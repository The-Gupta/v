We describe a patient with refractory anemia with excess blasts with unusual rheumatic manifestations of vasculitis, migratory synovitis, arthralgias, and myalgias. A retrospective review over a 6-month period of 162 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes found 16 patients (10%) with several rheumatic manifestations. We divided these manifestations into 4 different categories: cutaneous vasculitis, ""lupus-like syndrome,"" neuropathy, and patients with both a rheumatic disease and a myelodysplastic syndrome. There were 7 with cutaneous vasculitis including leukocytoclastic vasculitis and other individual cases of urticarial vasculitis and panniculitis; 3 with lupus-like manifestations with histological evidence of an inflammatory process; 3 with neuropathic manifestations including peripheral neuropathy, mononeuritis with foot drop, and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy; and 3 patients in which their myelodysplastic syndrome was diagnosed after their rheumatic disease was known, including rheumatoid arthritis. Sjogren's syndrome and mixed connective tissue disease. The class with refractory anemia with excess blasts had 9 patients with rheumatic manifestations but also had the largest number of patients in the study (46/162 or 29%). Three of the 16 patients died, all from the refractory anemia with excess blasts class, reflecting the known mortality in this group of patients.

The Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat (MoMLV LTR) and the SV40 early region promoters, while functional in transfected plasmacytoma cell lines, did not give rise to detectable CAT activity following transfection into primary activated mouse or human B lymphocytes. In contrast, the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early (HCMV-IE) enhancer/promoter functioned in both established and primary B cells. The highest expression levels in the primary cells were obtained with vectors containing the Adenovirus 2 major late promoter or the HCMV-IE enhancer/promoter in combination with the Adenovirus 2 tripartite leader and VA genes. These latter expression cassettes were placed in a retroviral vector with the aim of combining their capacity for high-level gene expression with the efficient stable gene transfer afforded by retroviral infection. Several retroviral constructs were made, some of which were able to generate high virus titers. However all of these underwent deletions during the process of retroviral infection, as judged by Southern analysis of infected cells, indicating that they were not optimal gene transfer vectors. The HCMV enhancer/promoter, which was the most active of the other expression cassettes tested in the primary B cells, was inserted into a retroviral vector which also expressed the hph gene under the transcriptional control of the retroviral LTR. This vector did not undergo rearrangement during the process of retroviral infection, as judged by Southern analysis. The CAT gene was inserted downstream of the HCMV promoter in this vector, and a high-titer retroviral stock was generated. Primary B lymphocytes infected with this vector gave high levels of CAT activity, under conditions in which parallel experiments with the hph drug resistance marker showed that one in 20 of the cells were infected. These experiments demonstrate efficient gene transfer and expression in primary B lymphocytes in vitro.","['Overell, R W', 'Weisser, K E', 'Hess, B W', 'Ziegler, S F', 'Pleiman, C M', 'Maliszewski, C', 'Grabstein, K H']","['Overell RW', 'Weisser KE', 'Hess BW', 'Ziegler SF', 'Pleiman CM', 'Maliszewski C', 'Grabstein KH']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Immunex Corporation, Seattle, WA 98101.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,IM,,"['Animals', '*B-Lymphocytes', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics', '*Gene Expression', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Plasmids', 'Retroviridae/genetics', '*Transfection']",,1991/07/26 00:00,1991/07/26 00:01,['1991/07/26 00:00'],"['1991/07/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/26 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 1991 Jul 26;141(1):53-62. doi: 10.1016/0022-1759(91)90209-x.,['EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)'],,"['0022-1759(91)90209-X [pii]', '10.1016/0022-1759(91)90209-x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The mean (SD) value of the total alpha:beta ratio was 0.82 (0.45) ranging from 0.05 to 1.73. The same ratio in 10 normal controls was 1.01 (0.04). This difference was significant. Furthermore, the alpha:beta ratios were lower than normal in 14 patients (alpha-thalassaemia-like) (group I), almost within normal limits in 11 (group II), and higher than normal in five (beta-thalassaemia-like) (group III). In each group almost all the FAB subtypes were represented. The addition of exogenous haem in several of the test samples resulted in a slight to pronounced increase in the alpha:beta ratios, particularly in group I. In 92% of the high risk cases (refractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB), chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML] or 87.5% of patients who finally developed acute non-lyphoid leukaemia (ANLL) low or normal alpha:beta ratios were found. No significant correlation was noticed between alpha:beta ratios and various haematological variables or survival. It is concluded that in MDS the alpha:beta ratio varied enormously across the entire population of patients, as well as within each FAB subtype, thereby restricting its prognostic value.

The present work has examined EGR gene expression during differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells along the monocytic lineage and in activated monocytes. Low levels of EGR-1 transcripts were detectable in untreated U-937 and HL-60 leukemia cells. In contrast, treatment of these cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) was associated with increases (within 1 h) in EGR-1 mRNA levels. The induction of monocytic differentiation by TPA and other agents was further associated with increases in EGR-2, but not EGR-3 or EGR-4, mRNA levels in these cells. Treatment of resting peripheral blood monocytes with the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) was also associated with rapid (within 15 min) increases in expression of the EGR-1 and EGR-2 genes. The results of nuclear run-on assays demonstrate that EGR-1 mRNA levels are increased in part by transcriptional activation of this gene in M-CSF-stimulated monocytes. The results also demonstrate that both EGR-1 and EGR-2 mRNA levels are regulated at the posttranscriptional level by a labile protein that destabilizes these transcripts. Finally, we demonstrate that dexamethasone, an inhibitor of monocytic differentiation, blocks the associated increases in EGR-1 and EGR-2 expression. Taken together, the results indicate that the EGR-1 and EGR-2 early response genes are involved in the induction of myeloid leukemia cell differentiation along the monocytic lineage and in the activation of human monocytes.","['Kharbanda, S', 'Nakamura, T', 'Stone, R', 'Hass, R', 'Bernstein, S', 'Datta, R', 'Sukhatme, V P', 'Kufe, D']","['Kharbanda S', 'Nakamura T', 'Stone R', 'Hass R', 'Bernstein S', 'Datta R', 'Sukhatme VP', 'Kufe D']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Monocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc Fingers/*genetics']",,1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1991 Aug;88(2):571-7. doi: 10.1172/JCI115341.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']","['EGR-1', 'EGR-2']",['10.1172/JCI115341 [doi]'],PMC295388,"['CA-34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

This reduces substantially the occurrence of graft versus host disease (GvHD) after transplantation without loss of the repopulation capacity. A limitation of the traditional Beckman elutriator rotor is the relatively small size of the elutriation chamber, which makes five to six runs, of one hour each, necessary to process the whole bone marrow graft. We developed a new elutriator rotor, containing four disposable elutriator chamber (Dijkstra BV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), which allows to complete the lymphocyte elimination from the bone marrow graft within 2 hours. Ninety-nine consecutive patients were transplanted with elutriated MLC-negative bone marrow grafts from histocompatible siblings. Indications for transplantation were: AML (n = 32), ALL (n = 34) and CML (n = 33). The grafts contained after counterflow centrifugation a mean of 12.1 (+/- 2.4)% of the nucleated cells, 1.9 (+/- 1.4)% of the T-lymphocytes, and 93.5 (+/- 59.4)% of the CFU-GM, originally present in the collected bone marrow.

The probability of acute GvHD greater than grade 1 at day 100 after BMT was 16%. The projected 3-year estimate of extensive chronic GvHD was 13%. The low incidence of GvHD was associated with a relatively low transplant related mortality in patients above the age of 40 years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Haanen, C', 'De Witte, T', 'Plas, A', 'Schattemberg, T']","['Haanen C', 'De Witte T', 'Plas A', 'Schattemberg T']","['Division of Hematology, University Hospital, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods/mortality', 'Cell Separation/*methods', 'Centrifugation/*methods', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/mortality/*surgery', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/epidemiology', 'Survival Rate']",,1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 1991 Mar;76 Suppl 1:22-8.,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously studied the different forms of alpha-L-fucosidase in human serum, kidney and urine. Some modifications of the glycanic fraction of glycoproteins have been described in various forms of tumoral cells; therefore, we have attempted to verify if the alpha-L-fucosidase of blood cells might be a useful marker in the diagnosis of leukemias, using the enzymic pattern obtained by chromatographic or electrofocusing methods. Detergent extracts from normal lymphocytes, submitted to ion-exchange chromatography as well as to chromatofocusing, revealed the presence of two forms of alpha-L-fucosidase, A and B, with respective pIs of 5.7 and 6.2. After treatment by neuraminidase, these two forms remain distinct, showing that the degrees of sialylation is not the only difference. Moreover, after desialylation, the two forms have not the same affinity for concanavalin A, an argument for the heterogeneity of the glycanic structures. The determination of the total activity, and of enzymic patterns of alpha-L-fucosidase from leukemic cells led to the observation of three types of modifications, in comparison with normal lymphocytes: quantitative variations in the total activity; variations in the proportions of the two forms; variations due to the modification of pIs. We have studied the lymphocytes from four patients with a hairy-cell leukemia (HCL), four patients with chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) and the MO cell-line, proceeding from a HCL. In all cases, the total fucosidase activity is strongly decreased in comparison with normal lymphocytes activity. The chromatofocusing pattern for CLL cells reveals the presence of the A and B forms, without modification of their eluting pH. A characteristic pattern is obtained with hairy cells, presenting only the B form, eluted in more acidic conditions. The normal lymphocytes in peripheral blood are for 80 per cent of the T phenotype, and the CLL lymphocytes exhibit the phenotypic markers B, as well as the hairy cells, but the MO cell-line acquires in culture the T markers. As these last cells express both the A and B forms of enzyme, the absence of the A form of alpha-L-fucosidase seems to be a marker of the HCL.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Percheron, F', 'Bernard, M', 'Foglietti, M J']","['Percheron F', 'Bernard M', 'Foglietti MJ']","['Laboratoire de Biochimie generale et metabolique, Faculte des sciences pharmaceutiques et biologiques, Universite Rene Descartes, Paris.']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Bull Acad Natl Med,Bulletin de l'Academie nationale de medecine,7503383,IM,,"['Biomarkers/chemistry', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Chromatography', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*blood/diagnosis/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/diagnosis/enzymology', 'Lymphocytes/*chemistry', 'alpha-L-Fucosidase/*chemistry']",,1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bull Acad Natl Med. 1991 Feb;175(2):205-14; discussion 215.,"['0 (Biomarkers)', 'EC 3.2.1.51 (alpha-L-Fucosidase)']",,,,,L'alpha-L-fucosidase de cellules sanguines normales et pathologiques.,,,,,,,,,

Differences in the relative proportions of the kinases, which may be significant in relation to differentiation, were seen in all the fractions on hexamethylenebisacetamide treatment of the cells.","['Sprott, S C', 'Hammond, K D', 'Savage, N']","['Sprott SC', 'Hammond KD', 'Savage N']","['Department of Medical Biochemistry, University of the Witwatersrand Medical School, Parktown, Johannesburg, South Africa.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Anal Biochem,Analytical biochemistry,0370535,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Fractionation/*methods', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anal Biochem. 1991 May 1;194(2):407-12. doi: 10.1016/0003-2697(91)90249-s.,['EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)'],,"['0003-2697(91)90249-S [pii]', '10.1016/0003-2697(91)90249-s [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Sixteen cases were of B-cell type (IBLC-B) and 18 cases were of T-cell type (IBLC-T). There were no significant differences in the morphologic characteristics of the neoplastic cells in the two types, although IBLC-B was less likely to be polymorphic than IBLC-T. Interfollicular proliferation, a higher mitotic rate, infiltration by eosinophils, and an increase in capillary-sized blood vessels were also features of IBLC-T, whereas necrosis and fibrosis were more extensive in IBLC-B. Patients with IBLC-B were predominantly female, whereas those with IBLC-T were predominantly male. The mean age was 62 years for those with IBLC-B and 46 years for those with IBLC-T. Patients with IBLC-B usually had lower-stage disease, but there was no significant difference in survival rate between those with IBLC-B and those with IBLC-T. Although most cases of IBLC have been considered to be of peripheral T-cell origin, the authors conclude that IBLC-B is more common than previously considered and that clear-cell morphologic characteristics are not a reliable indicator of T-cell type.","['Nakamine, H', 'Masih, A S', 'Strobach, R S', 'Duggan, M J', 'Bast, M A', 'Armitage, J O', 'Weisenburger, D D']","['Nakamine H', 'Masih AS', 'Strobach RS', 'Duggan MJ', 'Bast MA', 'Armitage JO', 'Weisenburger DD']","['Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha 68198-3135.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,IM,,"['Cytoplasm/*ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*pathology', 'Male', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Survival Analysis']",,1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1991 Aug;96(2):177-83. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/96.2.177.,,,['10.1093/ajcp/96.2.177 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In six of the eight cases, basophilic involvement was not apparent by light microscopic examination. The cases were identified on the basis of ultrastructural evidence for basophil/mast cell differentiation of the blasts with little or no differentiation into other lineages. Ultrastructural analysis revealed immature basophil granules in blasts in all eight cases and theta granules in blasts in four cases. In three cases, ultrastructural evidence of mast cell differentiation also was present, with rare cells showing evidence for both basophil and mast cell differentiation. No clinical features distinguished this group of patients from others with acute myeloid leukemia. Cytogenetically, the cases were heterogeneous. Three had a Philadelphia chromosome; none had a t(6;9). The authors conclude that ultrastructural analysis usually must be used to diagnose acute basophilic leukemia, that acute basophilic leukemia is associated frequently with the Philadelphia chromosome, and that the ultrastructural findings provide evidence for a common origin of basophils and mast cells.","['Peterson, L C', 'Parkin, J L', 'Arthur, D C', 'Brunning, R D']","['Peterson LC', 'Parkin JL', 'Arthur DC', 'Brunning RD']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Hennepin County Medical Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55415.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,IM,"['Am J Clin Pathol. 1992 Jun;97(6):895-6.

On day 26 after infection, the spleen weighed a maximum of 2.0 g (about 30 times the control weight). Assay of multipotent stem cells in vitro showed that the more enlarged spleens contained an increased number and concentration of mixed colony-forming units (CFU-mix) (at maximum, 11 times higher than the control). When the supernatant of cultured spleen cells was added to a serum-free bone marrow cell culture with or without erythropoietin (Epo) for detection of burst-promoting activity (BPA), it enhanced erythroid mixed colony (E-mix) formation only in the presence of Epo (p less than 0.05). Even when addition of Epo was delayed, it still induced a significant number of E-mix (p less than 0.05). These findings rule out a mimic effect of Epo resembling BPA and indicate the presence of BPA in the spleen. The culture supernatant also supported the proliferation of interleukin 3 (IL-3)-dependent 32Dcl cells. Therefore, although purification of the BPA substance has not yet been accomplished, BPA in the supernatant seems to depend on the presence of IL-3, which is known to be one of the factors stimulating multipotent hemopoietic stem cells. The presence of BPA- or CFU-mix-stimulating activity in the spleen after infection might be responsible for the development of panmyelosis, which is a characteristic of MPSV-induced myeloproliferative syndrome.","['Matsuo, K', 'Oda, H', 'Fukushima, T', 'Matsuoka, J', 'Hashimoto, N', 'Tadokoro, K', 'Kohama, H', 'Sato, M', 'Jasmin, C', 'Urano, Y']","['Matsuo K', 'Oda H', 'Fukushima T', 'Matsuoka J', 'Hashimoto N', 'Tadokoro K', 'Kohama H', 'Sato M', 'Jasmin C', 'Urano Y', 'et al.']","['Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Acta Pathol Jpn,Acta pathologica japonica,0372637,IM,,"['Animals', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/metabolism/microbiology/pathology', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Genetic Variation', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/microbiology/*pathology', 'Interleukin-3/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine sarcoma virus/genetics/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/metabolism/microbiology/*pathology', 'Splenic Neoplasms/metabolism/microbiology/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism/microbiology/pathology']",,1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Pathol Jpn. 1991 Apr;41(4):259-64. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1827.1991.tb03353.x.,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",,['10.1111/j.1440-1827.1991.tb03353.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Membrane perturbation results in the release of prostaglandins (PG) and leukotrienes (LT). These compounds are potent biological mediators and may modify the tumor microenvironment and therapeutic efficacy. Membrane composition and PG/LT release are influenced by the dietary fatty acids. The relationship between these variables and response to hyperthermia was examined in vitro using murine P388 leukemia cells grown as an ascites in mice provided either saturated fatty acid diet (SFA; 16% beef tallow) or unsaturated fatty acid diet (UFA; 16% safflower oil). Cells were harvested and exposed in vitro to either 37 degrees C or 43.5 degrees C for periods up to 2 hours. Hyperthermic exposure for 2 hours resulted in 40% cell lethality in SFA cells and 55% in UFA cells. The phospholipid and total cholesterol content was higher (33% and 50% respectively) in the UFA versus the SFA cells. Hyperthermia produced a six-fold increase in prostaglandin E2 PGE2 release by SFA cells and a 4.5-fold increase by UFA cells. No LTC4 was detected. Alteration of dietary fat affects cell lethality and PG release following hyperthermic treatment. The increase in phospholipid and cholesterol content of UFA cells may be a response to reduced membrane fluidity.,"['Wainberg, R H', 'Walden, T L Jr', 'Stebler, B A', 'Yatvin, M B']","['Wainberg RH', 'Walden TL Jr', 'Stebler BA', 'Yatvin MB']","['Biology Department, Piedmont College, Demorest, GA 30531.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Prostaglandins,Prostaglandins,0320271,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', '*Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cholesterol/analysis', 'Dietary Fats/*pharmacology', 'Dinoprostone/*metabolism', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/*pharmacology', 'Female', '*Hot Temperature', 'Leukemia P388/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Phospholipids/analysis']",,1991/05/11 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1991/05/11 19:15'],"['1991/05/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1991/05/11 19:15 [entrez]']",ppublish,Prostaglandins. 1991 May;41(5):501-13. doi: 10.1016/0090-6980(91)90056-l.,"['0 (Dietary Fats)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",,"['0090-6980(91)90056-L [pii]', '10.1016/0090-6980(91)90056-l [doi]']",,['R01-CA24872/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

The results showed that an activin homologue is, indeed, contained in unfertilized eggs and blastulae of Xenopus laevis in a considerable amount. This activity was eluted at the same retention time as human activin A when fractionated by reversed-phase HPLC. Furthermore, the fraction containing erythroid-differentiating factor activity had mesoderm-inducing activity on Xenopus animal-cap cells.

More recent reports have suggested that v-abl can, however, cause a disease similar to CML. We demonstrate here that v-abl, when transduced in a helper virus-containing system, causes disease similar to, but distinct from, the CML-like syndrome induced by bcr-abl. Animals whose bone marrow has been infected by v-abl virus develop modest splenomegaly, marked granulocytosis, and malignant disease of several hematopoietic cell types. Unlike animals with CML-like disease resulting from bcr-abl, the polymorphonuclear leukocytes from animals infected with a v-abl construct do not contain the v-abl provirus at a significant frequency.

The stimulatory potency of DNP-amino acids was dependent on the structure of amino acid attached to DNP. Generally, DNP-amino acids with high affinities to the sensitizing IgE (I(50) less than 10 microM) were stimulatory in polystyrene-bound form; DNP-amino acids with lower affinities (Pro, Cys, Trp), and aliphatic aromatic DNP-amino acid derivatives were inactive. In addition to structural analogues of DNP, lymecycline, that is chemically unrelated to DNP but was found to have high affinity to IgE(aDNP), was also stimulatory in this system. This drug, and various quinones (e.g. acenaphthene-quinone) in BSA-conjugated forms also stimulated serotonin release from RBL cells sensitized with IgE(aDNP). These studies suggest that (1) There is a threshold of intrinsic ligand binding affinities at approximately I(50) = 10-100 microM; ligands with lower affinities do not stimulate mediator release even if they are presented in multivalent forms; (2) The above affinity threshold for mediator cell stimulation is valid for various ligands, irrespective of their chemical similarity to the immunogen; (3) Multispecific stimulation of mediator release may contribute to the frequently observed allergic cross-reactions, false positive tests for allergies, and anaphylactic reactions to drugs upon first exposure.","['Varga, J M', 'Kalchschmid, G', 'Klein, G F', 'Fritsch, P']","['Varga JM', 'Kalchschmid G', 'Klein GF', 'Fritsch P']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,IM,,"['Acenaphthenes/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Anthraquinones/pharmacology', 'Cross Reactions/immunology', 'Dinitrophenols/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Drug Hypersensitivity/*immunology', 'Erythrocytes/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin E/*immunology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*immunology', 'Lymecycline/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Serotonin/metabolism', 'Vitamin K/pharmacology']",,1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 1991 Jun;28(6):655-9. doi: 10.1016/0161-5890(91)90134-6.,"['0 (Acenaphthenes)', '0 (Anthraquinones)', '0 (Dinitrophenols)', '12001-79-5 (Vitamin K)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '3950D6UEIQ (acenaphthenequinone)', '7D6EM3S13P (Lymecycline)']",,['10.1016/0161-5890(91)90134-6 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that HL-60 cells synthesized 5-10 times more proteoglycans than peripheral blood leukocytes. Differentiation of HL-60 cells toward mature monocytes by treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or towards granulocytes by treatment with retinoic acid or dibutyryl cyclic adenosine-3',5'-monophosphate (dbcAMP) resulted in a small (20-30%) decrease in sulfated proteoglycan biosynthesis. Chondroitin sulfate was found to be the predominant proteoglycan produced by monocytes, PMN and undifferentiated HL-60 cells. Differentiated HL-60 cells produced chondroitin sulfate as well as sulfated proteoglycans sensitive to nitrous acid degradation. Similar results were observed in TPA, dbcAMP and retinoic acid differentiated HL-60 cells indicating that the changes in proteoglycan biosynthesis observed were independent of the developmental pathway. Using specific monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry, we also found that HL-60 cells and monocytes produced chondroitin-4-sulfate, chondroitin-6-sulfate and chondroitin-O-sulfate while PMN only produced chondroitin-4-sulfate. In addition, although there were no significant differences in antibody binding to undifferentiated and differentiated HL-60 cells, the tumor cells bound 5-20 times more of the antibodies than the peripheral blood leukocytes. Our data demonstrate that sulfated proteoglycan production by HL-60 cells is distinct from PMN and monocytes. In addition, the fact that differentiated HL-60 cells continue to synthesize larger amounts of the proteoglycans than the peripheral blood leukocytes indicates these cells have not completely matured.","['Laskin, J D', 'Dokidis, A', 'Sirak, A A', 'Laskin, D L']","['Laskin JD', 'Dokidis A', 'Sirak AA', 'Laskin DL']","['Department of Environmental and Community Medicine, UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers University, Piscataway 08854.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,,"['Cell Line, Transformed', 'Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycans/*biosynthesis/blood', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocytes/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'Sulfur Radioisotopes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1991;15(6):515-23. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(91)90063-y.,"['0 (Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycans)', '0 (Sulfur Radioisotopes)']",,['10.1016/0145-2126(91)90063-y [doi]'],,"['AI 20183/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'ES 03647/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 34310/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

In these 10 long-term survivors, bone marrow was serially cultured in semi-solid agar during the unmaintained remission for a median period of 40 (range 12-72) months. In another group of 18 patients bone marrow was cultured after cessation of remission maintenance chemotherapy at intervals of 29-43 (median 33) days until relapse, at most up to 16 months, when all patients relapsed. In both groups of patients a periodic return to a leukemic growth pattern in their marrow cultures was observed. The difference in the frequency of leukemic growth patterns between both groups is not significant, while the patients, who remained in prolonged remission, had a significantly higher mean number of colonies. It is suggested that monitoring the remission with the help of bone marrow cultures is useless in predicting an approaching relapse of ANLL.

In three of the four patients who underwent conventional chemotherapy, the sequential treatment with retinol palmitate resulted in a complete remission: controlling residual bone marrow leukemic cells.

The factor is rapidly released to the circulation as 50 and 55 kD species which share the immunological determinants.

Induction of differentiation in the human HL-60 leukemia cell line by 13-cis-retinoic acid caused a down regulation of OFP synthesis, both intra- and extra-cellular levels dropping to essentially zero. Induction of differentiation with dibutyryl cyclic AMP caused a cessation of secretion of OFP, with a marked increase in its intracellular concentration, a condition resembling the retention in fetal cells.

Of these, 321 were considered for the study: 231 had been splenectomized, 46 of them receiving subsequently IFN and 90 patients had IFN as initial therapy. Patients treated with splenectomy showed different survival according to Jansen and Hermans' staging system, which identified two risk groups: stage 1 and stages 2 and 3, p = 0.0329. On the contrary, patients treated with IFN did not show significantly different survival according to stage. By the comparison of stage 1 patients, either treated with splenectomy or with IFN, no statistical difference in survival was registered. Different survivals emerged for patients stage 2 + 3, which improved when treated with IFN, p = 0.0324. The median failure free survival (FFS) after splenectomy resulted in 89 months versus 33 months after IFN. In conclusion, splenectomy still remains the primary therapy for HCL patients stage 1. For high risk patients, stages 2 and 3, IFN should be adopted as first line therapy, improving substantially the survival. The short duration of response to IFN suggests a sequential combination of the two treatments for this group of patients, IFN reducing tumor mass quite safely and splenectomy assuring long lasting stable disease.","['Capnist, G', 'Federico, M', 'Chisesi, T', 'Resegotti, L', 'Pagnucco, G', 'Castoldi, G L', 'Lamparelli, T', 'Frassoldati, A', 'Guarnaccia, C', 'Leoni, P']","['Capnist G', 'Federico M', 'Chisesi T', 'Resegotti L', 'Pagnucco G', 'Castoldi GL', 'Lamparelli T', 'Frassoldati A', 'Guarnaccia C', 'Leoni P', 'et al.']","['Department of Haematology, S.

Cells treated with GM-CSF or VD3 alone showed only minor changes. These results demonstrate a potent synergistic effect of GM-CSF and VD3 on induction of U937 differentiation. This differentiation was partially blocked by H7, a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor. Changes in c-myc and c-fos mRNA expressions and a shift in cell cycle were shown to be early events in this process.","['Kim, Y R', 'Abraham, N G', 'Lutton, J D']","['Kim YR', 'Abraham NG', 'Lutton JD']","['Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, New York Medical College, Valhalla 10595.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/physiology', 'Antigens, Surface/physiology', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/physiology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/physiology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Up-Regulation/physiology']",,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1991;15(6):409-18. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(91)90050-4.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']","['c-fos', 'c-myc']",['10.1016/0145-2126(91)90050-4 [doi]'],,['AM29742/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Marked interindividual differences in maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) were observed when children received the 50 mg/m2 dose. This variability decreased when the doses were increased. Six of the eight children showed a disproportionate increase in the AUC with increasing doses; the other two had a proportionate relationship between the AUC and dose. Overall mean (+/- SD) Cmax and AUC values increased disproportionately (88 +/- 123, to 326 +/- 194, to 653 +/- 344 ng/ml for Cmax, and 147 +/- 180, to 451 +/- 177, to 1291 +/- 415 ng/ml per hour for AUC, respectively) when the dose increased from 50 to 87.5 mg/m2 and then to 175 mg/m2. The results suggest that a saturable first-pass metabolism of oral 6-MP occurs with increasing oral doses in some, but not all, children.

Purification, characterization, and analysis of function of an enzyme with sulfatase activity.",950-8,"An enzyme with sulfatase activity has been isolated from the granules of a rat NK leukemia cell line, CRNK-16. The enzyme has been purified from crude preparation, with a specific activity of 52 nmol/min/mg of protein, by DEAE ion exchange and Con A-Sepharose affinity chromatography, resulting in a specific activity of 230 nmol/min/mg of protein. The molecular mass of the purified enzyme was estimated to be 40 kDa by gel filtration chromatography at pH 7.4, but the enzyme had the ability to complex to molecular masses of greater than 300 kDa at low pH when crude granule extract was used as the starting sample, suggesting that it associates with other granule components. The enzyme was determined to be an arylsulfatase by its ability to (a) hydrolyze p-nitrophenyl sulfate (Km = 26.0 mM) and p-nitrocatechol sulfate (pNC sulfate) (Km = 1.1 mM) and (b) be inhibited by sulfite (Ki = 6.0 x 10(-7) M), sulfate (Ki = 1 x 10(-3) M), and phosphate (Ki = 4 x 10(-5) M) in a competitive manner. The pH optimum for enzymatic activity was determined to be 5.6. The role of this enzyme in cytolytic function was investigated by examining the effect of its substrates and inhibitors on granule- and cell-mediated lysis. pNC sulfate was shown to cause a dose-dependent inhibition of target cell lysis by isolated cytolytic granules (complete inhibition at 12.5 mM). Sulfite induced an incomplete inhibition (50% at 1 mM), whereas phosphate was essentially without inhibitory effect. Sulfate, on the other hand, altered lytic activity in a biphasic manner, inasmuch as it induced an inhibition of lysis at high concentrations and an increase of lysis at low concentrations. Cell-mediated lysis was inhibited by pNC sulfate in a dose-dependent fashion at concentrations greater than 2.5 mM, with nearly complete inhibition at 50 mM. Sulfate also altered the lytic activity by intact cells in a biphasic manner, although the effect was much less pronounced. Sulfite and phosphate caused only a 30% inhibition of lytic activity. These results suggest that the sulfatase enzyme is involved in NK cytolytic function, presumably at the lethal hit stage.","['Amoscato, A A', 'Brumfield, A M', 'Sansoni, S B', 'Herberman, R B', 'Chambers, W H']","['Amoscato AA', 'Brumfield AM', 'Sansoni SB', 'Herberman RB', 'Chambers WH']","['Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15213.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,,"['Animals', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/*enzymology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology', 'Nitrobenzenes/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Sulfatases/analysis/*isolation & purification', 'Temperature', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1991 Aug 1;147(3):950-8.,"['0 (Nitrobenzenes)', '1080-04-2 (4-nitrophenyl sulfate)', 'EC 3.1.6.- (Sulfatases)']",,,,['AI26364/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

P48 induces differentiation and cytolytic activity in the promyelocytic cell line HL-60, and stimulates the release of TNF-alpha and IL-1 from peripheral blood monocytes. In further studies designed to examine the biosynthesis and function of P48, surface immunofluorescence flow cytometry analysis as well as 125I surface labeling and immunoprecipitation, revealed the presence of P48 on the surface of Reh cells. Triton X-114-treated Reh cells were partitioned into detergent and aqueous phases and separated by SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis revealed that P48 partitioned exclusively into the detergent phase, suggesting an integral membrane association. Reh cells fixed with paraformaldehyde, but not K562 or P815, were able to stimulate the release of TNF-alpha from peripheral blood monocytes in a manner similar to that of secreted P48. Isolated plasma membranes from Reh cells could also stimulate TNF-alpha release. This TNF-alpha-releasing activity could be removed from detergent solubilized Reh membranes by immunoaffinity chromatography on an anti-P48 column. This study suggests that, in addition to being secreted into the culture medium, P48 is expressed on the surface of Reh cells in a biologically active form. The membrane form of P48 may be 1) a final maturation step before secretion or 2) a cell membrane-associated form that may be analogous to the membrane forms of TNF-alpha and IL-1.","['Kostyal, D A', 'Beezhold, D H', 'Hall, R E']","['Kostyal DA', 'Beezhold DH', 'Hall RE']","['Laboratory of Tumor Immunology, Donald Guthrie Foundation for Medical Research, Sayre, PA 18840.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/biosynthesis', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",,1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1991 Aug 1;147(3):893-8.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",,,,['CA 37026/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

These include the growth factors that bind to membrane receptors and steroid hormones or vitamins that have intracellular receptors. We report the effects in culture of the steroid glucocorticoid hydrocortisone on freshly explanted AML blasts from patients and on two continuous AML cell lines. Only small changes in clonogenic cell numbers in suspension cultures were seen in the presence of hydrocortisone. The most striking effect of the hormone was on the sensitivity of blasts cells to cytosine arabinoside (ara-C). In contrast to the response of AML blast cells to retinoic acid, a ligand for intracellular steroid receptors that sensitizes some blast populations to ara-C, hydrocortisone reduced the toxic effects of the drug. The protective action of hydrocortisone was not mediated through the cell cycle since exposure of blasts to hydrocortisone did not affect the percentage of cells in DNA synthesis as measured with the tritiated thymidine (3HTdR) ""suicide"" technique. The hydrocortisone effect could be demonstrated using a pulse (20 min) exposure protocol. Blasts pulsed with increasing specific activities of 3HTdR showed the usual response pattern with an initial loss in plating efficiency to about 50% of control, followed by a plateau, regardless of whether the cells had been exposed to hydrocortisone. Control blasts exposed to increasing ara-C concentrations gave very similar dose-response curves; in striking contrast, blast cells cultured in hydrocortisone, then pulsed with ara-C did not lose colony-forming ability even though the same population was sensitive to 3HTdR. The hydrocortisone effect was dose and time related; protection from ara-C increased from 10(-8) to 10(-5) M and was seen after 4 hr exposure but required 8 hr to reach a maximum. We conclude that hydrocortisone can protect blasts from the lethal effects of ara-C even while the cells are in active DNA synthesis.","['Yang, G S', 'Wang, C', 'Minkin, S', 'Minden, M D', 'McCulloch, E A']","['Yang GS', 'Wang C', 'Minkin S', 'Minden MD', 'McCulloch EA']","['Ontario Cancer Institute, University of Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,,"['Blast Crisis/*pathology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/metabolism/*toxicity', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology']",,1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1991 Jul;148(1):60-7. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041480108.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",,['10.1002/jcp.1041480108 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We have begun to characterize the human gene in order to elucidate the genetic elements responsible for this highly regulated expression. We first cloned a human MARCKS cDNA, which encoded a predicted protein of 332 amino acids (Mr 31,600) that was approximately 89, 74, and 59% identical to the bovine, mouse, and chicken proteins, respectively. Regions conserved at the amino acid level included the amino-terminal myristoylation consensus sequence, the site of intron splicing, and the phosphorylation site domain. The human cDNA was used to demonstrate that tumor necrosis factor-alpha could rapidly stimulate MARCKS gene transcription in the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60. Genomic clones were then isolated; sequence analysis identified a putative promoter region that had no TATA box and contained multiple transcription initiation sites in a region spanning 57 base pairs (bp). This was followed by a 5'-untranslated region of approximately 400 bp, which displayed a complex predicted secondary structure with a delta G of -73.4 kcal/mol. Plasmid constructions containing between 52 and 1453 bp of the human MARCKS promoter linked to the human growth hormone gene were then used in transient expression experiments. Constructions containing 52 and 110 bp of the MARCKS promoter did not exhibit promoter function while the larger constructions all exhibited promotor function; the 248-bp fragment of the MARCKS promoter was 80% as effective as the human ferritin promoter in stimulating expression of human growth hormone in intact cells. Using an insert from the human genomic clone as a probe, we identified human chromosome 6, q21-qter, as the location of the MARCKS gene; this has been assigned the gene symbol MACS.","['Harlan, D M', 'Graff, J M', 'Stumpo, D J', 'Eddy, R L Jr', 'Shows, T B', 'Boyle, J M', 'Blackshear, P J']","['Harlan DM', 'Graff JM', 'Stumpo DJ', 'Eddy RL Jr', 'Shows TB', 'Boyle JM', 'Blackshear PJ']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute Laboratories, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cattle', 'Chickens', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', 'DNA/genetics', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', '*Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myristoylated Alanine-Rich C Kinase Substrate', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Plasmids', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",,1991/08/15 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1991/08/15 19:15'],"['1991/08/15 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1991/08/15 19:15 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1991 Aug 5;266(22):14399-405.,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (MARCKS protein, human)', '0 (Marcks protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '125267-21-2 (Myristoylated Alanine-Rich C Kinase Substrate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",['MACS'],['S0021-9258(18)98698-9 [pii]'],,"['GM20454/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HD05196/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,"['GENBANK/M63255', 'GENBANK/M63834', 'GENBANK/M63835', 'GENBANK/M63926', 'GENBANK/M63977', 'GENBANK/M63978', 'GENBANK/M65153', 'GENBANK/M65154', 'GENBANK/M68955', 'GENBANK/M68956']",,,,,,,

The cells from the CLL were typical mature B lymphocytes as could be assessed by morphologic, cytochemical, and surface marker analyses. The cells from the lymphoblastic lymphoma were immature B cells that expressed CD10, CD20, and HLA-DR markers, but not surface Ig or cytoplasmic mu chains, and were negative for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). The cells of two continuous cell lines, obtained from the bone marrow and the peripheral blood of the patient, had the same phenotype as the lymphoblastic lymphoma cells, did not contain the Epstein-Barr virus genome, and displayed malignant features in vitro, including the capacity to form colonies in agar. The two cell lines also shared identical chromosomal abnormalities, a finding which suggests that they derived from the same malignant cell already present in vivo. Such chromosomal abnormalities were not seen in the karyotype of the peripheral blood cells at the onset of the disease. Analysis of the Ig heavy chain genes using a DJ-specific probe showed the very same monoclonal rearrangement in the cells from the B-CLL, the lymphoblastic lymphoma and the two cell lines, thus demonstrating their common clonal origin. By contrast, a monoclonal rearrangement of the lambda chain gene locus was found in the B-CLL cells only, a finding consistent with their exclusive capacity to express surface IgM lambda. This patient represents a rare case in whom a chronic lymphoproliferative disorder with mature malignant cells transforms into a lymphoblastic lymphoma characterized by cells frozen at a very early maturational stage. The possible mechanisms leading to such transformation within the same cell clone are discussed.","['Pistoia, V', 'Roncella, S', 'Di Celle, P F', 'Sessarego, M', 'Cutrona, G', 'Cerruti, G', 'Boccaccio, G P', 'Grossi, C E', 'Foa, R', 'Ferrarini, M']","['Pistoia V', 'Roncella S', 'Di Celle PF', 'Sessarego M', 'Cutrona G', 'Cerruti G', 'Boccaccio GP', 'Grossi CE', 'Foa R', 'Ferrarini M']","['Servizio di Immunologia Clinica, Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro, Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/blood/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/blood/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/genetics/immunology/*pathology']",,1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1991 Aug 1;78(3):797-804.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",,['S0006-4971(20)85252-5 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, the clinical and hematologic characteristics according to the immunophenotype of blast cells were analyzed. Our results show that, although the granulocytic and/or monocytic lineages are those most commonly involved in these acute leukemias, other cell components, including the megakaryocytic and lymphoid, may be present (12% and 15% of the cases, respectively). Moreover, both morphologic and phenotypic studies show the frequent coexistence of two or three cell populations. Interestingly, in all cases the lymphoblastic component constantly displayed an early B phenotype (CD19+, CD10-, TdT+). Upon analyzing whether the type of MDS conditioned any differences in the immunophenotype of blast cells, we observed that, although the lymphoid lineage may be involved in all MDS subgroups, some differences emerge within the myeloid leukemic transformations. Thus, the refractory anemias with excess of blasts (RAEB) and RAEB in transformation displayed a significantly higher incidence of myeloblastic and megakaryoblastic transformations, while in the RA, RA with ring sideroblasts and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, the granulo-monocytic phenotype predominated. In addition, our results show that the clinical and hematologic characteristics of these patients may be partially related to the immunophenotype of the blast cells. Ig heavy chain gene rearrangements were found in two of 19 patients analyzed (11%), one with a hybrid leukemia (lymphoid-myeloid) and the other with a granulo-monocytic phenotype. Two other hybrid transformations analyzed were in germline configuration. Gamma and delta gene rearrangements were found in 21% and 37% of these acute transformation, respectively. The TCR-beta and M-bcr were in germline configuration in all 19 cases studied. In summary, immunophenotype and molecular studies point to a pluripotent stem cell with preferential myeloid commitment as the target cell of leukemias following a primary MDS.","['San Miguel, J F', 'Hernandez, J M', 'Gonzalez-Sarmiento, R', 'Gonzalez, M', 'Sanchez, I', 'Orfao, A', 'Canizo, M C', 'Lopez Borrasca, A']","['San Miguel JF', 'Hernandez JM', 'Gonzalez-Sarmiento R', 'Gonzalez M', 'Sanchez I', 'Orfao A', 'Canizo MC', 'Lopez Borrasca A']","['Hospital Clinico de Salamanca, Departamento de Medicina, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,['Blood. 1992 Aug 15;80(4):1097.

Neoplastic cells of the T- or B-phenotype from chronic as well as from acute leukemias proliferated in a dose-dependent manner.

Combinations of IL-7 with IL-2 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha showed an additive effect on [3H]TdR incorporation.

This chromosomal abnormality occurred in 6 of 252 (2.4%) children and adolescents with AML (6 of 28 infants, 22%; 6 of 18 M7 AML cases overall, 33%; and 6 of 6 M7 cases in infants). Infants with AML of M7 subtype and the t(1;22) often presented with prominent abdominal masses. Two of these infants were not treated and died early. Three of four treated infants entered complete remission with therapy for AML; the remaining infant died of hemorrhage on day 8. Of the three infants who entered remission, only one remains alive and disease free at 5+ months. The other two infants relapsed in the bone marrow at 5 and 2 months from the start of therapy, respectively. We conclude that M7 AML with the t(1;22) usually presents in infants with extensive infiltration of abdominal organs by leukemic cells and may confer a poor prognosis despite intensive AML-directed treatment.

Thus, the early detection of residual disease is highly desirable to monitor the efficacy of therapy, or to institute an alternative mode of therapy. Toward this aim, we have examined the applicability of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification in the detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) in bone marrow samples from patients with T-ALL in morphologic remission. Two different approaches were taken to identify leukemic clone-specific sequences that could be used as targets for PCR amplification. The first technique used T-cell receptor-delta (TCR-delta) gene rearrangements that were sequenced directly after PCR amplification of leukemic DNA. This method was successful in generating clone-specific probes for 76% of T-ALL patients screened. An alternative method was used to clone and sequence a TCR-beta chain gene from leukemic cells to generate a specific probe. The PCR assays that we used were specific for each patient's leukemic clone, and were capable of routinely detecting one leukemic cell in 10(4) normal cells. Using these sensitive PCR-based assays, we found no evidence for persistence of the leukemic clone in any of the bone marrow samples from four T-ALL patients who are in long-term (3.9 + to 8.1 + years) remission. In contrast, we detected residual disease in clinical remission samples from two patients who subsequently relapsed. In one patient, where we had appropriate samples, we observed a dramatic expansion of the leukemic clone 3 months before clinical relapse. These results suggest that PCR-based assays for detection of MRD in T-ALL patients have great potential in predicting impending relapse, and in determining the efficacy of the anti-leukemic therapy. These methods may also allow the identification of long-term survivors.","['Neale, G A', 'Menarguez, J', 'Kitchingman, G R', 'Fitzgerald, T J', 'Koehler, M', 'Mirro, J Jr', 'Goorha, R M']","['Neale GA', 'Menarguez J', 'Kitchingman GR', 'Fitzgerald TJ', 'Koehler M', 'Mirro J Jr', 'Goorha RM']","[""Department of Virology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/pathology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Prognosis']",,1991/08/11 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1991/08/11 19:15'],"['1991/08/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1991/08/11 19:15 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1991 Aug 1;78(3):739-47.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)']",,['S0006-4971(20)85244-6 [pii]'],,"['CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43237/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

However, its precise role in regulating B lymphopoiesis in bone marrow is not as well defined. We examined whether surface IgM- normal and leukemic human B-cell precursors (BCP) expressed IL-4 receptors using biotinylated IL-4. Constitutive expression of IL-4 receptors was detected on both normal and leukemic BCP. A higher percentage of normal BCP (82% +/- 15%) expressed IL-4 receptors compared with leukemic BCP (44% +/- 8%). Using mean fluorescent intensity as an indicator of receptor level on the IL-4 receptor positive cells, normal (91 +/- 41) and leukemic (44 +/- 37) BCP expressed comparable numbers of receptors. IL-4 induced the expression of CD23 on 30% of the leukemic BCP cases examined. IL-4 induced CD23 on surface IgM+ fetal bone marrow lymphoid cells but not on the surface IgM- normal BCP, despite the presence of detectable receptors on the surface IgM- cells. IL-4 did not stimulate proliferation of normal BCP, nor could it enhance the effect of recombinant IL-7 or low molecular weight B-cell growth factor. However, IL-4 increased the expression of surface IgM and surface Ig kappa on in vitro differentiated pre-B cells. Our collective results identify no role for IL-4 in the proliferation of normal or leukemic BCP, but identify a role in the enhancement of surface Ig expression during pre-B to B-cell differentiation.","['Law, C L', 'Armitage, R J', 'Villablanca, J G', 'LeBien, T W']","['Law CL', 'Armitage RJ', 'Villablanca JG', 'LeBien TW']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine/Pathology, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Replication', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-4', 'Receptors, Mitogen/*analysis/metabolism', 'Reference Values']",,1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1991 Aug 1;78(3):703-10.,"['0 (Receptors, Interleukin-4)', '0 (Receptors, Mitogen)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",,['S0006-4971(20)85240-9 [pii]'],,"['P01 CA-21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA-31685/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA-13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

It also provides a valuable model in which to test gene transfer and long-term expression in human hematopoietic cells as a prelude to human gene therapy. At the present time such studies are limited by the absence of in vivo assays for human stem cells, although recent descriptions of the engraftment of human hematopoietic cells in immune-deficient mice may provide the basis for such an assay. This study focuses on the establishment of conditions required for high efficiency retrovirus-mediated gene transfer into human hematopoietic progenitors that can be assayed in vitro in short-term colony assays and in vivo in immune-deficient mice. Here we report that a 24-hour preincubation of human bone marrow in 5637-conditioned medium, before infection, increases gene transfer efficiency into in vitro colony-forming cells by sixfold; interleukin-6 (IL-6) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) provide the same magnitude increase as 5637-conditioned medium. In contrast, incubation in recombinant growth factors IL-1, IL-3, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor increases gene transfer efficiency by 1.5- to 3-fold. Furthermore, preselection in high concentrations of G418 results in a population of cells significantly enriched for G418-resistant progenitors (up to 100%). These results, obtained using detailed survival curves based on colony formation in G418, have been substantiated by directly detecting the neo gene in individual colonies using the polymerase chain reaction. Using these optimized protocols, human bone marrow cells were genetically manipulated with a neo retrovirus vector and transplanted into immune-deficient bg/nu/xid mice. At 1 month and 4 months after the transplant, the hematopoietic tissues of these animals remained engrafted with genetically manipulated human cells. More importantly, G418-resistant progenitors that contained the neo gene were recovered from the bone marrow and spleen of engrafted animals after 4 months. These experiments establish the feasibility of characterizing human stem cells using the unique retrovirus integration site as a clonal marker, similar to techniques developed to elucidate the murine stem cell hierarchy.","['Dick, J E', 'Kamel-Reid, S', 'Murdoch, B', 'Doedens, M']","['Dick JE', 'Kamel-Reid S', 'Murdoch B', 'Doedens M']","['Department of Genetics, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial/genetics', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Reference Values', '*Transfection/drug effects', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",,1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1991 Aug 1;78(3):624-34.,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,['S0006-4971(20)85230-6 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate whether mdr1 could be involved in clinical resistance to chemotherapy in acute leukemias, we have analyzed retrospectively the RNA from adult acute leukemia cells by slot-blot hybridization with a human mdr1 probe. Units of mdr1 expression were defined by reference to drug-sensitive human sarcoma and K562 leukemia cell lines (1 U) and the highly resistant doxorubicin selected leukemia cells K562/R7 (50 U). We studied 41 adult patients with acute leukemias: 5 acute lymphoblastic leukemias, 23 acute myeloid leukemias, and 13 secondary leukemias or blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Expression of 10 U or more of mdr1 was found in 6 of 31 (19%) leukemias at diagnosis, versus 5 of 10 (50%) after relapse from therapy, P = .06. The complete remission rate and in vitro sensitivity to daunorubicin were both correlated with low expression (1 U, v 2 U or more) of mdr1. Among 36 evaluable attempts to induce remission, the complete remission rate was 67% (8 of 12) for patients with undetectable or minimal mdr1 expression (1 U), versus 29% (7 of 24) in patients with 2 U or more of expression, P = .03. In vitro resistance to daunorubicin or other MDR-related drugs was associated with expression of 2 U or more of mdr1 in 11 of 11 cases, while specimens that were sensitive to these agents were negative for mdr1 expression in 5 of 11 cases, P = .03. These data suggest that mdr1 expression contributes to chemoresistance in acute leukemia.

Tissues were solubilized by using concentrated sulfuric acid and 70% hydrogen peroxide to digest the samples without the need of high temperatures and pressures. Boron cluster compounds could be measured with sensitivity, precision, and accuracy similar to those of boric acid standards. Results obtained with [(C2H5)3NH]2B12H12, Cs2B12H11SH.H2O, and C15H32B10O6 show that this analytical method is applicable to a variety of compounds with different chemical structures. A sensitivity of 0.1 ppm has been obtained with known standards alone and in a variety of tissue matrices including tumor, blood, liver, skin, and cell suspensions. The measurement of total boron by direct-current plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (DCP-AES) has been achieved with as little as 50 mg of tissue or as few as 5 x 10(7) cells. The procedure is applicable to the analysis of boron in the ppm range with a high degree of precision and accuracy.","['Barth, R F', 'Adams, D M', 'Soloway, A H', 'Mechetner, E B', 'Alam, F', 'Anisuzzaman, A K']","['Barth RF', 'Adams DM', 'Soloway AH', 'Mechetner EB', 'Alam F', 'Anisuzzaman AK']","['Department of Pathology, Ohio State University, Columbus 43210.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,IM,,"['Animals', 'Boron/*analysis/pharmacokinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism', 'Male', 'Melanoma, Experimental/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Spectrum Analysis/methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anal Chem. 1991 May 1;63(9):890-3. doi: 10.1021/ac00009a010.,['N9E3X5056Q (Boron)'],,['10.1021/ac00009a010 [doi]'],,"['5R01 CA41288/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA53896/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

The patient was a 30-year-old male who had been diagnosed to have AML in June 1988. While in third complete remission, he underwent a sibling allogeneic HLA-matched bone marrow transplant. Five months after transplantation, he was readmitted for pneumonia. While in the hospital, he had an episode of upper GI bleeding. The endoscopy revealed a leukemic gastric ulcer, with morphology and immunophenotyping identical to his initial AML. There was no evidence of leukemia in the blood or bone marrow. Although different types of leukemic infiltrates have been recognized at post-mortem examination, our case is unique because AML presenting as an isolated malignant ulcer has not been described previously.

However, the TNF level was significantly elevated in DIC patients, and it was moderately increased in pre-DIC patients shortly before the onset of DIC. This increase in circulating TNF may be associated with DIC. TNF was higher in DIC associated with solid cancer than in DIC associated with leukemia or sepsis. The increase in plasma TNF level was mildly correlated with DIC score, and it was significantly increased in patients with poor prognosis.

The findings suggest that HTLV-I infection may be involved in the etiology of at least certain cases of mycosis fungoides.","['Hall, W W', 'Liu, C R', 'Schneewind, O', 'Takahashi, H', 'Kaplan, M H', 'Roupe, G', 'Vahlne, A']","['Hall WW', 'Liu CR', 'Schneewind O', 'Takahashi H', 'Kaplan MH', 'Roupe G', 'Vahlne A']","['Division of Infectious Disease, North Shore University Hospital-Cornell University Medical College, Manhasset, NY 11030.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,IM,"['Science. 1993 Mar 5;259(5100):1470; author reply 1471.

Survival and chromatid aberration frequency indicated that LY-R cells were considerably more sensitive to H2O2 than LY-S cells. So, LY strains were found to be inversely cross-sensitive to X/gamma rays and H2O2. The relative resistance to H2O2 corresponded with the previously found twofold difference in catalase activity (Jaworska et al. 1987). At higher concentrations H2O2 treatment caused interphase death, that was delayed by benzamide (Bz, 2mM), an inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribosylation), to a lesser extent in the more resistant cell subline (LY-S). From the examination of the H2O2 induced increase in the free Ca2+ concentration (with or without 2 mM Bz treatment) with the use of Fura-2 it followed, that the cells responded to the oxidative stress by Ca2+ release. The Ca2+ concentration increase was neither directly related to the killing effect of H2O2 treatment, nor did it correspond with the twofold difference in catalase activity in LY strains.","['Bouzyk, E', 'Buraczewska, I', 'Rosiek, O', 'Sochanowicz, B', 'Szumiel, I']","['Bouzyk E', 'Buraczewska I', 'Rosiek O', 'Sochanowicz B', 'Szumiel I']","['Institute of Nuclear Chemistry and Technology, Department of Radiobiology and Health Protection, Warszawa, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Radiat Environ Biophys,Radiation and environmental biophysics,0415677,IM,,"['Animals', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Catalase/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Chromatids/drug effects', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Drug Resistance', 'Fura-2', 'Gamma Rays', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*pharmacology', 'Interphase/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutagens', 'X-Rays']",,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Radiat Environ Biophys. 1991;30(2):105-16. doi: 10.1007/BF01219344.,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Mutagens)', '6X80438640 (benzamide)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'TSN3DL106G (Fura-2)']",,['10.1007/BF01219344 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

To facilitate studies in a variety of solvents, both tetramethylesters of the diporphyrin ethers and free acids were employed. For comparison, studies on the corresponding porphyrin monomers were also carried out. The joining of two porphyrins by an ether linkage had several consequences. We observed a blue shift in the Soret band of the ethers, but not of the corresponding simple porphyrins, in protic solvents. This phenomenon is likely related to ether aggregation under conditions which promote H-bonding. The presence of an ether linkage was associated with enhanced fluorescence at 630-640 nm and decreased fluorescence lifetimes and yields, especially in protic solvents. The ether linkage was unaffected by intracellular enzymes, but porphyrin esters were readily hydrolyzed upon accumulation by L1210 cells. The joining of two hematoporphyrin molecules by an ether linkage promoted dye accumulation by L1210 cells. In contrast, accumulation of mesoporphyrin and protoporphyrin was thereby retarded.","['Kessel, D', 'Byrne, C J', 'Ward, A D']","['Kessel D', 'Byrne CJ', 'Ward AD']","['Department of Pharmacology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI 48201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,IM,,"['Animals', 'Ethers/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Hematoporphyrin Photoradiation', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Photochemistry', 'Porphyrins/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence']",,1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 1991 Apr;53(4):469-74. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-1097.1991.tb03658.x.,"['0 (Ethers)', '0 (Porphyrins)']",,['10.1111/j.1751-1097.1991.tb03658.x [doi]'],,['CA 23378/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors were tested for their cytolytic activity in vitro in the presence of adriamycin, methotrexate, leucovorin, vincristin, cytosine arabinoside and teniposide. Most of the tested cytostatic drugs did not show to be active at concentrations comparable to their plasma level. However, diluents of some preparations (cytosine arabinoside, teniposide) containing organic solutions and stabilizing additives (e.g. benzyl alcohol) suppressed the NK activity more than chemotherapeutic agents alone. Thus teniposide, containing such additives, inhibited NK activity already at 5 mg/ml, while its peak plasma concentration was 23.8 mg/ml. The inhibitory concentrations of teniposide did not affect the target binding of effector cells and the expression of 14 tested leukocyte differentiation markers. This implies that a postbinding step of the lytic process was altered by the preparation. Likewise, no inhibition of lectin dependent cellular cytotoxicity by teniposide and its diluent was observed, suggesting that the lectin may substitute the missing lytic signal.","['Ujhazy, P', 'Babusikova, O']","['Ujhazy P', 'Babusikova O']","['Cancer Research Institute, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Czechoslovakia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,IM,,"['Antigens, Differentiation/biosynthesis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzyl Alcohol', 'Benzyl Alcohols/pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects', 'Leucovorin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Teniposide/pharmacology', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Neoplasma. 1991;38(3):303-12.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzyl Alcohols)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'LKG8494WBH (Benzyl Alcohol)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

General toxicity was assessed by means of mortality, or body weight changes of male CBA mice weighing 22-25 g after a single-dose i.p. administration of 5 or 2.5 mg/kg DNR, free or bound. Linked DNR at a larger lethal dose significantly increased mean survival time (18 versus 12 days). Surprisingly, free DNR at a smaller dose produced larger increases in body weight as compared with linked DNR. The linkage of DNR and PHEG did not markedly change the therapeutic activity in three murine hemoblastoses--plasmacytoma MOPS 406, leukemia P388 and hemoblastosis La. Acute (24 h) changes in cardio- and hepatotoxicity were studied on female Wistar rats weighing 208 +/- 5 g after a single dose of 5 mg/kg i.v. both free and linked DNR, as well as after an administration of the PHEG polymer alone (200 mg/kg i.v.). Free DNR caused a three-fold increase in creatine kinase (CK) activity, the identical dose of linked DNR caused only a 1.7-fold increase. Free DNR administration resulted in a decrease in heart rate, other tested drugs did not significantly change either blood pressure or heart rate. Free DNR did not change the kinetics of bromsulphalein (BSP) except for a decrease in extraction effectivity. Both linked DNR and polymer alone significantly changed some kinetic parameters of BSP. The results showed that the biodegradable polymer PHEG cannot be clinically used due to its hepatotoxic action. On the other hand, a decrease in total toxicity and cardiotoxicity resulting from the linkage of DNR and PHEG, the therapeutic efficacy being preserved, stimulates the efforts to find a suitable polymer carrier of anthracyclines without more serious side-effects.","['Hrdina, R', 'Bogusova, T A', 'Kunova, A', 'Kvetina, J']","['Hrdina R', 'Bogusova TA', 'Kunova A', 'Kvetina J']","['Institute of Experimental Biopharmacy, Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, Hradec Kralove.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,IM,,"['Animals', 'Aza Compounds/*chemistry', 'Blood Pressure/drug effects', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Creatine Kinase/metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Drug Carriers/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Heart Rate/drug effects', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Liver/drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Nitriles/*chemistry', '*Peptides', 'Plasmacytoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Pyrimidine Nucleosides/*chemistry', 'Sulfobromophthalein/pharmacokinetics']",,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Neoplasma. 1991;38(3):265-73.,"['0 (Aza Compounds)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Pyrimidine Nucleosides)', '0C2P5QKL36 (Sulfobromophthalein)', '27878-59-7 (poly-N(5)-(2-hydroxyethyl)glutamine)', 'EC 2.7.3.2 (Creatine Kinase)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The presence of the TdT enzyme was assessed and specific monoclonal antibodies to the different hemopoietic lines were used to evaluate blast cells in 38 patients with blast crisis during Ph-positive CML. RESULTS: T lymphoid phenotype was found in three of the 38 patients, corresponding in all cases to immature T cells. In one patient, the blast crisis was the presenting feature of CML and in two the localization of the blast crisis was lymphadenopathic. In the two patients who could be followed up a favorable response to chemotherapy regimens including vincristine and prednisone was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Although uncommon, T lymphoid blast crisis in CML should no longer be considered exceptional. This phenotypic finding suggests that, at least in some cases, CML originates in a pluripotential stem cell common to all hemopoietic cells, including T lymphocytes.","['Cervantes, F', 'Urbano-Ispizua, A', 'Escoda, L', 'Ordi, J', 'Montserrat, E', 'Rozman, C']","['Cervantes F', 'Urbano-Ispizua A', 'Escoda L', 'Ordi J', 'Montserrat E', 'Rozman C']","['Escuela de Hematologia Farreras Valenti, Hospital Clinic i Provincial, Barcelona.']",['spa'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,IM,,"['Adult', '*Blast Crisis/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', '*T-Lymphocytes', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",,1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 1991 Jun 1;97(1):21-3.,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",,,,,Crisis blastica linfoide T de la leucemia mieloide cronica cromosoma Filadelfia positiva: analisis de tres casos.,,,,,,,,,

CxD2 mice showed only slightly reduced presence of Moloney mink cell focus-forming virus (M-MCF) provirus as seen by Southern blot analysis compared to Balb/c mice. This lack of restriction for disease and spread of MCF was in sharp contrast to that seen for CxD2 mice inoculated with Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV), where incidence of disease and propagation of MCFs were severely restricted, as previously reported. Inoculation of CxD2 mice with FM-MuLV, a recombinant F-MuLV virus containing M-MuLV LTR sequences (U3 and R), resulted in T cell disease of time course equal to that seen in Balb/c mice; there also was little restriction for propagation of MCFs. This indicated that presence of the M-MuLV long terminal repeat (LTR) was sufficient for propagation of MCFs in CxD2 mice. Differing restriction for F-MuLV vs. M-MuLV in CxD2 mice was explained on the basis of different ""MCF propagator cells"" for the two viruses. It was suggested that cells propagating F-MCF (e.g., erythroid progenitors) are blocked by endogenous MCF-like gp70env protein, whereas cells propagating M-MCF (e.g., lymphoid) do not express this protein on their surface. F-MuLV disease in CxD2 mice was greatly accelerated when neonates were inoculated with a F-MuLV/F-MCF pseudotypic mixture. However, F-MCF provirus was not detectable or only barely detectable in F-MuLV/F-MCF-induced tumors, suggesting that F-MCF acted indirectly in induction of these tumors.","['Brightman, B K', 'Li, Q X', 'Trepp, D J', 'Fan, H']","['Brightman BK', 'Li QX', 'Trepp DJ', 'Fan H']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine 92717.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', '*DNA, Viral', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Immunity, Innate/genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/*immunology/mortality', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', '*Moloney murine leukemia virus', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics']",,1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1991 Aug 1;174(2):389-96. doi: 10.1084/jem.174.2.389.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",['Rmcf'],['10.1084/jem.174.2.389 [doi]'],PMC2118917,"['R0I CA-32455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI-07319/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

The markers studied were transferrin receptor (TR), Ki-67 antigen, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Two-color analysis for DNA via propidium iodide binding and for antigen expression via either a direct or indirect immunofluorescence assay was performed on three different cell lines and a solid human tumor model. The three cell lines tested were MCF-7 (breast), K-562 (leukemia), and A431 (a squamous cell). The solid tumor was obtained by subcutaneous injection of A431 cells into an athymic nude mouse. Our results demonstrate that TR are cell-cycle specific and can be readily measured in the cell lines. Ki-67 antigen is also cell-cycle specific in the cell lines tested, but the mean channel specific fluorescence uptake varies in the cell types. Finally, the EGFR was observed only in the A431 cell line, with most cells equally expressing this receptor. A bimodal distribution of EGFR was observed in A431 cells obtained from a solid tumor grown in an athymic nude mouse system. This suggests that cell line analysis may not always represent what might be observed under in vivo conditions.

This study determined tumor incidence in various tissues of male F344/NCr rats after a single dose of cadmium. Cadmium (as CdCl2) was given sc in the dorsal thoracic midline at 30 mumole/kg to 70 8-week old male F344 rats while controls (n = 50) received saline. Rats were observed during the next 90 weeks. Early deaths (less than or equal to 32 weeks), due mostly to acute cadmium-induced hepatotoxicity, accounted for 37 of the cadmium-treated rats while no control rats died in the same period. A high incidence of injection site sarcomas (ISS) occurred in the cadmium-treated group (21 ISS/32 rats at risk; 66%) while only 1/50 occurred in controls (2%). In fact, ISS were the major cause of morbidity after 35 weeks in cadmium-treated rats. These tumors were mostly fibrosarcomas, although histiocytic and osteogenic sarcomas also occurred. Testicular interstitial cell tumors, which show a very high spontaneous incidence in this strain (41/49; 84%), were not markedly affected by cadmium (30/31; 97%). This is in sharp contrast to other strains, such as the Wistar, in which cadmium treatment is reported to cause as much as an eightfold increase in interstitial cell (Leydig cell) tumor incidence. The incidence of large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia, which also occurred frequently in control F344 rats (12/47; 26%) was markedly decreased (2/31; 7%) by cadmium. Our recent studies indicate acute lymphonecrotic effects occur with cadmium in lymphoid tissues of rats, and this may be related to the suppression of the leukemia. These results indicate that cadmium is very effective in inducing ISS in F344 rats, as is the case with other strains thus far tested, and also markedly reduces spontaneous leukemia incidence.","['Waalkes, M P', 'Rehm, S', 'Sass, B', 'Konishi, N', 'Ward, J M']","['Waalkes MP', 'Rehm S', 'Sass B', 'Konishi N', 'Ward JM']","['Inorganic Carcinogenesis and Tumor Pathology Section, National Cancer Institute, Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Maryland 21702.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Environ Res,Environmental research,0147621,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cadmium/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Fibrosarcoma/*chemically induced', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Liver/drug effects', 'Lymph Nodes/drug effects', 'Male', 'Necrosis', 'Osteosarcoma/*chemically induced', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/*chemically induced', 'Skin Neoplasms/*chemically induced', 'Spleen/drug effects', 'Testis/drug effects', 'Thymus Gland/drug effects']",,1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Environ Res. 1991 Jun;55(1):40-50. doi: 10.1016/s0013-9351(05)80139-2.,['00BH33GNGH (Cadmium)'],,"['S0013-9351(05)80139-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0013-9351(05)80139-2 [doi]']",,['N01-CO-74102/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

The L-cysteine then elevates glutathione (GSH) levels by stimulating its biosynthesis. RibCys was investigated for its ability to protect CDF1 mice from the potent urotoxicity of cyclophosphamide (CTX) without compromising the therapeutic utility of the drug. RibCys induced a significant reduction in weight loss of the animals and in bladder inflammation at 48 h after CTX administration; however, bladder tissue remained inflamed as compared with that in controls. Bladder histology also showed some pathological changes in the presence of RibCys. In contrast, all parameters of toxicity (body weight loss, bladder inflammation, and pathological abnormalities) had been virtually reversed by day 21 after administration. In tests against L1210 leukemia, RibCys did not interfere with CTX anticancer activity. From these preliminary studies, RibCys appears to be a likely candidate for protecting against long-term CTX toxicity, perhaps reversing the original damage caused by a very high dose, without compromising the therapeutic utility of the alkylating agent.","['Roberts, J C', 'Francetic, D J', 'Zera, R T']","['Roberts JC', 'Francetic DJ', 'Zera RT']","['Department of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Utah, Salt Lake City 84112.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Cysteine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Glutathione/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Prodrugs/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Thiazolidines', 'Time Factors', 'Urinary Bladder/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology']",,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1991;28(3):166-70. doi: 10.1007/BF00685504.,"['0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Thiazolidines)', ""17087-36-4 (2-(1',2',3',4'-tetrahydroxybutyl)thiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid)"", '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",,['10.1007/BF00685504 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The s.c. growth of P388 tumors in DBA/2 mice was significantly suppressed by systemically administered N-CWS, and the effect was dose dependent. The antitumor effect of N-CWS was partially but significantly abrogated in splenectomized mice but not in T-cell or natural killer cell-deficient mice. Although spleen cells from mice treated with 1600 micrograms N-CWS contained no cytolytic activity, they exerted a significant cytostatic effect on P388 cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Splenic cytostatic activity did not reside in T- or natural killer cells, but in plastic adherent cell population, macrophages. The response to N-CWS immunotherapy appeared to be associated with the number of macrophages infiltrating into the tumor lesions, and this was confirmed by histological analysis showing that P388 tumors from N-CWS-treated mice were intensively and dominantly infiltrated by macrophages. Furthermore, these were shown to be strongly tumor necrosis factor-positive by immunohistochemical analysis. These findings indicate that macrophages are the main effector cells playing a critical role in the suppression of P388 tumor growth in DBA/2 mice, and that tumor necrosis factor produced by these cells may be involved in the macrophage-mediated cytostatic effect induced by N-CWS. The fact that N-CWS suppressed the growth of weakly immunogenic P388 cells in syngeneic DBA/2 mice even when it was systemically injected would support the clinical potential of this agent.","['Izumi, S', 'Ogawa, T', 'Miyauchi, M', 'Fujie, K', 'Okuhara, M', 'Kohsaka, M']","['Izumi S', 'Ogawa T', 'Miyauchi M', 'Fujie K', 'Okuhara M', 'Kohsaka M']","['Exploratory Research Laboratories, Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Wall/immunology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Immunity, Cellular', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Killer Cells, Natural/physiology', 'Leukemia P388/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Nocardia/*immunology/ultrastructure', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology', 'Splenectomy', 'T-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis']",,1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Aug 1;51(15):4038-44.,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A subgroup at high risk of early treatment failure.,751-8,"Multivariate analyses of the clinical course of 1537 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) identified a subgroup which experienced short remission duration and a high incidence of extramedullary relapse. The patients differed from other ALL patients by the presence at diagnosis of two or more of a constellation of clinical and laboratory features: organomegaly or mass disease, E-rosette positivity, hemoglobin level greater than 10 g/dl, leukocyte count greater than 50,000/microliters, male predominance, and older age. This type of presentation of ALL is referred to as the ""lymphoma syndrome"" (LS) since such patients exhibit a pattern of several clinical and laboratory features which were observed repeatedly but in differing combinations, and some of which clinically resemble lymphoma. A subsequent database from 2231 patients was analyzed. Patients with a mediastinal mass, massive splenomegaly, or massive adenopathy, alone or in combination, had a worse outcome when the patient also had either leukocytosis, E-rosette-positive lymphoblasts, or a normal or near normal hemoglobin (Hb) level at diagnosis. Similarly, the above three laboratory features alone or in combination did not predict less than 40% disease-free survival (DFS) unless they were accompanied by at least one of the clinical features of mass disease. When at least one clinical feature and at least one laboratory feature were present, the overall DFS was 36% 6 years after diagnosis versus 64% for all other patients. The association of these features with poor prognosis remained significant after adjusting for the level of leukocyte count at diagnosis, age at diagnosis, and sex of the patients. Patients with this recurrent syndrome of features do not represent a homogeneous biologic entity but they constitute a subgroup of patients with ALL having a high risk of treatment failure using current therapies, including failure to achieve remission, early relapse, and increased frequency of relapse in extramedullary sites. They deserve early recognition at diagnosis and selection of treatment strategies appropriate for very high risk ALL.","['Steinherz, P G', 'Siegel, S E', 'Bleyer, W A', 'Kersey, J', 'Chard, R Jr', 'Coccia, P', 'Leikin, S', 'Lukens, J', 'Neerhout, R', 'Nesbit, M']","['Steinherz PG', 'Siegel SE', 'Bleyer WA', 'Kersey J', 'Chard R Jr', 'Coccia P', 'Leikin S', 'Lukens J', 'Neerhout R', 'Nesbit M', 'et al.']","['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Hepatomegaly/blood/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Mediastinal Neoplasms/blood/diagnosis', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*classification/diagnosis/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Rosette Formation', 'Splenomegaly/blood/diagnosis', 'Survival Analysis']",,1991/08/25 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1991/08/25 19:15'],"['1991/08/25 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1991/08/25 19:15 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1991 Aug 15;68(4):751-8. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19910815)68:4<751::aid-cncr2820680416>3.0.co;2-t.,,,['10.1002/1097-0142(19910815)68:4<751::aid-cncr2820680416>3.0.co;2-t [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The patients were treated daily with 6 x 10(6) IU of HLBI subcutaneously and 100 mg of bestrabucil orally. In patients with lymphoma-type ATLL or hypercalcemia, prednisolone also was given daily. Of 12 patients suitable for evaluation, nine had partial responses, one had a minor response, and two had no response. All five patients with skin infiltration and both patients with hypercalcemia responded. A history of prior chemotherapy did not affect the response rate. The time to clinical response was 3 to 16 days (median, 11 days) after initiation of treatment. The response duration was 4 to 108+ weeks (median, 9 weeks), but all patients except one relapsed, even during continuing treatment. No serious side effects were observed. Although the response rate with this combination treatment was high, the response duration was short, and other treatments would have to be added to achieve control of this aggressive disease.","['Ezaki, K', 'Hirano, M', 'Ohno, R', 'Yamada, K', 'Naito, K', 'Hirota, Y', 'Shirakawa, S', 'Kimura, K']","['Ezaki K', 'Hirano M', 'Ohno R', 'Yamada K', 'Naito K', 'Hirota Y', 'Shirakawa S', 'Kimura K']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Fujita Health University, School of Medicine, Aichi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Chlorambucil/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Estradiol/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,1991/08/15 00:00,1991/08/15 00:01,['1991/08/15 00:00'],"['1991/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1991 Aug 15;68(4):695-8. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19910815)68:4<695::aid-cncr2820680405>3.0.co;2-k.,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '75219-46-4 (bestrabucil)']",,['10.1002/1097-0142(19910815)68:4<695::aid-cncr2820680405>3.0.co;2-k [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Seven patients received mitoxantrone (6 mg/m2/d for 5 days) and VP-16 (1500 mg/m2 over 3 days). The median duration of the initial complete remission (CR) was 6 months and 83% of the patients had initial CR that lasted 12 months or less.

Twelve patients (33%) died and 15 patients (42%) had disease that was resistant to treatment. Patients undergoing a first salvage attempt had a higher incidence rate of CR than those undergoing a second or subsequent salvage attempt (37% versus 6%; P = 0.03). CR rates were also higher in patients with a favorable (translocation 8;21 or 15;17) or diploid karyotype compared with other patients (32% versus 8%; P = 0.10).

Unfortunately, this information is surprisingly difficult to obtain accurately. Most studies that have attempted to define the value of BMT have been subject to varying degrees of bias because of the problems of identifying a ""conventional chemotherapy"" control group with which the outcome of patients who have received BMTs can be compared. A common bias arises when disease-free survival of BMT patients is compared with that of all other remitters. Early failures are then automatically assigned to the chemotherapy group even if they have donors and so would have gone on to a BMT had they not relapsed or died. Since some patients receive BMTs many months (or even years) after achieving remission-when their prognosis is already much improved-the definition of ""early failure"" is problematic. Nevertheless, although it is very rarely used, an adequate statistical method does exist to overcome this problem. Careful analysis cannot, however, overcome the problem of selection bias: patients selected for BMT are likely to have better (or worse) prognosis than patients who are treated conventionally. The only really satisfactory way of assessing the value of BMT is to conduct randomised trials comparing BMT with no BMT - or with extra chemotherapy. Several such studies are currently being undertaken assessing the role of autologous BMT in AML.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Gray, R', 'Wheatley, K']","['Gray R', 'Wheatley K']","['MRC Clinical Trial Service Unit, Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, England.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Drug Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/surgery/*therapy', 'Selection Bias']",0,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1991;7 Suppl 3:9-12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of the sites of relapse before transplantation showed that 39 patients had bone marrow relapses, 17 patients had CNS and/or testicular isolated relapses only. 32 harvests were purged in vitro by 1 mcgr/ml Vincristine and 30 mcgr/ml Prednisone, 16 by 100 mcgr/ml Mafosfamide, 8 were not cleaned. 29 patients received high dose Vincristine (4 mg/m2), TBI (1200 cGy), Cyclophosphamide (3600 mg/m2) as standard conditioning regimen before transplant. 27 patients received other conditioning treatments with (14) or without (13) TBI.

Since five patients were studied twice, a total of 54 studies were carried out. Fourteen patients were evaluated at diagnosis, 12 in the controlled chronic phase within 1 year from diagnosis, 14 in the advanced chronic phase (median evolution 3.25 years), and 14 in the accelerated (five cases) or blastic (nine cases) phases. Fourteen normal subjects served as a control group. At diagnosis, a significant decrease in the positivity for both antigens was observed with respect to controls, probably due to the circulation of incompletely mature NG. In the early chronic phase the values were within the normal range, whereas a significant decrease was registered in the advanced chronic phase and especially in the accelerated/blastic phase. A negative correlation between the NG positivity for both markers and the time elapsed from the moment of obtaining the initial control of the disease was found, suggesting that a progressive loss of the myeloid antigens of the NG occurs during the evolutive course of CML.

Although benzene has been shown to cause many types of genetic damage, it has consistently been classified as a non-mutagen in the Ames test, possibly because of the inadequacy of the S9 microsomal activation system. The metabolism of benzene is complex, yielding glucuronide and sulphate conjugates of phenol, quinol, and catechol, L-phenylmercapturic acid, and muconaldehyde and trans, trans-muconic acid by ring scission. Quinol is oxidised to p-benzoquinone, which binds to vital cellular components or undergoes redox cycling to generate oxygen radicals; muconaldehyde, like p-benzoquinone, is toxic through depletion of intracellular glutathione. Exposure to benzene may also induce the microsomal mixed function oxidase, cytochrome P450 IIE1, which is probably responsible for the oxygenation of benzene, but also has a propensity to generate oxygen radicals. The radiomimetic nature of benzene and its ability to induce different sites of neoplasia indicate that formation of oxygen radicals is a major cause of benzene toxicity, which involves multiple mechanisms including synergism between arylating and glutathione-depleting reactive metabolites and oxygen radicals. The occupational exposure limit in the United Kingdom (MEL) and the United States (PEL) was 10 ppm based on the association of benzene exposure with aplastic anaemia, but recently was lowered to 5 ppm and 1 ppm respectively, reflecting a concern for the risk of neoplasia. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) has even more recently recommended that, as benzene is considered an A1 carcinogen, the threshold limit value (TLV) should be decreased to 0.1 ppm. Only one study in man, based on nine cases of benzene associated fatal neoplasia, has been considered suitable for risk assessment. Recent re-evaluation of these data indicated that past assessments may have overestimated the risk, and different authors have considered that lifetime exposure to benzene at 1 ppm would result in an excess of leukaemia deaths of 9.5 to 1.0 per 1000. Although in this study, deaths at low levels of benzene exposure were associated with multiple myeloma and a long latency period, instead of leukaemia, which might justify further lowering of the exposure limit, the risk assessment model has been found to be non-significant for response at low levels of exposure. The paucity of data for man, the complexity of the metabolic activation of benzene, the interactive and synergistic mechanisms of benzene toxicity and carcinogenicity, the different disease endpoints (aplastic anaemia, leukaemia, and multiple myeloma), and different individual susceptibilities, all indicate that in such a complex scenario, regulators should proceed with caution before making further changes to the exposure limit for this chemical.","['Yardley-Jones, A', 'Anderson, D', 'Parke, D V']","['Yardley-Jones A', 'Anderson D', 'Parke DV']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Surrey, Guildford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Br J Ind Med,British journal of industrial medicine,0370637,IM,,"['Anemia, Aplastic/chemically induced', 'Animals', 'Benzene/metabolism/poisoning/*toxicity', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced', 'Maximum Allowable Concentration', 'Multiple Myeloma/chemically induced', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Risk']",61,1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Ind Med. 1991 Jul;48(7):437-44. doi: 10.1136/oem.48.7.437.,['J64922108F (Benzene)'],,['10.1136/oem.48.7.437 [doi]'],PMC1035396,,,,,,,,,,,

Both compounds were effective against the murine tumours L1210 and Colon 26 by i.p. injection of 20-100 mg kg-1. While DWA2114S showed marked increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and urinary protein and sugar in BDF1 mice treated i.p. at the maximum tolerated dose, DWA2114R showed no increases in these parameters. To clarify the difference of nephrotoxicity between the isomers, tissue distribution was examined. Renal Pt concentration in DWA2114S-treated mice was more than 5-fold higher compared with that in DWA2114R-treated mice 2h after i.p. injection of 80 mg kg-1. However, there were no such marked differences in the lung, liver, heart, spleen and plasma. The low content of Pt in the kidneys of DWA2114R-treated mice could explain its lower nephrotoxicity. The in vitro experiments for uptake of the drugs into the cultured normal rat kidney cells and fresh splenocytes revealed that the Pt amount in the cells treated with DWA2114S, especially in the kidney cells, was much higher than DWA2114R.","['Matsumoto, T', 'Endoh, K', 'Akamatsu, K', 'Kamisango, K', 'Mitsui, H', 'Koizumi, K', 'Morikawa, K', 'Koizumi, M', 'Matsuno, T']","['Matsumoto T', 'Endoh K', 'Akamatsu K', 'Kamisango K', 'Mitsui H', 'Koizumi K', 'Morikawa K', 'Koizumi M', 'Matsuno T']","['Exploratory Research Laboratories, Chugai Pharmaceutical Co.

Record-linkage with the Swedish Cancer Register identified 99 new cancers more than 2 years after 131I therapy [standardised incidence ratio (SIR) = 1.43; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17-1.75] vs 122 (SIR = 1.19; 95% CI 0.88-1.42) in patients not receiving 131I.

No elevated risk of a subsequent breast cancer or leukaemia was noted. SIR did not change over time, arguing against a strong radiation effect of 131I. Organs that were estimated to have received more than 1.0 Gy had together a significantly increased risk of a subsequent cancer following 131I treatment (SIR = 2.59; n = 18). A significant trend was seen for increasing activities of 131I with highest risk for patients exposed to greater than or equal to 3,664 MBq (SIR = 1.80; 95% CI 1.20-2.58). No specific cancer or group of cancers could be convincingly linked to high-dose 131I exposures since SIR did not increase after 10 years of observation. However, upper confidence intervals could not exclude levels of risk that would be predicted based on data from the study of atomic bomb survivors. We conclude that the current practice of extrapolating the effects of high-dose exposures to lower-dose situations is unlikely to seriously underestimate radiation hazards for low LET radiation.","['Hall, P', 'Holm, L E', 'Lundell, G', 'Bjelkengren, G', 'Larsson, L G', 'Lindberg, S', 'Tennvall, J', 'Wicklund, H', 'Boice, J D Jr']","['Hall P', 'Holm LE', 'Lundell G', 'Bjelkengren G', 'Larsson LG', 'Lindberg S', 'Tennvall J', 'Wicklund H', 'Boice JD Jr']","['Department of General Oncology, Radiumhemmet, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Sweden', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*radiotherapy/surgery', 'Thyroidectomy']",,1991/07/11 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1991/07/11 19:15'],"['1991/07/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1991/07/11 19:15 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1991 Jul;64(1):159-63. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1991.261.,['0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)'],,['10.1038/bjc.1991.261 [doi]'],PMC1977300,['N01-CP-51034/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Though no specific reason was found, certain geographical areas, tumour groups and putative risks were identified for further study. One possible risk was a tin smelter to the west of Hull. A new method of analysis (Stone's conditional Poisson maximum) was used and showed some evidence of increased risk close to the smelter. This was accounted for by the solid tumours (primarily central nervous system malignancies) and was not apparent for the leukaemias. The Poisson maximum method is a special case of isotonic regression; a more general isotonic regression method, also due to Stone, Maximum Likelihood Ratio (MLR), is also available, and for reasons described elsewhere we prefer the more general method. The present study begins by applying this to the childhood data and then to data for corresponding adult disease (leukemias and central nervous system tumours) in the same area and time period. In both children and adults the results are negative for the leukaemias. For the remaining tumour categories, there is a significant increase in risk close to the smelter, but it is not possible to identify any aspect of the smelter or feature in its vicinity as causative.","['Alexander, F', 'McKinney, P A', 'Cartwright, R A']","['Alexander F', 'McKinney PA', 'Cartwright RA']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre for Clinical Epidemiology, Leeds.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Public Health Med,Journal of public health medicine,9011205,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk Factors', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",,1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Public Health Med. 1991 May;13(2):96-100.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The responses of these cases to questions about possible sources of antigenic stimulation were compared with the responses of controls selected from the populations of these areas. Little difference between cases and controls was present for a history of most forms of viral and bacterial infection and for a history of allergies or allergy treatment. However, a relation was observed with antecedent syphilis infection (odds ratio (OR) = 5.0, 95% confidence interval (Cl) 2.0-12.9).

This disease induction was prevented, to a great extent, by transient depletion of the peripheral T lymphocytes during the early course of infection by using anti-Thy 1.2 antibody. FVB/N mice, which are highly susceptible to ts1, but express Thy 1.1 instead of Thy 1.2 on their T lymphocytes, did not show any difference in the disease profile when treated similarly with anti-Thy 1.2 antibody. Transient depletion of the peripheral B lymphocytes in BALB/c mice in the early course of ts1 infection had no effect on the disease induction. In the T cell depleted BALB/c mice, virus replication was reduced, survival of the mice was increased and viral specific antibodies were produced, whereas, in the B cell depleted mice the disease process went on in a fashion similar to untreated mice infected with ts1. Thus, this study demonstrates that the disease syndrome induced by ts1 in BALB/c mice is dependent upon the presence of T lymphocytes during the early course of infection, and that presence of B lymphocytes have little or no effect on the disease outcome.","['Saha, K', 'Wong, P K']","['Saha K', 'Wong PK']","['Department of Carcinogenesis, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Smithville 78957.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*immunology/microbiology', '*Mutation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Virus Replication/genetics']",,1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 1991 Aug;183(2):815-20. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(91)91017-b.,,,"['0042-6822(91)91017-B [pii]', '10.1016/0042-6822(91)91017-b [doi]']",,"['AI 28283/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 45124/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

All seven mutants were replication-defective as tested by transformation of NIH/3T3 cells. The mutant DNAs were introduced into NIH/3T3 cells to generate stable producer lines; all released virion particles into the medium, suggesting that none of the mutations affected overall viral gene expression, gag and pol gene expression, gag and pol gene functions, or virion budding. Several of the mutations reduced the lifetime of the env protein or blocked its export to the cell surface. One mutation altering the membrane-spanning region and the cytoplasmic tail of the TM protein had no effect on export of the protein, proteolytic processing, or incorporation into virion particles, but still blocked the infectivity of the resulting virus. The results suggest that alterations in the transmembrane region can affect early steps of infection, such as the fusion of virion and host membranes. Cells expressing this mutant env protein were fully resistant to superinfection by wild-type virus. Thus, induction of virus resistance, presumably reflecting blocking the virus receptor, can be separated from virus infectivity.","['Granowitz, C', 'Colicelli, J', 'Goff, S P']","['Granowitz C', 'Colicelli J', 'Goff SP']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Viral', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', '*Genes, env', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/metabolism/pathogenicity', '*Mutation', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Virus Replication/*genetics']",,1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 1991 Aug;183(2):545-54. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(91)90983-i.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",['env'],"['0042-6822(91)90983-I [pii]', '10.1016/0042-6822(91)90983-i [doi]']",,['CA 30488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

The use of autologous rather than allogeneic marrow stem cells reduces the probability of acute graft-versus-host disease and reduces the need for obtaining HLA-matched marrow from limited donor pools. The greatest problem in Auto-KMT involves efficacy of the cytotoxic therapy and the obvious lack of graft-versus-leukemia effect. In addition, a theoretical limitation is that the marrow may contain clonogenic malignant cells, which may be the source of reestablished disease. In absence of phase III clinical trials directly comparing Auto-KMT with conventional therapies in the treatment of most malignancies, its role continues to be poorly defined. In an attempt to identify subsets of patients with leukemia or lymphoma who might benefit from transplantation, we performed this study of recent reports from the literature. It is concluded that the associated mortality is acceptable. At present the indications for Auto-KMT are lymphoma in relapse after conventional therapy and acute myeloblastic leukemia in second remission.

The present study combines both treatments. METHODS. Remission induction treatment was DAE combination. The first intensification consisted of HD ARA-C and mitoxantrone and the second HD ARA-C and AMSA. CNS prophylaxis consisted of 6 doses of i.t. ARA-C and MTX. Later, patients in remission with HLA-compatible donor received BMT and those without it, ABMT with ""ex vivo"" treatment of the bone marrow with ASTA-Z. Pre-BMT treatment was the same in both cases: fractionated total body irradiation (TBI) and cyclophosphamide in patients over 3 years of age; in patients under 3 busulfan was given instead of TBI.

Although the normal roles of tumour suppressor genes are still largely unknown, it seems that they could be involved in promoting cell differentiation as well as in mediating growth arrest by growth-inhibitory cytokines. Hence, the abrogation of wild-type p53 expression, which is a common feature of many tumours, could eliminate these activities. We have now tested this notion by restoring the expression of p53 in a murine myeloid leukaemic cell line that normally lacks p53. The use of a temperature-sensitive p53 mutant allowed us to analyse cells in which the introduced p53 had either wild-type or mutant properties. Although there seemed to be no effect on differentiation, the introduction of wild-type p53 resulted in rapid loss of cell viability in a way characteristic of apoptosis (programmed cell death). The effect of wild-type p53 was counteracted by interleukin-6. Thus products of tumour suppressor genes could be involved in restricting precursor cell populations by mediating apoptosis.","['Yonish-Rouach, E', 'Resnitzky, D', 'Lotem, J', 'Sachs, L', 'Kimchi, A', 'Oren, M']","['Yonish-Rouach E', 'Resnitzky D', 'Lotem J', 'Sachs L', 'Kimchi A', 'Oren M']","['Department of Chemical Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Survival', 'Genes, p53', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*pharmacology']",,1991/07/25 00:00,1991/07/25 00:01,['1991/07/25 00:00'],"['1991/07/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/25 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nature. 1991 Jul 25;352(6333):345-7. doi: 10.1038/352345a0.,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",,['10.1038/352345a0 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to further study the effects of IFN in this disease, we derived a cell line (HC1) from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a patient with hairy cell leukemia (HCL). Cells exhibited the typical morphological features of HCL, including the characteristic cytoplasmic projections by light, transmission, and scanning electron microscopy. HC1 cells were of B-cell lineage, as evidenced by immunophenotypic analysis. Although originally TRAP positive, HC1 cells lost this biochemical marker following 3 months in culture. Monoclonality of the cell line was confirmed by a clonal karyotypic abnormality characteristic of B-cell malignancies, and the presence of a single, distinctive fused terminal EBV fragment. The cells formed colonies in soft agar and were tumorigenic in irradiated nude mice. HC1 cells were sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of IFN-a and IFN-beta, but only moderately sensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of IFN-gamma. Incubating the cells in the presence of Type 1 IFN resulted in stabilization of cell numbers, without cellular proliferation or loss. Cell cycle analysis revealed that IFN-alpha resulted in a build-up of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle, suggesting a cytostatic effect of IFN on the growth of these cells.

In this study we examined the correlation between rearrangement and methylation status of the T-cell receptor (TCR) beta-chain gene in 23 patients with B precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In B precursor ALL, all patients had a CCmeGG sequence in the C beta 2 region, a pattern similar to that observed in normal mature B-cells. Approximately 55% of patients with B precursor ALL exhibiting a hypomethylated CCGG sequence at the J beta 1 region showed rearrangement of this region. Furthermore, the same allele of rearranged J beta 1 always contained an unmethylated sequence in the region, although another allele without rearrangement contained methylated J beta 1. By contrast, none of the patients had a rearrangement in the J beta 1 region without hypomethylation. Therefore, rearrangement of the J beta 1 region may link to the hypomethylation status of this region. A close association between hypomethylation of the J beta 1 region may promote accessibility to a putative common recombinase to produce TCR J beta 1 rearrangement. In contrast, about 45% of patients with a hypomethylated J beta 1 did not show rearrangement in this region, thus allowing categorization of B precursor ALL patients into subtypes, according to the combination of TCR beta-chain gene rearrangement and hypomethylation status, especially in the J beta 1 region.","['Tauchi, T', 'Ohyashiki, J H', 'Ohyashiki, K', 'Saito, M', 'Nakazawa, S', 'Kimura, N', 'Toyama, K']","['Tauchi T', 'Ohyashiki JH', 'Ohyashiki K', 'Saito M', 'Nakazawa S', 'Kimura N', 'Toyama K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical College, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain/*genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Methylation', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Restriction Mapping']",,1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Jun 1;51(11):2917-21.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunoprecipitation of radiolabelled CD45 glycoprotein from dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) treated HL60 cells indicated that the cells expressed 200 and 180 kD isoforms. Northern blots of steady-state RNA from HL60 cells showed a 4-11-fold increase in CD45 transcripts after DMSO treatment, but no alteration in the half-life of CD45 mRNA. Nuclear transcription assays showed that CD45 expression was controlled at the level of gene transcription. Namalwa Burkitt leukemia cells expressing the heterologous epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor protein tyrosine kinase were used to assess the specificity of CD45 PTPase activity. Co-clustering of CD45 and the EGF receptor with specific monoclonal antibodies failed to alter the EGF stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor. These studies indicate that CD45 increases during myeloid maturation, and the expression of the CD45 gene is controlled at the level of gene transcription. Preliminary studies suggest that CD45 does not alter the protein tyrosine kinase activity of the EGF receptor in intact cells, suggesting substrate specificity in vivo.","['Taetle, R', 'Ostergaard, H', 'Smedsrud, M', 'Trowbridge, I']","['Taetle R', 'Ostergaard H', 'Smedsrud M', 'Trowbridge I']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of California, San Diego.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Antigens, Differentiation/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'ErbB Receptors/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*physiology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/metabolism', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 Apr;5(4):309-14.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",['CD45'],,,"['CA-17733/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-32094/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-37641/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,

BFA is a fungal metabolite that disrupts intracellular membrane traffic at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi complex junction. In MEL cells, BFA inhibited the processing of the newly synthesized precursor, gPr90env, of the murine leukemia virus envelope protein, gp70, and curtailed the budding of virions into the culture medium by blocking the transport of this protein out of the ER. The block resulted in the intracellular accumulation of gPr90env and two putative products of its processing (78 and 66 kDa). The results of endoglycosidase (endo) H and D digestion of the viral glycoproteins in the presence and absence of BFA indicated that (i) there was no glycoprotein processing during the first approximately 2 h of the BFA block; (ii) active Golgi enzymes relocated to the ER in approximately 2 h during BFA treatment, resulting in the production of partially endo H-resistant forms of the spleen focus-forming virus glycoprotein, gp55 (in controls, this glycoprotein was generally retained in the ER as an endo H-sensitive entity); and (iii) proteolytic processing of gPr90env to gp70 occurred prior to the acquisition of endo H resistance and at approximately the same time as endo D sensitivity (i.e. in a cis Golgi compartment). In control cells, the spleen focus-forming virus glycoprotein, gp55, underwent turnover with a half-life of approximately 5 h. In contrast, its turnover was considerably slower during BFA treatment (t 1/2 = approximately 20 h), suggesting that transport of gp55 out of the ER was required for its degradation or that BFA afforded it protection from proteolysis within the ER.","['Ulmer, J B', 'Palade, G E']","['Ulmer JB', 'Palade GE']","['Department of Cell Biology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Brefeldin A', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cyclopentanes/*pharmacology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', 'Gene Products, env/*metabolism', 'Glycosylation', 'Golgi Apparatus/metabolism', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*drug effects', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*metabolism']",,1991/05/15 00:00,1991/05/15 00:01,['1991/05/15 00:00'],"['1991/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1991 May 15;266(14):9173-9.,"['0 (Cyclopentanes)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '20350-15-6 (Brefeldin A)']",['env'],['S0021-9258(18)31567-9 [pii]'],,['P01 CA 46128-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

The course of the feline disease is characterized by an age-dependent prodromal period during which a non-disease-specific, common form of proviral DNA is detected in bone marrow. Preceding clinical onset of immunodeficiency is production of high levels of specific, pathogenic variant genomes, primarily as unintegrated viral DNA, in bone marrow. Acute immunodeficiency syndrome (survival period approximately 3 months) is associated with a short prodromal period and appearance of a characteristic variant genome (variant A) that persists at high copy number as integrated and full-length unintegrated viral DNA in bone marrow. Chronic immunodeficiency syndrome (survival greater than 1 year) is marked by a longer prodromal period, a more gradual onset of severe clinical immunosuppression, and a predominance of other variant genomes that often contain substantial internal deletions. In both forms of the disease, tissue-specific replication of certain variant viruses is noted in the bone marrow, intestine, and lymph nodes. Evidence from in vitro and in vivo virus transmission studies indicates that the appearance of FeLV-FAIDS variant viruses reflects differential replication of viral genomes pre-existing in the inoculum rather than rapid de novo evolution of new variants within each animal. These results demonstrate that retrovirus-induced immunodeficiency disease in cats can be associated with and prefigured by the amplified replication of specific viral variants in target tissues.","['Mullins, J I', 'Hoover, E A', 'Quackenbush, S L', 'Donahue, P R']","['Mullins JI', 'Hoover EA', 'Quackenbush SL', 'Donahue PR']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, California 94305-5402.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr (1988),Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes,8812597,IM,,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/microbiology', 'Cats', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Feline Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/complications/*microbiology', 'Genes, Viral', 'Genetic Variation', 'Intestines/microbiology', 'Leukemia/microbiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics/physiology', 'Lymph Nodes/microbiology', 'Lymphoma/microbiology', 'Opportunistic Infections/complications', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Virus Replication']",,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr (1988). 1991;4(6):547-57.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,,"['CA01058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA3216/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA34975/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,['J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr 1991;4(9):925'],,,,,,

Since this receptor has been shown to be involved with growth and differentiation of myeloid cells in vitro, and since recent clinical studies have reported that tretinoin (all-trans-retinoic acid) induces complete remission in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia we studied the effects of tretinoin on cellular maturation and molecular abnormalities in patients undergoing the induction of remission with this agent. RESULTS: Eleven patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia were treated with tretinoin administered orally at a dose of 45 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day. Nine of the 11 patients entered complete remission. In two patients, complete remission was preceded by striking leukocytosis that then resolved despite continued drug treatment. Serial studies of cellular morphologic features, cell-surface immunophenotypic analysis, and fluorescence in situ hybridization with a chromosome 17 probe revealed that clinical response was associated with maturation of the leukemic clone. All patients who responded to treatment who were tested by Northern blot analysis had expression of aberrant RAR-alpha. As patients entered complete remission, the expression of the abnormal RAR-alpha message decreased markedly; however, it was still detectable in several patients after complete morphologic and cytogenetic remission had been achieved. CONCLUSIONS: Tretinoin is a safe and highly effective agent for inducing complete remission in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Clinical response to this agent is associated with leukemic-cell differentiation and is linked to the expression of an aberrant RAR-alpha nuclear receptor. Molecular detection of the aberrant receptor may serve as a useful marker for residual leukemia in patients with this disease.","['Warrell, R P Jr', 'Frankel, S R', 'Miller, W H Jr', 'Scheinberg, D A', 'Itri, L M', 'Hittelman, W N', 'Vyas, R', 'Andreeff, M', 'Tafuri, A', 'Jakubowski, A']","['Warrell RP Jr', 'Frankel SR', 'Miller WH Jr', 'Scheinberg DA', 'Itri LM', 'Hittelman WN', 'Vyas R', 'Andreeff M', 'Tafuri A', 'Jakubowski A', 'et al.']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,IM,,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Carrier Proteins/drug effects', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid', 'Remission Induction', 'Tretinoin/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",,1991/05/26 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1991/05/26 19:15'],"['1991/05/26 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1991/05/26 19:15 [entrez]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1991 May 16;324(20):1385-93. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199105163242002.,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,['10.1056/NEJM199105163242002 [doi]'],,"['CA-09207-14/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'FD-R-000674/FD/FDA HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

The lines carried the same ring chromosome 15 as the leukemia cells in vivo and were similarly trisomic for chromosome 12. They all showed the same JH rearrangement, indicating that they had arisen from the same B-cell progenitor. They also had the same single EBV-terminal repeat (TR), indicating that they had been generated by a single EBV infection event. It may be surmised that a single CLL cell had been infected by EBV in vivo and established itself subsequently as a subclone within the CLL population. This subpopulation persists in vivo but does not appear to expand with time. After explantation, it transforms into lymphoblastoid cells and proliferates selectively as immortalized lines. The leukemia-representative CLL lines were phenotypically indistinguishable from the B95-8 virus-transformed normal diploid cells of the patient, established in parallel by in vitro infection. They grew as typical LCL clusters and expressed the same B-cell activation markers. The methylation status of EBV-DNA was different in the CLL lines and the B95-8-virus-transformed LCLs. When Hpall- and Mspl- digested DNA was probed with BamHI C, E, H and W fragments, the CLL lines showed a mixture of methylated and unmethylated restriction fragments as in certain EBV-carrying Burkitt lymphoma (BL) lines. In contrast, the EBV-DNA of B95-8 virus-transformed normal diploid cells was completely unmethylated, as in other LCLs.","['Lewin, N', 'Minarovits, J', 'Weber, G', 'Ehlin-Henriksson, B', 'Wen, T', 'Mellstedt, H', 'Klein, G', 'Klein, E']","['Lewin N', 'Minarovits J', 'Weber G', 'Ehlin-Henriksson B', 'Wen T', 'Mellstedt H', 'Klein G', 'Klein E']","['Dept. of Tumor Biology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular/methods', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens', '*Genes, Viral', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/microbiology', 'Methylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/microbiology', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Restriction Mapping']",,1991/04/22 00:00,1991/04/22 00:01,['1991/04/22 00:00'],"['1991/04/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/22 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/22 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1991 Apr 22;48(1):62-6. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910480112.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens)']",,['10.1002/ijc.2910480112 [doi]'],,['5 R 01 CA 30264/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

The technique uses a single pair of 'consensus' primers to amplify rearrangements involving the V gamma I subgroup genes, which are common in malignant cells from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. Using this method we were able to detect rearrangements in the TCRG locus in disease cells from patients with T-cell ALL (12 of 12), common ALL (10 of 14), and Null cell ALL (2 of 2) at presentation. Monoallelic and biallelic rearrangements involving V gamma I subgroup genes were identified by restriction analysis of PCR products from DNA samples from a T-cell leukemic cell line, T-cell clones, and disease cells from patients with ALL of T-and B-cell lineage at presentation. These results confirmed the presence of cell clones within the presentation samples and, in one case, confirmed the persistence of the original malignant cell clone at relapse. This is a rapid and specific method for the detection and characterization of rearrangements of the TCRG locus without recourse to Southern blotting. Therefore, the PCR technique described herein can provide the basis for the study of clonal evolution and minimal residual disease on a high proportion of patients with ALL.","['Taylor, J J', 'Rowe, D', 'Williamson, I K', 'Christmas, S E', 'Proctor, S J', 'Middleton, P G']","['Taylor JJ', 'Rowe D', 'Williamson IK', 'Christmas SE', 'Proctor SJ', 'Middleton PG']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Laboratory, Medical School, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Alleles', 'Base Sequence', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Deoxyribonuclease EcoRI', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*immunology', 'Restriction Mapping']",,1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1991 May 1;77(9):1989-95.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (Deoxyribonuclease EcoRI)']",,['S0006-4971(20)82418-5 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In a prospective study of 90 consecutive untreated patients with newly diagnosed Hodgkin's disease who were treated according to the protocols of the German Hodgkin Study group, 22% had detectable levels of sCD30 in their serum. sCD30 was only detected in patients with B symptoms (20 of 44 or 45%), and maximum sCD30 levels (88 U/mL) were found in stage IVB. Of 87 patients evaluable for response, sCD30+ patients had significantly lower rates of complete remission (9 of 20 or 45% v 60 of 67 or 90%; P less than .001) and higher rates of progressive disease (9 of 20 or 45% v 6 of 67 or 9%; P less than .001) than CD30+ patients. Similarly, freedom from treatment failure curves were significantly worse for CD30+ patients (P = .0003). sCD30 disappeared after successful treatment, but increased in patients with progressive disease. It was never detected in patients in complete remission or in healthy controls. We conclude that sCD30 is a valuable marker for disease activity and has prognostic significance in Hodgkin's disease.","['Gause, A', 'Pohl, C', 'Tschiersch, A', 'Da Costa, L', 'Jung, W', 'Diehl, V', 'Hasenclever, D', 'Pfreundschuh, M']","['Gause A', 'Pohl C', 'Tschiersch A', 'Da Costa L', 'Jung W', 'Diehl V', 'Hasenclever D', 'Pfreundschuh M']","['Medizinische Klinik I, University of the Saarland, Homburg/Sarr, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/blood', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*blood', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*blood', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Hodgkin Disease/*immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Ki-1 Antigen', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction']",,1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1991 May 1;77(9):1983-8.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Ki-1 Antigen)']",,['S0006-4971(20)82417-3 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence for two topoisomerase II directed drug actions.,4048-55,"HL-60/AMSA is a human leukemia cell line that is 50-100-fold more resistant than its drug-sensitive HL-60 parent line to the cytotoxic actions of the DNA intercalator amsacrine (m-AMSA). HL-60/AMSA topoisomerase II is also resistant to the inhibitory actions of m-AMSA. HL-60/AMSA cells and topoisomerase II are cross-resistant to anthracycline and ellipticine intercalators but relatively sensitive to the nonintercalating topoisomerase II reactive epipodophyllotoxin etoposide. We now demonstrate that HL-60/AMSA and its topoisomerase II are cross-resistant to the DNA intercalators mitoxantrone and amonafide, thus strongly indicating that HL-60/AMSA and its topoisomerase II are resistant to topoisomerase II reactive intercalators but not to nonintercalators. At high concentrations, mitoxantrone and amonafide were also found to inhibit their own, m-AMSA's, and etoposide's abilities to stabilize topoisomerase II-DNA complexes. This appears to be due to the ability of these concentrations of mitoxantrone and amonafide to inhibit topoisomerase II mediated DNA strand passage at a point in the topoisomerization cycle prior to the acquisition of the enzyme-DNA configuration that yields DNA cleavage and topoisomerase II-DNA cross-links. In addition, amonafide can inhibit the cytotoxic actions of m-AMSA and etoposide. Taken together, these results suggest that the cytotoxicity of m-AMSA and etoposide is initiated primarily by the stabilization of the topoisomerase II-DNA complex. Other topoisomerase II reactive drugs may inhibit the enzyme at other steps in the topoisomerization cycle, particularly at elevated concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Zwelling, L A', 'Mayes, J', 'Hinds, M', 'Chan, D', 'Altschuler, E', 'Carroll, B', 'Parker, E', 'Deisseroth, K', 'Radcliffe, A', 'Seligman, M']","['Zwelling LA', 'Mayes J', 'Hinds M', 'Chan D', 'Altschuler E', 'Carroll B', 'Parker E', 'Deisseroth K', 'Radcliffe A', 'Seligman M', 'et al.']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Texas M.

The non lytic concentration of 50 microM oleate induced a three-fold increase in [3H]choline incorporation into phosphatidylcholine. This stimulation was accompanied by a translocation of the CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.15) from cytosol to membranes. By contrast, the ether-lipid AMGPC inhibited [3H]choline incorporation into phosphatidylcholine by 60% at 10 microM. AMGPC had no effect on choline kinase or choline phosphotransferase activities. When AMGPC was added separately to an homogenate, a particulate or a cytosolic fraction, cytidylyltransferase inhibition was observed only in the homogenate. However on particulates recovered from homogenates treated with increasing concentrations of AMGPC, membranous cytidylyltransferase activity decreased dose-dependently. Thus AMGPC had no effect on cytidylyltransferase activity itself but inhibited its translocation from cytosol to membrane. At variance with the well-established positive effect on cytidylyltransferase translocation induced by fatty acids, this is the first demonstration that AMGPC can inhibit cytidylyltransferase translocation in cell-free system.","['Tronchere, H', 'Terce, F', 'Record, M', 'Ribbes, G', 'Chap, H']","['Tronchere H', 'Terce F', 'Record M', 'Ribbes G', 'Chap H']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Unite 326, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Cell-Free System', 'Choline/metabolism', 'Choline-Phosphate Cytidylyltransferase', 'Cytosol/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Nucleotidyltransferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oleic Acid', 'Oleic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylcholines/biosynthesis', 'Phospholipid Ethers/*pharmacology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*drug effects']",,1991/04/15 00:00,1991/04/15 00:01,['1991/04/15 00:00'],"['1991/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1991 Apr 15;176(1):157-65. doi: 10.1016/0006-291x(91)90903-k.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oleic Acids)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '2UMI9U37CP (Oleic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.15 (Choline-Phosphate Cytidylyltransferase)', 'N91BDP6H0X (Choline)']",,"['0006-291X(91)90903-K [pii]', '10.1016/0006-291x(91)90903-k [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

This response was markedly inhibited by a monoclonal antibody specific for the MuLV gag-encoded p30 antigen.","['Hugin, A W', 'Vacchio, M S', 'Morse, H C 3rd']","['Hugin AW', 'Vacchio MS', 'Morse HC 3rd']","['Laboratory of Immunopathology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/genetics/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics', 'HIV-1/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/immunology/*microbiology', 'Mutation', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/immunology', 'Virus Replication/genetics']",,1991/04/19 00:00,1991/04/19 00:01,['1991/04/19 00:00'],"['1991/04/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/19 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/19 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Science. 1991 Apr 19;252(5004):424-7. doi: 10.1126/science.1850169.,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",['gag'],['10.1126/science.1850169 [doi]'],,['N01-AI-72622/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Also a higher incidence of double rearrangements in My+ALL was found as compared with My-ALL (43% vs 29%). This difference was more evident when only B-lineage ALL was considered (50% in My+ patients vs 24% in My- patients). However the difference is not statistically significant yet possibly due to the small number of patients in the study. Further studies on more patients are needed to confirm this. In My-B-lineage ALL, rearrangements of TCR beta chain gene were restricted to certain subgroups (Groups III & IV) of patients who expressed CD10 surface antigens but lacked cytoplasmic Ig.

However, the presence of a persistent antiviral antibody response in infected animals suggests that some degree of virus expression must occur in vivo. The purpose of this study was to determine whether BLV RNA species could be detected by using the polymerase chain reaction in normal or neoplastic lymphoid cells freshly isolated from naturally or experimentally BLV-infected cattle and sheep, respectively. Primers designed to detect a 2.1-kb doubly spliced BLV tax/rex-specific mRNA were used to amplify cDNA copies of RNA derived from infected animals. The amplified viral product was then detected with a radiolabeled BLV tax/rex-specific probe. BLV-specific RNA was detected readily in freshly isolated peripheral blood leukocytes derived from BLV-seropositive cattle or sheep with persistent lymphocytosis and less readily in peripheral blood leukocytes from BLV-seropositive but hematologically normal animals. BLV-specific RNA was also detected in fresh samples of BLV-induced lymphosarcomas. Normal and neoplastic lymphoid cells from BLV-seronegative animals were uniformly negative under similar conditions. These primers also amplified the same viral product from genomic DNA derived from BLV-seropositive animals, providing further evidence for in vivo transcription and suggesting that BLV RNA-dependent DNA polymerase is capable of reverse transcribing the 2.1-kb mRNA in vivo. The demonstration of transcriptional products of BLV in vivo proves that viral latency in BLV infection is incomplete.","['Jensen, W A', 'Rovnak, J', 'Cockerell, G L']","['Jensen WA', 'Rovnak J', 'Cockerell GL']","['Department of Pathology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cattle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics/isolation & purification', '*Genes, pX', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics/immunology', 'Lymphocytes', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Sheep', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1991 May;65(5):2484-90. doi: 10.1128/JVI.65.5.2484-2490.1991.,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",,['10.1128/JVI.65.5.2484-2490.1991 [doi]'],PMC240603,"['AI-00924/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-43728/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that gp70 encoded by either the Friend or Moloney MCF virus also binds to the erythropoietin receptor and that coexpression of the receptor and gp70 in an interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent cell line can activate IL-3-independent growth. Furthermore, when the cDNA for the human IL-2 receptor beta chain, which is related by sequence to the erythropoietin receptor, was introduced into this cell line, it became growth factor independent after infection either with SFFV or with one of the two MCF viruses but not with an ecotropic virus.

To understand this phenomenon in molecular terms, it is important to obtain active, cell-free preparations. In extensive preliminary studies, we could not demonstrate Fc epsilon RI-mediated activation of PI-PLC in plasma membranes prepared by conventional methods from rat basophilic leukemia cells. We now report a stepwise approach involving preparation of cytoplasts from such cells and then hypotonic lysis of the cytoplasts to obtain active membrane vesicles. These membranes, best described as ""ghosts,"" appear to reseal after losing greater than 90% of their soluble, cytoplasmic components and contain receptors that when aggregated, activate PI-PLC to hydrolyze endogenous phospholipids. Per unit of plasma membrane, the ghosts retain approximately 25% of Fc epsilon RI-mediated stimulation of PI-PLC relative to the cells. This activity requires ATP, magnesium, phosphoenolpyruvate, and, to a limited degree, calcium.

Using primer extension analysis, we identified two distinct transcriptional start sites, which were located 2 base pairs apart in anemic spleens, fetal liver, Friend-induced tumoral spleens, and mouse erythro-leukemia cells. In contrast, transcription was initiated 37 base pairs upstream of the normal cap sites in T3Cl-2, a Friend virus-induced murine erythroleukemia cell line. Also, the erythropoietin receptor mRNA in T3Cl-2 was overexpressed when compared with other erythroleukemia cell lines. We found that abnormal transcription occurring in T3Cl-2 cells resulted from an erythropoietin receptor gene alteration. Indeed, one erythropoietin receptor allele was rearranged by insertion of a spleen focus-forming virus long terminal repeat within the noncoding region of the first exon, 45 bases upstream of the ATG initiation codon and in the same 5'----3' orientation. The transcription of the rearranged allele was shown to be directed from the long terminal repeat promoter, leading to a long terminal repeat-erythropoietin receptor fusion transcript, whereas the normal erythropoietin receptor allele was weakly transcribed. Such altered receptor gene activation may provide a positive pressure in the development of tumorigenic erythroleukemia.","['Lacombe, C', 'Chretien, S', 'Lemarchandel, V', 'Mayeux, P', 'Romeo, P H', 'Gisselbrecht, S', 'Cartron, J P']","['Lacombe C', 'Chretien S', 'Lemarchandel V', 'Mayeux P', 'Romeo PH', 'Gisselbrecht S', 'Cartron JP']","['Institut Cochin de Genetique Moleculaire, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U152, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/genetics/isolation & purification', '*DNA Transposable Elements', 'Erythropoietin/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', '*Genes', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Organ Specificity', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA Probes', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*genetics', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation']",,1991/04/15 00:00,1991/04/15 00:01,['1991/04/15 00:00'],"['1991/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1991 Apr 15;266(11):6952-6.,"['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (RNA Probes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,['S0021-9258(20)89595-7 [pii]'],,,,,['GENBANK/M62360'],,,,,,,

Conversion of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity to NAD-glycohydrolase during retinoic acid-induced differentiation of HL60 cells.,1-8,"Two enzymatic activities of the nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase or transferase (ADPRT, EC 2.4.2.30), a DNA-associating abundant nuclear protein with multiple molecular activities, have been determined in HL60 cells prior to and after their exposure to 1 microM retinoic acid, which results in the induction of differentiation to mature granulocytes in 4-5 days. The cellular concentration of immunoreactive ADPRT protein molecules in differentiated granulocytes remained unchanged compared to that in HL60 cells prior to retinoic acid addition (3.17 +/- 1.05 ng/10(5) cells), as did the apparent activity of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase of nuclei. On the other hand, the poly(ADP-ribose) synthesizing capacity of permeabilized cells or isolated nuclei decreased precipitously upon retinoic acid-induced differentiation, whereas the NAD glycohydrolase activity of nuclei significantly increased. The nuclear NAD glycohydrolase activity was identified as an ADPRT-catalyzed enzymatic activity by its unreactivity toward ethenoadenine NAD as a substrate added to nuclei or to purified ADPRT. During the decrease in in vitro poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity of nuclei following retinoic acid treatment, the quantity of endogenously poly(ADP-ribosylated) ADPRT significantly increased, as determined by chromatographic isolation of this modified protein by the boronate affinity technique, followed by gel electrophoresis and immunotransblot. When homogenous isolated ADPRT was first ADP-ribosylated in vitro, it lost its capacity to catalyze further polymer synthesis, whereas the NAD glycohydrolase function of the automodified enzyme was greatly augmented. Since results of in vivo and in vitro experiments coincide, it appears that in retinoic acid-induced differentiated cells (granulocytes) the autopoly(ADP-ribosylated) ADPRT performs a predominantly, if not exclusively, NAD glycohydrolase function.","['Kirsten, E', 'Bauer, P I', 'Kun, E']","['Kirsten E', 'Bauer PI', 'Kun E']","['Laboratory for Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry, Romberg Tiburon Center for Environmental Studies, State University of San Francisco, California 94132.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Granulocytes/drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/enzymology/*pathology', 'NAD+ Nucleosidase/*metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology/pathology']",,1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1991 May;194(1):1-8. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(91)90122-b.,"['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (NAD+ Nucleosidase)']",,"['0014-4827(91)90122-B [pii]', '10.1016/0014-4827(91)90122-b [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Using the JH probe and several restriction enzymes, the authors also found evidence for a postrearrangement deletion of the heavy chain mu gene.

Analysis of this data base has yielded insights into the cross-resistance, collateral sensitivity, and mechanisms of resistance of P388/DDPt. P388/DDPt was cross-resistant or marginally cross-resistant to eight agents [carmethizole.HCl, rhizoxin, dibromodulcitol, spirohydantoin mustard, hepsulfam, arabinosyl-5-azacytosine (ara-AC), tiazofurin, and deoxyspergualin]. Of these eight agents, the latter six have entered various phases of clinical trials. For these trials, it may be important to exclude or to monitor with extra care patients who have previously been treated with cisplatin. P388/DDPt was collaterally sensitive to six agents [fludarabine phosphate (2-F-ara-AMP), amsacrine (AMSA), mitoxantrone, etoposide (VP-16), batracylin, and flavone acetic acid] and, possibly, to two others (merbarone and echinomycin). These observations of collateral sensitivity suggest that a combination of cisplatin plus any one of these drugs might exhibit therapeutic synergism. Therapeutic synergism has been observed in animal models for combinations of cisplatin plus VP-16, AMSA, or mitoxantrone. The observation of collateral sensitivity for P388/DDPt to four agents (AMSA, mitoxantrone, merbarone, and VP-16) that have been reported to interact with DNA topoisomerase II suggests the possible involvement of the latter in cisplatin resistance. Both the increased sensitivity of P388/DDPt to these agents and a portion of its resistance to cisplatin could be the result of an increase in DNA topoisomerase II activity.","['Waud, W R', 'Harrison, S D Jr', 'Gilbert, K S', 'Laster, W R Jr', 'Griswold, D P Jr']","['Waud WR', 'Harrison SD Jr', 'Gilbert KS', 'Laster WR Jr', 'Griswold DP Jr']","['Chemotherapy and Toxicology Research, Southern Research Institute, Birmingham, AL 35255-5305.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,,"['Amsacrine/administration & dosage', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Synergism', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage']",,1991/01/11 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1991/01/11 19:15'],"['1991/01/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1991/01/11 19:15 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1991;27(6):456-63. doi: 10.1007/BF00685160.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,['10.1007/BF00685160 [doi]'],,['N01-CM-07315/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Selective ablation of these activated cells from peripheral blood lymphocytes may offer a a method of controlling allograft rejection. An immunotoxin was prepared from the monoclonal antibody (mAb) NDA 4, which recognizes a differentiation antigen (NDA 4) common to activated B and T cells. MAb NDA 4 was conjugated to the ribosome-inhibiting protein gelonin via a cleavable disulfide bond provided by a crosslinking reagent. The purified immunotoxin was evaluated for in vitro cytotoxicity on NDA 4 positive T and B cell lines. Conjugation of mAb NDA 4 to gelonin increased the in vitro cytotoxicity by a concentration factor of 1000, compared to gelonin alone. The specificity and saturability of mAb NDA 4 binding, as well as the number of antigenic sites per cell on resting versus activated T lymphocytes, were also evaluated. Resting T cells expressed 400-800 sites per cell. PHA-activated T cells and the MLA T cell leukemia expressed 10,000 to 80,000 sites per cell. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from allografted baboons in quiescence or undergoing rejection were compared for NDA 4 expression by flow cytometry. Lymphocytes obtained from baboons rejecting a heart allograft expressed NDA 4, whereas transplant recipients in quiescence showed no detectable NDA 4.

We describe two simple procedures for the rapid identification of certain structural features of glycolipid anchors in acetylcholinesterases (AChEs). 2. Treatment with alkaline hydroxylamine (that cleaves ester-linked acyl chains but not ether-linked alkyl chains) converts molecules possessing a diacylglycerol, but not those with an alkylacylglycerol, into hydrophilic derivatives. AChEs in human and bovine erythrocytes possess an alkylacylglycerol (Roberts et al., J. Biol. Chem. 263:18766-18775, 1988; Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 150:271-277, 1988) and are not converted to hydrophilic dimers by alkaline hydroxylamine. Amphiphilic dimers of AChE from Drosophila, from mouse erythrocytes, and from the human erythroleukaemia cell line K562 also resist the treatment with hydroxylamine and likely possess a terminal alkylacylglycerol. This indicates that the cellular pool of free glycolipids used as precursors of protein anchors is distinct from the pool of membrane phosphatidylinositols (which contain diacylglycerols). 3. Pretreatment with alkaline hydroxylamine is required to render the amphiphilic AChE from human erythrocytes susceptible to digestion by Bacillus thuringiensis phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) (Toutant et al., Eur. J. Biochem. 180:503-508, 1989). We show here that this is also the case for the AChE from mouse erythrocytes, which therefore likely possesses an additional acyl chain in the anchor that prevents the action of PI-PLC. 4. In two sublines of K562 cells (48 and 243), we observed that AChE either was directly susceptible to PI-PLC (243) or required a prior deacylation by alkaline hydroxylamine (48). This suggests that glycolipid anchors in AChE of K562-48 cells, but not those in AChE of K562-243 cells, contain the additional acylation demonstrated in AChE from human erythrocytes. These observations illustrate the cell specificity (and the lack of species-specificity) of the structure of glycolipid anchors.","['Toutant, J P', 'Krall, J A', 'Richards, M K', 'Rosenberry, T L']","['Toutant JP', 'Krall JA', 'Richards MK', 'Rosenberry TL']","['Department of Pharmacology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Mol Neurobiol,Cellular and molecular neurobiology,8200709,IM,,"['Acetylcholinesterase/*metabolism', 'Acylation', 'Animals', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry, Physical', 'Drosophila melanogaster/metabolism', 'Erythrocyte Membrane/drug effects/enzymology', 'Glycolipids/*analysis/physiology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxylamine', 'Hydroxylamines/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Organ Specificity', 'Phosphatidylinositol Diacylglycerol-Lyase', 'Phosphoinositide Phospholipase C', 'Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Protein Conformation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/enzymology']",,1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Mol Neurobiol. 1991 Feb;11(1):219-30. doi: 10.1007/BF00712811.,"['0 (Glycolipids)', '0 (Hydroxylamines)', '2FP81O2L9Z (Hydroxylamine)', 'EC 3.1.1.7 (Acetylcholinesterase)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.4.11 (Phosphoinositide Phospholipase C)', 'EC 4.6.1.13 (Phosphatidylinositol Diacylglycerol-Lyase)']",,['10.1007/BF00712811 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Peptides with sequences spanning known cleavage sites in viral polyproteins of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) and avian leukemia viruses, as well as in BSA and HSA, were synthesized, and the rate of their cleavage by the MAV proteinase was compared. Synthetic peptides require for successful cleavage at least 4 residues at the N-terminal side and 3 residues at the C-terminal side. The proteinase shows a preference for hydrophobic residues with bulky side chains (Met, Tyr, Phe) in P3, although Arg and Gln can also be accepted. Small hydrophobic residues are required in P2 and P2', and large hydrophobic residues (Tyr, Met, Phe/p-nitro-Phe) are preferred in both P1 and P1'. The difference between the specificity of the p15 proteinase and that of the HIV-1 proteinase mostly pertains to position P2' of the substrate, where bulkier side chains are accepted by the HIV-1 proteinase (Richards et al., 1990). A good chromogenic substrate for the MAV and RSV proteinases was developed and used to further characterize the MAV proteinase activity with respect to ionic strength and pH. The activity of the proteinase is strongly dependent on ionic strength and pH. Both the kcat and Km values contribute to a higher cleavage efficiency at higher salt concentrations and show a bell-shaped pH dependence curve with a sharp maximum at pH 5.5 (kcat) and 6.5 (Km).","['Strop, P', 'Konvalinka, J', 'Stys, D', 'Pavlickova, L', 'Blaha, I', 'Velek, J', 'Travnicek, M', 'Kostka, V', 'Sedlacek, J']","['Strop P', 'Konvalinka J', 'Stys D', 'Pavlickova L', 'Blaha I', 'Velek J', 'Travnicek M', 'Kostka V', 'Sedlacek J']","['Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Czechoslovak Academy of Science, Prague.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', '*Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/genetics', 'Avian Myeloblastosis Virus/*enzymology', 'Avian Sarcoma Viruses/genetics', 'Binding Sites', 'Endopeptidases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genes, gag', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Hydrolysis', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Hydrolases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*metabolism', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/metabolism', 'Sodium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Substrate Specificity']",,1991/04/09 00:00,1991/04/09 00:01,['1991/04/09 00:00'],"['1991/04/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/09 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1991 Apr 9;30(14):3437-43. doi: 10.1021/bi00228a013.,"['0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', '451W47IQ8X (Sodium Chloride)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.4.23.- (Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.23.- (protease p15)']",,['10.1021/bi00228a013 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

After 16 weeks of HTLV-I infection, expression of T cell receptor-CD3 complex on HTLV-I-infected clone cells became decreased. This phenomenon is similar to the effect of HTLV-I infection on CD4+ cytotoxic T cells as we previously reported, and suggests that there are common mechanisms of declined cytotoxic activity mediated by both CD4+ and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells following infection with HTLV-I.

We have previously isolated and characterized a CPT-resistant topoisomerase I isolated from a CPT-resistant human leukemia cell line, CPT-K5. cDNA clones of topoisomerase I were isolated from the CPT-resistant and the parental CPT-sensitive cell lines, respectively. Sequencing of the clones identified two mutations in the cDNA isolated from the resistant cells, which cause amino acid changes from aspartic acid to glycine at residues 533 and 583 of the parental topoisomerase I. When the CPT-K5 topoisomerase I was expressed in E. coli as a fusion protein with Staphylococcal Protein A fragment, the activity was resistant to CPT at a dose level up to 125 microM, whereas the parental fusion protein was sensitive to CPT as low as 1 microM.

These results indicate that either or both of the two amino acid changes identified in the mutant enzyme is responsible for the resistance to CPT.","['Tamura, H', 'Kohchi, C', 'Yamada, R', 'Ikeda, T', 'Koiwai, O', 'Patterson, E', 'Keene, J D', 'Okada, K', 'Kjeldsen, E', 'Nishikawa, K']","['Tamura H', 'Kohchi C', 'Yamada R', 'Ikeda T', 'Koiwai O', 'Patterson E', 'Keene JD', 'Okada K', 'Kjeldsen E', 'Nishikawa K', 'et al.']","['Department of Hygienic Chemistry, Meiji College of Pharmacy, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Camptothecin/*pharmacology', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/drug effects/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation/genetics', 'Protein Conformation', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1991/01/11 00:00,1991/01/11 00:01,['1991/01/11 00:00'],"['1991/01/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/11 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1991 Jan 11;19(1):69-75. doi: 10.1093/nar/19.1.69.,"['0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",,['10.1093/nar/19.1.69 [doi]'],PMC333535,,,,,,,,,,,

On admission to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, between 1979 and 1986 a questionnaire was administered to 1,270 mothers of patients diagnosed with childhood cancer. Approximately one-half of the children had acute leukemias (n = 629); the remainder had lymphomas (n = 237) or solid tumors (n = 404). Responses to questions regarding the patients' and parents' environmental and medical histories were compared across nine diagnostic categories. Only 5 of 232 variables remained nominally statistically significant (P less than 0.05) after adjusting for confounding by patient or maternal age, year of birth or diagnosis, patient's race, and social class. The variables identified were length of time the patient was breast-fed (chi 2 = 16.1, P = 0.04); having a garden with fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides (chi 2 = 17.2, P = 0.03); maternal use of sex hormones during the year before the patient's birth (chi 2 = 18.2, P = 0.02); maternal cigarette consumption (chi 2 = 18.0, P = 0.02); and patient contact with persons with cancer (chi 2 = 20.7, P = 0.01). Despite the large number of patients studied, we identified fewer significant variables than would be expected, on the average, under the null hypothesis.

The problem, however, is that there has been no guarantee to endorse the simplification. To study this problem, we first evaluated the robustness of the ML method in the estimation of molecular trees against different nucleotide substitution patterns, including Jukes and Cantor's, the simplest ever proposed. Namely, we conducted computer simulations in which we could set up various evolutionary models of a hypothetical gene, and define a true tree to which an estimated tree by the ML method was to be compared. The results show that topology estimation by the ML method is considerably robust against different ratios of transitions to transversions and different GC contents, but branch length estimation is not so. The ML tree estimation based on Jukes and Cantor's model is also revealed to be resistant to GC content, but rather sensitive to the ratio of transitions to transversions. We then applied the ML method with different substitution patterns to nucleotide sequence data on tax gene from T-cell leukemia viruses whose evolutionary process must have been more complicated than that of the hypothetical gene. The results are in accordance with those from the simulation study, showing that Jukes and Cantor's model is as useful as a more complicated one for making inferences about molecular phylogeny of the viruses.","['Fukami-Kobayashi, K', 'Tateno, Y']","['Fukami-Kobayashi K', 'Tateno Y']","['Ochanomizu University, Otsuka, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Mol Evol,Journal of molecular evolution,0360051,IM,,"['Base Composition', 'Computer Simulation', 'Deltaretrovirus/*genetics', '*Genes, pX', 'Models, Genetic', '*Mutation', '*Phylogeny']",,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Mol Evol. 1991 Jan;32(1):79-91. doi: 10.1007/BF02099932.,,,['10.1007/BF02099932 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Differentiation was induced by 1 mumol/L arabinocytosine (Ara-C), 40 mumol/L tiazofurin, 1 mumol/L aphidicolin, or 1 mumol/L hydroxyurea, and was monitored daily by the appearance of hemoglobin in an increasing proportion of cells. Pretreatment for 48 hours with 2.4 x 10(-8) mol/L 1,25(OH)2D3, a concentration that is also optimal for induction of monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells, reproducibly inhibited subsequent induction of erythroid differentiation by all of the above inducers, and modified the morphologic changes that Ara-C produced in these cells. The inhibition of hemoglobinization was approximately 50% irrespective of the degree of differentiation produced by the various inducers, but growth inhibition associated with exposure to the inducers was not affected by 1,25(OH)2D3. Similar inhibition of differentiation by 1,25(OH)2D3 was observed in mouse erythroleukemia cells MEL-D1B treated with 5 mmol/L hexamethylenebisacetamide. The inhibitory effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 on erythroid differentiation of K562 cells was abrogated by cyclohexamide (20 micrograms/mL), an inhibitor of protein synthesis. The mRNA for 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor (VDR) was detected in K562 cells, and was downregulated by a 96-hour exposure to 1,25(OH)2D3 or a 48-hour exposure to Ara-C. The presence of VDR mRNA suggests a physiologic role for 1,25(OH)2D3 in K562 cells that are precursors of erythroid cells. This role is perhaps to shift the pathways of differentiation from the erythroid to the monocytic lineage.","['Moore, D C', 'Carter, D L', 'Bhandal, A K', 'Studzinski, G P']","['Moore DC', 'Carter DL', 'Bhandal AK', 'Studzinski GP']","['UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School, Newark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Animals', 'Calcitriol/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/genetics', 'Receptors, Calcitriol', 'Receptors, Steroid/drug effects/genetics', 'Ribavirin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",,1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1991 Apr 1;77(7):1452-61.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']",,['S0006-4971(20)83283-2 [pii]'],,"['CA 44722-02S2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 44722-3/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Two to 3 weeks before the onset of anemia, CFU-E become undetectable in marrow cultures while earlier erythroid progenitors (BFU-E) persist, suggesting that FeLV-C/Sarma (presumably via its envelope glycoprotein gp70) inhibits the differentiation of BFU-E to CFU-E in vivo. To correlate in vitro observations with the progression of disease, prospective studies were performed in six cats. These studies showed that at the time that the frequencies of CFU-E decreased in marrow cultures, BFU-E no longer responded to hematopoietic growth factor(s), although the responses of CFU-GM were unchanged. In further studies, anemic cats received suramin, a reverse-transcriptase inhibitor with other diverse effects. Within 4 to 14 days, erythropoiesis improved and up to 1,616 CFU-E were detected per 10(5) marrow mononuclear cells. However, progenitor cells remained infected, suggesting that suramin modulated erythroid differentiation without inhibiting progenitor infection. These observations led to the hypothesis that the gp70 of FeLV-C/Sarma impairs BFU-E differentiation by interference with ligand/receptor interactions or signal transduction pathways unique to erythroid cells. Understanding this mechanism should provide insights into the interactions controlling early erythropoiesis.","['Abkowitz, J L']",['Abkowitz JL'],"['Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cats', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Erythrocytes/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Red-Cell Aplasia, Pure/*blood/drug therapy/microbiology/pathology', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Suramin/*therapeutic use', 'Transferrin/genetics', 'Viral Proteins/genetics']",,1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1991 Apr 1;77(7):1442-51.,"['0 (Transferrin)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '6032D45BEM (Suramin)']",,['S0006-4971(20)83282-0 [pii]'],,['HL31823/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Measurement of steady-state levels of mRNA for c-myc and c-fos showed that in sublines of HL-60 cells which respond rapidly to 1,25(OH)2D3, elevation of VDR mRNA is evident prior to the changes in proto-oncogene expression.

In the present study, we examined the effects of disulfiram (DSF) in combination with ifosfamide (IFX). DSF prevented IFX-induced bladder damage in a dose-dependent manner in tumour-free ddY mice when orally administered simultaneously with antitumour agent, but failed to diminish the acute lethal toxicity or leukocytotoxicity of IFX. Diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC) prevented IFX-induced bladder damage when administered simultaneously with IFX or 1 to 5 hr afterwards. The antitumour activity of IFX in ddY-mice inoculated with Sarcoma 180 or in C57BL/6J mice inoculated with EL-4 leukaemia was not impaired when it was given simultaneously with DSF or 3 hr before DDTC. Thus, neither DSF nor DDTC impaired the antitumour effect of IFX and both diminished its adverse effects. The bladder protection of DSF and DDTC appeared resulted from adduct formation with acrolein and not from inhibition of the metabolic activation of IFX.","['Ishikawa, M', 'Takayanagi, Y', 'Sasaki, K']","['Ishikawa M', 'Takayanagi Y', 'Sasaki K']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Tohoku College of Pharmacy, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Denmark,Pharmacol Toxicol,Pharmacology & toxicology,8702180,IM,,"['Animals', 'Disulfiram/*pharmacology', 'Ditiocarb/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Ifosfamide/antagonists & inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Leukopenia/chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Urinary Bladder/*drug effects']",,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pharmacol Toxicol. 1991 Jan;68(1):21-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0773.1991.tb01202.x.,"['99Z2744345 (Ditiocarb)', 'TR3MLJ1UAI (Disulfiram)', 'UM20QQM95Y (Ifosfamide)']",,['10.1111/j.1600-0773.1991.tb01202.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here that pretreatment of erythropoietin-responsive murine erythroleukemia cells with chemical inducers resulted in a striking increase in erythropoietin-specific hemoglobinization. This amplification of the erythropoietin biologic response was accompanied by the induction of a new population of high-density receptors (approximately 20,000 per cell) exhibiting marked positive cooperativity. Erythropoietin binding to new receptors displayed a convex upward Scatchard plot and a Hill coefficient (nH) of 6.75. Measurement of erythropoietin receptor mRNA demonstrated an initial decrease in receptor transcript followed by an approximately 2- to 3-fold increase after 24-48 hr. This increase in receptor message does not appear to account for the magnitude of the receptor up-regulation by dimethyl sulfoxide. We propose that this positive cooperativity reflects the interaction (clustering) of receptors, presumably through the formation of homooligomers or heterooligomers, and that this receptor interaction may amplify the erythropoietin signal transduction pathway.","['Yonekura, S', 'Chern, Y', 'Donahue, K A', 'Feldman, L', 'Vanasse, G J', 'Sytkowski, A J']","['Yonekura S', 'Chern Y', 'Donahue KA', 'Feldman L', 'Vanasse GJ', 'Sytkowski AJ']","['Laboratory for Cell and Molecular Biology, New England Deaconess Hospital, Boston, MA 02215.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Erythropoietin/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*biosynthesis/drug effects/genetics', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism']",,1991/03/15 00:00,1991/03/15 00:01,['1991/03/15 00:00'],"['1991/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1991 Mar 15;88(6):2535-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.88.6.2535.,"['0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,['10.1073/pnas.88.6.2535 [doi]'],PMC51267,['R01 DK38841/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a controlled trial of ganciclovir in recipients of bone marrow transplants who had asymptomatic pulmonary CMV infection. We also sought to identify risk factors for the development of CMV interstitial pneumonia. METHODS: After bone marrow transplantation, 104 patients who had no evidence of respiratory disease underwent routine bronchoalveolar lavage on day 35. The 40 patients who had positive cultures for CMV were randomly assigned to either prophylactic ganciclovir or observation alone. Ganciclovir (5 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously) was given twice daily for two weeks and then five times per week until day 120. RESULTS: Of the 20 culture-positive patients who received prophylactic ganciclovir, 5 (25 percent) died or had CMV pneumonia before day 120, as compared with 14 of the 20 culture-positive control patients (70 percent) who were not treated prophylactically (relative risk, 0.36; P = 0.01). No patient who received the full course of ganciclovir prophylaxis went on to have CMV interstitial pneumonia. Four patients treated with ganciclovir had maximal serum creatinine levels greater than or equal to 221 mumol per liter (2.5 mg per deciliter), as compared with none of the controls (P = 0.029). Of the 55 CMV-negative patients who could be evaluated, 12 (22 percent) had CMV pneumonia--a significantly lower rate than in the untreated CMV-positive control patients (relative risk, 0.33; P = 0.003). The strongest predictors of CMV pneumonia were a lavage-fluid culture that was positive for CMV and a CMV-positive blood culture, both from specimens obtained on day 35. CONCLUSION: In recipients of allogeneic bone marrow, asymptomatic CMV infection of the lung is a major risk factor for subsequent CMV interstitial pneumonia. Prophylactic ganciclovir is effective in preventing the development of CMV interstitial pneumonia in patients with asymptomatic infection.","['Schmidt, G M', 'Horak, D A', 'Niland, J C', 'Duncan, S R', 'Forman, S J', 'Zaia, J A']","['Schmidt GM', 'Horak DA', 'Niland JC', 'Duncan SR', 'Forman SJ', 'Zaia JA']","['Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, Calif. 91010.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,IM,['N Engl J Med. 1991 Apr 11;324(15):1057-9.

In murine leukemias, expression of the Evi-1 gene is associated with retroviral insertions either in the Evi-1 locus, which is immediately 5' of the coding region of the gene, or in the genetically linked Cb-1/fim-3 locus. In these studies, we demonstrate by chromosomal walking and pulse field electrophoresis that the Cb-1/fim-3 locus is located 90 kb 5' of the Evi-1 locus. Primary structure analysis of Evi-1 cDNA clones from a Cb-1/fim-3 rearranged cell line (DA-3) demonstrates that transcription initiates 5' of the Evi-1 locus and that the first noncoding exon of the gene is 681 bp larger than previously defined. S1 nuclease protection studies reveal multiple transcription initiation sites within this region. Comparable transcriptional initiation sites were identified in RNA from kidney and ovary, in which the gene is normally expressed, suggesting that retroviral insertions in the Cb-1/fim-3 locus activate transcription from the normal promoter. In one myeloid cell line (DA-3), a single long terminal repeat (LTR) is present in the Cb-1/fim-3 locus. No stable transcripts were detectable from this LTR. In cells with retroviral insertions in the Cb-1/fim-3 locus, one allele of the Evi-1 locus becomes hypermethylated in the 5' region of the gene. Together, these results are most consistent with an LTR-mediated, long-range cis activation of Evi-1 gene expression.","['Bartholomew, C', 'Ihle, J N']","['Bartholomew C', 'Ihle JN']","[""Department of Biochemistry, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosome Walking', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Restriction Mapping', '*Transcription Factors', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics']",,1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1991 Apr;11(4):1820-8. doi: 10.1128/mcb.11.4.1820-1828.1991.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (Mecom protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",['Evi-1'],['10.1128/mcb.11.4.1820-1828.1991 [doi]'],PMC359852,"['P30 CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA51020/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,"['GENBANK/M35697', 'GENBANK/M35698', 'GENBANK/M35699', 'GENBANK/M35700', 'GENBANK/M64252', 'GENBANK/M64494', 'GENBANK/M64598', 'GENBANK/M73694', 'GENBANK/M73695', 'GENBANK/M97165']",,,,,,,

It also inhibited leukotriene (LT)B4 biosynthesis by rat PMNL (IC50 = 0.4 microM), human PMNL (IC50 = 0.4 microM) and human whole blood (IC50 = 0.9 microM). Inhibition of human PMNL LTB4 biosynthesis was removed readily by a simple wash procedure. At concentrations up to 100 microM, the compound produced little or no inhibition of several related enzymes, such as platelet 12-lipoxygenase, soybean and rabbit reticulocyte 15-lipoxygenase and sheep seminal vesicle cyclooxygenase. At p.o. doses from 0.5 to 5 mg/kg in the dog, zileuton produced a rapid and sustained inhibition of ex vivo blood LTB4 biosynthesis which correlated with the pharmacokinetic behavior of the compound. In a similar ex vivo study in the rat, the compound displayed an p.o. ED50 of 2 mg/kg. Zileuton was highly effective in preventing 6-sulfidopeptide LT formation in the rat peritoneal cavity triggered by an antigen-antibody reaction with an ED50 of 3 mg/kg. In experimental models of inflammation, zileuton significantly reduced arachidonic-acid induced mouse ear edema (ED50 = 31 mg/kg) and also attenuated inflammatory cell accumulation in the rat pleural Arthus reaction. The effectiveness of this compound for preventing LT formation in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo suggests its utility for preventing the pathophysiological effects of the LTs and other 5-lipoxygenase products in animals and in humans.","['Carter, G W', 'Young, P R', 'Albert, D H', 'Bouska, J', 'Dyer, R', 'Bell, R L', 'Summers, J B', 'Brooks, D W']","['Carter GW', 'Young PR', 'Albert DH', 'Bouska J', 'Dyer R', 'Bell RL', 'Summers JB', 'Brooks DW']","['Immunosciences Research Area, Abbott Laboratories, Illinois.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,IM,,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/blood/pharmacology', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/blood', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dogs', 'Edema/prevention & control', 'Haplorhini', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*analogs & derivatives/blood/pharmacology', 'Leukotriene B4/*biosynthesis/blood', '*Lipoxygenase Inhibitors', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Species Specificity']",,1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 1991 Mar;256(3):929-37.,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', '1HGW4DR56D (Leukotriene B4)', 'EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)', 'V1L22WVE2S (zileuton)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, a set of EC cell-derived differentiated cell lines was analysed. Restriction of both B-tropic and endogenous N-tropic virus is characteristic of the Nr-type restriction reported in mouse strain 129. However, results indicate that Fv-1 restriction is not expressed in the PCC4.aza1R EC cell line. In contrast, the F9 EC cell line showed a strong restriction of the B-tropic pseudotyped vector but failed to restrict endogenous N-tropic pseudotypes. The Fv-1 gene thus seems to be differentially expressed in two EC cell lines derived from the same mouse strain. Furthermore, the selective restriction of B-tropic but not endogenous N-tropic MuLV in F9 cells suggests that these activities function independently of each other. Analysis of PCC4.aza1R-derived differentiated cell lines revealed that three fibroblast cell lines derived by retinoic acid-induced differentiation were also phenotypically silent for Fv-1. However, a pre-adipocyte line established following simultaneous exposure to retinoic acid and 5-azacytidine showed strong restriction of both B-tropic and endogenous N-tropic MuLV. Although additional data suggest that there is no correlation between the differentiated pre-adipocyte phenotype and Fv-1 expression, our results nonetheless show that Nr restriction can be observed in some derivatives of PCC4.aza1R cells, presumably by activating expression of the Fv-1 gene.","['Heitman, C K', 'Innes, C L', 'Jetten, A M', 'Boone, L R']","['Heitman CK', 'Innes CL', 'Jetten AM', 'Boone LR']","['Cellular and Genetic Toxicology Branch, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,IM,,"['Animals', 'Embryonal Carcinoma Stem Cells', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*microbiology', 'Phenotype', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virus Replication/genetics']",,1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Gen Virol. 1991 Mar;72 ( Pt 3):609-16. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-72-3-609.,,['Fv-1'],['10.1099/0022-1317-72-3-609 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The characteristics that appeared as a result of differentiation induced by these inhibitors were essentially similar in every cell line. Exposure to VP16 for 2 h induced both differentiation and DNA-strand breaks in K562 cells, whereas podophyllotoxin, which lacks topoisomerase II inhibitory activity, induced neither differentiation nor DNA-strand breaks in these cells. These results suggest a parallelism between the induction of differentiation and that of DNA-strand breaks. The combination of VP16 and recombinant tumor necrosis factor alpha (rTNF alpha) synergistically induced differentiation of human U937, ML1, and M1 cells and had an additive effect on HL60 cells. Simultaneous treatment with rTNF alpha plus camptothecin or VP16, or pretreatment with camptothecin or VP16, followed by rTNF alpha induced marked differentiation of M1 cells.

Anions bind to these unloaded forms of the carrier, and translocation takes place only when a suitable anion is bound to the transport site. In a previous paper [Am. J. Physiol. 257 (Cell Physiol. 26): C520-C527, 1989], we had shown that the substrate kinetics of Cl-Cl exchange in the promyelocytic HL-60 cell cannot be explained by this simple ping-pong model of anion exchange but is consistent with a simultaneous model according to which both extracellular and intracellular anions must bind before simultaneous translocation can take place. In the present paper we show that external 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS) inhibits anion exchange in HL-60 cells by competing with Cl- for binding to the outward-facing transport site. Furthermore, there is a linear dependence of the slope of the Dixon plot for inhibition by DIDS on the reciprocal of the intracellular Cl- concentration. This result clearly rules out a simple ping-pong scheme. In addition, the data also rule out a ping-pong model in which some translocation of the unloaded carrier is allowed (ping-pong model with slippage). The observed inhibition kinetics can be modeled by a simultaneous model of Cl-Cl exchange with competitive inhibition by DIDS.","['Restrepo, D', 'Cronise, B L', 'Snyder, R B', 'Spinelli, L J', 'Knauf, P A']","['Restrepo D', 'Cronise BL', 'Snyder RB', 'Spinelli LJ', 'Knauf PA']","['Monell Chemical Senses Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Physiol,The American journal of physiology,0370511,IM,,"[""4,4'-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-Disulfonic Acid"", ""4-Acetamido-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology"", 'Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte/*metabolism', 'Bicarbonates/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorides/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Mathematics', '*Models, Biological', 'Protein Binding']",,1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Physiol. 1991 Mar;260(3 Pt 1):C535-44. doi: 10.1152/ajpcell.1991.260.3.C535.,"['0 (Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte)', '0 (Bicarbonates)', '0 (Chlorides)', ""27816-59-7 (4-Acetamido-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic Acid)"", ""Q1O6DSW23R (4,4'-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-Disulfonic Acid)""]",,['10.1152/ajpcell.1991.260.3.C535 [doi]'],,"['CM-4295/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-27495/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-18208/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we reported that the combination of one of the two Py enhancers (A enhancer) and the repeated Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV) enhancer gave a chimeric Py genome (Py-MuLV) that replicates predominantly in the acinar cells of the pancreas, a tissue not permissive for wild-type PyA2 replication (R. Rochford, B. A. Campbell, and L. P. Villareal. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 84:449-453,1987). In this report, we further examine the combined enhancer requirements for acinar cell-specific Py replication. We also compare enhancer requirements for Py replication in the acinar cells of the pancreas with those of a transformed acinar cell line (266-6 cells). The deletion of sequences within the A enhancer of Py-MuLV (nucleotides 5098 to 5132) results in a virus with 10-fold-reduced levels of pancreas-specific replication. The deletion, however, of one of the 72-bp repeated Mo-MuLV enhancer sequences from Py-MuLV results in a complete loss of pancreas-specific DNA replication. Thus, the Py A enhancer is required for efficient replication of Py in the pancreas without otherwise altering organ specificity, but both of the repeated copies of the Mo-MuLV enhancer are essential for pancreas-specific Py replication. In contrast to the enhancer requirements for in vivo pancreas replication, in transformed acinar cells (266-6), PyA2 wild-type replicated efficiently and the Py-MuLV recombinant replicated inefficiently. These data suggest that the cell-specific control of DNA replication is different between normal pancreas cells and their transformed cell line counterparts and that this difference is apparent in the enhancer requirement of cell-specific Py DNA replication.","['Rochford, R', 'Villarreal, L P']","['Rochford R', 'Villarreal LP']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine 92717.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA, Viral/*biosynthesis', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Pancreas/*microbiology', 'Polyomavirus/*genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid']",,1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1991 Apr;65(4):2108-12. doi: 10.1128/JVI.65.4.2108-2112.1991.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",,['10.1128/JVI.65.4.2108-2112.1991 [doi]'],PMC240076,['GM 36605/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

The NF1 point mutation reduced in vitro protein binding as assessed by gel shift analysis and reduced promoter activity significantly (2- to 10-fold). However, the degree of promoter impairment due to the NF1 site mutation varied according to cell type and was least severe in a feline leukemia cell line (T3) which had low levels of nuclear NF1 DNA-binding activity. Low NF1 DNA-binding activity was observed in three FeLV-induced leukemia cell lines (T3, T17, and FL74) and in murine F9 embryonal carcinoma cells. While similar levels of NF1 gene mRNA transcripts were detected in all cell lines, Western immunoblot analysis of F9, T17, and FL74 but not T3 nuclear extracts revealed very low levels of nuclear NF1 protein. These results indicate that NF1 activity is down-regulated in FeLV-induced leukemia cells by diverse posttranscriptional mechanisms.

Transfection of the ovine cell line FLK-BLV, which expresses all BLV proteins from a wild-type provirus, with this viral DNA resulted in a viral titer of 10(4) CFU/ml. The inclusion of a large portion of the gag region did not significantly increase the titer. Both activator-dependent and activator-independent retroviruses were constructed. In activator-dependent vectors, the expression of the insert was dependent on the presence of the Tax protein, which activated the BLV long terminal repeat. In activator-independent vectors, the expression of the insert was constitutive because of the presence of an internal promoter. Infections with the recombinant retrovirus were inhibited by specific neutralizing antibodies. The structure of the transduced genetic material was not rearranged. BLV vectors encoding a reporter nlsLacZ gene, the product of which can be detected in single cells, greatly simplified studies of their biological properties.

We used gel retardation assays to demonstrate that F9 EC cell extracts form several complexes with the myeloproliferative sarcoma virus sequence around -166. One of these complexes involves a murine Sp1-like protein, which has immunoreactivity, DNA binding specificity, and electrophoretic mobility equivalent to those of purified human Sp1 protein.

Using the calcium-specific probe indo-1 acetoxymethyl ester, we found that the ability of differentiating HL-60 cells to mobilize calcium in response to N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) developed concomitantly with expression of receptors on the cells for this peptide. Mobilization of calcium in HL-60 cells, as well as in PMN, in response to fMLP was dose dependent and was related to the presence of calcium in the culture medium. In calcium-free medium, tenfold higher concentrations of fMLP were required to induce calcium mobilization than in calcium-containing medium. In HL-60 cells, calcium mobilization occurred more rapidly than in PMN and was independent of extracellular calcium. Furthermore, the response of HL-60 cells to fMLP was more prolonged than the response of PMN and was also of greater magnitude. Calcium mobilization in both HL-60 cells and PMN was partially inhibited by the calcium channel blocker, verapamil, but completely blocked by trimethylbenzoic acid 8-(diethylamino) octyl ester, an intracellular calcium antagonist. These results indicate that although both cell types mobilize calcium in response to fMLP, the characteristics of the responses are distinct. These differences may underlie distinct functional responses of PMN and differentiated HL-60 cells to fMLP.","['Laskin, D L', 'Sirak, A A', 'Robertson, F M', 'Laskin, J D']","['Laskin DL', 'Sirak AA', 'Robertson FM', 'Laskin JD']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Rutgers University, Piscataway, New Jersey 08855-0789.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,IM,,"['Biological Transport, Active', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Chemotactic Factors/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gallic Acid/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",,1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1991 Apr;49(4):369-79. doi: 10.1002/jlb.49.4.369.,"['0 (Chemotactic Factors)', '57818-92-5 (8-(N,N-diethylamino)octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '632XD903SP (Gallic Acid)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,['10.1002/jlb.49.4.369 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

No significant correlation was noted between myeloid marker expression and POEM positivity, whereas presence of CD 19 or CD 24 antigen significantly correlated with POEM negativity (P = .001 and .023, respectively).

Fourteen UMPO+ patients responded poorly to an ALL/AUL chemotherapy regimen with a low complete remission (CR) rate of 29% and a short median remission duration (MRD) of 5 months. The POEM- patients proved very heterogenous with respect to immunophenotype and Ig gene rearrangement. Seventeen of 21 patients tested had Ig gene rearrangements, including oligoclonal patterns. Combined data suggest that a proportion of these cases probably derive from a very immature lymphoid progenitor cell, particularly because 15 POEM- AUL patients showed a response to ALL/AUL chemotherapy comparable to that observed in patients with definitive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (CR rate 80%, MRD 20 months).

The role of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), a protein with pleiotropic effects on the proliferation and differentiation of various cell types, was examined during RA-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. Although TGF-beta 1 alone had little effect on proliferation or differentiation of HL-60 cells, addition of TGF-beta 1 to HL-60 cells treated with a suboptimum concentration of RA (1.0 nmol/L) resulted in a marked decrease in proliferation with no effect on granulocytic differentiation. Studies of the mechanism of RA-induced TGF-beta sensitivity showed that although untreated HL-60 cells expressed low levels of TGF-beta 1 binding proteins on the cell surface, the levels were increased in a dose-dependent manner after RA treatment. Maximum induction was achieved after treatment with 10 nmol/L RA and consisted predominantly of the 65-Kd TGF-beta 1 receptor type. Moreover, RA treatment also resulted in a dose-dependent increase in both TGF-beta 1 steady-state mRNA expression and production of active TGF-beta with maximum induction at 10 nmol/LRA. RA treatment of HL-60 cells had no effect on TGF-beta 2 and TGF-beta 3 mRNA expression.

During differentiation over 3 days in culture, the expression and the nature of erythropoietin (EPO) receptors have been analyzed using 125I-labeled bioactive recombinant human EPO. Aclacinomycin at 20 nM, the concentration inducing optimum differentiation, progressively increased EPO-specific binding. On day 3, EPO binding was nine-fold higher than that of the controls (1031 +/- 101 cpm/5 x 10(6) cells versus 112 +/- 15 cpm); with various concentrations of ACM, the increase in EPO binding appeared to parallel the recruitment of hemoglobin-producing cells. However, at 95% of growth inhibition, EPO binding remained constant while the percentage of differentiated cells decreased. Specific binding was reversible, saturable, and proportional to cell number; bound EPO was displaced by unlabeled EPO. Scatchard analysis of the equilibrium binding data suggested the existence of a single class of EPO receptors with an apparent Kd of 867 +/- 458 pM, corresponding to 400 +/- 142 receptors per cell. Affinity cross-linking of 125I-EPO using disuccinimidyl suberate followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions demonstrated that EPO was preferentially cross-linked to a protein of approximately 116 kD.

Mature phagocytes display functions requiring organized intracellular traffic and, for this reason, we questioned whether phagocyte differentiation could correlate with the increased expression of rab proteins. Rabbit antisera raised against the recombinant proteins rab1Ap, 2p, 4p, and 6p were able to detect the corresponding proteins in the human monoblast leukemic cell line U937. When these cells were induced to differentiate into monocyte/macrophage-like cells displaying functional characteristics of a normal phagocyte, rab1Ap, 2p, 4p, and 6p were increased and this correlated with an increase in the rab transcripts. Using a rab5 probe, we also observed an increased expression of the rab5 gene in differentiated cells. Similarly, differentiation of the human leukemic myeloblast HL60 cell line along either monocyte or granulocyte pathways induced an increased expression of the rab proteins. Rab proteins were also detected in human neutrophils and in guinea pig alveolar macrophages. As degranulation is one of the phagocyte functions acquired in the late stage of differentiation, we investigated whether rab proteins would be involved in this process. Although rab proteins were tightly membrane bound, none of them was detected in the specific or azurophil granules purified from human neutrophils. The increased expression of rab proteins in mature phagocytes suggests that they may promote functions highly developed in these cells.","['Maridonneau-Parini, I', 'Yang, C Z', 'Bornens, M', 'Goud, B']","['Maridonneau-Parini I', 'Yang CZ', 'Bornens M', 'Goud B']","['Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Centre de Genetique Moleculaire, Gif sur Yvette, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Compartmentation/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/classification/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'Phagocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Pulmonary Alveoli/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1991 Mar;87(3):901-7. doi: 10.1172/JCI115096.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,['10.1172/JCI115096 [doi]'],PMC329880,,,,,,,,,,,

When stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), both secretion of uPA and the expression of its receptor are up-regulated, and these cells differentiate to an adherent phenotype. This adhesive response is markedly reduced in the presence of uPA antibodies. The PMA response is restored by the addition of native uPA, an amino-terminal fragment of uPA (residues 1-143) devoid of proteolytic activity, or a synthetic peptide (residues 12-32) from the uPA growth factor domain known to mediate receptor binding. In contrast, the addition of catalytically active low molecular weight uPA, which is missing the growth factor domain, or a peptide from the catalytic domain (residues 247-266) is ineffective. The influence of uPA antibodies on a second marker of macrophage differentiation, cysteine proteinase activity, was also examined. Cysteine proteinase activity of HL60 cells is increased in PMA-treated cells after 24 h but it fails to increase in the presence of anti-uPA. This increase in cathepsin B-like activity is also restored by exogenous uPA. These experiments indicate that an autocrine interaction of the growth factor domain of uPA with its receptor mediates an essential step in PMA-mediated myeloid cell differentiation.","['Nusrat, A R', 'Chapman, H A Jr']","['Nusrat AR', 'Chapman HA Jr']","[""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,,"['Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/metabolism', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Macrophages/*cytology', 'Peptide Fragments/pharmacology', 'Pulmonary Alveoli/cytology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/physiology', 'Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/*physiology']",,1991/03/11 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1991/03/11 19:15'],"['1991/03/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1991/03/11 19:15 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1991 Mar;87(3):1091-7. doi: 10.1172/JCI115070.,"['0 (PLAUR protein, human)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,['10.1172/JCI115070 [doi]'],PMC329905,"['ES 0002/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-35505/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL8002/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Receptors for fMLF (fM,N-formylmethionine) and guanine-nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) serving as the substrate for pertussis toxin (islet-activating protein; IAP) were extracted from cell membranes then reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles. The binding of fMLF to the reconstituted vesicles (or the membranes) was determined with 10 nM [3H] fMLF. In both cases, high-affinity binding to vesicle preparations from the Me2SO- and Bt2cAMP-induced cells was abolished following treatment with IAP, suggesting that fMLF receptors were functionally coupled to IAP-sensitive G proteins in each of the two vesicle types. However, the high-affinity fMLF binding was much higher in vesicle preparations originating from Bt2cAMP-induced cells than in those from Me2SO-induced cells, although the amount of IAP-substrate G protein reconstituted into the each phospholipid vesicles preparation was not significantly different from the other. The G proteins of the two differentiated cells were both identified as inhibitory forms (Gi-2) based on their electrophoretic mobilities and immunoblot analyses. When purified Gi-2 from rat brain was reconstituted into the two IAP-treated vesicles, high-affinity fMLF binding was restored in a similar manner in both. IAP-substrate G proteins partially purified from the two differentiated HL-60 cells were also effective in restoring high-affinity fMLF binding to the IAP-treated vesicles. However, a significant difference was observed that the reconstituted binding was higher with the G-protein-rich fraction from Bt2cAMP-induced cells than with that from Me2SO-induced cells, with each of the two IAP-treated vesicle types. These results suggest that the different high-affinity binding of fMLF observed in the two differentiated HL-60 cells are due to a difference in the property of endogenous G proteins rather than fMLF receptors, though the two G proteins are indistinguishable from each other in terms of the subtype of G protein, Gi-2.","['Tohkin, M', 'Morishima, N', 'Iiri, T', 'Takahashi, K', 'Ui, M', 'Katada, T']","['Tohkin M', 'Morishima N', 'Iiri T', 'Takahashi K', 'Ui M', 'Katada T']","['Department of Life Science, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,IM,,"['Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Lipid Bilayers/metabolism', 'N-Formylmethionine/*metabolism', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Phospholipids/metabolism', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology']",,1991/01/30 00:00,1991/01/30 00:01,['1991/01/30 00:00'],"['1991/01/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/30 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/30 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1991 Jan 30;195(2):527-33. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1991.tb15733.x.,"['0 (Lipid Bilayers)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '4289-98-9 (N-Formylmethionine)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1991.tb15733.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Differences between myeloid and lymphoid cells.,573-8,"The binding and metabolism of platelet-activating factor (PAF) was studied in human cell lines resembling myeloid cells (HL60 and U937) and B and T lymphocytes (Daudi and Jurkat). All of the cell lines were found to bind and catabolize exogenous [3H]PAF in a time- and temperature-dependent manner. PAF binding could also be demonstrated in isolated membrane fractions, which provides further evidence of the existence of true membrane receptors. Myeloid cell lines contained numbers of receptors at least 10-fold higher than in lymphoid cell lines. Biosynthesis of PAF upon challenge by ionophore A23187 could be demonstrated in HL60 and U937 cells. In contrast, lymphoid cell lines were unable to produce PAF. Incubation with [14C]acetate showed incorporation of the label into three main fractions: neutral lipids, phosphatidylcholine and PAF, but the distribution of the label varied depending on the cell line. Significant incorporation into phosphatidylcholine was observed in uninduced myeloid cell lines. A phospholipase A2 acting on 1-O-hexadecyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and an acetyl-CoA:lyso-PAF acetyltransferase were expressed in the HL60 cell line and showed variations in specific activity with granulocytic differentiation. In contrast, these enzyme activities were not expressed in Daudi and Jurkat cell lines. These data indicate (1) the occurrence of PAF binding and catabolism in both myeloid and lymphoid cell lines; (2) the restriction of PAF biosynthesis to myeloid cell lines, especially HL60 cells; (3) the occurrence of differentiation-elicited changes in the specific activities of the enzymes involved in PAF biosynthesis by the remodelling pathway; and (4) the central role played by the disposal of lyso-PAF, a product of the phospholipase A2 reaction, in PAF biosynthesis.","['Garcia, M C', 'Garcia, C', 'Gijon, M A', 'Fernandez-Gallardo, S', 'Mollinedo, F', 'Sanchez Crespo, M']","['Garcia MC', 'Garcia C', 'Gijon MA', 'Fernandez-Gallardo S', 'Mollinedo F', 'Sanchez Crespo M']","['Instituto de Investigaciones Medicas de la Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Centro Asociado al CSIC, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,IM,,"['Acetates/metabolism', 'Acetyltransferases/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Burkitt Lymphoma', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse', 'Phospholipids/biosynthesis', 'Platelet Activating Factor/*metabolism', '*Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', '*Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled', 'Sulfuric Acid Esters/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Temperature', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",,1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 1991 Feb 1;273 ( Pt 3):573-8. doi: 10.1042/bj2730573.,"['0 (Acetates)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (Platelet Activating Factor)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Sulfuric Acid Esters)', '0 (platelet activating factor receptor)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.67 (1-alkylglycerophosphocholine acetyltransferase)', 'JW5CW40Z50 (dimethyl sulfate)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,['10.1042/bj2730573 [doi]'],PMC1149801,,,,,,,,,,,

However, viral expression was not in itself sufficient to cause disease, since significant viral expression was observed in regions that did not exhibit pathological changes (cerebellar cortex, hippocampus, corpus callosum, peripheral nervous system). In both diseased and nondiseased regions, endothelial and glial cells were identified as the main target cells. Neurons in diseased regions did not show viral expression. The regional distribution of the spongiform changes appears to be laid down very early following infection, since expression could be detected at 10 days postinfection in regions that become diseased.

The beta-galactosidase fusion protein prepared from the lysogen of a clone specifically recognized the cyclic AMP-responsive element in HTLV-I enhancer. The nucleotide sequence of a full-length cDNA clone (TAXREB67) had a coding capacity of 351 amino acids, which contained a basic motif followed by a leucine zipper structure near the carboxy terminus. Its mRNA was detected in human cell lines, including HTLV-I-infected or noninfected hematopoietic cell lines. The mRNA level in Jurkat cells was decreased temporarily by increasing cyclic AMP concentration but increased by increasing Ca2+ concentration.

Analysis via inhibition of transferrin recycling by low temperatures.",3469-74,"Transferrin (Tf) acidification has been shown to be limited to pH 6 in murine Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts, human A549 epidermoid carcinoma cells, and Chinese hamster ovary cells and is followed by alkalinization during recycling. In contrast, Tf acidification in the human erythroleukemic cell line K562 proceeds to below pH 5.5, and alkalinization of internal Tf during recycling is not observed. To explore the regulation of endosomal pH in K562 cells, we determined whether the existence of an early endosome of pH 6 could be demonstrated in K562 cells. The kinetics of Tf internalization, acidification, and recycling were determined at temperatures which block recycling of Tf in 3T3 cells. As in 3T3, Tf recycling in K562 was inhibited at 24 degrees C and below. At these temperatures, Tf internalization and acidification were delayed relative to 37 degrees C, yet the minimum pH achieved was below 5.5. Temperatures at or below 19 degrees C resulted in a complete block in recycling (at least over 40 min), which was rapidly reversible by incubation at 37 degrees C. Ouabain (a specific inhibitor of the Na+,K(+)-ATPase) had no effect on K562 Tf acidification, indicating that K562 endosomal pH is probably not regulated by the Na+,K(+)-ATPase. The results suggest that differentiation of the early endocytic pathway in erythroid cells involves changes such that the pH of Tf-containing compartments is not limited to 6 by the Na+,K(+)-ATPase.","['Sipe, D M', 'Jesurum, A', 'Murphy, R F']","['Sipe DM', 'Jesurum A', 'Murphy RF']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology', 'Ouabain/pharmacology', 'Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/*metabolism', 'Temperature', 'Transferrin/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/enzymology']",,1991/02/25 00:00,1991/02/25 00:01,['1991/02/25 00:00'],"['1991/02/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/25 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1991 Feb 25;266(6):3469-74.,"['0 (Transferrin)', '5ACL011P69 (Ouabain)', 'EC 7.2.2.13 (Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase)']",,['S0021-9258(19)67819-1 [pii]'],,"['GM08067/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM32508/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

These sera also blocked the expression of the ligand binding to WT31 in flow cytometry. WT31 is a MAb that recognizes a common determinant on the T cell receptor (TCR). Immunoglobulins from these sera suppressed the activation of normal peripheral blood T lymphocytes (PBT) induced by OKT3. All patients (7/32) who developed this Ab2 had distinct culture-proved cytomegaloviral infections. In further immunoblotting studies, alpha F1, another MAb recognizing the framework of the TCR alpha chain, more deeply inserted in the T cell membrane, also showed binding to protein bands of cytomegalovirus pellet lysates derived from virus-infected embryonic fibroblasts. In addition, alpha F1 showed positive binding to several ligands in the membrane lysate of CMV-infected, but not noninfected MRC-5 cells. An anti-CMV MAb recognizing late nuclear antigen (LAb), also strongly bound to a approximately 50 KD band of TCML and several bands (approximately 34, approximately 40, and approximately 50 KD) of H33HJAJ1 (human T leukemia) cell lysate. Furthermore, alpha F1 immunoprecipitated a approximately 96 KD ligand of CMV-infected MRC5 lysate that had the same electrophoretic mobility as one of the proteins precipitable with LAb. Both LAb and alpha F1 also showed positive binding to paraformaldehyde-fixed and Triton X-100-permeabilized PBT in flow cytometry. Sera containing Ab2 blocked alpha F1 binding to acetone-fixed cytofuged PBT preparations on slides. Moreover, both alpha F1 and LAb inhibited mitogen-stimulated lymphocyte activation in vitro. These data support the notion that T cell functional abnormalities associated with CMV infection observed after treatment of transplant recipients with anti-T cell monoclonals might be caused by binding to T cell ligands by a variety of crossreacting human Igs operative in a regulatory network. Confirmatory evidence is the effect of MAbs generated against CMV virion epitopes crossreacting with T cell ligands, and vice versa.","['Yang, W C', 'Carreno, M', 'Esquenazi, V', 'Fuller, L', 'Ranjan, D', 'Burke, G', 'Roth, D', 'Miller, J']","['Yang WC', 'Carreno M', 'Esquenazi V', 'Fuller L', 'Ranjan D', 'Burke G', 'Roth D', 'Miller J']","['Department of Surgery, Microbiology, Miami Veterans Administration Hospital, Florida.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antibodies, Viral/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD3 Complex', 'Cytomegalovirus/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Molecular Weight', 'Muromonab-CD3', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Viral Proteins/immunology']",,1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 1991 Feb;51(2):490-8. doi: 10.1097/00007890-199102000-00042.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Muromonab-CD3)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",,['10.1097/00007890-199102000-00042 [doi]'],,['R01 DK25243-11/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

This association of BLV with B lymphocytes is well established but the mechanism(s) of disease expression is not defined.

Differential inhibition of protein kinase C, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and synaptosomal membrane Na,K-ATPase, and Na+ pump and differentiation of HL60 cells.",2753-8,"Interactions of certain naturally occurring, amphiphilic polypeptides with membranes were investigated. Mastoparan (wasp venom toxin), melittin (bee venom toxin), cardiotoxin (cobra venom toxin), and polymyxin B (antibacterial antibiotic) inhibited protein kinase C stimulated by phosphatidylserine bilayer or arachidonate monomer and blocked binding of [3H] phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate to protein kinase C in the presence of phosphatidylserine bilayer, with IC50 values (concentrations causing 50% inhibition) of 1-8 microM. Mastoparan and polymyxin B were much less inhibitory (IC50, 10-20 microM), whereas melittin and cardiotoxin were similarly inhibitory (IC50, 1-4 microM), when protein kinase C was activated instead by synaptosomal membrane. Kinetic analysis indicate that mastoparan inhibited protein kinase C, assayed using phosphatidylserine or synaptosomal membrane as the phospholipid cofactor, competitively with the phospholipid cofactor, in a mixed manner with CaCl2 or diacylglycerol, noncompetitively with histone, and uncompetitively with ATP, with apparent Ki values of 1.6-18.7 microM. Inhibition of Na,K-ATPase in the membrane by these polypeptides had relative potencies different from those for their inhibition of protein kinase C activated by the same membrane preparation; mastoparan and melittin inhibited the two activities with comparable potencies, but polymyxin B and cardiotoxin were far less effective in inhibiting Na,K-ATPase. The same relative inhibitory potencies of the polypeptides (melittin greater than mastoparan greater than polymyxin B) for inhibition of Na,K-ATPase were also noted for their inhibition of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, 86Rb uptake (Na+ pump) by HL60 cells and the phorbol ester-induced differentiation of the leukemia cells. These findings were consistent with discrete interactions of the polypeptides with functionally distinct sites on the membrane, leading to differential inhibition of biological activities associated with the membrane. Actions of certain polypeptides appeared to be more specific compared to those of lipid second messengers such as lyso-phosphatidylcholine and sphingosine, and the antineoplastic ether lipid analogs such as 1-O-octadecyl-2-methyl-rac-glycero-3-ophosphocholine.","['Raynor, R L', 'Zheng, B', 'Kuo, J F']","['Raynor RL', 'Zheng B', 'Kuo JF']","['Department of Pharmacology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Cobra Cardiotoxin Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Kinetics', 'Melitten/metabolism', 'Peptides/*metabolism', 'Polymyxin B/metabolism', '*Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Sodium/*metabolism', 'Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Swine', 'Synaptosomes/*enzymology', 'Wasp Venoms/metabolism']",,1991/02/15 00:00,1991/02/15 00:01,['1991/02/15 00:00'],"['1991/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1991 Feb 15;266(5):2753-8.,"['0 (Cobra Cardiotoxin Proteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Wasp Venoms)', '20449-79-0 (Melitten)', '72093-21-1 (mastoparan)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'EC 7.2.2.13 (Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase)', 'J2VZ07J96K (Polymyxin B)']",,['S0021-9258(18)49909-7 [pii]'],,"['CA-36777/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-15696/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'NS-17608/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

In a retrospective study of 56 consecutive cases of T-cell lymphoma, EBV DNA was found by Southern blot and in situ DNA hybridization in 10 (20%) of 50 peripheral T-cell lymphomas, but in none of six cases of T-lymphoblastic lymphoma. Peripheral T-cell lymphomas containing EBV DNA could be subclassified into three categories according to histology and immunophenotypic studies: (1) T-cell lymphoma of the helper phenotype, five cases. Two cases had histologic features resembling angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy (AILD). (2) T-cell lymphoma of the cytotoxic/suppressor phenotype, four cases. AILD-like features could also be recognized in two cases. Reed-Sternberg-like giant cells were identified in three cases designated Hodgkin-like T-cell lymphoma. (3) Angiocentric T-cell lymphoma or lymphomatoid granulomatosis in one case, initially affecting the skin and nose; no T-cell subset could be defined. Six of the eight EBV DNA-positive patients tested for serum EBV antibodies had elevated titers of IgG antiviral capsid antigen (greater than 640) and/or early antigen (greater than 10). From combined studies of Southern blot hybridization by using EBV termini fragment probe and in situ DNA hybridization, the EBV genomes appeared to be clonotypically proliferated in the neoplastic T cells. The patients in all three groups usually had prolonged fever preceding the diagnosis, hepatosplenomegaly, an aggressive clinical course, and poor response to chemotherapy; nine died with a median survival of only 8 months.

The cell suicide could be prevented by inhibitors of macromolecular synthesis. cAMP analogs induced cell death in a positively cooperative manner (apparent Hill coefficient of 2.9), indicating that triggering of the apoptotic process was under stringent control. There was a strong synergism between cAMP analogs complementing each other in the activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase I (cAKI). No such synergism was noted for analogs complementing each other in the activation of cAKII. It is concluded that apoptosis can be induced solely by activation of cAKI. The IPC-81 cells expressed about four times more cAKI than cAKII. The expression of cAK subunits, on the protein and mRNA levels, was only minimally affected by cholera toxin treatment.","['Lanotte, M', 'Riviere, J B', 'Hermouet, S', 'Houge, G', 'Vintermyr, O K', 'Gjertsen, B T', 'Doskeland, S O']","['Lanotte M', 'Riviere JB', 'Hermouet S', 'Houge G', 'Vintermyr OK', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Doskeland SO']","['INSERM U301, Centre Hayem, Hopital St-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Cholera Toxin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/analogs & derivatives/*physiology', 'DNA Damage', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Isoenzymes/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Nucleolus Organizer Region/metabolism', 'Protein Kinases/drug effects/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1991 Jan;146(1):73-80. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041460110.,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9012-63-9 (Cholera Toxin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)']",,['10.1002/jcp.1041460110 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we compared the expression of c-myb and c-myc during erythropoietin (Epo) and Me2SO induction of Rauscher erythroleukemia cells, which differentiate in response to both inducers, and Friend erythroleukemia cells, in which Epo-induced differentiation is blocked. Our results demonstrate that Epo induces specific changes in expression of c-myb and c-myc in both Rauscher and Friend cells. Epo increases c-myc transcript, in contrast to a decreased caused Me2SO, indicating that the biphasic mode of c-myc regulation seen with Me2SO is not required for erythropoiesis. The Epo-induced changes in c-myb and c-myc do not require new protein synthesis, thus identifying these proto-oncogenes as early response genes for Epo. Both cell types also exhibit rapid changes in membrane protein phosphorylation in response to Epo. Since the signal pathway from Epo receptor activation to the nucleus appears equally functional in both Rauscher and Friend cells, the data suggest that the inability of Friend cells to differentiate in response to Epo is due to a block at a later step in the induction process.","['Chern, Y', 'Spangler, R', 'Choi, H S', 'Sytkowski, A J']","['Chern Y', 'Spangler R', 'Choi HS', 'Sytkowski AJ']","['Laboratory for Cell and Molecular Biology, New England Deaconess Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02215.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Erythropoietin/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, myc', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Rauscher Virus', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1991/02/05 00:00,1991/02/05 00:01,['1991/02/05 00:00'],"['1991/02/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/05 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1991 Feb 5;266(4):2009-12.,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']","['c-myb', 'c-myc']",['S0021-9258(18)52200-6 [pii]'],,['R01 DK38841/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

This system is a relevant one for an investigation of the molecular mechanism of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. We have now examined the effect of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 on the induction of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3- and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-24-hydroxylase activities in HL-60 cells. The hydroxylase activities were measured by a periodate-based assay, which was validated by comparison with well-established HPLC analysis. HPLC analysis also suggested that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 induces a 23-hydroxylase in addition to the 24-hydroxylase. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3- and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-24-hydroxylase activities were stimulated as early as 4 h after the addition of 10(-7) M 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and became maximal by 24 h. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 stimulated both activities in a dose-dependent manner up to 10(-6) M. The Km of 24-hydroxylase for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 were 2 x 10(-8) M and 5.2 x 10(-7) M, respectively. Cycloheximide (5 microM) inhibited 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-mediated stimulation of 24-hydroxylase activity. Other differentiation inducers, such as retinoic acid and phorbol ester, did not induce either activity. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3-24-hydroxylase in HL-60 mitochondria was solubilized with 0.6% cholate and reconstituted with NADPH, beef adrenal ferredoxin, and beef adrenal ferredoxin reductase, each component being essential for 24-hydroxylase activity. These results strongly suggest that the 24-hydroxylase in HL-60 cells is a three-component cytochrome P450-dependent mixed-function oxidase.","['Inaba, M', 'Burgos-Trinidad, M', 'DeLuca, H F']","['Inaba M', 'Burgos-Trinidad M', 'DeLuca HF']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Wisconsin-Madison, College of Agricultural and Life Sciences 53706.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,IM,,"['25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 1-alpha-Hydroxylase/*metabolism', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', '*Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Periodic Acid/pharmacology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Steroid Hydroxylases/*metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity/drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vitamin D3 24-Hydroxylase']",,1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1991 Feb 1;284(2):257-63. doi: 10.1016/0003-9861(91)90293-r.,"['10450-60-9 (Periodic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'B45A1BUM4Q (metaperiodate)', 'EC 1.14.- (Steroid Hydroxylases)', 'EC 1.14.15.16 (Vitamin D3 24-Hydroxylase)', 'EC 1.14.15.18 (25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 1-alpha-Hydroxylase)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,"['0003-9861(91)90293-R [pii]', '10.1016/0003-9861(91)90293-r [doi]']",,['DK-14881/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

A three-mode binding model for ellipticine derivatives.,1820-9,"Cytotoxic effects and topoisomerase II-mediated DNA breaks induced in vitro by ellipticine derivatives were examined in connection with 1H NMR and circular dichroism (CD) studies on molecular structures and interactions of drugs with DNA. The compounds included four 9-hydroxyellipticine and two 7-hydroxyisoellipticine derivatives. Structure-activity relationships indicated that a change in nitrogen atom position in the pyridinic ring greatly affected drug effects both on topoisomerase II action and cytotoxicity to L1210 cells. The four 9-hydroxyellipticine derivatives yielded bell-shaped curves in in vitro topoisomerase II-mediated DNA break assays, whereas the two 7-hydroxyisoellipticine derivatives demonstrated an almost linear increase at the same concentration (0-10 microM). In both cases, the intensity of cleavage was modulated by the position and the degree of methylation on the pyridinic ring, and results were correlated with cytotoxic activity expressed as the in vitro ID50 values for L1210 leukemia cells. 1H NMR experiments performed on free drug molecules in solution revealed that the two protons (alpha and beta) contiguous to the biologically important hydroxy group were sensitive to changes in electron distribution produced by the distant chemical modifications and methylations of the pyridinic ring. A linear relationship was observed between the differences in chemical shifts of alpha and beta protons (delta delta alpha-beta) versus ID50 values. CD experiments indicated that, at weak ionic strength I = 0.02 and at pH 7, drugs interact with the poly[d(A-T)] duplex according to a ""three-mode binding model"" which is governed by the drug structure and the drug to DNA ratio. The intercalation mode was related to the induction of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage, while the external binding mode consecutive to intercalation was related to cleavage suppression. These two modes concerned the good intercalators 9-hydroxyellipticines. The third was found for the weak intercalators 7-hydroxyisoellipticines and was characterized by self-stacked molecules bound ""outside"" DNA, presumably in the minor groove. Ligands either could be intercalated partially or linked at the edge of bases with a small number of molecules filling intercalation sites, for the second alternative. In addition to having different binding modes, 9-hydroxyellipticines were better inducers of DNA distortions than 7-hydroxyisoellipticines. The incidence of the drug binding modes on DNA-topoisomerase II recognition was discussed in connection with the in vitro cytotoxic activity exhibited by the drugs.","['Monnot, M', 'Mauffret, O', 'Simon, V', 'Lescot, E', 'Psaume, B', 'Saucier, J M', 'Charra, M', 'Belehradek, J Jr', 'Fermandjian, S']","['Monnot M', 'Mauffret O', 'Simon V', 'Lescot E', 'Psaume B', 'Saucier JM', 'Charra M', 'Belehradek J Jr', 'Fermandjian S']","['Institut Gustave Roussy, URA 147 Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, U 140 Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Villejuit, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Circular Dichroism', 'DNA/*chemistry/metabolism', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'Ellipticines/*chemistry/toxicity', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Intercalating Agents/chemistry', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mice', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,1991/02/04 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1991/02/04 19:15'],"['1991/02/04 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1991/02/04 19:15 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1991 Jan 25;266(3):1820-9.,"['0 (Ellipticines)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '117VLW7484 (ellipticine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",,['S0021-9258(18)52368-1 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Specific role in cell differentiation.,484-9,"The biochemical signaling mechanisms involved in transducing the effects of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN) on leukemia cell differentiation are poorly defined. Recent studies established the existence of a sphingomyelin cycle that operates in response to the action of vitamin D3 on HL-60 cells and that may transduce the effects of vitamin D3 on cell differentiation (Okazaki, T., Bell, R., and Hannun, Y. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 19076-19080). The effects of TNF alpha and gamma-IFN on sphingomyelin turnover were determined, and the specificity and role of sphingomyelin hydrolysis in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells with 20% hydrolysis of sphingomyelin at 15 min, 40% hydrolysis at 30-60 min, and return to base line at 2 h. The hydrolyzed sphingomyelin (18 pmol/nmol total phospholipid) was accompanied by the concomitant generation of ceramide (11.2 pmol/nmol total phospholipid). gamma-IFN also caused reversible hydrolysis of sphingomyelin with onset at 1 h and peak effect at 2 h. This sphingomyelin cycle appeared to be specific to the monocytic pathway of HL-60 differentiation, since it was not activated by retinoic acid or dibutyryl cAMP, inducers of granulocytic differentiation, nor with phorbol myristate acetate, an inducer of macrophage-like differentiation. Addition of synthetic ceramide or bacterial sphingomyelinase induced monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells. Cell-permeable ceramide also caused prompt down-regulation of mRNA for the c-myc protooncogene. The time course of c-myc down-regulation was consistent with the action of ceramide as the mediator of TNF alpha action. These results suggest that sphingomyelin turnover may be an important signaling mechanism transducing the actions of TNF alpha and gamma-IFN with specific function in cell differentiation.","['Kim, M Y', 'Linardic, C', 'Obeid, L', 'Hannun, Y']","['Kim MY', 'Linardic C', 'Obeid L', 'Hannun Y']","['Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['Bucladesine/pharmacology', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Ceramides/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/pharmacology', 'Sphingomyelins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",,1991/01/05 00:00,1991/01/05 00:01,['1991/01/05 00:00'],"['1991/01/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/05 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1991 Jan 5;266(1):484-9.,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Sphingomyelins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 3.1.4.12 (Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,['S0021-9258(18)52461-3 [pii]'],,['ES-00155/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, bryostatin 1 (bryo), a structurally distinct protein kinase C (PKC) activator, does not induce differentiation and blocks the cytostatic effect of PBt2. The divergent responses to these agents correlate with activation of a PKC-like activity at the nucleus in response to bryo but not PBt2 (Fields, A. P., Pettit, G. R., and May, W.S. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 8253-8260). In the present study, this nuclear PKC-like activity (termed PKCn) was isolated from HL60 cells and shown to phosphorylate its known nuclear substrate, lamin B. PKCn-mediated phosphorylation of nuclear envelope-associated lamin B in vitro is calcium-dependent and is stimulated by bryo and 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol (DiC8), but not PBt2. In contrast, PKCn-mediated phosphorylation of histone IIIS is stimulated equally by all three activators. PKCn mediates calcium- and phosphatidylserine-dependent phosphorylation of both histone IIIS and partially purified lamin B. PKCn activity can be inhibited by an anti-PKC monoclonal antibody which specifically inhibits PKC. Isotype-specific PKC antibodies identify PKCn as beta II-PKC. Immunoblot analysis indicates that HL60 cells express both alpha- and beta II-PKC but no beta I- or gamma-PKC. Treatment of intact cells with bryo for 30 min leads to complete translocation of both alpha- and beta II-PKC from the cytosol to the membrane fractions. Approximately 8-10% of the total beta II-PKC (and less than 0.3% of the alpha-PKC) is found associated with the nuclear membrane of bryo-treated cells. In contrast, PBt2 treatment leads to complete translocation of alpha-PKC, but only partial translocation of beta II-PKC to the plasma membrane fraction. Neither PKC isotype is found associated with the nuclear membrane of PBt2-treated cells. These data demonstrate that alpha- and beta II-PKC differ with respect to activator responsiveness, intracellular distribution, and substrate specificity and indicate that their selective activation at distinct intracellular sites, including the nucleus, can have a dramatic effect on resulting cellular responses.","['Hocevar, B A', 'Fields, A P']","['Hocevar BA', 'Fields AP']","['Department of Pharmacology, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies/isolation & purification', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Lamin Type B', 'Lamins', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Envelope/*enzymology', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protamine Kinase/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism']",,1991/01/05 00:00,1991/01/05 00:01,['1991/01/05 00:00'],"['1991/01/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/05 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1991 Jan 5;266(1):28-33.,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Lamin Type B)', '0 (Lamins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protamine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",,['S0021-9258(18)52396-6 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

To test this hypothesis, 26 lymphomas involving the central nervous system (CNS) (11 primary, 15 systemic) were studied for the presence of EBV. In situ hybridization (ISH) was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue using a sulfur 35 (35S)-labeled EBV probe (EBV BAMH1-W). The results were interpreted without knowledge of the patients' immunologic status. The EBV sequences were detected in 11 lymphomas, nine of which were mixed or large cell subtypes. Review of the clinical information revealed that nine of the 26 lymphomas occurred in immunocompromised patients secondary to renal transplantation, human immunodeficiency virus infection, leukemia, and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. The EBV sequences were detected in all nine lymphomas occurring in immunocompromised patients, whereas two of the 17 lymphomas occurring in immunocompetent patients expressed EBV sequences. The authors conclude that the presence of EBV sequences in CNS lymphomas is highly correlated with a history of compromised immune status supporting a pathogenetic role of EBV in the development of CNS lymphomas in immunocompromised patients.","['Nakhleh, R E', 'Manivel, J C', 'Copenhaver, C M', 'Sung, J H', 'Strickler, J G']","['Nakhleh RE', 'Manivel JC', 'Copenhaver CM', 'Sung JH', 'Strickler JG']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota and Medical School, Minneapolis.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Brain Neoplasms/immunology/*microbiology', 'Child', 'DNA, Viral/*analysis', 'Female', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Lymphoma/immunology/*microbiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization']",,1991/01/15 00:00,1991/01/15 00:01,['1991/01/15 00:00'],"['1991/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1991 Jan 15;67(2):444-8. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19910115)67:2<444::aid-cncr2820670221>3.0.co;2-w.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",,['10.1002/1097-0142(19910115)67:2<444::aid-cncr2820670221>3.0.co;2-w [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

At this time, patients with subsequent pyogenic infections had lower chemotaxis (P less than .05), phagocytic-bactericidal activity (P less than .005), and superoxide production (P less than .025) than those without. Defective skin window migration and combined defects were predictive for late pyogenic infections. At 9 months all tests were normal in seven patients surviving without GVHD. In contrast, at 9 months three of three patients, and at 1 year two of three with chronic GVHD had still decreased neutrophil function.

Histologic and immunohistologic characterization.,87-95,"The term ""plasmacytoid T-zone cells"" has been used to describe distinctive cells that occur in clusters in the paracortex of some reactive lymph nodes. Recently, tumorous proliferations of these cells have been described in several patients with myelomonocytic leukemias. Neither the nature of these cells nor their relationship to myeloid leukemia has been conclusively established. We report the case of a 64-year-old woman with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia who developed lymphadenopathy that proved to be due to tumorous accumulation of plasmacytoid T-zone cells in the interfollicular regions of the lymph nodes. She underwent splenectomy because of symptomatic splenomegaly; the resected spleen also contained aggregates of plasmacytoid T-zone cells, in addition to extramedullary hematopoiesis. On treatment with busulphan and prednisone, the lymphadenopathy resolved and did not recur. The patient died 7 years later with blast transformation of her myelomonocytic leukemia and no recurrence of lymphadenopathy. The aggregates of plasmacytoid T-zone cells were architecturally and cytologically distinct from the leukemic infiltrates of myeloid cells in the spleen, and there was no evidence of differentiation of these cells into myeloid or monocytic cells. A panel of monoclonal antibodies on paraffin sections revealed no lineage-specific T- or B-cell markers (UCHL1-, L26-), and the plasmacytoid cells were positive for CD68 (KP1) and L60 (CD43), as well as faintly positive for 4KB5 (CD45RA) and MB1 (CD45R). They did not stain with antibodies to myeloid lineage antigens CD15, lysozyme, or myeloperoxidase. The combination of clinical, morphologic, and immunologic features of plasmacytoid T-zone cells in this case suggests that these cells may be of monocytic lineage but are not direct precursors of mature monocytic or granulocytic cells, and may not be part of the neoplastic clone in patients with myelomonocytic leukemia.","['Harris, N L', 'Demirjian, Z']","['Harris NL', 'Demirjian Z']","['Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston 02114.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lysosomes/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Spleen/metabolism/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology']",,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 1991 Jan;15(1):87-95. doi: 10.1097/00000478-199101000-00011.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",,['10.1097/00000478-199101000-00011 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Two approaches were used to model the probability of infection. First, the expected number of new infections per pen-month was assumed to follow a binomial distribution. The probability of infection was modeled, using logistic regression, as a function of prevalence of infection in pen, presence of lactating cows, proportion of pregnant cows, presence of an infected bull, and proportion of infected cows with a lymphocyte count above 10,000 cells/microliters of blood and/or with Mr 24,000 protein (p24) antibodies. The probability of infection was significantly associated with the prevalence of infection and at the limit of significance for presence of lactating cows in pen. Second, the Cox model with time-dependent covariates was used to analyze time from first parturition or from the beginning of the study to infection. Factors examined were age, breed, lactation number, whether the cow was pregnant and/or lactating, prevalence of infection, presence of an infected bull, and density of cattle in the pen holding the cow. Non-pregnant cows were 2.9 times more at risk of infection than were pregnant cows, and risk of infection significantly increased as prevalence of infection in a pen increased.","['Lassauzet, M L', 'Thurmond, M C', 'Johnson, W O', 'Stevens, F', 'Picanso, J P']","['Lassauzet ML', 'Thurmond MC', 'Johnson WO', 'Stevens F', 'Picanso JP']","['Department of Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Tulare.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/blood/epidemiology/*transmission', 'Female', 'Leukemia/blood/epidemiology/*veterinary', '*Leukemia Virus, Bovine', 'Prospective Studies', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk Factors']",,1991/01/15 00:00,1991/01/15 00:01,['1991/01/15 00:00'],"['1991/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 1991 Jan 15;133(2):164-76. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a115855.,,,['10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a115855 [doi]'],,,,,,['Am J Epidemiol 1991 May 1;133(9):965'],,,,,,

By using a DNA probe derived from Cas-Br-E provirus-flanking sequences, we identified a DNA region, originally called Sic-1, rearranged in 16 of 24 tumors analyzed (67%). All proviruses were integrated in a DNA segment smaller than 100 bp and were in the same 5'-to-3' orientation. Ecotropic as well as mink cell focus-forming virus types were found integrated in that specific DNA region. On the basis of Southern blot analysis of somatic cell hybrids and progeny of an interspecies backcross, the Sic-1 region was localized on mouse chromosome 9 near the previously described proto-oncogenes or common viral integration sites: Ets-1, Cbl-2, Tpl-1, and Fli-1. Restriction map analysis shows that this region is identical to the Fli-1 locus identified in Friend murine leukemia virus-induced erythroleukemia cell lines and thus may contain sequences also responsible for the development of mouse non-T-, non-B-cell lymphomas.","['Bergeron, D', 'Poliquin, L', 'Kozak, C A', 'Rassart, E']","['Bergeron D', 'Poliquin L', 'Kozak CA', 'Rassart E']","['Departement des Sciences Biologiques, Universite du Quebec a Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Lymphoma/genetics/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Restriction Mapping']",,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1991 Jan;65(1):7-15. doi: 10.1128/JVI.65.1.7-15.1991.,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",,['10.1128/JVI.65.1.7-15.1991 [doi]'],PMC240483,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells infected with two viruses can, in some cases, give rise to phenotypically mixed virions with altered or broadened cell tropism and could therefore account for some of these findings. Such pseudotypes could alter the course of disease by infecting more tissues than are normally infected by HIV. We show here that HIV type 1 (HIV-1) efficiently incorporates the HTLV type I (HTLV-I) envelope glycoprotein and that both HIV-1 and HTLV-II accept other widely divergent envelope glycoproteins to form infectious pseudotype viruses whose cellular tropisms and relative abilities to be transmitted by cell-free virions or by cell contact are determined by the heterologous envelope. We also show that the mechanism by which virions incorporate heterologous envelope glycoproteins is independent of the presence of the homologous glycoprotein or heterologous gag proteins.

The secretion of interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) into the medium was markedly stimulated by a 10(-5)-mol/L fragment D, E, and D-dimer, whereas a significant increase in IL-1 beta secretion was observed only in D-dimer-stimulated cells. In addition, D-dimer induced a rapid increase in urokinase-type plasminogen activator on day 1 (0.52 +/- 0.02 ng/mL v 0.07 +/- 0.01 ng/mL in the control culture) and a slow increase in plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 on day 5 (3.9 +/- 1.6 ng/mL v 1.2 +/- 0.2 ng/mL in the control culture). An increase in tissue factor (TF) was also demonstrated on the cell surface of NOMO-1 cells exposed to fragment D or D-dimer by indirect immunofluorescence using an anti-TF monoclonal antibody. Scatchard plot analysis showed that fragment D and D-dimer bound to the NOMO-1 cells with a kd of 3.3 nmol/L and 2.7 nmol/L, respectively.

A subsequent increase in the amount of RB protein per cell occurred with cell proliferation. Thus the amount of RB protein relative to the total cell mass underwent a biphasic response with mitogenesis. The resulting proliferating cells had a slightly elevated level of RB protein per cell compared to the unstimulated cells. Comparison of other proliferating leukocytes to normal lymphocytes showed that both EBV virally transformed lymphocytes and human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) had elevated levels of RB protein per cell compared to normal peripheral blood lymphocytes.

While the effects of GM-CSF and IL-3 on ara-C-induced differentiation appear limited, the combination of ara-C and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) may appear to be useful in overcoming the block in differentiation characteristic of leukemic myeloblasts. On the basis of in vitro studies, clinical trials with ara-C are underway that are examining the usefulness of GM-CSF and IL-3 in cell cycle recruitment of leukemic myeloblasts. These cytokines are also under study in supportive therapy of ara-C-induced myelosuppression.

All pts were on heparin during induction chemotherapy. Coagulation activation, which increased with the onset of chemotherapy (increases in D-dimer) and a decreasing trend at the end of the antileukemic therapy (normalization of fibrinogen levels) was observed. During the whole observation period alpha-2 antiplasmin levels remained very low. No significant changes were observed in antithrombin III or protein C levels. In conclusion, disseminated intravascular coagulation with associated thrombopenia is an important event in acute leukemia and an increased fibrinolytic activity due to low alpha-2 antiplasmin levels may take part in the genesis of hemorrhage.

We divided the Negev into an Eastern part where plant employees are likely to live, and a Western part where this is quite unlikely. Reported leukemia cases were provided by the Israel Cancer Registry for the age group 0-24, and for the period 1960-1985. We checked this file against data obtained from the hospitals in the area. We added 6 more cases in the Eastern Negev, none in the Western Negev, and none of the reported cases was discarded. There was a total of 192 cases, of which 52% were acute lymphatic leukemia. Jewish and Bedouin children were studied separately. Among Jewish children the average annual incidence rate for the Eastern Negev was 2.76/100,000, the Western Negev 3.51. Over time the leukemia rates were consistently higher in the Western Negev among children aged 0-9 years, which holds especially for acute lymphatic leukemia. There was a sudden increase among girls born during the period 1970-1979 in the northern part of the Western Negev, which was not noticed among boys. No excess cases were found in the small towns around the plant.","['Sofer, T', 'Goldsmith, J R', 'Nusselder, I', 'Katz, L']","['Sofer T', 'Goldsmith JR', 'Nusselder I', 'Katz L']","['Epidemiology Unit, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Public Health Rev,Public health reviews,0370123,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Israel/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Male', '*Nuclear Reactors', 'Time Factors']",,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Public Health Rev. 1991-1992;19(1-4):191-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similar problems occur with water and air pollutants and with occupational exposures of many types.

(b) Interpretation of non-significant results as equivalent to no effect. (c) Accepting author's interpretation of a study, rather than examining its data independently for evidence of hazard. (d) Discounting data on unanticipated effects because of poor fit to preconceptions. (e) Dependence on threshold assumptions and demonstrations of dose-response relationships.

In the current study, we have examined the effect of increased membrane fatty acid unsaturation on insulin action. Friend Erythroleukemia cells were grown with exogenous polyunsaturated fatty acids for three days. After growth in medium supplemented with fatty acids, the unsaturation index of the phospholipids increased from 1.08 to 1.92, and this was associated with a significant decrease in anisotropy, as measured by fluorescence polarization. When measured at 15 degrees C, insulin receptor number rose from 9000 to 22,000 per cell with increased fatty acid unsaturation. The affinity for insulin in the polyunsaturated fatty acid treated cells decreased, however, resulting in similar amounts of insulin binding at low insulin concentrations but more binding at high insulin concentrations when compared to control cells. In contrast, binding of IGF-I was not influenced by increased membrane fatty acid unsaturation. When measured at 37 degrees C there were no changes in binding of insulin or IGF-I. Internalization of insulin was identical in control cells and in cells with increased membrane fatty acid unsaturation. Thymidine incorporation, an insulin-dependent function in these cell, was measured in control and fatty acid treated cells. In control cells, insulin increased thymidine incorporation by 80%, with an ED50 of about 5 nM. In cells treated with polyunsaturated fatty acids, the insulin stimulated thymidine incorporation was slightly higher and the ED50 was about 0.2 nM. In contrast, there was no increase in the sensitivity or responsiveness of fatty acid treated cells to IGF-I. We conclude that increased membrane fatty acid unsaturation greatly influences insulin binding and biological sensitivity, but not that of IGF-I. At low insulin levels, there was a greater insulin bioeffectiveness, despite the same or lower insulin binding, suggesting more efficient coupling of the insulin-effector complex.","['Ginsberg, B H', 'Chatterjee, P', 'Yorek, M A']","['Ginsberg BH', 'Chatterjee P', 'Yorek MA']","['Veterans Administration Medical Center, Iowa City, IA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Receptor,Receptor,9109671,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Membrane/chemistry', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/*metabolism', 'Fluorescence Polarization', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Insulin/*metabolism', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Membrane Lipids/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1/metabolism', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Receptor. 1991;1(3):155-66.,"['0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)']",,,,['AM 25295/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Intermediate-grade lymphomas, especially diffuse large-cell lymphomas, may be cured in 30% to 60% of the cases with aggressive combination chemotherapy. The high-grade lymphomas require treatment similar to regimens designed to treat acute lymphocytic leukemia, including central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis. Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are becoming more common in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and may be effectively controlled before the immunodeficiency becomes too severe. All patients with high-grade lymphoma and others at high risk should be tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

The current paper explores the nature of the factors in medium conditioned by THP-1 cells which inhibit cell growth and the effects of interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) on their synthesis. Activity inhibiting the growth of the MDA-MB-415 mammary carcinoma line migrated in a pH range of 6.5 to 7.5 and could be resolved into 2 peaks, one corresponding to interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and the other with an apparent average molecular weight of 43 Kd. Antisera against tumor necrosis factor alpha and beta (TNF alpha and beta) and monocyte colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) had no effect on the 43 Kd inhibitor. IFN gamma enhanced the secretion of IL-1, but decreased the production of the 43 Kd inhibitor. The L-929 cell cytotoxicity assay and an ELISA were used to show that the amount of TNF alpha present was less in medium from IFN gamma treated cells. THP-1 cells also produced an IFN gamma repressed activity separating at pH 4.8 to 6.1 which inhibited the response of T cells to IL-1 in a thymocyte co-mitogenic assay. The inhibitors expressed by THP-1 cells may be comparable to the cytotoxic and cytostatic activities expressed by activated human monocytes and macrophages.","['Gaffney, E V']",['Gaffney EV'],"['Department of Research, Baptist Medical Center, Birmingham, AL 35213.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Scotland,Growth Regul,Growth regulation,9106990,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Chromatography, Gel', '*Diterpenes', 'Growth Inhibitors/biosynthesis/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Immune Sera', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/metabolism', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Lymphotoxin-alpha/immunology/physiology', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/immunology/physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Terpenes/pharmacology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/immunology/metabolism/physiology']",,1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Growth Regul. 1991 Sep;1(3):85-94.,"['0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Lymphotoxin-alpha)', '0 (Terpenes)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '34807-41-5 (mezerein)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,"['CA 44677/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 45143/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

It is also effective for treatment of patients with gastric carcinoma, liver carcinoma, tumor of head and neck or leukemia. Pharmacologic studies showed that it could depress S phase of tumor cells significantly and cause formation of cellular chromatid breaks. By means of alkaline elution and nick translation methods it has been proved that HCPT induced DNA single strand breaks remarkably. Homoharringtonine (HHRT) was shown to be effective against acute leukemia. Recent experiments in tumor-bearing mice indicated that (HHRT) could diminish tumor metastasis. Using molecular hybridization technique it was demonstrated that (HHRT) decreased the content of c-myc RNA in the cytoplasm but not in the nuclei. Lycobetaine (LBT) possessed strong inhibitory effects on a number of ascites tumors. In clinical trials it was effective against ovarian and gastric carcinomas. It is able to intercalate into DNA. Oxalysine (OXL) is a new antibiotic and shown to be effective against tumor metastatis. When used in combination with 5-FU, its anticancer action could be enhanced.

The MST of rh-TNF--treated mice was longer than that of control animals. The longest survivals were observed in mice treated with 250 and 275 micrograms/kg of rh-TNF. Groups of mice receiving a combination of rh-TNF at doses of 225 or 250 micrograms/kg and MTX lived longer than animals treated with these agents separately. We observed the longest survival time of mice treated with combined administration of rh-TNF at a dose of 250 micrograms/kg and CY, but survival time was not significantly prolonged compared with mice receiving only CY. Additional studies were performed to examine the influence of rh-TNF administered as a single agent or in combination with toxic doses of CY or MTX on the number of granulocytes, lymphocytes, erythrocytes with hematocrit values and hemoglobin concentration, and platelets in peripheral blood, and the number of mononuclear cells as well as multipotential stem cells (CFU-GEMM) in bone marrow. Rh-TNF caused dose-dependent suppression of mononuclear cells and multipotential stem cells in bone marrow. The addition of MTX to rh-TNF caused no enhanced suppression of any of the above mentioned hematological parameters.

Developments in the methodology of genetic investigation have clarified the molecular alterations brought about by the appearance of the Philadelphia chromosome. It is possible that the hybrid bcr/abl gene plays an important role in the pathogenesis of CML by subverting the mechanism of homeostasis through the uncoordinated activation of cell growth stimulating and regulating factors. Further improvements have been brought about by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) which permits an indirect identification of the fusion gene and the study of minimal residual disease during remission after chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Clinical trials have shown that alpha-interferon, alone or in association with chemotherapy, induces long term clinical and cytogenetic remission in those CML patients in whom BMT from either related or unrelated donors cannot be performed. Allogeneic BMT seems to be the treatment of choice in younger people. However, since a minority of subjects have HLA identical siblings, the possibility of using unrelated donors to provide long term disease free survival has been explored even if the availability of a compatible donor is the primary limiting factor. The development of in vivo and in vitro purging procedures has aroused new interest in autologous bone marrow transplantation. This procedure benefits particularly from biotherapeutic agents which selectively act on the marrow by suppressing bcr/abl positive cells.","['Polli, E E', 'Pozzoli, E', 'Annaloro, C']","['Polli EE', 'Pozzoli E', 'Annaloro C']","['Istituto di Scienze Mediche, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,Ann Ital Med Int,Annali italiani di medicina interna : organo ufficiale della Societa italiana di medicina interna,8806705,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*etiology/genetics/immunology/therapy', 'Oncogenes', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Prognosis', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",19,1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Ital Med Int. 1991 Oct-Dec;6(4 Pt 2):491-7.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence for involvement of ferritin in globin gene expression.,17566-72,"We have isolated non-globin cDNA clones specific for erythroid differentiation from K562 human erythroleukemia cells and have identified those that may regulate globin gene transcription. A cDNA library was constructed from K562 cells induced by hemin for production of embryonic and fetal hemoglobins and screened against cDNA from uninduced K562 cells. Full-length clones specific for induced K562 cells were ligated into a eukaryotic expression vector and transfected into HeLa cells to allow for production of the corresponding coded polypeptide. The ability to increase epsilon- or gamma-globin promoter activity was identified using cotransfection with a second vector containing a globin gene promoter fused to a reporter gene. Six of the induced K562-specific clones exhibited the ability to increase the levels of the reporter genes, bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and human growth hormone. Sequencing analyses of these clones indicated that five were homologous to ferritin heavy and light chains and one had no homology with known DNA or protein sequences. The ferritin light chain cDNA had the greatest effect on globin gene promoter activation, increasing the gamma-globin promoter activity by 6-8-fold. The activation of the globin gene promoter in the absence of globin gene translation suggests that ferritin (or iron) may have a direct role in globin gene transcription. The subtractive library cloning strategy has enabled us to isolate cDNA clones that activate specific gene promoter without the requirement of direct DNA binding. This approach may allow further identification of the genes encoding proteins that are involved in the control of erythropoiesis.","['Wu, Y J', 'Noguchi, C T']","['Wu YJ', 'Noguchi CT']","['Laboratory of Chemical Biology, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA', 'Ferritins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1991/09/15 00:00,1991/09/15 00:01,['1991/09/15 00:00'],"['1991/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1991 Sep 15;266(26):17566-72.,"['9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)']",,['S0021-9258(19)47409-7 [pii]'],,,,,"['GENBANK/M69023', 'GENBANK/S53397', 'GENBANK/S53399', 'GENBANK/S53401', 'GENBANK/S53403', 'GENBANK/S56709', 'GENBANK/S56712', 'GENBANK/S69701', 'GENBANK/S69703', 'GENBANK/S69705']",,,,,,,

It is also strongly expressed on platelets, among other cells, where it shows the property of mediating platelet activation and aggregation upon binding with mAbs. The primary structure has been elucidated by cloning the cDNA from a lambda gt11 expression vector library constructed with megakaryocytic mRNA. Monoclonal antibodies were used as probes with an APAAP amplification of the signal. The 5' region was further cloned in a lambda gt10 randomly primed cDNA library. The initiation codon was immediately followed by a sequence coding for the tetrapeptide corresponding to the NH2-terminal sequence identified in a microsequencing procedure. Only one species of mRNA was found with an estimated size of 1.4 kilobase. CD9 antigen appears to be a 227-amino acid molecule with four hydrophobic domains and one N-glycosylation site. Sequence and structural comparisons showed extensive similarity of the CD9 antigen with a 237-amino acid molecule described previously as the human melanoma-associated antigen ME491 and a Schistosoma mansoni membrane protein of 218 amino acids.

Leukosialin is heavily glycosylated by O-linked oligosaccharides (70-80 oligosaccharides/molecule) and the structures of those O-glycans are characteristic to each cell lineage and differentiation stage. In particular, the branched hexasaccharide, NeuNAc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----3(NeuNAc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----6)GalNAc is specifically expressed in activated T-lymphocytes as well as in thymocytes and T-lymphocytes from patients with leukaemia, and immuno-deficiency syndromes. A portion of these O-glycans are attached to a domain with tandem repeats in the polypeptide of leukosialin. However, the entire translation product, including such tandem repeats, is coded by one exon and a short novel promoter sequence confers the expression of the leukosialin gene. Leukosialin is apparently involved in T-cell-B-cell interaction during immune reaction and binds to ligands on antigen-presenting B-cells.

Two recently cloned genes, RAG1 and RAG2, are sufficient to induce rearrangements of synthetic substrates when transfected into fibroblasts. In order to determine at which differentiation steps where the human RAG are expressed and in order to investigate the possible impairment of their expression by the leukemic process, we have recently studied a large series of B and T lymphoid neoplasias. We show that RAG are expressed in almost all sIg- B-ALL but not in the sIg+ B cell proliferations we have tested. Furthermore, we show that RAG can be expressed not only by CD3-TCR negative but also by CD3-TCRab or gd positive T-ALL cells. We conclude that the recombinase activity is not turned off by the expression of a functionnal T-cell receptor on the cell surface. This observation is in line with recent studies on RAG expression in human thymus and are of major interest to understand the set up of the TCR repertoire.","['Bories, J C', 'Sigaux, F']","['Bories JC', 'Sigaux F']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie Moleculaire, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol,Nouvelle revue francaise d'hematologie,7909092,IM,,"['Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*genetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'CD3 Complex', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*physiology', 'Genes, RAG-1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic/genetics', 'Thymus Gland/cytology']",,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol. 1991;33(6):521-3.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",['RAG'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Maximal cell proliferation was obtained in the presence of a mixture of H9 leukemic cells and normal PBL. More importantly, under these culture conditions, 30%-50% of these cells were found to express CD16 surface antigen after 1-2 weeks of culture. Similar proportions of CD16+ cells could be detected in CD3-4- thymocyte populations that had been further depleted of CD16+ cells. Cloning of CD3-4-16- thymocytes under limiting dilution conditions resulted, in the presence of H9 cells, in more than 50% of CD16+ clones (cloning efficiency 3%-8%). Since some of the surface CD3- clones expressed cytoplasmic CD3 antigen, it has been possible to identify four distinct phenotypic groups of clones (CD16+cyCD3+, CD16+cyCD3-, CD16-cyCD3+, CD16-cyCD3-). Independently of their phenotype, all thymus-derived CD3- clones expressed a strong cytolytic activity against natural killer (NK)-sensitive and NK-resistant tumour target cells. In addition, following stimulation with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (or PHA alone) all clones released interferon-gamma and tumour necrosis factor-alpha, but not IL-2. Taken together, our data provide evidence that cells which share their phenotypic and functional properties with CD3-CD16+ NK cells can be derived from thymic precursors.","['Mingari, M C', 'Poggi, A', 'Bellomo, R', 'Pella, N', 'Moretta, L']","['Mingari MC', 'Poggi A', 'Bellomo R', 'Pella N', 'Moretta L']","['Istituto di Oncologia Clinica e Sperimentale, Universita di Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Int J Clin Lab Res,International journal of clinical & laboratory research,9206491,IM,,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells/cytology', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Phytohemagglutinins', 'Receptors, Fc/analysis', 'Receptors, IgG', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thymus Gland/*cytology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/physiology/radiation effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Clin Lab Res. 1991;21(2):176-8. doi: 10.1007/BF02591639.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,['10.1007/BF02591639 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

CSF-1 is permanently present in serum and several biological fluids at stable concentrations and can thus be considered as a hormone. In vivo concentrations are mainly regulated by binding, internalization and degradation of the CSF-1 molecule by hepatic and splenic macrophage receptors. Very little is known about the organs and cell types responsible for in vivo CSF-1 synthesis. In vitro, CSF-1 regulates the survival, proliferation and differentiation of the monocyte-macrophage lineage from progenitors to mature cells and activates several important functions of mature tissular macrophages. Recent results obtained with injections of recombinant CSF-1 show that interesting activities, e.g., as ADCC, NK or antiinfectious effects, that had been initially observed in vitro can also be induced in vivo.

All TcR-gamma genes were rearranged except for one deleted allele and one allele in germline configuration. The expressed TcR-gamma protein chains showed a preference for V gamma l (11/13), J gamma 2.3 (7/13) and C gamma 2 (8/13). Furthermore, the TcR-gamma combinatorial repertoire appears to be even more limited by the fact that particular V gamma genes are preferentially used in TcR-gamma 1 or TcR-gamma 2 derived receptors, i.e. in disulfide-linked or non-disulfide-linked TcR-gamma delta receptors. The combinatorial repertoire of the expressed TcR-delta genes was homogeneous, as all thirteen T-ALL expressed V delta 1-D delta-J delta 1-C delta protein chains. In contrast to the limited combinatorial repertoire of the TcR-gamma and TcR-delta genes, the junctional diversity of both TcR genes was extensive due to insertion of N-region, P-region, and D delta gene nucleotides in addition to deletion of nucleotides by trimming. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-mediated amplification and subsequent direct sequencing, we determined the junctional region sequences of all TcR-gamma and TcR-delta rearrangements. Sequence analysis showed that in the TcR-gamma junctional regions insertion varied from 0 to 25 nucleotides (average 8.0) and deletion from 1 to 27 nucleotides (average 8.7). In TcR-delta junctional regions, nucleotide insertion varied from 5 to 47 nucleotides (average 25.5) and deletion from 0 to 29 nucleotides (average 6.2) per junctional region. In general, the N-region nucleotides were the most prominent element in the junctional regions, i.e. 97% of the TcR-gamma and 55% of the TcR-delta junctional regions. D delta genes contributed significantly (40%) to the TcR-delta junctional diversity, whereas P-regions were hardly found in both TcR genes. Altogether, the junctional regions of TcR-delta genes were far more diverse than the junctional regions of TcR-gamma genes. With respect to the new methods of detecting minimal residual disease (MRD) in lymphoid malignancies utilizing PCR-mediated amplification of the junctional regions of TcR genes, our data indicate that this MRD-PCR analysis will generally be more sensitive if TcR-delta instead of TcR-gamma junctional-region-specific probes are used.","['Breit, T M', 'Wolvers-Tettero, I L', 'Hahlen, K', 'van Wering, E R', 'van Dongen, J J']","['Breit TM', 'Wolvers-Tettero IL', 'Hahlen K', 'van Wering ER', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, University Hospital Dijkzigt/Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*genetics']",,1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 Dec;5(12):1076-86.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",,,,,,,,['Leukemia. 1992 Feb;6(2):169-70.

Such studies greatly enhance our understanding of both the cells of origin in these diseases and the order of assembly of immune receptor genes in B-cells and T-cells. The patterns of Ig and TCR genes in B-cell precursor and T-cell ALL of childhood and ALL of infancy are heterogeneous though generally distinctive. The vast majority of cases of B-cell precursor ALL of childhood rearrange Ig heavy (H) chain genes, and 40-50% rearrange Ig light (L) chain genes. In contrast, in ALL of infancy, Ig genes are frequently germline, indicating generally less mature cells of origin in younger patients. Similarly, the vast majority of cases of T-cell ALL of childhood rearrange TCR delta, gamma, and beta genes and approximately one-half rearrange TCR alpha. TCR gene rearrangements are very common in cases of B-cell precursor ALL, but in patterns different from T-cells. In contrast, T ALL cells only infrequently rearrange Ig genes, and TCR gamma rearrangements are not found in ALL of infancy. The demonstration of lineage non-restricted Ig and TCR gene rearrangements raises questions about lymphocyte development and about the 'precursor' nature of ALL. The identification of generally distinctive patterns of these genes creates a foundation for their utilization as markers of minimal and preclinical disease. The extent to which specific immune receptor gene patterns correlate with clinical outcome in ALL warrants further study.","['Felix, C A', 'Poplack, D G']","['Felix CA', 'Poplack DG']","['Pediatric Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clone Cells', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*genetics']",86,1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 Dec;5(12):1015-25.,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results showed a rather high frequency of mixed (C + T) ALL phenotype. The characteristic T ALL enzyme pattern (high ADA, low PNP) was present not only in T, but also in CD10+ T ALL blast cells. The T cell marker showed to be dominant in the determination of clinical course and prognostic significance in children with ALL; children with T and CD10+ T ALL phenotype, in contrast to C ALL phenotype, experienced more frequent relapses and a shorter event-free survival.","['Babusikova, O', 'Cap, J', 'Hrivnakova, A', 'Klobusicka, M', 'Mesarosova, A', 'Konikova, E']","['Babusikova O', 'Cap J', 'Hrivnakova A', 'Klobusicka M', 'Mesarosova A', 'Konikova E']","['Cancer Research Institute, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Czechoslovakia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,IM,,"['Acid Phosphatase/analysis', 'Adenosine Deaminase/*analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*enzymology/immunology/mortality', 'Male', 'Neprilysin', 'Phenotype', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/*analysis', 'Survival Rate']",,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Neoplasma. 1991;38(6):595-602.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interleukin 2 (IL-2)].,323-31,"Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is predominantly produced by T-helper cells (TH1) having the phenotype CD4+, and by subpopulations of thymocytes after antigenic or mitogenic stimulation. IL-2 causes an indefinite growth of T-cells, and its function depends on binding to IL-2 receptors (IL-2R alpha and IL-2R beta). Thus the immune response of T cells is controlled through the expression of the IL-2 receptors and the IL-2 binding. IL-2 receptors are expressed not only by T-cells but also by B-cells, NK cells, monocytes, thymocytes, thymic stroma cells, oligodendrocytes and endothelial cells. This explains the various functions of IL-2, such as increased immunoglobulin production, growth of certain B-cell subpopulations, macrophage-dependent cytotoxicity, growth and differentiation of oligodendrocytes and proliferation of lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells. Abnormal production of IL-2 may lead to autoimmune diseases, immunodeficiencies and, under certain circumstances, to T-cell leukemia. With antibodies against the IL-2 receptors the binding of IL-2 may be blocked to avoid auto-aggressive destruction in autoimmune diseases. LAK cells increase the growth of NK cells and T-cell cytotoxicity against transformed cells. LAK cells, especially those from tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, in conjunction with IL-2 have already been used with promising initial results in the treatment of distant metastases.

The phosphorylation of a prominent 98 kDa phosphoprotein (pp98) (pI approximately 6.5) in the particulate fraction of ELM-I-1 cells decreased markedly upon exposure of the cells to recombinant human Epo. The effect was rapid and transient, occurring within 1 min after Epo exposure, and disappearing within 15-30 min.

In all patients, the leukemic blasts coexpressed Ia (HLA-DR), CD9, CD19, CD20, CD24, and CD10. Five of six patients achieved complete remission, but one has so far relapsed. No leukemic blasts (CD10+, TdT+) were detected at the time of complete remission. During maintenance chemotherapy, leukemic blasts coexpressed C10 and TdT were found 2.32% in the patient's peripheral blood by two-color analysis, whereas no obvious leukemic cells were recognized morphologically. The patient relapsed leukemia with the same phenotype 4 weeks after the examination. On the basis of our findings, we suggest that two-color flow cytometric analysis with the use of these antibodies is quite valuable to detect the minimal residual leukemic cells in a patient with ALL. The reduction of leukemic cells below the threshold of detection of methods currently available appears to be necessary to achieve a cure in ALL. Hence accurate diagnosis of ALLs with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) should contribute substantially to the development of an effective form of therapy for their cure.","['Imamura, N', 'Kuramoto, A']","['Imamura N', 'Kuramoto A']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Hiroshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Neprilysin', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis']",,1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1991 Dec;38(4):332-4. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830380416.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,['10.1002/ajh.2830380416 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-1 also induces synthesis of colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) and sustains leukemic growth. An IL-1-specific inhibitor has been recently purified and cloned; this molecule binds to IL-1 receptors but has no IL-1 activity, fulfilling the characteristics of an IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). Because high-affinity binding sites for IL-1ra were shown on AML cells by radioligand binding studies, we studied the effect of IL-1ra on the proliferative activity of blast cells isolated from 16 cases of AML. In each case, spontaneous proliferation was inhibited by addition of the IL-1ra in a dose-dependent manner (1 to 100 ng/mL). Culture supernatants of unstimulated leukemic cells contained IL-1 beta and granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), but when incubated with the IL-1ra, a reduction or disappearance of GM-CSF was observed in 8 of 10 cases, whereas spontaneous IL-1 production was reduced in four of seven cases. By Northern hybridization, IL-1 beta gene transcripts were shown in 20 of 23 AML cases, whereas IL-1ra-specific messenger RNA was present in only two of the patients studied. These data show a role for IL-1 in the spontaneous proliferation and cytokine production of AML cells and suggest that an imbalanced synthesis of IL-1 and of its natural receptor antagonist may contribute to the unrestricted growth of AML cells.","['Rambaldi, A', 'Torcia, M', 'Bettoni, S', 'Vannier, E', 'Barbui, T', 'Shaw, A R', 'Dinarello, C A', 'Cozzolino, F']","['Rambaldi A', 'Torcia M', 'Bettoni S', 'Vannier E', 'Barbui T', 'Shaw AR', 'Dinarello CA', 'Cozzolino F']","['Division of Hematology, Ospedali Riuniti, Bergamo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Binding, Competitive', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', '*Gene Expression', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein', 'Interleukin-1/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptors, Interleukin-1', 'Recombinant Proteins', '*Sialoglycoproteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1991/12/15 00:00,1991/12/15 00:01,['1991/12/15 00:00'],"['1991/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1991 Dec 15;78(12):3248-53.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (IL1RN protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-1)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,['S0006-4971(20)65805-0 [pii]'],,['AI 15614/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Attention has been focussed on the role of community lifestyle indicators for small areas, derived from routine sources, in an ecological analysis. The predominant conditions were acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)--42.4%, and Hodgkin's disease (HD)--37.5%. Lowest overall incidence at approximately 8 years of age corresponded to the termination of the childhood peak for ALL. Opposite trends of incidence rates with distance from urban centres (urban distance) were observed for the two age groups: odds ratios (OR) for areas greater than 20 km from towns and cities were 1.46 (95% confidence interval 1.01-2.12) for ages 0-7 and 0.75 (95% confidence interval 0.56-0.99) for ages 8-24. For the younger group this was entirely attributable to ALL. HD, which was dominant in the older group, had highest incidence in connurbations but the gradient of risk for older onset ALL followed the overall pattern for this age group. A positive relationship with socioeconomic status was evident for both age groups but this was considerably stronger for the older cases (OR = 1.16, 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.33) than for the younger for whom it was not independent of urban distance. These results display an association between expression of lymphoid malignancies in young people and urban distance which is not attributable to socioeconomic status; for urban distances the distribution is shifted towards ALL and towards younger age at onset.","['Alexander, F E', 'Ricketts, T J', 'McKinney, P A', 'Cartwright, R A']","['Alexander FE', 'Ricketts TJ', 'McKinney PA', 'Cartwright RA']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre for Clinical Epidemiology, University of Leeds, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'England/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Life Style', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Urban Population', 'Wales/epidemiology']",,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1991;27(11):1486-90. doi: 10.1016/0277-5379(91)90037-e.,,,['10.1016/0277-5379(91)90037-e [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The effects of mAbs specifically blocking the p55 and p75 IL-2R on the generation of proliferative and cytotoxic functions were studied following anti-CD3 mAb stimulation. A significant difference was observed in the expression of p55 and p75 antigens on LDGL cells under resting conditions: a low number of p55 IL-2R+ (mean 1.2 +/- 0.4%) and high values of p75 IL-2R+ cells (54.9 +/- 7.4%). Accordingly, a barely detectable message for the p55 IL-2R and a strong signal for the p75 IL-2R mRNA were demonstrated. Following activation with anti-CD3 or IL-2, different patterns of IL-2R expression were observed. Anti-CD3 mAb induced an increase in the expression of the p55 IL-2R both at the mRNA and antigen level, whereas the p75 values remained consistently raised. In contrast, IL-2 induced the expression of p55 IL-2R mRNA associated with only a slight expression of this antigen. This finding was associated with a decrease in the cell expression of the p75 IL-2R, whereas the amount of p75 mRNA was unchanged. Both anti-CD3 mAb and IL-2 induced cell proliferation and cytotoxicity against the K-562 target cells. Anti-p55 IL-2R mAb did not affect the cytotoxic activity mediated by anti-CD3, but it markedly inhibited cell proliferation. Anti-p75 mAb did not inhibit either lytic function or cell proliferation mediated by anti-CD3 mAb, suggesting that only the high affinity IL-2R (p55 plus p75) is involved in anti-CD3 mediated cell activation in LDGL patients. This mechanism is different from that responsible for the IL-2 activation of CD3+ GL in LDGL patients, which is achieved through the p75 IL-2R alone. These results provide new insights into the pathophysiology of proliferating GL in LDGL patients and may also contribute to further characterization of the normal CD3+ GL population.","['Zambello, R', 'Cassatella, M A', 'Trentin, L', 'Bulian, P', 'Siviero, F', 'Feruglio, C', 'Agostini, C', 'Vespignani, M', 'Chisesi, T', 'Pizzolo, G']","['Zambello R', 'Cassatella MA', 'Trentin L', 'Bulian P', 'Siviero F', 'Feruglio C', 'Agostini C', 'Vespignani M', 'Chisesi T', 'Pizzolo G', 'et al.']","['Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*analysis', 'Blotting, Northern', 'CD3 Complex', 'Cell Separation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*analysis/genetics/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism']",,1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 Nov;5(11):942-50.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

European Co-operative Group for Bone Marrow Transplantation (EBMT).,896-904,"Fifty-nine European teams have reported 919 autografts for the consolidation of acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) up to December 31, 1989. The distribution for autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) was 671 in first complete remission (CR1) and 196 in CR2. Pretransplantation regimes were: total-body irradiation (TBI), 456; busulfan plus cyclophosphamide (BU-CY) 174; marrow purging with mafosfamide, 269 (corresponding to 26% of all patients in CR1 and 41% in CR2). Patients autografted in CR1 with no high risk factor (standard risk) had a leukemia-free survival (LFS) and relapse rate at 7 years of 48 +/- 2 and 41 +/- 3%, respectively. Of all the prognostic factors studied, only secondary leukemia was correlated with a poorer LFS (19 +/- 9% at 1 year) and a higher relapse rate (76 +/- 11%) (p less than 0.0001). For patients autografted in CR2, the LFS and relapse rate were 34 +/- 4 and 54 +/- 5%. With the restriction of a shorter follow-up, the results achieved with the BU-CY combinations (LFS and relapse rate at 3 years, CR1 47 +/- 6 and 45 +/- 7%; CR2, 37 +/- 9 and 50 +/- 10%) did not differ from those with TBI or other chemotherapy combinations. LFS and relapse rates were correlated with several pretransplant intervals: in CR1, patients reaching CR more rapidly (less than or equal to 40 days) had a better LFS (53 +/- 3 versus 42 +/- 3%; p = 0.03) and a lower relapse rate (46 +/- 3 versus 57 +/- 3%; p = 0.03). In patients autografted less than 3 months, 3-6 months and more than 6 months after CR, the LFS was 26 +/- 5, 49 +/- 3, and 55 +/- 4%, respectively, and the relapse rates 63 +/- 5, 38 +/- 3, and 36 +/- 4% (p less than 0.0001 for both). In CR2, patients autografted more than 18 months after the initial diagnosis had a better LFS (42 +/- 5 versus 24 +/- 5%; p less than 0.001) and a lower relapse rate (45 +/- 6 versus 65 +/- 6%; p less than 0.001). For those autografted less than 3 months, 3-6 months and more than 6 months after CR, the probability of LFS was 30 +/- 5, 30 +/- 7, and 50 +/- 9% (p = 0.06), respectively and the relapse rates 63 +/- 6, 50 +/- 8, and 36 +/- 8% (p = 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Gorin, N C', 'Labopin, M', 'Meloni, G', 'Korbling, M', 'Carella, A', 'Herve, P', 'Burnett, A', 'Rizzoli, V', 'Alessandrino, E P', 'Bjorkstrand, B']","['Gorin NC', 'Labopin M', 'Meloni G', 'Korbling M', 'Carella A', 'Herve P', 'Burnett A', 'Rizzoli V', 'Alessandrino EP', 'Bjorkstrand B', 'et al.']","['Department of Hematology, Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Hopital Saint Antoine, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Antineoplastic Agents', 'Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Busulfan', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/*analogs & derivatives', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*surgery', 'Male', 'Meta-Analysis as Topic', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",,1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 Oct;5(10):896-904.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5970HH9923 (mafosfamide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Simultaneous and continuous exposure (72 h) to these two agents had subadditive to protective effects (antagonism). Partial simultaneous exposure to methotrexate (5 h) and 6-MP (72 h) showed additive to protective effects. Sequential exposure to methotrexate (5 h) followed by 6-MP (72 h) had an additive effect at 0 h and a supra-additive effect (synergism) at 3 h and 19 h intervals. Therefore, it would seem to be better to avoid the simultaneous administration of methotrexate and 6-MP when these two drugs are used in combination.

Two photosensitizers (haematoporphyrin derivative (HPD) and rhodamine 123 (Rh-123) were analysed which can be irradiated at the same wavelength (514 nm), are preferentially taken up by tumour tissue and are not specific for the same target (membrane for HPD, mitochondria for Rh-123). The analysis of the phototoxic effects in surviving fractions showed a dependence on dose for both products and a dependence on incubation time for HPD but not Rh-123. The lethal dose for 50% cell death (LD50) for HPD increased from 25 to 56 J cm-2 when the HPD dose was reduced from 2.5 to 1 micrograms ml-1 for the same incubation time. When the incubation time was increased from 15 to 45 min, the surviving fraction decreased by 37% and 17% for doses of 1 and 2.5 micrograms ml-1 respectively. For low doses (0.5 and 1 microgram ml-1), the toxicity of the two photosensitizers added simultaneously was weaker than for Rh-123 alone, whereas for high doses (2.5 micrograms ml-1) the surviving fraction was less than that obtained with Rh-123 alone.

Intrinsic radiation sensitivity differed substantially among primary clonogenic blasts from 34 newly diagnosed patients. The mean D0 (37% dose slope), SF2 (surviving fraction at 200 cGy), and alpha values (initial slope of the survival curve) were 141 +/- 15 cGy, 0.31 +/- 0.04, and 0.630 +/- 0.093 Gy-1, respectively. Among newly diagnosed cases, nine had SF2 values of greater than or equal to 0.50 and alpha values of less than or equal to 0.2 Gy-1, consistent with a marked intrinsic radiation resistance at the level of clonogenic blasts using the multitarget and linear quadratic models of cell survival. Of these nine radiation resistant cases, seven were CD3+. Furthermore, the mean D0 (162 +/- 20.8 cGy) and SF2 (0.377 +/- 0.057) values for the 20 CD3+ cases were significantly higher than the D0 (108.6 +/- 18.2 cGy) and SF2 (0.204 +/- 0.051) values for the 14 CD3- cases (P less than or equal to .05). Thus, clonogenic blasts from CD3+ newly diagnosed T-lineage ALL patients were more resistant to radiation than clonogenic blasts from CD3- newly diagnosed T-lineage ALL patients. Nineteen T-lineage ALL patients received autologous bone marrow transplants during complete remission. Pretransplant conditioning consisted of total body irradiation (TBI) combined with high-dose chemotherapy. Primary clonogenic blasts from patients who relapsed after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) displayed a particularly high degree of intrinsic radiation resistance with a mean D0 value of 333 cGy and an alpha value of 0.112 Gy-1. The expression of CD3 antigen appeared to predict the outcome of relapsed T-lineage ALL patients undergoing autologous BMT after TBI plus high-dose chemotherapy. The Kaplan-Meier estimates and standard errors of the probability of remaining in remission after BMT were 60% +/- 22% (mean relapse - free interval = 1.6 +/- 0.7 years) for CD3- patients and 0% +/- 0% (mean relapse - free interval = 0.2 +/- 0.0 years) for CD3+ patients (P = .002). Furthermore, the mean percentage of CD3-positive leukemic marrow blasts at presentation or relapse before BMT was significantly lower than the mean percentage of CD3-positive leukemic marrow blasts at relapse after BMT. Notably, in cultured leukemic bone marrow specimens from newly diagnosed as well as relapsed patients, colony blasts surviving in vitro radiation expressed CD3 more vividly than did colony blasts in unirradiated cultures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Uckun, F M', 'Ramsay, N K', 'Waddick, K G', 'Jaszcz, W', 'Chandan-Langlie, M', 'Obuz, V', 'Haake, R', 'Gajl-Peczalska, K', 'Kersey, J H', 'Song, C W']","['Uckun FM', 'Ramsay NK', 'Waddick KG', 'Jaszcz W', 'Chandan-Langlie M', 'Obuz V', 'Haake R', 'Gajl-Peczalska K', 'Kersey JH', 'Song CW']","['Section of Cancer and Leukemia Biology, University of Minnesota Health Sciences Center, Minneapolis.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/pathology', 'CD3 Complex', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Survival/radiation effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clone Cells/radiation effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*analysis', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/physiology', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",,1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1991 Dec 1;78(11):2945-55.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",,['S0006-4971(20)75272-9 [pii]'],,"['R01 CA-42633/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA-44114/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 CA-42111/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,

Patients were excluded only for age greater than 50 years and Burkitt's leukemia. Treatment included a four-drug remission induction phase followed by alternating cycles of noncrossresistant chemotherapy and prolonged oral maintenance therapy. Eighty-eight percent of patients entered complete remission. With a median follow-up of 77 months (range, 48 to 111 months), 42% +/- 6% (SEM) of patients achieving remission are projected to remain disease-free at 5 years, and disease-free survival for all patients entered on study is 35% +/- 5%. Failure to achieve remission within the first 4 weeks of therapy and the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome are associated with a 100% risk of relapse. Remission patients with neither of these adverse features have a 48% +/- 6% probability of remaining in continuous remission for 5 years.

Treatment of Jurkat cells with phosphatidic acid, induced a mobilization of calcium ions arising exclusively from intracellular stores, suggesting that Ca2+ from intracellular compartments might play a key role in the inhibition of PS synthesis.

The high-affinity receptor for IgE (Fc epsilon RI) responsible for initiating these events is a complex structure composed of an IgE-binding alpha-chain, a beta-chain and a homodimer of gamma-chains. It has been assumed that beta and gamma, which have extensive cytoplasmic domains, play an important but undefined role in coupling Fc epsilon RI to signal transduction mechanisms. Here we show that Fc epsilon RI engagement induces immediate in vivo phosphorylation on beta (tyrosine and serine) and gamma (tyrosine and threonine) by at least two different non-receptor kinases. We take advantage of unique features of this receptor system to demonstrate that the phosphorylation signal is restricted to activated receptors and is immediately reversible upon receptor disengagement by undefined phosphatases. Rapid phosphorylation and dephosphorylation may be a general mechanism to couple and uncouple activated receptors to other effector molecules. This could be particularly relevant to other multimeric receptors containing Fc epsilon RI gamma-chains or the related zeta and eta chains such as the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) and the low-affinity receptor for immunoglobulin G (Fc gamma RIII, CD16).","['Paolini, R', 'Jouvin, M H', 'Kinet, J P']","['Paolini R', 'Jouvin MH', 'Kinet JP']","['Molecular Allergy and Immunology Section, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Maryland 20852.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nature,Nature,0410462,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Immunoglobulin E/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phosphoproteins/isolation & purification', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE']",,1991/10/31 00:00,1991/10/31 00:01,['1991/10/31 00:00'],"['1991/10/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/31 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/31 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nature. 1991 Oct 31;353(6347):855-8. doi: 10.1038/353855a0.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",,['10.1038/353855a0 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

It structurally resembles the H-2K, D, and L class I transplantation antigens, which present processed peptides to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Although their function(s) are unknown, there has been recent speculation concerning the possibility that class Ib molecules may present antigens to T cells that express gamma delta T cell antigen receptors (TCRs). In this report, using both a cell-cell adhesion assay and adhesion of T lymphocyte clones to purified plate-bound TLA, we provide evidence that TLA can bind to both human and mouse CD8. We also show that a chimeric class I molecule containing the peptide antigen binding site of Ld and the alpha 3 domain, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic segments of TLA, can support a CD8-dependent immune response by CTLs. These results demonstrate for the first time binding of a class Ib molecule to CD8 with a functional outcome, as is observed for the class I transplantation antigens. The capacity to interact with CD8 has been conserved despite the extensive sequence divergence of TLA in the peptide antigen binding site, suggesting this interaction is highly significant. TLA is expressed by epithelial cells in the mouse small intestine. As these epithelial cells are in close contact with intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes that are nearly all CD8+, and many of which express the gamma delta TCR, the data are consistent with the hypothesis that TLA is involved in antigen presentation, perhaps to gamma delta-positive lymphocytes in this site.","['Teitell, M', 'Mescher, M F', 'Olson, C A', 'Littman, D R', 'Kronenberg, M']","['Teitell M', 'Mescher MF', 'Olson CA', 'Littman DR', 'Kronenberg M']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California Los Angeles School of Medicine 90024.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'CD8 Antigens/*physiology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/physiology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/physiology']",,1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1991 Nov 1;174(5):1131-8. doi: 10.1084/jem.174.5.1131.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)']",,['10.1084/jem.174.5.1131 [doi]'],PMC2119000,"['CA-09120/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-52511/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-08042/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Three major proteins of molecular mass of 72, 92, and 110 kDa are targeted by antigen and a 110-kDa species by ionophore, A23187. The antigen- and ionophore-induced tyrosine phosphorylation responses are dose-dependent and correlate with increases in serotonin release from activated cells. The presence of extracellular Ca2+ is required to sustain the antigen- and ionophore-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation as well as mediator release. A protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, RG 50864, differentially inhibits the antigen-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation in the decreasing order of 72, 91, and 110-kDa proteins. The compound inhibition of the 72-kDa protein tyrosine phosphorylation correlates with that of serotonin release. In ionophore-stimulated cells, the inhibition of the 110-kDa protein tyrosine phosphorylation and serotonin release by RG 50864 occurs in parallel. These results suggest that the 72- and 110-kDa phosphoproteins may represent the respective regulators of serotonin release in antigen- and ionophore-activated cells. The 110-kDa tyrosine phosphorylated proteins from antigen- and ionophore-stimulated cells exhibit identical electrophoretic mobility and V8 protease-generated phosphopeptide maps, suggesting that these two proteins may be the same. These results provide new evidence that both the stimulatory actions of antigen and ionophore on mediator release are mediated through enhanced protein tyrosine phosphorylation in RBL-2H3 cells. Significantly, the present study suggests the presence of multiple tyrosine phosphorylation signaling pathways in RBL cells and that their selective utility may be determined by the nature of the stimulus.","['Yu, K T', 'Lyall, R', 'Jariwala, N', 'Zilberstein, A', 'Haimovich, J']","['Yu KT', 'Lyall R', 'Jariwala N', 'Zilberstein A', 'Haimovich J']","['Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Central Research, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania 19406.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['Animals', '*Antigens', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/physiology', 'Calcimycin/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/pharmacology', 'Catechols/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Dinitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoglobulin E/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Magnesium/pharmacology', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Phosphopeptides/isolation & purification', 'Phosphoproteins/analysis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/physiology', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Serotonin/*pharmacology', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/*pharmacology', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', '*Tyrosine', '*Tyrphostins']",,1991/11/25 00:00,1991/11/25 00:01,['1991/11/25 00:00'],"['1991/11/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/25 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1991 Nov 25;266(33):22564-8.,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Catechols)', '0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Phosphopeptides)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (dinitrophenyl-bovine serum albumin)', '118409-60-2 (tyrphostin 47)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,['S0021-9258(18)54609-3 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The parental cell line and a subline derived from this line have absolute dependency on several cytokines for their long-term survival and growth.

When these cytokines are depleted, both the parental and the subline cells die within several days, even in medium supplemented with fetal calf serum (FCS). F-36E, maintained in the presence of Epo, constitutively synthesizes hemoglobin at a significant level. F-36P, which is usually maintained in the presence of GM-CSF or IL-3, can be induced to synthesize hemoglobin when GM-CSF or IL-3 is substituted by Epo.

However, some monoclonal antibodies recognizing erythroid and platelet glycoproteins react with these cells. Thus, this cell line has a multilineage phenotype, suggesting that the transformation event occurred in a multipotent stem cell. It is also evident that the F-36 cells can be induced to differentiate into the erythroid lineage in the presence of Epo. This, to our knowledge, is the first description of a human leukemic cell line that can be stimulated to synthesize hemoglobin by Epo.","['Chiba, S', 'Takaku, F', 'Tange, T', 'Shibuya, K', 'Misawa, C', 'Sasaki, K', 'Miyagawa, K', 'Yazaki, Y', 'Hirai, H']","['Chiba S', 'Takaku F', 'Tange T', 'Shibuya K', 'Misawa C', 'Sasaki K', 'Miyagawa K', 'Yazaki Y', 'Hirai H']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Erythrocytes/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/pathology', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1991 Nov 1;78(9):2261-8.,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,['S0006-4971(20)82194-6 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work, we paid special attention to a nodular tumor, named MCL-YSK, developed at the subcutaneous transplant site. MCL-YSK was serially passaged in subcutaneous tissue of syngeneic rats up to the 19th generation. Transplants from MCL-YSK grew into nodules 3 cm in diameter and 11.3 g in weight 9 weeks after subcutaneous implantation. Neoplastic cells forming the nodules had azurophilic cytoplasmic granules, which ultrastructurally appeared to be lysosomes. The cells reacted positively for acid phosphatase and nonspecific esterase, but not for alkaline phosphatase, alpha-1 antitrypsin and lysozyme, nor reacted with anti-rat monocyte/macrophage monoclonal antibody and anti-rat CD-8 monoclonal antibody. They possessed Fc-receptor. Leukemic cells first appeared in the peripheral blood 6 weeks after transplantation when subcutaneous nodules reached an average diameter of one cm. Subsequently, leukemic changes progressed in recipients as MCL-YSK grew larger. The recipients died during the period from 8 to 12 weeks after transplantation, showing anemia, depression, splenohepatomegaly and lymph node enlargement. Diffuse or focal proliferation of sprinkled tumor cells was present in many organs. Hematologic changes suggestive of hemolytic anemia, elevated plasma enzymes and decreased drug-metabolizing enzymes, indicative of hepatic malfunction, were seen in transplant recipients. MCL-YSK was easily transplanted into athymic nude mice. The transplanted mice showed leukemic changes similar to those observed in rats with transplanted MCL-YSK.","['Yamate, J', 'Tajima, M', 'Shibuya, K', 'Saitoh, T', 'Ihara, M', 'Kudow, S']","['Yamate J', 'Tajima M', 'Shibuya K', 'Saitoh T', 'Ihara M', 'Kudow S']","['Nippon Institute for Biological Science, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,J Vet Med Sci,The Journal of veterinary medical science,9105360,IM,,"['Animals', 'Blood Cell Count/veterinary', 'Blood Chemical Analysis/veterinary', 'Female', 'Hepatomegaly', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology/*veterinary', 'Liver/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation/veterinary', 'Rats', '*Rats, Inbred F344', 'Rodent Diseases/pathology/*transmission', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Splenomegaly']",,1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Vet Med Sci. 1991 Aug;53(4):585-92. doi: 10.1292/jvms.53.585.,,,['10.1292/jvms.53.585 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

A socioeconomic status (SES) measure had been produced for each local government area (LGA) by principal components analysis of sociodemographic variables recorded at the 1981 census. A SES score from 1 to 10 was assigned to each death and cancer. Population data from the census were similarly scored. Age standardised rates for all cause mortality, for mortality from all causes other than cancer and for both incidence and mortality of total cancers, cancer of the stomach, colon, rectum, lung, female breast, cervix, uterus, prostate and bladder, and for melanoma, lymphoma and leukaemia were analysed as a function of SES decile using weighted linear regression. Despite the limited number of years of data and the misclassification of the SES score, analyses showed there were inequitable distributions of mortality, and of some major cancers, across social strata in Melbourne during the early 1980s. The incidences of cancer of the breast, colon, prostate and melanoma were all positively associated with SES, while the incidences of cancer of the stomach, lung and cervix demonstrated negative SES gradients. For cancers where incidence showed a significant SES gradient there was a similar SES gradient with mortality. These patterns are consistent with the literature and implicate SES differences in education and access to services.

CR patients received intensive consolidation. Bone marrow blast kinetics was studied before therapy with in vivo bromodeoxyuridine and bivariate flow cytometry. CR rate was 70.2%, median CR was 13.2 months, responsive patient survival was 16.9 months and overall survival was 9.2 months. Besides lower median age, the 33 responsive patients also had shorter potential doubling time (Tpot) and greater cell production rate (PR) than the 14 unresponsive patients (mean values = 10.9 vs. 25.4 days, P less than 0.05, and 14.7 vs. 8.9 cells/100 cells/day, P less than 0.02, respectively), due to a higher mean labelling index (7.0 vs. 5.1%, P less than 0.05) and/or to a shorter mean DNA synthesis time (13.6 vs. 18.6 hours, P less than 0.05). Besides lower white blood cell count and bone marrow blast percentage, patients who experienced CR longer than 13.2 months had shorter Tpot (P less than 0.05) and a greater PR (P less than 0.02) than those who relapsed before this time.

To define more clearly the mechanisms of homologous TXA2 receptor downregulation, the effects of the TXA2 mimetics U44069 ([15S)-hydroxy-9,11- (epoxymethano) prostadienoic acid] and I-BOP ([1S-(1 alpha 2 beta(5Z),3 alpha(1E,3S),4 alpha))-7-[3-(3-hydroxy-4- (p-iodophenoxy)-1-butenyl)-7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-yl]-5 -heptenoic acid) on receptor-mediated calcium fluxes and on ligand binding to TXA2 receptors were studied in the K562 cultured human leukemic cell line which possesses many platelet characteristics. Incubation with U44069 resulted in a time-dependent decrease in the amplitude of TXA2 receptor-mediated intracellular free calcium transients. Under the same conditions, binding of [125I] BOP demonstrated a concurrent loss of K562 plasma membrane binding sites to approximately one-third the original number. The loss of [125I]BOP binding was prevented by coincubation with the TXA2 antagonist SQ29548 ([1S-1 alpha,2 beta (5Z), 3 beta,4 alpha]-7- (3-[2-[phenylamino)-carbonyl) hydrazino) methyl)-7-oxabicyclo-(2.2.1)- heptan-2-yl)-5-heptenoic acid]) and was reversed upon removal of U44069 from the culture medium. SQ29548 alone had no affect on receptor density or affinity. Loss of surface receptors was demonstrated to be mediated by agonist-occupied receptor internalization which was inhibited by incubation at 4 degrees C and did not occur with antagonist occupation. The results indicate that homologous downregulation of TXA2 receptors in K562 cells occurs by agonist-mediated active internalization of plasma membrane TXA2 receptors.","['Dorn, G W 2nd']",['Dorn GW 2nd'],"['Department of Medicine/Cardiology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Ohio.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,IM,,"['Binding, Competitive', 'Blood Platelets', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds/metabolism/*pharmacology', '*Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Prostaglandin Endoperoxides, Synthetic/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Prostaglandin/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, Thromboxane', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 1991 Oct;259(1):228-34.,"['0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Prostaglandin Endoperoxides, Synthetic)', '0 (Receptors, Prostaglandin)', '0 (Receptors, Thromboxane)', '124924-85-2', ""(7-(3-(3-hydroxy-4-(4'-iodophenoxy)-1-butenyl)-7-oxabicyclo(2.2.1)heptan-2-yl)-5-"", 'heptenoic acid)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Fc epsilon RI gamma-chains form additional disulfide-linked dimers with the homologous zeta- and eta-chains, as part of the TCR complex. The low affinity receptor for IgG (Fc gamma RIII)2 on NK cells is also associated with zeta-chains. Here we show that the gamma-chain is expressed in NK cells both as a group of heterogenous gamma gamma homodimers and also as a heterodimer bound to zeta. Fc gamma RIIIA is associated with three types of dimers zeta zeta, gamma zeta, and notably gamma gamma as well. In fact, gamma gamma appears to be the predominant species associating with Fc gamma RIIIA. The surface expressed Fc epsilon RI also associates with the same group of heterogenous gamma gamma homodimers. We also show that there is no C-terminal posttranslational cleavage of gamma occurring before its insertion into the plasma membrane as previously suggested.

We have compared the hybridization pattern of the CALLA gene from leukemic and normal cells digested with several restriction enzymes. No alterations were noticed with Eco RI, Sac I, Pvu II, Eco RV, Hind III, and Msp I. Since CALLA is also found on other malignancies, we analyzed DNA samples prepared from cell lines derived from leukemia, lymphoma, glioblastoma, retinoblastoma, and neuroblastoma. Normal restriction patterns were observed for all the lines regardless of their CALLA phenotype. Having demonstrated previously that CALLA was structurally identical to neutral endopeptidase 3.4.24.11 (NEP), we have now established a correlation between surface expression of CALLA and NEP activity on leukemia samples and on several cell lines. Malignant cells tested expressed a functionally active enzyme and no gross alteration was present in the CALLA gene. The CD44 gene is expressed on most cells of hemopoietic origin and on greater than 95% of cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloblastic leukemia studied. It is also expressed on normal astrocytes and on malignant cells of glioma/astrocytoma types. We now report that a similar pattern of hybridization was observed with Sac I, Pvu II, and Eco RI for leukemic samples, normal cells, and malignant cell lines. A polymorphism was recently detected for CD44 using Hind III; leukemic cells and malignant lines also showed this normal polymorphism. Thus no deletion or insertion could be detected in the CD44 gene of leukemic cells and malignant lines, suggesting that no gross DNA alterations were involved. The correlation between surface expression and enzymatic activity of CD10/CALLA and the expression of CD44 on a variety of malignant cells would suggest that the structure and function of these two gene products are probably not altered by the process of transformation.","['Kee, B L', 'Dadi, H K', 'Tran-Paterson, R', 'Quackenbush, E J', 'Andrulis, I L', 'Letarte, M']","['Kee BL', 'Dadi HK', 'Tran-Paterson R', 'Quackenbush EJ', 'Andrulis IL', 'Letarte M']","['Division of Immunology and Cancer Research, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,,"['Antigens, CD/*genetics', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*genetics', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line', 'Child', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Neprilysin', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/*genetics', 'Restriction Mapping']",,1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1991 Sep;148(3):414-20. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041480312.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,['10.1002/jcp.1041480312 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Their isolation was based on the exclusive expression of two surface antigens, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and the common acute lymphoblastic leukaemia antigen (CALLA/CD10/neutral endopeptidase 24.11). Sorted luminal and myoepithelial cells displayed distinctively different morphologies when maintained in monolayer culture, differences which were enhanced by the addition of hydrocortisone, insulin and cholera toxin to the culture medium. The EMA-positive cells formed an attenuated monolayer with indistinct cell boundaries while CALLA-positive cells, by contrast, formed tightly packed arrays of refractile cells. The distribution of the cell type-specific markers cytokeratin 18 (luminal cells) and smooth muscle alpha-actin (myoepithelial cells) indicated that the sorted populations were approximately 98% pure. However, a significant minority (approximately 15%) of sorted luminal cells consistently expressed the basal-cell marker cytokeratin 14 in culture. A marked difference was noted in the proliferative behaviour of the two types of sorted cells, with myoepithelial cells dividing rapidly in response to the humoural additives, in contrast to the luminal cells which proliferated slowly. Both types of sorted cells could be cloned in the presence of feeder layers of mouse fibroblasts. Clones of luminal and myoepithelial cells were also distinctive; all ""spread"" luminal clones were similar in appearance to each other, although some cellular heterogeneity, including squamous metaplasia, was observed in ""compact"" myoepithelial clones. Both types were shown to have retained their original surface markers and to exhibit different cytoskeletal antigenic phenotypes when they were re-analysed after a 3-week growth period. Both spread and compact phenotypes were obtained when separately isolated ducts and alveoli were cloned. This detailed characterization of cells isolated from the human breast epithelium by flow cytometry provides the basis for further studies of luminalmyoepithelial interactions and growth responses of purified cell types in vitro.","[""O'Hare, M J"", 'Ormerod, M G', 'Monaghan, P', 'Lane, E B', 'Gusterson, B A']","[""O'Hare MJ"", 'Ormerod MG', 'Monaghan P', 'Lane EB', 'Gusterson BA']","['Royal Cancer Hospital, Haddow Laboratories, Sutton, Surrey, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Differentiation,Differentiation; research in biological diversity,0401650,IM,,"['Antigens, Differentiation/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/biosynthesis', 'Breast/*cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/analysis', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Epithelium/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Microscopy, Phase-Contrast', 'Mucin-1', 'Neprilysin']",,1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Differentiation. 1991 Apr;46(3):209-21. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-0436.1991.tb00883.x.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Mucin-1)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,"['S0301-4681(11)60252-1 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1432-0436.1991.tb00883.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Protein kinase C (PKC) activation, and intracellular free Ca2+ mobilization, initiated by phorbol esters and calcium ionophores, respectively, not only acted independently but, more interestingly, their effects were antagonistic, suggesting a role for these signals during T cell differentiation. The Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin, increased the levels of intracellular free Ca2+ and induced the expression of the gamma and delta chains of the T cell antigen receptor in a concentration-dependent manner. The phorbol ester 12-myristate 13-acetate down-regulated the basal gamma TcR expression with marginal effect on delta TcR mRNA, but diminished the induction of both gamma and delta TcR, initiated by the Ca2+ ionophore. These antagonistic effects of the two arms of the phospholipase C-mediated signal transduction pathways, i.e. PKC activation and increased intracellular free Ca2+, were specific to the regulation of the gamma and delta TcR, since the same signals exerted a synergistic effect on the mRNA levels of interleukin 2 receptor. These data confirm our hypothesis that the antagonistic regulation on the gamma and delta TcR gene expression by phorbol esters and calcium ionophores occurs in the same cell, and stresses the biological significance of PKC activation and intracellular free calcium mobilization during intrathymic differentiation and selection.","['Martinez-Valdez, H', 'Takihara, Y', 'Champagne, E', 'Minden, M', 'Mak, T W', 'Cohen, A']","['Martinez-Valdez H', 'Takihara Y', 'Champagne E', 'Minden M', 'Mak TW', 'Cohen A']","['Division of Immunology/Rheumatology, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,IM,,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-2/genetics', 'Ionomycin/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Protein Kinase C/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/genetics', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1991 Oct;21(10):2625-8. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830211048.,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,['10.1002/eji.1830211048 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The most common side effects were mild and have included fever, malaise, headache, myalgias, and pain at the injection site. Adverse events causing interruption of therapy were seizures, aseptic necrosis, and myelofibrosis. alpha-IFN stabilizes the chronic phase of Ph+ CML in some children, is adequately tolerated when administered at a dose of 2.5 to 5 x 10(6) U/m2/d intramuscularly, and results in a significant decrease in the proportion of Ph+ metaphases in some patients. alpha-IFN in combination with an effective cytoreductive agent or agents appears worthy of further clinical testing in this disease.","['Dow, L W', 'Raimondi, S C', 'Culbert, S J', 'Ochs, J', 'Kennedy, W', 'Pinkel, D P']","['Dow LW', 'Raimondi SC', 'Culbert SJ', 'Ochs J', 'Kennedy W', 'Pinkel DP']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Eruptions/etiology', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Remission Induction']",,1991/10/15 00:00,1991/10/15 00:01,['1991/10/15 00:00'],"['1991/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1991 Oct 15;68(8):1678-84. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19911015)68:8<1678::aid-cncr2820680803>3.0.co;2-j.,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,['10.1002/1097-0142(19911015)68:8<1678::aid-cncr2820680803>3.0.co;2-j [doi]'],,['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Mature donor T cells were essential for complete chimerism when host mice (AKR, H-2k) were conditioned with suboptimal irradiation (9 Gy = LD50). Transplantation of donor BM (B10.BR, H-2k) resulted in mixed chimerism, whereas mice given BM containing additional T cells developed into complete and stable chimeras. Depletion of T cell subsets was associated with an increase in the frequency of mixed chimerism. The incidence of lethal GVHD was dependent on the number of T cells added to the BM inoculum. Ex vivo depletion of CD4+ T cells eliminated GVH-associated mortality. Removal of CD8+ T cells had no effect on overall survival. In contrast to the GVH results, removal of either CD4+ or CD8+ T cells compromised GVL reactivity, indicating that an optimal GVL response required both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. T cell-subset depletion did not interfere with the induction of donor-host tolerance in these chimeras and may have facilitated its development. The loss of GVH/GVL effector cells as a result of T cell depletion and the development of donor-host tolerance may act synergistically to prevent or suppress GVH and GVL reactivity.","['Truitt, R L', 'Atasoylu, A A']","['Truitt RL', 'Atasoylu AA']","['Department of Pediatrics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology/*pathology', 'CD4 Antigens/*immunology', 'CD8 Antigens/*immunology', 'Chimera', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/immunology/*pathology', 'Histocompatibility/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Mice', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/immunology/*pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology/*pathology']",,1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1991 Jul;8(1):51-8.,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)']",,,,['CA-39854/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Recently, two genes, RAG1 and RAG2, that are able to activate rearrangement of synthetic recombination substrates were cloned in mouse and a human gene homologous to RAG1 was described. To define the differentiation stages corresponding to RAG1 and RAG2 RNA expression, we have studied a large number of B- and T-lymphoid neoplasias. First, we show that a human gene homologous to the murine RAG2 is transcribed in humans. Moreover, using a polymerase chain reaction approach, we have shown that RAG are expressed not only in T-cell receptor (TCR)-negative T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALLs), but also in some cases in which a significant percentage of cells expressed surface TCR. Absence of RAG expression was shown in certain T-ALLs at variable stages of thymic differentiation. Data obtained in B-lineage ALLs show that RAG RNAs are expressed in almost all slg- B-lineage ALLs but are not transcribed in the slg+ B-cell proliferations tested, including Burkitt's ALLs, follicular center cell lymphomas, and chronic leukemias. These findings are consistent with the involvement of RAG in the control of in vivo V-(D)-J recombinations.

Before transplantation, eight of nine patients tested had less than 10% CD3+TCR gamma delta+ cells. Consistent increased numbers of gamma delta cells up to eightfold the pretransplant level can be seen in four of nine patients tested within the first 4 months after BMT. The large majority of early posttransplant gamma delta and alpha beta T cells express the CD45RO antigen, which is usually expressed on ""memory"" cells only. The V-region usage of the TCR gamma delta+ T cells was analyzed using fresh mononuclear cells and MoAbs against known V gamma and V delta regions. For more detailed analysis, CD3+TCR gamma delta+ cells were sorted and cultured in bulk and cloned. Using fresh cells and bulk cultures, mainly V gamma 9+V delta 1-V delta 2+ cells were found during engraftment. Only after 6 weeks post-BMT, V gamma 9-V delta 1+V delta 2- cells appear. Analysis of the V gamma and V delta usage at the clonal level confirmed the observation that early after BMT only V gamma 9+V delta 2+ cells are present, whereas gamma delta T-cell clones expressing other gamma delta TCR phenotypes can only be detected 4 to 6 weeks post-BMT. The predominance of V gamma 9+ cells during early engraftment could be explained by several mechanisms: (A) sequential rearrangements during T-cell development, leading to an early wave of V gamma 9+ cells, or (B) selective outgrowth of preexisting V gamma 9+V delta 2+CD45RO+ TCR gamma delta cells in the bone marrow graft, possibly as a result of antigen driven expansion due to exposure to environmental antigens.","['van der Harst, D', 'Brand, A', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs, S A', 'Kooij-Winkelaar, Y M', 'Zwaan, F E', 'Koning, F']","['van der Harst D', 'Brand A', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs SA', 'Kooij-Winkelaar YM', 'Zwaan FE', 'Koning F']","['Department of Immunohaematology and Bloodbank, University Hospital, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology/therapy', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1991 Oct 1;78(7):1875-81.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",,['S0006-4971(20)81106-9 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

If an additional increment of radiation could be delivered to lymphohematopoietic tissues with relative specificity, the relapse rate may decrease without a marked increase in toxicity. We have examined the biodistribution of two 131I-labeled monoclonal antibodies reactive with the CD45 antigen in Macaca nemestrina. Three animals received 0.5 mg/kg BC8, an IgG1 of low avidity (6 x 10(7) L/mol). Three received 0.5 mg/kg AC8, an IgG2a of moderate avidity (5 x 10(8) L/mol), and two received 4.5 mg/kg AC8. Estimates of radiation absorbed dose demonstrated that these antibodies could deliver up to five times more radiation to lymph nodes, and up to 2.6 times more to bone marrow, than to lung or liver. The higher avidity AC8 antibody at 0.5 mg/kg was cleared more rapidly from blood and resulted in lower antibody uptake in lymph nodes than did BC8 at 0.5 mg/kg. Increasing the dose of AC8 to 4.5 mg/kg resulted in slower blood clearance and higher lymph node uptake. These studies suggest that radiolabeled anti-CD45 antibodies can deliver radiation with relative specificity to lymphohematopoietic tissues. This approach, in combination with marrow transplantation, may improve treatment of hematologic malignancies.","['Matthews, D C', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Eary, J F', 'Hui, T E', 'Fisher, D R', 'Martin, P J', 'Durack, L D', 'Nelp, W B', 'Press, O W', 'Badger, C C']","['Matthews DC', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Eary JF', 'Hui TE', 'Fisher DR', 'Martin PJ', 'Durack LD', 'Nelp WB', 'Press OW', 'Badger CC', 'et al.']","['Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Autoradiography', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/*immunology', '*Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Kinetics', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism', 'Lymphoid Tissue/*metabolism', 'Macaca nemestrina', 'Male', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radioimmunotherapy', 'Tissue Distribution']",,1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1991 Oct 1;78(7):1864-74.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",,['S0006-4971(20)81105-7 [pii]'],,['CA44991/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Folinic acid rescue dose in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.,1006-9,"The effect of folinic acid rescue dose on the event-free survival of 71 children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia was examined in a retrospective clinical study. All patients, diagnosed between 1 January 1980 and 1 January 1989, were treated according to the Norwegian Pilot protocol which included eight courses of high dose (6-8 g/m2/24 h intravenous infusion) methotrexate. Following the infusion, a uniform dose of 75 mg (at 36 h after the beginning of the drug infusion) and 15 mg (at 39-106 h) folinic acid rescue was administered to all patients, at predetermined intervals. The uniformity of the rescue dose resulted in distribution of dosages in the range of 38-140 mg/m2 and 7.5-28 mg/m2 for the different periods, respectively, when the dose was recalculated on the basis of the body surface area of the individual patients. The event-free survival of children receiving less or more than 15 mg/m2 (75 mg/m2) rescue dose was compared. Although no significant difference was found, a tendency was observed for a lower risk of relapse in patients receiving less folinic acid. No major methotrexate-related toxicity was observed in the group of patients receiving the lower dose of rescue. These observations suggest that the reduction of folinic acid rescue dose below the generally accepted 12-15 mg/m2 dose may increase the efficacy of high-dose methotrexate therapy while still remaining safe in preventing treatment-related toxicity. Prospective, randomised clinical trials are needed to examine the role of rescue as a determinant of effective exposure to methotrexate in patients receiving high-dose methotrexate treatment.","['Borsi, J D', 'Wesenberg, F', 'Stokland, T', 'Moe, P J']","['Borsi JD', 'Wesenberg F', 'Stokland T', 'Moe PJ']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Semmelweis Medical School, Budapest, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leucovorin/*administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1991;27(8):1006-9. doi: 10.1016/0277-5379(91)90269-j.,"['Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,['10.1016/0277-5379(91)90269-j [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The second phase of the emission (20-90 microseconds) was due mainly to singlet oxygen. Evidence supporting the assignment of the second phase emission to singlet oxygen included a spectral analysis showing a peak near 1270 nm and reductions in the second phase emission caused by the singlet oxygen quenchers, histidine, carnosine, and water. The second phase emission decayed in a biexponential manner with lifetimes of 4.5 +/- 0.5 and 49 +/- 4 microseconds.

A marked and dose-dependent increase in the percentage of CD23+ cells, as well as in the mean channel fluorescence intensity, as demonstrated by FACS analysis, was noted after 8- to 72-h incubation of U937 cells with 1 to 1000 U/ml of human rIL-6. Furthermore, rIL-4 synergized with rIL-6 and rIFN-tau in augmenting the Fc epsilon RII expression on U937 cells, whereas rIFN-tau and rIL-6 showed rather additive effects. The enhancement of CD23 expression on IL-6-treated U937 cells was blocked by anti-IL-6 antibodies. Northern blot analysis, employing cDNA probes for Fc epsilon RII, showed that U937 cells contain Fc epsilon RII-specific mRNA. The level of Fc epsilon RII-encoding mRNA was evidently increased by treatment of U937 cells with human rIL-6, rIL-4, or with rIL-6 + rIL-4. The expression of CD23 on THP-1 and Mono-Mac-6 cells was increased slightly by rIL-6 and markedly by rIL-4, rIFN-tau, or a mixture of them. Approximately 14% of blood monocytes, isolated from apparently healthy donors, constitutively possess Fc epsilon RII. In contrast to the cell lines, the Fc epsilon RII density and the percentage of blood monocytes bearing Fc epsilon RII was not augmented by IL-6. Furthermore, rIL-6, and more evidently rIFN-tau, down-regulate rIL-4-driven Fc epsilon RII expression on monocytes but not on monocytic cell lines. Our findings point to differences in the capability of mononuclear phagocytes to respond to cytokine treatment, which may be differentiation dependent, and suggest separate regulatory pathways.","['Willheim, M', 'Gessl, A', 'Berger, R', 'Schedle, A', 'Luger, T', 'Foster, O', 'Boltz-Nitulescu, G']","['Willheim M', 'Gessl A', 'Berger R', 'Schedle A', 'Luger T', 'Foster O', 'Boltz-Nitulescu G']","['Institute of General and Experimental Pathology, Vienna University School of Medicine, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,,"['Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/genetics/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Monocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Fc/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1991/09/15 00:00,1991/09/15 00:01,['1991/09/15 00:00'],"['1991/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1991 Sep 15;147(6):1837-42.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tax activates transcription of the c-fos proto-oncogene by a mechanism that appears to involve members of the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and activating transcription factor (ATF) family of DNA-binding proteins. Tax also induces the nuclear expression of the NF-kappa B family of rel oncogene-related enhancer-binding proteins. We have investigated the potential role of these CREB/ATF and NF-kappa B/Rel transcription factors in Tax-mediated transformation by analyzing the oncogenic potential of Tax mutants that functionally segregate these two pathways of transactivation. Rat fibroblasts (Rat2) stably expressing either the wild-type Tax protein or a Tax mutant selectively deficient in the ability to induce NF-kappa B/Rel demonstrated marked changes in morphology and growth characteristics including the ability to form tumors in athymic mice. In contrast, Rat2 cells stably expressing a Tax mutant selectively deficient in the ability to activate transcription through CREB/ATF demonstrated no detectable changes in morphology or growth characteristics.

However, the phospholipase C (PLC) enzyme mediating this process has not been identified. We report that PLC gamma 1 protein is expressed in human T cells. It is a phosphoprotein, and the activation of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) or of protein kinase C (PKC) with forskolin or phorbol ester, respectively, increases the level of phosphorylation. CD3 stimulation of T cells induces tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC gamma 1 and causes 8-10-fold higher yield of PLC activity with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (APTyr Ab) from activated cells than from non-activated cells. Genistein, an inhibitor of protein tyrosine kinase, decreases this yield of AP-Tyr Ab-bound PLC activity from activated cells and lowers the level of Ca2+ mobilization. Furthermore, phorbol ester and forskolin treatment of cells before CD3 stimulation reduces the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC gamma 1 and the PLC activity associated with APTyr Ab.

Biosynthetically labeled [3H]64.1 and externally radioiodinated 125I-64.1 were similarly internalized and degraded by tumor cells, with approximately 70% of the initially bound radioactivity being released to the culture supernatant as trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity in the first 24 hr of culture. Radiolabeled 64.1 was routed from the cell membrane to endosomes where initial proteolysis began and finally to lysosomes where terminal catabolism to single amino acids occurred. SDS-PAGE demonstrated four major intracellular metabolite species (46, 25, 15, and less than 10 kDa). Thin-layer chromatography demonstrated that greater than 95% of the trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity in culture supernatants was 125I-monoiodotyrosine, indicating that proteases, not deiodinases, were of primary importance in catabolism of 125I-64.1. In the presence of inhibitors of lysosomal function (leupeptin, monensin, and ammonium chloride), 125I-64.1 degradation was impeded, causing prolonged retention of radioactivity in the lysosomal compartment of cells. However, although the pace of catabolism was markedly diminished by these agents, no major changes in the sizes of intermediate metabolites generated were observed. Our results suggest that judicious administration of lysosomal inhibitors (e.g. chloroquine, verapamil, monensin) may significantly enhance retention of radioimmunoconjugates by lymphoid malignancies, improving radioimmunoscintigraphic and radioimmunotherapeutic efforts.","['Geissler, F', 'Anderson, S K', 'Press, O']","['Geissler F', 'Anderson SK', 'Press O']","['Department of Biological Structure, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,IM,,"['Ammonium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*metabolism', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*metabolism', 'Autoradiography', 'CD3 Complex', 'Endocytosis', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology/metabolism', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Monensin/pharmacology', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1991 Oct 1;137(1):96-110. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(91)90060-o.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '01Q9PC255D (Ammonium Chloride)', '906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)', 'J97339NR3V (leupeptin)']",,"['0008-8749(91)90060-O [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(91)90060-o [doi]']",,['CA46134/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

The methylation pattern of the c-fms gene as detected by isoschizomeric restriction analysis with MspI/HpaII showed only slight interindividual variations in normal donors, but there were constant differences between granulocytes and monocytes from the same donor. Of 21 acute myelomonocytic leukemias investigated, 85% revealed a methylation pattern different from that of normal monocytes. One or more restriction sites which were at least partly unmethylated in normal monocytes proved to be methylated in leukemic cells. In contrast, leukemias of lymphocytic origin showed hypomethylation of the c-fms gene. There was no correlation between the methylation state of the c-fms gene and its expression at the RNA level, but an increase in monocyte/macrophage-specific differentiation markers could be observed in those samples which exhibited a methylation pattern similar to that of normal monocytes. The increased DNA methylation within the c-fms gene might reflect the inactivation of differentiation genes in leukemic cell clones, contributing to their maturation arrest. Furthermore, neoplastic hematopoietic cells seem to exhibit lineage-specific differences in c-fms gene methylation.","['Felgner, J', 'Kreipe, H', 'Heidorn, K', 'Jaquet, K', 'Zschunke, F', 'Radzun, H J', 'Parwaresch, M R']","['Felgner J', 'Kreipe H', 'Heidorn K', 'Jaquet K', 'Zschunke F', 'Radzun HJ', 'Parwaresch MR']","['Institute of Pathology, Kiel, FRG.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Pathobiology,"Pathobiology : journal of immunopathology, molecular and cellular biology",9007504,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics']",,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pathobiology. 1991;59(4):293-8. doi: 10.1159/000163666.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",['c-fms'],['10.1159/000163666 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Genistein has little effect on several functional responses to stimuli that bypass PI hydrolysis (ionomycin-induced secretion, phorbol ester-induced ruffling) but it inhibits phorbol ester-induced actin polymerization.

Multivariate analysis of the data made it possible to correlate changes in each parameter with the degree of cell advancement through S phase (amount of replicated DNA). A decrease of the protein/DNA ratio, lowered DNA accessibility to 7-AMD, increased sensitivity of DNA to denaturation, and increased ability of isolated nuclei to scatter light all paralleled cell progression through S phase. These changes indicate that during S phase chromatin progressively condenses and suggest that the condensation is associated with the efflux of nonhistone proteins from the nucleus. The increase in the content of the antigen detected by the Ki-67 antibody was observed to exceed the increase in DNA content during S phase and the rate of the Ki-67/DNA increase was higher during the second half of S phase. Thus, this protein appears to be primarily synthesized during S, especially late in S phase, and is degraded in G1. The ratio of cyclin (PCNA)/DNA remained rather constant whereas the contents of p105 and p34 proteins, when expressed per unit of DNA, both decreased during S phase. The data indicate that significant changes in structure and composition of chromatin take place during S phase and suggest that the composition of chromatin associated with the nonreplicated DNA is different compared to chromatin associated with the newly replicated DNA.","['Bruno, S', 'Crissman, H A', 'Bauer, K D', 'Darzynkiewicz, Z']","['Bruno S', 'Crissman HA', 'Bauer KD', 'Darzynkiewicz Z']","['Cancer Research Institute, New York Medical College, Valhalla 10595.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,,"['Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'Chromatin/physiology/*ultrastructure', 'Cyclins/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'DNA Replication/physiology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'Dactinomycin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Ki-67 Antigen', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', '*S Phase']",,1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1991 Sep;196(1):99-106. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(91)90460-c.,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '7240-37-1 (7-aminoactinomycin D)']",,"['0014-4827(91)90460-C [pii]', '10.1016/0014-4827(91)90460-c [doi]']",,"['P41-RR01315/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA28704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA23296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we examined the possible involvement of vacuolar H(+)-adenosine triphosphatase (H(+)-ATPase) activity in drug resistance in HL60 cells. We utilized bafilomycin A1, an agent which selectively inhibits vacuolar H(+)-ATPase activity at low concentrations. The results showed that bafilomycin A1 induced a major increase in drug accumulation and inhibited drug efflux in both HL60/Adr cells and HL60/Vinc cells. Similar results were obtained with 7-chloro-4-nitrobenz-2-oxa 1,3 diazole, an agent which is also capable of inhibiting vacuolar H(+)-ATPase. Azide, an inhibitor of F1F0 mitochondrial ATPase, and vanadate and ouabain, which are inhibitors of E1E2-type ATPase, did not affect drug levels in resistant cells. We also observed that bafilomycin A1 did not compete with [3H]azidopine binding to P-glycoprotein. Thus, bafilomycin A1 does not appear to function as a substrate for P-glycoprotein. These results suggest an involvement of vacuolar H(+)-ATPase activity in the pathway of drug efflux from HL60/Adr cells and HL60/Vinc cells.

LNR levels in HL60 cells increased during differentiation, being significantly higher in cells exposed to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and ethanol (55,391 +/- 27,845 and 29,314 +/- 6,435 sites/cell respectively) as compared with HL60 controls (8,549 +/- 4,000 sites/cell). The control cells do not adhere to laminin-coated surfaces, but differentiation with PMA results in their rapid adherence on this substratum. Short treatment with PMA does not increase the number of adherent cells or the receptor expression. Granulocytes also presented equally high LNR concentration (29,739 +/- 13,516 sites/cell). The lymphoid cells (lymphocyte, acute lymphoid leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia) shared low LNR numbers (less than 6,500 sites/cell). Myeloid cells displayed a wide range of LN receptors with higher levels being associated with the more differentiated FAB subgroups. 125I-laminin binding to lymphoid or myeloid leukemic cells was mainly inhibited by P1 fragments, whereas granulocytes and differentiated HL60 cells displayed a dual binding pattern for laminin fragments P1 and E8. These results were confirmed by assays using 125I-labelled P1 and E8 fragments. We conclude that magnitude of LNR levels and variation in expression of P1 and E8 receptors appear to be linked to lineage and maturation status in hematopoietic cells.","['Federico, M H', 'Maria, D A', 'Sonohara, S', 'Yamamoto, M', 'Katayama, M L', 'Brentani, M M']","['Federico MH', 'Maria DA', 'Sonohara S', 'Yamamoto M', 'Katayama ML', 'Brentani MM']","['Disciplina de Oncologia Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Granulocytes/cytology/*metabolism', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Laminin/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Macrophages/cytology/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Laminin', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1991/08/19 00:00,1991/08/19 00:01,['1991/08/19 00:00'],"['1991/08/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/19 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/19 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1991 Aug 19;49(1):32-7. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910490107.,"['0 (Laminin)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Laminin)']",,['10.1002/ijc.2910490107 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Failure to interconvert tetrahydrofolate cofactors to dihydrofolate in mitochondria of L1210 leukemia cells treated with trimetrexate.,1015-9,"Following exposure of L1210 leukemia cells to antifolates, tetrahydrofolate-dependent purine and pyrimidine biosyntheses are blocked despite the presence of the major portion of tetrahydrofolate cofactors. Previous studies from this laboratory demonstrated that this cannot be due to direct inhibition of thymidylate synthase by dihydrofolate polyglutamates or other endogenous folates and suggested that this phenomenon is due to compartmentation of tetrahydrofolate cofactors unavailable for interconversion and/or oxidation when dihydrofolate reductase activity is abolished by antifolates. The present paper evaluates the possibility that tetrahydrofolate cofactors in subcellular organelles, in particular, mitochondria, are unavailable for oxidation by thymidylate synthase. Particulate and cytosolic fractions were obtained from L1210 cells following homogenization and differential centrifugation. The crude mitochondrial fraction contained 20.1% of the total folate pool and included 5-formyltetrahydrofolate, 10-formyltetrahydrofolate and tetrahydrofolate in proportions similar to intact cells. The cytosolic fraction had an increased proportion of tetrahydrofolate and decreased proportions of 5-formyl- and 10-formyltetrahydrofolate relative to intact cells or the particulate fraction. Exposure of cells to 10 microM trimetrexate for 30 min produced approximately 45% interconversion of tetrahydrofolate cofactors to dihydrofolate in the cytosolic fraction, a level much greater than that observed in whole cell extracts (25-30%), but had no effect on folate pools in the crude mitochondrial fraction. These data indicate that subcellular compartmentation accounts, in part, for the failure to oxidize tetrahydrofolate cofactors to dihydrofolate in the presence of antifolate levels that abolish dihydrofolate reductase activity.","['Trent, D F', 'Seither, R L', 'Goldman, I D']","['Trent DF', 'Seither RL', 'Goldman ID']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,,"['Animals', '*Cell Compartmentation', 'Folic Acid/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', '*Folic Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology', 'Tetrahydrofolates/*metabolism', 'Trimetrexate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",,1991/08/08 00:00,1991/08/08 00:01,['1991/08/08 00:00'],"['1991/08/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/08 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/08 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1991 Aug 8;42(5):1015-9. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(91)90283-b.,"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '4033-27-6 (dihydrofolate)', '43ZWB253H4 (5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolic acid)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'UPN4ITI8T4 (Trimetrexate)']",,"['0006-2952(91)90283-B [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(91)90283-b [doi]']",,"['CA-09340/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-39807/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['Biochem Pharmacol 1991 Nov 27;42(12):2405'],,,,,,

These lymphocytes were fused with an azaguanine-resistant mutant of a human T cell leukemic cell line (CCRF-CEMAG). Four weeks after fusion, approximately 30% of the wells showed hybridoma cell growth. To select hybridoma clones with suppressive activity, irradiated hybridoma clones were added as regulator cells to the mixed lymphocyte culture. After the cloning, one clone causing suppression of the donor-specific MLR was established (termed HK40: %MLR suppression = 38.9%). Unstimulated supernatant of HK40 showed no suppressive effect on the specific MLR. In contrast, supernatant of HK40 cultured with donor PBL for 24 hrs, suppressed the donor-specific MLR dose-dependently. This primed supernatant of HK40 markedly suppressed the specific MLR when added added at the culture initiation. These findings indicate that functional clones causing suppression of the alloantigen-specific MLR can be generated in patients receiving DST, and suggest that these clones may be essential to the prolongation of kidney allograft survival.","['Haisa, M']",['Haisa M'],"['First Department of Surgery, Okayama University Medical School, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Nihon Geka Gakkai Zasshi,Nihon Geka Gakkai zasshi,0405405,IM,,"['*Blood Transfusion', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas/*immunology', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nihon Geka Gakkai Zasshi. 1991 Apr;92(4):367-73.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A major component of this stimulated 86Rb+ efflux appears to be due to a Ca(2+)-activated K+ channel because it is inhibited by quinidine in parallel with the inhibition of degranulation and membrane potential repolarization, it is blocked by 0.1 mM La3+, and it is dependent on external Ca2+. Depolarization of the plasma membrane by carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone inhibits stimulated Ca2+ influx and prevents antigen-induced 86Rb+ efflux, and increased external Ca2+ partially restores 86Rb+ efflux under these conditions. In addition, potentiation of antigen-stimulated Ca2+ influx by pretreatment with cholera toxin increases the initial rate of stimulated 86Rb+ efflux. Another component of antigen-stimulated K+ efflux appears to be mediated by a guanine nucleotide-binding protein because pretreatment of rat basophilic leukemia cells with pertussis toxin decreases the initial rate of antigen-stimulated 86Rb+ efflux to 40% of that for the untreated cells. Stimulated 86Rb+ efflux is also observed when ionomycin is used to increase cytoplasmic Ca2+ and to trigger membrane depolarization. The efflux stimulated by ionomycin is inhibited by quinidine but not by pertussis toxin pretreatment; thus, it appears to occur through the Ca(2+)-activated K+ efflux pathway. It is proposed that these K+ efflux pathways serve to sustain the Ca2+ influx that is necessary for receptor-mediated triggering of cellular degranulation.","['Labrecque, G F', 'Holowka, D', 'Baird, B']","['Labrecque GF', 'Holowka D', 'Baird B']","['Department of Chemistry, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*metabolism', 'Basophils/*metabolism', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Carbonyl Cyanide m-Chlorophenyl Hydrazone/pharmacology', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', 'Cholera Toxin/pharmacology', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Immunoglobulin E/*metabolism', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Potassium/*metabolism', 'Quinidine/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Rubidium/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology']",,1991/08/15 00:00,1991/08/15 00:01,['1991/08/15 00:00'],"['1991/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1991 Aug 15;266(23):14912-7.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '555-60-2 (Carbonyl Cyanide m-Chlorophenyl Hydrazone)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', '9012-63-9 (Cholera Toxin)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'ITX08688JL (Quinidine)', 'MLT4718TJW (Rubidium)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)']",,['S0021-9258(18)98564-9 [pii]'],,"['AI 18306/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 22449/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

In the presence of phytohemagglutinin or anti-T cell receptor monoclonal antibodies and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, the IFN-gamma promoter is activated in human T cells, which can be further enhanced by co-transfection of the tax I or II genes.

Preliminary experiences of active specific immunotherapy with monoclonal antiidiotypic antibodies in cancer patients are reported.","['Castello, G', ""D'Alessio, V""]","['Castello G', ""D'Alessio V""]","['Servizio di Immunologia Clinica, Istituto Nazionale per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori, Napoli.']",['ita'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,Clin Ter,La Clinica terapeutica,0372604,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', '*Immunotherapy', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/therapy', 'Melanoma/therapy', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/immunology/*therapy', 'Skin Neoplasms/therapy']",55,1991/05/15 00:00,1991/05/15 00:01,['1991/05/15 00:00'],"['1991/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Ter. 1991 May 15;137(3):155-67.,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",,,,,L'immunoterapia attiva specifica del cancro con anticorpi monoclonali anti-idiotipo.,,,,,,,,,

KN6 cells reacted with syngeneic (C57BL/6) cells from various origins (splenocytes, thymocytes, peritoneal exudate cells, etc.) and cells from many different mouse strains. KN6 reactivity against cells from a panel of congenic and recombinant mouse strains demonstrated that the ligand recognized by KN6 is controlled by an MHC-linked gene that most probably maps in the TL region. We cloned this gene and formally proved that it does map in the TL region. This gene turned out to be a novel class I gene (designated T22b) belonging to a hitherto unidentified cluster of TL region genes in strain C57BL/6. This gene was expressed in many different tissues and cell types. We also examined the tissue expression of several other TL genes. One of these, the structural gene (T3b) encoding the thymus leukemia (TL) antigen from C57BL/6 mice, was specifically expressed in the epithelium of the small intestine. Since the intestinal epithelium of the mouse is known to be the homing site for a subset of gamma delta T cells (i-IEL) bearing diverse TCR with V7 rearranged gamma chains, we propose that the T3b gene product is part of the ligand recognized by some of the i-IEL. Our data support the idea that gamma delta T cells might be specific for non-classical class I or class I-like molecules and suggest that gamma delta TCR and non-classical MHC co-evolved for the recognition of a conserved set of endogenous or foreign peptides.","['Van Kaer, L', 'Wu, M', 'Ichikawa, Y', 'Ito, K', 'Bonneville, M', 'Ostrand-Rosenberg, S', 'Murphy, D B', 'Tonegawa, S']","['Van Kaer L', 'Wu M', 'Ichikawa Y', 'Ito K', 'Bonneville M', 'Ostrand-Rosenberg S', 'Murphy DB', 'Tonegawa S']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge 02139.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Immunol Rev,Immunological reviews,7702118,IM,,"['Age Factors', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'CD8 Antigens', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/chemistry', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*immunology', 'Hybridomas/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', '*Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains/genetics/immunology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Organ Specificity', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', '*Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/metabolism']",98,1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunol Rev. 1991 Apr;120:89-115. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-065x.1991.tb00589.x.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '0 (Tla antigens)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)']","['26<up>b</up>', '37<up>b</up>', 'Pgk-2', 'T10<up>129</up>', 'T10<up>b</up>', 'T10<up>d</up>', 'T21', 'T22', 'T22<up>b</up>', 'T22<up>d</up>', 'T22<up>k</up>', 'T23', 'T3<up>b</up>', 'TL', 'TL<up>b</up>', 'TL<up>b</up>-B', 'Tl4<up>b</up>', 'Tl5<up>b</up>', 'Tl<up>d</up>', 'Tl<up>d</up>-A', 'Tla<up>a</up>', 'Tla<up>b</up>']",['10.1111/j.1600-065x.1991.tb00589.x [doi]'],,"['AI14349/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI17879/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA28900/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

M1 cells differentiated into macrophage-like cells by addition of rH-TNF or TNS. The differentiated cells expressed phagocytic function and did not grow anymore. Cytolytic effect of rH-TNF or TNS was not observed. The differentiation of M1 cells into phagocytic cells by the TNS treatment was more rapidly than that by the rH-TNF treatment though TNS contained 25-time less amounts of TNF indicating species specificity of TNF action on myeloid leukemic cells or TNS containing other differentiation factor(s). 3H-ornithine formation from 3H-arginine is catalyzed by arginase (EC. 3.5.3.1). The enzyme product increased in the M1 cell culture medium by the treatment with rH-TNF or TNS. The arginase activity statistically correlated with the appearance percentage of differentiated cells with phagocytic function.

In the present report, we extended these studies and showed that CD5+ B cells from all CLL patients (n = 15) co-express CD23 Ag. We next identified two additional major differences between B-CLLs and normal adult B cells. First, in contrast to normal adult B cells which exclusively express type A CD23 mRNA, freshly isolated B-CLLs expressed both type B and type A CD23 mRNA. Second, although IL-4 is a potent inducer of type B CD23 mRNA on normal B cells, an optimal concentration of IL-4 infranormally upregulated CD23 on highly purified B-CLLs both at the protein and at the molecular levels. However, co-stimulation of CLL PBMC with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and IL-4 strongly upregulated CD23 on B-CLLs, reconstituting the high level of CD23 expression observed in vivo. We next attempted to relate B-CLLs to the CD5+ B cell subpopulations present in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC, n = 3), cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMC, n = 6) and tonsillar lymphocytes (TONS, n = 3) by analysing their co-expression of CD20, CD5 and CD23 Ag and their phenotypic regulation by IL-4. Our results indicated that B-CLLs presented some features in common with the CD23+ umbilical cord blood B cells in as much as, like in B-CLLs; (i) all CD23+ cord blood cells co-expressed CD5 Ag, (ii) freshly isolated CBMC expressed both type A and type B CD23 mRNA, and finally (iii) these cells weakly re-expressed CD23 Ag upon IL-4 stimulation as compared to adult PBMC.","['Fournier, S', 'Tran, I D', 'Suter, U', 'Biron, G', 'Delespesse, G', 'Sarfati, M']","['Fournier S', 'Tran ID', 'Suter U', 'Biron G', 'Delespesse G', 'Sarfati M']","['University of Montreal, Notre-Dame Hospital, Research Center, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,,"['Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Fetal Blood/cytology/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Receptors, Fc/*genetics', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/*physiology']",,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1991;15(7):609-18. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(91)90030-w.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",,"['0145-2126(91)90030-W [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(91)90030-w [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Receptor cross-linking also stimulates the redistribution of receptors on the cell surface, a process observed here by labeling the anti-IgE with 15 nm protein A-gold particles that are visible by back-scattered electron imaging in the scanning electron microscope. We report that anti-IgE binding stimulates the redistribution of IgE-receptor complexes at 37 degrees C from a dispersed topography to distributions dominated sequentially by short chains, small clusters, and large aggregates of cross-linked receptors. Cells incubated with 1 microgram/ml anti-IgE, a concentration that stimulates maximum net secretion, redistribute receptors into chains and small clusters during a 15 min incubation period. At 3 and 10 micrograms/ml anti-IgE, net secretion is reduced and the majority of receptors redistribute rapidly into clusters and large aggregates. The addition of Fab fragments with the high anti-IgE concentrations, to reduce cross-linking, delays receptor aggregation and enhances secretion. The progression of receptors from small clusters to large aggregates is prevented in cells treated with dihydrocytochalasin B to prevent F-actin assembly. These results establish that characteristic patterns of receptor topography are correlated with receptor activity. In particular, they link the formation of large receptor aggregates to reduced signalling activity. Cytoskeleton-membrane interaction is implicated in the formation or stabilization of the large receptor clusters.","['Seagrave, J', 'Pfeiffer, J R', 'Wofsy, C', 'Oliver, J M']","['Seagrave J', 'Pfeiffer JR', 'Wofsy C', 'Oliver JM']","['Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Albuquerque 87131.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/immunology/metabolism', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/pharmacology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cytochalasin B/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cytoskeleton/drug effects/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gold', 'Immunoglobulin E/immunology/metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Mast Cells/metabolism/physiology/*ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Receptors, Fc/drug effects/metabolism/*physiology', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Staphylococcal Protein A', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1991 Jul;148(1):139-51. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041480117.,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Staphylococcal Protein A)', '0 (anti-IgE antibodies)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '39156-67-7 (dihydrocytochalasin B)', '3CHI920QS7 (Cytochalasin B)', '7440-57-5 (Gold)']",,['10.1002/jcp.1041480117 [doi]'],,"['ES03338/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM37202/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Detergent insolubility of the receptor can also be induced on purified plasma membranes isolated from RBL cells by the use of either IgE oligomers or IgE monomers plus multivalent antigen. The critical event in initiating this interaction between the receptor and the membrane skeleton is cross-linking of the receptor. This association is rapid, and, when triggered by multivalent antigen, it is quickly reversed by the addition of excess monovalent antigen. The fact that this association occurs with the use of purified plasma membranes indicates that all of the components necessary for this interaction are present in the plasma membrane and that intracellular components are not required. Although crosslinking of the receptor activates phospholipase C and phospholipase A2 leading to the generation of several second messengers, none of these signaling mechanisms appears to be involved in IgE receptor interaction with the membrane skeleton. This interaction cannot be induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), ionomycin, or a combination of these two reagents, although this will result in degranulation. Furthermore, receptor detergent insolubility is temperature independent when triggered by multivalent antigen, thus indicating that enzyme-catalyzed reactions are not important. This was verified by the fact that a variety of inhibitors that block phosphatidylinositol metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, Ca2+ influx, and protein kinase C (PKC) activation had no effect on antigen-induced association of the receptor with the membrane skeleton. These results indicate that the signaling mechanisms leading to the degranulation response are not involved in the association of the crosslinked receptor with the membrane skeleton.","['Apgar, J R']",['Apgar JR'],"['Division of Membrane Biology, Medical Biology Institute, La Jolla, California 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Regul,Cell regulation,9005331,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/chemistry/*metabolism/physiology', 'Arachidonic Acid', 'Arachidonic Acids/metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Cytoskeleton/*metabolism', 'Dinitrophenols/metabolism', '*Immunoglobulin E', 'Inositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/chemistry/*metabolism/physiology', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Serotonin/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Solubility', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Regul. 1991 Mar;2(3):181-91. doi: 10.1091/mbc.2.3.181.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', '66-56-8 (2,3-dinitrophenol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,['10.1091/mbc.2.3.181 [doi]'],PMC361749,['R01 GM42388/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

This observation prompted us to study the levels of the naturally occurring anticoagulant proteins C and S prospectively in patients undergoing remission induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia. Plasma samples from 50 adult patients with acute leukemia (34 AML, 16 ALL) were analyzed for protein C antigen, functional protein C, immunologic total and free protein S as well as levels of C4b binding protein (C4bBP). Plasma levels of immunologic protein C were significantly lower in patients with active acute myelocytic leukemia (mean = 77.9) than in controls (mean = 123.6) or patients in remission (mean = 132). Functional protein C levels were also significantly lower in AML patients with active disease (mean = 58.5) than controls (mean = 95.5) or patients in remission (mean = 98.5). Patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) had normal levels of immunologic and functional protein C. Although total protein S levels were normal in all patients studied, levels of free protein S were significantly decreased in patients with active AML (mean = 29.3) compared with patients in remission (mean = 42.0) or controls (mean = 42.4). In contrast, patients with ALL, both with active disease and in remission had normal free protein S levels. This decrease in free protein S seen in active AML was not associated with liver disease, white cell count or an increase in C4bBP. These findings provide a possible explanation for the occasional occurrence of venous thrombosis in patients with acute myelocytic leukemia.","['Troy, K', 'Essex, D', 'Rand, J', 'Lema, M', 'Cuttner, J']","['Troy K', 'Essex D', 'Rand J', 'Lema M', 'Cuttner J']","['Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Complement C4b/metabolism', 'Female', 'Glycoproteins/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein C/*analysis', 'Protein S']",,1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1991 Jul;37(3):159-62. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830370305.,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Protein C)', '0 (Protein S)', '80295-50-7 (Complement C4b)']",,['10.1002/ajh.2830370305 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in combination with immunoblot analysis showed that the bone TrATPase has a molecular weight of 33,000 D and is composed of disulfide-linked polypeptides of 20,000 and 16,000 D. The enzyme contains 1.7 mol Fe per mol enzyme. Hydrodynamic studies allowed calculation of the Stokes radius (24 A), the sedimentation coefficient (3.19S), the partial specific volume (0.748 ml/g), the frictional ratio (0.995), and the axial ratio (1.0). The amount of detergent bound to the protein was determined to 4 mol of Triton X-100 per mol enzyme. The molecular weight of bone TrATPase derived from these parameters was 31,900 D. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the Mr 20,000 subunit indicated a high degree of similarity with TRAP enzymes from spleen, uterus, placenta, hairy cell leukemia, and osteoclastoma. It is concluded that rat bone TrATPase belongs to the type 5 (tartrate-resistant and purple) acid phosphatase family. The similarities in the N-terminal amino acid sequences, iron content, and physicochemical properties of TRAP enzymes indicate a close structural relationship between type 5 acid phosphatases expressed in different tissues. The findings that TrATPase has a spherical shape and binds low amounts of detergent suggest that the enzyme is a soluble protein, compatible with the view that TrATPase is secreted by the osteoclast.","['Ek-Rylander, B', 'Bergman, T', 'Andersson, G']","['Ek-Rylander B', 'Bergman T', 'Andersson G']","['Department of Oral Pathology, Karolinska Institute, Huddinge, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Bone Miner Res,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,8610640,IM,,"['Acid Phosphatase/*analysis', 'Adenosine Triphosphatases/*analysis', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Bone and Bones/*enzymology', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Immunoblotting', 'Iron/analysis', 'Isoenzymes/*analysis', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Rats', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Tartrates/*pharmacology']",,1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Bone Miner Res. 1991 Apr;6(4):365-73. doi: 10.1002/jbmr.5650060408.,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Tartrates)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)']",,['10.1002/jbmr.5650060408 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The TCR delta gene was rearranged in four lymphomas although the gamma/delta TCR was not expressed in two cases studied. The TCR delta gene was the only TCR gene rearranged in two cases. Each lymphoma with TCR delta gene rearrangement had an aberrant T-cell immunophenotype and three cases were of the large cell anaplastic type. The TCR delta gene was deleted in 22 cases and was in the germline configuration in 13 lymphomas. Deletion of the TCR delta gene was characteristic of mycosis fungoides, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (human T cell leukemia-lymphoma virus positive), and Lennert's lymphoma, and was not identified in angiocentric lymphomas. In eight cases with TCR delta deletion, however, a large number of polyclonal (presumably reactive) T cells were present and, in these lymphomas, the authors could not determine if TCR delta gene deletion occurred in the polyclonal T cells, the neoplastic cells, or both cell populations. The authors conclude that the TCR delta gene is usually deleted in mature T-cell lymphomas, as would be expected in alpha/beta TCR T cells. However, TCR delta gene rearrangement is detectable in approximately 10% of cases. Analysis of this locus may be useful diagnostically, as it occasionally may be the only molecular marker of clonality in mature T-cell lymphomas T-cell receptor delta chain gene rearrangement also is found most often in lymphomas of the large cell anaplastic type.","['van Krieken, J H', 'Elwood, L', 'Andrade, R E', 'Jaffe, E S', 'Cossman, J', 'Medeiros, L J']","['van Krieken JH', 'Elwood L', 'Andrade RE', 'Jaffe ES', 'Cossman J', 'Medeiros LJ']","['Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,IM,,"['Chromosome Deletion', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism']",,1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1991 Jul;139(1):161-8.,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",,,PMC1886140,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular basis of the t(4;11) is unknown although a number of genes have been mapped to 11q23. The CD3D, G, and E genes have been positioned proximal to the 11q23 breakpoint of the 4;11 translocation while the THY1 and ETS1 genes have been mapped distal to this breakpoint. We report evidence that CD3G is within 200 kb of the 4;11 breakpoint as observed by pulsed field gel analysis. A rearrangement of the CD3G gene has been observed in a cell line derived from a patient with the t(4;11) translocation and in a hybrid cell line containing the derivative 11q chromosome derived from this cell line, using the restriction enzymes SacII and ClaI. Similar rearrangements using SacII were observed in 2 further patients with ALL and the t(4;11) translocation. No rearrangements in the same DNA were observed using ETS1, THY1, and D11S29 and a range of rare cutter restriction enzymes. CD3G thus provides a tool for the cloning and analysis of the 4;11 translocation, and poses a question of its possible involvement at long range with this translocation.","['Das, S', 'Cotter, F E', 'Gibbons, B', 'Dhut, S', 'Young, B D']","['Das S', 'Cotter FE', 'Gibbons B', 'Dhut S', 'Young BD']","[""ICRF Medical Oncology Unit, St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London, U.K.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,,"['Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*genetics', 'CD3 Complex', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4/*ultrastructure', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1991 Jan;3(1):44-7. doi: 10.1002/gcc.2870030108.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']","['CD3G', 'ETS1', 'NCAM', 'PBGD', 'THY1']",['10.1002/gcc.2870030108 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this concept has now been strengthened by the discovery of a group of genes (oncogenes) which are specifically associated with neoplasia. These genes have been identified by studies of animal oncogenic viruses, by in vitro transformation studies of mouse fibroblasts, and by molecular analyses of human tumour cells. The oncogenes are altered forms of normal genes (proto-oncogenes) whose protein products are thought to be involved in the regulation of cell proliferation. It appears that the alteration of proto-oncogenes to form oncogenes results in the inappropriate production of normal proteins or in the production of abnormal proteins. It is suggested, therefore, that the presence of such proteins would allow cells to escape from normal cell growth regulation, and as a result produce uncontrolled proliferation. Oncogene research has to date been primarily concerned with identifying oncogenes and assessing their importance in the development of a number of malignancies. Such research is therefore allowing us to build up a framework of genetic changes which define the development of each type of tumour or leukaemia. Furthermore, information concerning the oncogenes is now beginning to be applied diagnostically to help in determining predisposition of an individual to disease, in aiding the accurate staging of disease, in indicating prognosis and in developing markers to detect residual disease after therapy. It is also possible that in the future we may be able to develop new anticancer therapies, for example, based on oncogene protein inhibitors, or anti-oncogene protein antibodies or even gene therapy.","['Goyns, M H', 'Hancock, B W']","['Goyns MH', 'Hancock BW']","['Department of Clinician Oncology, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol),Clinical oncology (Royal College of Radiologists (Great Britain)),9002902,IM,,"['Humans', 'Medical Oncology', 'Neoplasms/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins/physiology', 'Oncogenes/*physiology']",101,1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol). 1991 May;3(3):168-76. doi: 10.1016/s0936-6555(05)80840-4.,['0 (Oncogene Proteins)'],,"['S0936-6555(05)80840-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0936-6555(05)80840-4 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The most distinctive of the myelodysplastic syndromes is the 5q- syndrome characterized by refractory anemia, poorly lobulated megakaryocytes, and an interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q deletion) as the sole karyotypic abnormality. Recently, several genes encoding hemopoietic growth factors and receptors, comprising the interleukins 3, 4, and 5, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor, and the receptor for macrophage-colony-stimulating factor [the CSF1R (formerly FMS) gene product], have been localized to the long arm of chromosome 5, and there has been much speculation that deletion of one or more of these genes may be critical to the pathogenesis of the associated myeloid disorders. One candidate gene is CSF1R, which is required for normal proliferation and differentiation of hemopoietic cells of the myeloid lineage. We have carried out a molecular examination of the CSF1R, both on the 5q- chromosome and on the apparently normal homologous chromosome 5, in 10 patients with myelodysplasia and a 5q deletion. We have found, using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and gene dosage experiments, that all 10 patients showed deletion of CSF1R; 6 of 10 were hemizygous and 4 of 10 homozygous for CSF1R loss. The homozygous CSF1R loss has been confirmed in 2 patients by an in situ hybridization technique comparing the signal in affected cells to that in control sex-mismatched cells on the same slides. In those patients considered to have homozygous CSF1R loss by DNA experiments the gene was deleted from the 5q chromosome in all cells and from the apparently normal chromosome 5 in a subset of cells.

Staphylococcus epidermidis, once considered a non-pathogenic skin contaminant, is emerging as a major cause of severe infection. However, in infants Gram-negative septicaemias are more frequent than in older children. A teicoplanin and ceftriaxone combination was assessed for use as empirical therapy of febrile episodes in neutropenic children with acute leukaemias. Of 47 patients, fever was of unknown origin in 21, and documented in 26 with 28 strains isolated; 19 Gram-positive (all sensitive to teicoplanin) and nine Gram-negative. Within 48 h, 41 patients became afebrile and the pathogen was cleared if initially present. Mean duration of treatment was 16 days. Febrile relapse occurred in 24 patients with eight documented superinfections. The need for prophylactic cover against Gram-positive organisms at the time of intravenous catheter insertion is questionable. We studied 71 patients who were randomly allocated to receive teicoplanin when the central line was inserted and if febrile, with added ceftriaxone and amikacin (arm A) or the tri-antibiotic regimen when fever occurred (arm B). In arm A a febrile episode occurred after ten days in 34/35 patients with only one Gram-positive organism isolated. In arm B a febrile episode occurred in all 36 patients after five days and ten Gram-positive strains were isolated. Those patients in arm A also received fluconazole.

A 2-day treatment with IFN sets in motion a differentiation program that leads to an early and transient increase of human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR) and a delayed appearance of CSF-1 receptors. In this study we have investigated the inverse relationship between class II and CSF-1 receptor expression and found that IFN acts only on an IFN-sensitive HL-60 cell population that is class II negative. This population becomes susceptible to induction and expresses the early HLA-DR surface antigen. The same cells become programmed to acquire CSF-1 receptors at a later time, an effect that cannot be substituted by another agent (A23187) known to have the same effect as IFN on DR expression. Induced class II expression by itself is not sufficient to predict a future CSF-1 receptor appearance, suggesting that HLA-DR induction by IFN is an accompanying rather than a causative event, although inhibition of class II expression completely ablates the IFN up-regulation of CSF-1 receptors. In contrast, constitutive class II-positive HL-60 cells do not respond to CSF-1, nor they can be induced to do so.","['Vassiliadis, S', 'Guilbert, L J']","['Vassiliadis S', 'Guilbert LJ']","['Department of Immunology, University of Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,,"['Cell Line', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'HLA-DR Antigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'Interferon-gamma/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Theophylline/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1991 May;19(4):250-6.,"['0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'C137DTR5RG (Theophylline)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To further explore the gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity of cytostatic therapy, 37 patients with acute leukemia were investigated during and/or after remission induction courses by the use of the differential sugar absorption test (DSAT) and the intestinal clearance of alpha-1-antitrypsin (ClAAT). The ratio of the lactulose to the mannitol excretion in the urine was found abnormal in 44% of the tests. The ClAAT was increased in 74% of tests. The tests results differed considerably from patient to patient and depended on the chemotherapy course; correlation between the tests was low, probably indicating the unrelated pathophysiological processes were measured. After haematological regeneration, abnormal test results normalised. It is concluded that aggressive chemotherapy not only causes a reduction in the absorption of sugars, but commonly also protein leakage. These GI side-effects are reversible, and the application of both tests in combination provides a practical and reproducible method for investigation of GI toxicity in patients treated with cytostatic drugs.","['Daenen, S', 'Muskiet, F A', 'Marrink, J', 'Halie, M R']","['Daenen S', 'Muskiet FA', 'Marrink J', 'Halie MR']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University and University Hospital of Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Absorption', 'Intestinal Diseases/chemically induced', 'Lactulose/urine', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/metabolism/urine', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/urine', 'Mannitol/urine', 'Middle Aged', 'alpha 1-Antitrypsin/*pharmacokinetics']",,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1991;27(5):552-6. doi: 10.1016/0277-5379(91)90214-x.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (alpha 1-Antitrypsin)', '3OWL53L36A (Mannitol)', '4618-18-2 (Lactulose)']",,['10.1016/0277-5379(91)90214-x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Regarding the immunophenotype, common-ALL had a better prognosis than T-ALL in the children's group. However, in adults the situation was different since both null and T-ALL patients had longer survival rates than the common pre-B group. Moreover, several individual markers add interesting prognostic information, either in ALL as a whole group or within the different immunophenotypes. Thus, the expression of CD10 and TdT had a significantly favourable influence in the outcome of the whole series of patients; within the T-ALL, those cases positive for CD10 also had a longer median survival (33 versus 17 months). In addition, in the common ALL patients group the expression of a relatively mature B marker--CD20--appeared to have a favourable prognosis (27 versus 13 months). Other non lineage specific markers, such as CD9 and CD38 did not seem to influence survival. Regarding the more conventional parameters, our data suggest that the classical age prognostic classification in children (less than 15 years) and adults can be improved using two cut-off points at 11 and 35 years. Moreover, the multivariate analysis showed that this variable, together with FAB morphology and WBC counts were the best combination of parameters for predicting survival. The present study shows that although the immunophenotype helps us in understanding the biological heterogeneity of ALL, having also prognostic implications, there are other clinical and hematological features that yield stronger prognostic information.","['Gomez, E', 'San Miguel, J F', 'Gonzalez, M', 'Orfao, A', 'Canizo, M C', 'Moraleda, J M', 'Lopez Borrasca, A']","['Gomez E', 'San Miguel JF', 'Gonzalez M', 'Orfao A', 'Canizo MC', 'Moraleda JM', 'Lopez Borrasca A']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Clinico, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neprilysin', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 1991 Jan-Feb;9(1):33-42. doi: 10.1002/hon.2900090105.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,['10.1002/hon.2900090105 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism by which GM-CSF transduces its proliferative signal in acute myeloid leukemia has been extensively investigated over the past year. It is now known that the GM-CSF belongs to a new family of hematopoietic growth factor binding proteins which are characterized by a relatively short intracytoplasmic domain that lacks a tyrosine kinase sequence. Nevertheless, studies performed using GM-CSF-dependent leukemic cell lines demonstrate the appearance of several new phosphotyrosine species after GM-CSF exposure, suggesting that receptor activation is directly or indirectly linked to tyrosine kinase stimulation. Apart from the basic biology of GM-CSF-induced signal transduction, the ability of this factor to enhance the S-phase fraction of myeloid leukemia blasts may have important therapeutic implications. Clinical trials are currently being conducted in an attempt to determine whether GM-CSF is able to overcome kinetic resistance of leukemic myeloblasts to cell cycle-specific agents such as cytarabine in the treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia.","['Cannistra, S A']",['Cannistra SA'],"['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,IM,,"['Clone Cells/pathology', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/physiology', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology']",43,1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 1991 Feb;3(1):4-12. doi: 10.1097/00001622-199102000-00002.,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",,['10.1097/00001622-199102000-00002 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

It bound to two novel derivatives of ganglioside GD1b (Ag I and Ag II) that appear to be present only in rat mast cells. The present study demonstrates the importance of gangliosides Ag I and Ag II for binding of mAb AA4 to intact cells. We also investigated the presence of gangliosides Ag I and Ag II and proteins immunoprecipitated with mAb AA4 in the parental and four variant cell lines. In comparison with the parental RBL-2H3, two variant cell lines had very low (0.5% and 2.0%) and two others had intermediate levels (9% and 18%) of 125I-AA4 binding. mAb AA4 inhibited 125I-IgE binding to the parental RBL-2H3 cells and to only one variant with intermediate amounts of gangliosides Ag I and Ag II. Therefore, there are variations in the proximity of these gangliosides to the high affinity IgE receptor (Fc epsilon RI) among different cell lines. mAb AA4 immunoprecipitated proteins of 50 to 60, 120, and 135 kDa from 125I-surface labeled cells. These were different from the subunits of Fc epsilon RI. The amount of gangliosides Ag I and Ag II in cell extracts correlated with the number of mAb AA4 binding sites on the cell surface and with the quantity of proteins precipitated from the different cell lines. Thus, these membrane proteins appear to be associated with gangliosides Ag I and Ag II. The binding of mAb AA4 to the surface gangliosides could induce intracellular changes through transmembrane signaling by these proteins.","['Stephan, V', 'Guo, N', 'Ginsburg, V', 'Siraganian, R P']","['Stephan V', 'Guo N', 'Ginsburg V', 'Siraganian RP']","['Clinical Immunology Section, National Institute of Dental Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Gangliosides/analysis/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin E/metabolism', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*analysis/immunology', 'Mice', 'Neuraminidase/pharmacology', '*Precipitin Tests', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/immunology', 'Receptors, IgE']",,1991/06/15 00:00,1991/06/15 00:01,['1991/06/15 00:00'],"['1991/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1991 Jun 15;146(12):4271-7.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In human K652 erythroleukemia cells TNF produced an 8-10-fold activation of the human TNF promoter linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. The TNF-responsive element was localized to the -125 to -82 region by examining the TNF activation in 5'-deletion or site-directed mutants of the TNF promoter and by demonstrating that the -125 to -82 fragment confers TNF responsiveness to the thymidine kinase promoter. This region contains a palindrome, 5' TGAGCTCA 3', that resembles the consensus binding sequences for the transcription factors, activator protein-1 (AP-1), cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB), and activation transcription factor (ATF). An internal deletion in the palindrome abolished the TNF responsiveness, whereas known AP-1 and CREB/ATF elements were unresponsive to TNF. In band shift analyses a nuclear factor from U937 cells specifically bound to the -125 to -82 TNF-responsive fragment in or near the palindromic sequence.

E. Gallagher, D. A. Giangiulio, C-S. Chang, C. J. Glover, and R. L. Felsted, Blood, 68: 1402-1406, 1986). The present study examined the structures of O-glycans attached to leukosialin, a major sialoglycoprotein in HL-60 cells, and the activities of glycosyltransferases involved in O-glycan synthesis. Leukosialin from RA-resistant and 6-TG-resistant HL-60 sublines migrated much more slowly than those from wild-type HL-60 cells when applied to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The dimethyl sulfoxide-resistant HL-60 subline, on the other hand, expressed leukosialin with a molecular weight similar to wild-type HL-60 cells. RA-resistant and 6-TG-resistant HL-60 cells were found to express a significant amount of tetrasaccharides that contain no sialic acid residue, while wild-type HL-60 cells expressed mainly disialosyl hexasaccharides and contained no detectable amount of asialo-oligosaccharides. Furthermore, wild-type HL-60 cells treated with the inducers for 4 days were found to express the same saccharides present in untreated wild-type HL-60 cells, indicating that the altered O-glycans present in RA and 6-TG sublines were not caused by a direct effect of these agents but rather are intrinsically unique to these sublines. To better understand the mechanisms underlying the differences in O-glycans, the activities of four sialyltransferases were measured: Gal beta 1----3GalNAc alpha 2----3sialyltransferase, Gal beta 1----4(3) GlcNAc alpha 2----3sialyltransferase, Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc alpha 2----6sialyltransferase, and GalNAc alpha 2----6sialyltransferase. Among them, Gal beta 1----3GalNAc alpha 2----3sialyltransferase and Gal beta 1----4(3)GlcNAc alpha 2----3sialyltransferase were much lower in the RA- or 6-TG-resistant HL-60 subline than in wild-type HL-60 cells. These findings indicate that the differences in O-glycans are due to the differences in alpha 2----3sialyltransferase activities. These results strongly suggest that O-glycans associated with leukosialin may play some role in HL-60 cell differentiation.","['Saitoh, O', 'Gallagher, R E', 'Fukuda, M']","['Saitoh O', 'Gallagher RE', 'Fukuda M']","['La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation, Cancer Research Center, California 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,,"['*Antigens, CD', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukosialin', 'Polysaccharides/biosynthesis/*chemistry', 'Sialoglycoproteins/*chemistry', 'Sialyltransferases/analysis', 'Thioguanine/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism/pathology']",,1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Jun 1;51(11):2854-62.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Leukosialin)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '0 (SPN protein, human)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.4.99.- (Sialyltransferases)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",,,,['R01 CA33895/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

A complete remission (CR) was attained in 66 patients (80%, 95% confidence intervals, [CI] 71%-89%). Factors affecting favourable CR achievement were age less than 60 years and absence of lymphadenopathy-hepatosplenomegaly at presentation (P less than 0.05). Median duration of CR was 27 months. 26 patients remain in first continuous and unmaintained CR, 18 of whom between 5.9 and 11.1 years, for an estimated 39% prolonged disease-free survival (95% CI 27%-51%). CR duration correlated significantly with absolute blast cell count (15 x 10(9)/l or less compared to more) and age (30 years or under compared to over). Overall, 29 patients are alive with a median follow-up of 6.7 years, the projected long term survival being 35% at 11 years (95% CI 24%-46%).

The two groups were comparable with respect to age: ITP mean, 4.3 (range 0.3-15.5) years; control mean, 5.8 (0.6-13.8) years. The ITP group had a significantly higher percentage of CD10 positive bone marrow lymphocytes (p = 0.007). Five of the 10 patients younger than 4 years of age in the ITP group had CD10 levels of greater than 30%, which is in the leukemic range, whereas none of the control patients had a CD10 levels of greater than 17% (p = 0.003). There was good correlation between CD10 positivity and B4 positivity indicating that both of these markers arise from the same population of immature B-lymphocytes. None of the ITP patients who were older than 4 years had a CD10 level of greater than 30%. We conclude that it is common to have an increase in the proportion of immature lymphocytes in the marrow of young children with ITP. The cause of this increase in CD10 positive cells is unknown.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Cornelius, A S', 'Campbell, D', 'Schwartz, E', 'Poncz, M']","['Cornelius AS', 'Campbell D', 'Schwartz E', 'Poncz M']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,IM,,"['Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Neprilysin', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic/*immunology']",,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1991 Spring;13(1):57-61. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199121000-00014.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,['10.1097/00043426-199121000-00014 [doi]'],,"['DK 16691/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 37419/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Leukemia cells from these patients were negative for myeloperoxidase staining and failed to express B-cell, T-cell, or megakaryocyte associated antigens. The expression of the CD7 antigen, myeloid associated antigens, or both was detected in three patients each. Ig and/or TCR gene rearrangements were detected in seven of the 12 patients, and five had rearrangement of both the Ig and TCR genes. Full length mature TCR gene transcripts were not demonstrated in most of the patients showing TCR gene rearrangements. In contrast, cells from two patients with germline configurations of the Ig and TCR genes tested expressed truncated forms of both Ig and TCR genes. These results suggest that AUL may generally originate from undifferentiated cells with an aberrant rearrangement and/or expression of the Ig and TCR genes.","['Asou, N', 'Suzushima, H', 'Hattori, T', 'Nishikawa, K', 'Wang, J X', 'Okubo, T', 'Oura, K', 'Sato, M', 'Kawano, F', 'Shido, T']","['Asou N', 'Suzushima H', 'Hattori T', 'Nishikawa K', 'Wang JX', 'Okubo T', 'Oura K', 'Sato M', 'Kawano F', 'Shido T', 'et al.']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Kumamoto University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/genetics', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'CD3 Complex', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement/*genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte/*genetics', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics']",,1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 Apr;5(4):293-9.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here that 20 h incubation of RBL-2H3 cells with 10 microM lovastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG CoA reductase), inhibits both the secretory and morphologic responses to IgE receptor cross-linking. Ag-induced Ca2+ mobilization, determined from the influx and efflux of 45Ca2+, and Ag-induced 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate production are also inhibited in lovastatin-treated RBL-2H3 cells. Under the same conditions, lovastatin does not alter cell proliferation or IgE receptor expression, and it causes only a small impairment of responses initiated by drugs that bypass the earliest steps in the receptor-activated transduction pathway (ionomycin-induced secretion and PMA-induced membrane ruffling). Receptor-mediated Ca2+ mobilization, secretion, and ruffling are all restored by 0.5- to 4-h incubation of lovastatin-treated cells with mevalonic acid, the product of HMG CoA reductase and the first committed intermediate of the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway. In contrast, dolichol and cholesterol, which are synthesized from products of the isoprenoid pathway, do not restore receptor-activated responses. These data implicate an isoprenoid pathway intermediate in an early step in the IgE receptor-activated signal-transduction sequence. We postulate that this intermediate is required for a newly described post-translational modification of proteins, their post-synthetic isoprenylation. The substrates for this modification include the ras family of GTP-binding proteins and the gamma subunits of the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein.","['Deanin, G G', 'Cutts, J L', 'Pfeiffer, J R', 'Oliver, J M']","['Deanin GG', 'Cutts JL', 'Pfeiffer JR', 'Oliver JM']","['Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Albuquerque 87131.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*physiology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/metabolism', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Lovastatin/pharmacology', 'Mevalonic Acid/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/*physiology', 'Receptors, IgE', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",,1991/05/15 00:00,1991/05/15 00:01,['1991/05/15 00:00'],"['1991/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1991 May 15;146(10):3528-35.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', '9LHU78OQFD (Lovastatin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'S5UOB36OCZ (Mevalonic Acid)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,"['CA24773/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM37202/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Using polyethylene glycol, we have fused RPMC with 6-thioguanine resistant, HAT (hypoxanthine, aminopterin, thymidine) sensitive RBL-CA10.7 or RBL-CK2 cells, yielding several hybrid rat mast cell lines (HRMC). The hybridomas exhibited different size and cytoplasmic granularity when compared with parental cell lines. Analysis of both high (Fc epsilon RI) and low affinity (Fc epsilon RL) receptors for IgE revealed that the hybrid lines had more variable receptor patterns than the parent lines. Three hybridoma lines were chosen for further study. Differential histochemical staining with alcian blue and safranin O dyes indicated the hybrids to be predominantly of the MMC type: however, a few cells of one of these uncloned hybridomas were found to be of the CTMC type. Attempts to isolate the CTMC hybridomas yielded one culture which was predominantly of the CTMC phenotype and in a number of other cultures, cells were found expressing simultaneously both the CTMC and the MMC phenotype. After 3 weeks in culture, however, all hybridomas, including those which were cloned further, expressed only the MMC histochemical phenotype. This was found to correlate with the presence of rat mast cell protease II (RMCPII) and the absence of RMCPI in all hybridomas, as detected by Western blot analysis. In addition, the histamine content of all cells was significantly lower than that of the parent RPMC. Most hybrid mast cells expressed both Fc epsilon RI and Fc epsilon RL which in some cases exhibited significant variations in the Mr. These results indicate that somatic cell hybrids expressing the MMC and CTMC phenotype can be produced by the fusion of RBL and RPMC. The CTMC phenotype, however, is unstable, and possible reasons for this are discussed.","['Zheng, Y L', 'Chan, B M', 'Rector, E S', 'Berczi, I', 'Froese, A']","['Zheng YL', 'Chan BM', 'Rector ES', 'Berczi I', 'Froese A']","['Department of Immunology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/ultrastructure', 'Endopeptidases/analysis', 'Histamine/analysis', 'Hybrid Cells/*cytology', 'Immunoglobulin E/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mast Cells/*cytology/immunology/physiology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Receptors, Fc/analysis', 'Receptors, IgE']",,1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1991 Jun;194(2):301-9. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(91)90369-6.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)']",,['10.1016/0014-4827(91)90369-6 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Both chimeric chains were required to express the chimeric Ti and to restore CD3 surface expression. CD8/Ti and CD3 cointernalized and coimmunoprecipitated. Stimulation of the chimeric receptor induced transmembrane signaling events and cell activation.

Twenty-three of the 30 patients with DIC (77%) exhibited tissue factor-like activity levels above normal range (greater than 3.0 U/L), and in eleven of these patients, the levels were more than 10 U/L. Of the 22 patients without DIC, seven patients had elevated levels (3-10 U/L), and had a possibility to be developing DIC. So, we considered them to be in a pre-DIC state. No correlation was found between tissue factor-like activity and alpha 2 plasmin inhibitor-plasmin complex or FDP-D dimer. In a patient with acute monocytic leukemia, the elevated tissue factor-like activity (84.4 U/L) rapidly decreased after the initiation of chemotherapy, whereas in a patient with pancreatic cancer, the level remained elevated (67.4-79.2 U/L). These results suggested that the plasma tissue factor-like activity is differ from the other parameters reflecting the process of DIC and is a useful indicator of the presence of an initiating factor of blood coagulation in some selected patients with DIC or pre-DIC.","['Iijima, K', 'Fukuda, C', 'Nakamura, K']","['Iijima K', 'Fukuda C', 'Nakamura K']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory, Tottori University Hospital, Yonago, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Thromb Res,Thrombosis research,0326377,IM,,"['Adult', 'Antifibrinolytic Agents/blood', 'Cerebral Infarction/complications', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/*blood/etiology', 'Female', 'Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products/metabolism', 'Fibrinolysin/blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/complications', 'Thromboplastin/*metabolism', '*alpha-2-Antiplasmin']",,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Thromb Res. 1991 Jan 1;61(1):29-38. doi: 10.1016/0049-3848(91)90166-t.,"['0 (Antifibrinolytic Agents)', '0 (Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products)', '0 (alpha-2-Antiplasmin)', '0 (fibrin fragment D)', '0 (plasmin-plasmin inhibitor complex)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)', 'EC 3.4.21.7 (Fibrinolysin)']",,['10.1016/0049-3848(91)90166-t [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In nine T-ALL the TcR-gamma genes were rearranged on both alleles, whereas in the tenth leukemia one allele was rearranged and the other was in germline configuration. Twelve out of the 19 rearranged alleles contained rearrangements of the J gamma 2.3 gene segment, five of which were to the V gamma 8 gene segment and three to the V gamma 3 gene segment. This implies that the combinatorial repertoire of the rearranged TcR-gamma gene is restricted due to the preferential usage of several V gamma and J gamma gene segments. The TcR-delta genes were rearranged on both alleles in nine T-ALL, whereas in the tenth leukemia one allele was rearranged and the other deleted. The combinatorial repertoire of the TcR-delta genes was homogeneous, as in all ten T-ALL at least one allele contained a V delta 1-J delta 1 rearrangement. In at least nine of the ten T-ALL the V delta 1-J delta 1 allele coded for the expressed TcR-delta chain, as was supported by reactivity with the anti-V delta 1-J delta 1 (delta TCS1) antibody in all T-ALL tested. As the total repertoire of the TcR molecules is not only dependent on combinations of gene segments, but also on the size and diversity of the junctional regions, we studied the V delta 1-J delta 1 junctional regions using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. These PCR analyses showed that the size of the V delta 1-J delta 1 junctional regions differed markedly (up to approximately 30 bases or more) between the leukemias. Therefore we conclude that the combinatorial repertoire of TcR-delta S+ T-ALL is limited, especially due to the homogeneous TcR-gamma gene rearrangements, but that the junctional repertoire of the TcR-delta genes seems to be extensive.","['Breit, T M', 'Wolvers-Tettero, I L', 'Hahlen, K', 'van Wering, E R', 'van Dongen, J J']","['Breit TM', 'Wolvers-Tettero IL', 'Hahlen K', 'van Wering ER', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus University/University Hospital Dijkzigt, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",,1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 Feb;5(2):116-24.,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is characterized by aggregation and subsequent loss of the molecules from the cell surface, usually by internalization. In this study we have investigated the effect of modulation of the T-cell antigen receptor complex (TCR) and the transferrin receptor (TFR) on the distribution of cholera toxin (CTx)- and pertussis toxin (PTx)-sensitive GTP binding proteins in human T-lymphocytes. Modulation of both the TCR and the TFR induced a selective shift of PTx-sensitive G-proteins from the plasma membrane to a high density membrane fraction enriched for lysosomal membranes. The distribution of CTx-sensitive G-proteins was unaffected. This shift was found in both the T-cell leukemia line Jurkat and in normal T-cells. The loss of PTx-sensitive G-proteins from the plasma membrane required approximately 15 h to be complete and was not inhibited by cycloheximide. It had no influence on T-cell triggering via anti-T-cell receptor antibodies and is unrelated to the inactivating effect of TCR-modulation on T-cell signalling. The loss of PTx-sensitive G-proteins was not accompanied by greater sensitivity to stimuli raising cAMP concentration. These results show that PTx-sensitive G-proteins can be selectively depleted from the plasma membrane by antibody treatment of T-cells.","['Gerardy-Schahn, R', 'Mittrucker, H W', 'Schultze, U', 'Fleischer, B']","['Gerardy-Schahn R', 'Mittrucker HW', 'Schultze U', 'Fleischer B']","['1.

We have previously shown that entry of myeloid leukemic cells into S phase can be accelerated in vitro through the use of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF), resulting in enhancement of ara-C-mediated cytotoxicity. In order to evaluate the in vivo biological and clinical effects of this strategy in patients with high risk AML, we treated three patients with either refractory or relapsed disease with a continuous infusion of rhGM-CSF (0.45 micrograms/kg/h aglycoprotein) for 18 h, followed by the institution of high dose ara-C and continuation of rhGM-CSF throughout the 4 day duration of ara-C treatment. Prior to therapy, no patient had detectable levels of circulating rhGM-CSF, and there was no evidence of GM-CSF receptor occupancy in leukemic myeloblasts. After 18 h of rhGM-CSF therapy, all patients had biologically active levels of circulating rhGM-CSF (7.9-12.0 ng/ml), and two patients showed a significant degree of leukemic GM-CSF receptor occupancy without evidence of GM-CSF receptor down-regulation. A significant rise in the S phase fraction of leukemic myeloblasts was observed at 18 h of rhGM-CSF treatment in all three patients (29-56% increment). The toxicity of combined rhGM-CSF/ara-C therapy included pericarditis and cerebellar degeneration in one patient, fever and mild renal dysfunction in two patients, and mild hepatic dysfunction in all three patients. Each patient showed a transient rise in the absolute neutrophil and blast count during rhGM-CSF/ara-C administration, followed by profound, but clinically tolerable, myelosuppression. No patient developed clinical evidence of leukostasis. There was one death related to pericardial tamponade, one death related to refractory disease, and one clinical and cytogenetic remission. These results suggest that exogenously administered rhGM-CSF is capable of rapidly mobilizing leukemic cells into S phase in vivo and theoretically should be useful in overcoming kinetic resistance to ara-C. Clinical trials of this regimen in patients with high risk AML who are not already pharmacologically resistant to ara-C are warranted.","['Cannistra, S A', 'DiCarlo, J', 'Groshek, P', 'Kanakura, Y', 'Berg, D', 'Mayer, R J', 'Griffin, J D']","['Cannistra SA', 'DiCarlo J', 'Groshek P', 'Kanakura Y', 'Berg D', 'Mayer RJ', 'Griffin JD']","['Division of Tumor Immunology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/blood/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage/blood/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'S Phase/drug effects']",,1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 Mar;5(3):230-8.,"['0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,"['CA 34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 36167/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,

Although PCR holds great promise for ""molecular"" staging and follow-up, several technical problems have to be kept in mind, and the clinical relevance of PCR-based evidence of minimal residual disease in haematological malignancies requires further investigation.","['Fey, M F', 'Kulozik, A E', 'Hansen-Hagge, T E', 'Tobler, A']","['Fey MF', 'Kulozik AE', 'Hansen-Hagge TE', 'Tobler A']","['Institute of Medical Oncology, Inselspital, Berne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,IM,,"['False Negative Reactions', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*diagnosis', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction']",54,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1991;27(1):89-94. doi: 10.1016/0277-5379(91)90070-t.,,,['10.1016/0277-5379(91)90070-t [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

A significant increase in CD10+ cells occurred in BM in both children and adults after ABMT. In children, we also found a significant increase in CD10+ cells in PB. In individual patients remaining in remission, up to 34% CD10+ cells having a normal Ig kappa/lambda light chain ratio were recorded after ABMT. In children, the percentage of TdT+ and CD10+ TdT+ cells increased significantly in BM. In most cases the CD10/TdT-ratio was greater than 1.0, but during early regeneration after ABMT this ratio was less than 1.0 in several patients remaining in complete remission. In patients remaining in remission, CD10+TdT+ cells were detected in the blood in only 2 out of 140 samples tested, and the proportion of these cells never exceeded 0.03%.

These MoAbs reacted exclusively with CD3+ T cells and did not label B-lineage and myeloid cells. In 17 of the 40 T-ALL cases studied the leukemic blasts lacked membrane and cytoplasmic TCR chains (group I). In 12 cases cells did not have membrane CD3/TCR but expressed cytoplasmic TCR proteins heterogenously: nine cases had cytoplasmic TCR beta chains (beta F1+, alpha F1-; group II), one case had cytoplasmic TCR alpha chains (alpha F1+, beta F1-; group III), and two cases were labeled by both alpha F1 and beta F1 MoAbs (group IV). The remaining 11 cases were mCD3+: nine were TCR alpha beta+ (group Va) and two exhibited TCR gamma delta (TCR delta-1+, delta TCS-1+; group Vb). The analysis of the TCR beta, -gamma, and -delta gene configurations in 23 of the 40 T-ALLs showed that: (1) the lack of TCR protein expression was due to the lack of TCR gene rearrangements only in one of nine cases; (2) five of five TCR beta+, TCR alpha- cases studied had germline TCR alpha genes (ie, no detectable TCR delta gene deletions); (3) seven of eight cases with TCR delta gene deletions expressed TCR alpha proteins, whereas in 12 of 20 of the T-ALLs with TCR beta gene rearrangements the synthesis of the corresponding protein occurred; only 2 of 16 cases with rearranged TCR delta genes expressed TCR delta chains. The T-ALL categories identified with anti-TCR MoAbs did not have additional characteristic phenotypic patterns and may correspond to the normal stages of T-cell development more precisely than those defined by other differentiation antigens.","['Campana, D', 'van Dongen, J J', 'Mehta, A', 'Coustan-Smith, E', 'Wolvers-Tettero, I L', 'Ganeshaguru, K', 'Janossy, G']","['Campana D', 'van Dongen JJ', 'Mehta A', 'Coustan-Smith E', 'Wolvers-Tettero IL', 'Ganeshaguru K', 'Janossy G']","['Department of Immunology and Haematology, Royal Free Hospital, School of Medicine, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'CD3 Complex', 'Female', 'Fetus', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology', 'Liver/immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Pregnancy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/analysis/*genetics', 'Reference Values']",,1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1991 Apr 1;77(7):1546-54.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",,['S0006-4971(20)83294-7 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we analyzed the structures of O-glycans attached to leukosialin present in various T-lymphocytic leukemia cells. T-lymphoid cells from patients with acute T-lymphocytic leukemia express a large amount of the branched hexasaccharides, NeuNAc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----3(NeuNAc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----6)GalNAc, which are also expressed in activated normal T lymphocytes, but that are almost absent in resting normal T lymphocytes.

The same hexasaccharides can be detected in thymocytes. The increased amount of the hexasaccharides in acute leukemia is associated with increased activity of beta 1----6 GlcNAc-transferase, a key enzyme in forming the hexasaccharides. Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates showed that monoclonal antibody (MoAb) T-305 reacts preferentially with leukosialin of high mol wt containing the hexasaccharides.

The immunotherapy was achieved by transfer of anti-ESb-immune spleen cells from B10.D2 mice, which express the same major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules as DBA/2. In contrast, anti-ESb-immune cells from MHC-disparate C57BL/6 mice did not confer protective immunity. The B10.D2 anti-ESb-immune T cells contain two types of cytolytic specificity as detected by limiting-dilution analysis: (1) clones with specificity for the ESb-tumour-associated transplantation antigen (TATA) (at low frequency), and (b) clones with specificity for minor DBA/2 histocompatibility (H) antigens (at high frequency). Immune B10.D2 cells raised against different tumour lines or against TATA-ESb tumour variants did not confer the 100% protection seen with immune cells against ESb TATA+ cells. Finally we demonstrate that the allogeneic immune cells are more potent in terms of protective immunity than corresponding syngeneic immune cells. The data suggest that the strong graft-versus-leukemia effect with immune T cells from allogeneic MHC-identical but not from MHC-disparate mice was due to T cells with MHC-restricted specificity for an ESb-associated TATA. A graft-versus-host reactivity that developed much later and could not be prevented was most likely due to T cells sensitized against normal minor H antigens of the host. Our results are of potential relevance for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and adoptive immunotherapy protocols.","['Schirrmacher, V', 'von Hoegen, P', 'Griesbach, A', 'Schild, H J', 'Zangemeister-Wittke, U']","['Schirrmacher V', 'von Hoegen P', 'Griesbach A', 'Schild HJ', 'Zangemeister-Wittke U']","['Institut fur Immunologie und Genetik, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD', 'Capillary Permeability', 'Graft vs Host Reaction', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive/adverse effects', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology/*therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1991;32(6):373-81. doi: 10.1007/BF01741332.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",,['10.1007/BF01741332 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro studies confirmed previous work showing that antibody bivalency is required to induce modulation in vitro in simple systems. However, in the presence of isolated Kupffer cells, Fc-containing univalent antibodies were found to induce significant antigenic modulation, and the modulation induced by intact IgG was also found to be more rapid and extensive. Fragments that did not contain Fc regions behaved similarly in the presence or absence of Kupffer cells. Further investigations demonstrated that all three classes of human FcR can mediate modulation enhancement, and suggest that the mechanism involves indirect cross-linking of cell surface Ag via the antibody and effector cell FcR. In vivo studies showed that univalent antibody derivatives containing Fc regions did induce antigenic modulation, but that this was significantly reduced in comparison with bivalent antibodies, confirming their potential advantage for immunotherapy.","['Lane, A C', 'Foroozan, S', 'Glennie, M J', 'Kowalski-Saunders, P', 'Stevenson, G T']","['Lane AC', 'Foroozan S', 'Glennie MJ', 'Kowalski-Saunders P', 'Stevenson GT']","['Lymphoma Research Unit, Southampton General Hospital, England.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Surface/*metabolism', 'Endocytosis', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/immunology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Kupffer Cells/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Receptors, Fc/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgG']",,1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1991 Apr 1;146(7):2461-8.,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells are clonal expansions of B lymphocytes frozen at specific stages of activation. They displayed two patterns of response upon surface Ig (sIg) cross-linking in terms of in vitro proliferation and intracellular free Ca2+ mobilization: cells from patient F (first pattern) proliferated in the presence of mitogenic anti-mu antibodies, whereas cells from patient A (second pattern) did not respond to sIg cross-linking but proliferated in the presence of low m.w. B cell growth factor and IL-2. Coculture of A or F cells with C3b-bearing SRBC led to a two- to four-fold increase in thymidine incorporation in cultures containing low m.w. B cell growth factor but not in cultures containing rIL-2. This enhanced proliferation was inhibited by F(ab')2 polyclonal rabbit antihuman CR1 antibodies. Only cells which proliferated in the presence of anti-mu (cells F) responded to cross-linking of sIg with a rise in intracellular Ca2+. No increase in calcium mobilization was observed after co-cross-linking of CR1 and sIg on A and F cells with mAb or polyclonal anti-CR1 antibodies. Co-cross-linking of CR2 with sIg only led to an enhanced intracellular Ca2+ rise in F cells but not in A cells. The lack of CR2-mediated synergy in Ca2+ rise in A cells indicates that the synergy occurs only if there is a proper coupling of sIg to phospholipase C. CR1-induced proliferation of B cells does not involve the signaling pathways of sIg. These results provide additional evidences for the role of C3 fragments in modulation of human B cell activation.","['Hivroz, C', 'Fischer, E', 'Kazatchkine, M D', 'Grillot-Courvalin, C']","['Hivroz C', 'Fischer E', 'Kazatchkine MD', 'Grillot-Courvalin C']","['INSERUM U 108, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,,"['Antigens, CD/*physiology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/biosynthesis/physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/physiology', 'Interleukin-4/physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', 'Phosphatidylinositols/physiology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/physiology', 'Receptors, Complement/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Receptors, Complement 3b', 'Receptors, Complement 3d', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1991/03/15 00:00,1991/03/15 00:01,['1991/03/15 00:00'],"['1991/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1991 Mar 15;146(6):1766-72.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '0 (Receptors, Complement 3b)', '0 (Receptors, Complement 3d)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rather, the data suggested this preservation of tetrahydrofolate cofactor pools is likely due to a fraction of cellular folates unavailable for oxidation to dihydrofolate. This paper explores the role of cell cycle phase in L1210 leukemia cells in logarithmic versus stationary phase growth as a factor in the rate and extent of tetrahydrofolate cofactor interconversion to dihydrofolate after exposure of cells to the dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor trimetrexate. The S phase fraction was reduced by inoculating L1210 leukemia cells at high density to achieve a stationary state. Flow cytometric analysis of DNA content indicated that log phase cultures were 53.0% S phase; this decreased to 42.1% at 24 h and 24.1% at 48 h in stationary phase cultures. 5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation into DNA decreased 80 and 96%, while [3H]dUrd incorporation into DNA declined 70 and 95% for stationary cultures at 24 and 48 h, respectively, as compared with the log phase rates. Log phase cells interconverted 28.0% of the total pool of radiolabeled folates to dihydrofolate with a half-time of approximately 30 s. Stationary cells at 24 h interconverted 20.4% of the total folate pool with a t1/2 of approximately 3 min, and at 48 h, net interconversion to dihydrofolate decreased further to 12.1% with a t1/2 of approximately 6 min. The decrease in the extent of tetrahydrofolate cofactor interconversion to dihydrofolate in stationary phase cells was directly proportional to the decrease in the S phase fraction determined by total DNA content. This suggests that tetrahydrofolate cofactor depletion occurs only in S phase cells. The much larger drop in [3H]dUrd and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation into DNA in comparison with the decline in the S phase fraction measured by DNA content along with the reduced rate of tetrahydrofolate cofactor interconversion to dihydrofolate indicates that the rate of DNA synthesis is decreased in S phase cells in stationary cultures. Network thermodynamic simulations suggest that a reduction in the number of S phase cells and their thymidylate synthase catalytic activity would account for the observed decrease in the rate and extent of interconversion of tetrahydrofolate cofactors to dihydrofolate after trimetrexate in stationary phase cultures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Trent, D F', 'Seither, R L', 'Goldman, I D']","['Trent DF', 'Seither RL', 'Goldman ID']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Folic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Folic Acid Antagonists', 'Leukemia L1210/*enzymology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Quinazolines/pharmacology', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/*metabolism', 'Tetrahydrofolates/*metabolism', 'Thermodynamics', 'Trimetrexate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/pathology']",,1991/03/25 00:00,1991/03/25 00:01,['1991/03/25 00:00'],"['1991/03/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/25 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1991 Mar 25;266(9):5445-9.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '4033-27-6 (dihydrofolate)', '43ZWB253H4 (5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolic acid)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'UPN4ITI8T4 (Trimetrexate)']",,['S0021-9258(19)67615-5 [pii]'],,"['CA-09340/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-39807/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

About half of the T-cells in peripheral blood express CD45RA while the remainder express CD45RO. A switch from the high to the low Mr isoform of CD45 has been found in association with the process of T-cell stimulation and acquisition of ""memory."" B-cells normally express CD45RA, but not CD45RO. However, under stimulatory conditions, B-cells may be capable of undergoing an isoform switch and expressing CD45RO. The expression of this low Mr isoform of CD45 was investigated in lymphomas composed of monoclonal B-cells to determine if such a switch occurs in malignant B-cell populations. The vast majority (110/117 cases) of B-cell lymphomas expressed only CD45RA, while a very small number (7/117 cases) expressed CD45RO, but not CD45RA. There was no relationship between the CD45RO expression and the histologic subtype. The physiological significance of this unusual expression of CD45RO in a subpopulation of B-cell lymphomas is not clear. In that CD45RO, as defined by the MoAb UCHL 1, is typically used as a marker of T-cells in tissue sections, caution must be exercised in interpretation, since not all T-cells are reactive and some B-cell lymphomas are reactive.","['Caldwell, C W', 'Marty, L M', 'Feldbush, T L']","['Caldwell CW', 'Marty LM', 'Feldbush TL']","['Department of Pathology, University of Missouri School of Medicine, Columbia 65212.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Immunol Immunopathol,Clinical immunology and immunopathology,0356637,IM,,"['Antigens, Differentiation/*biosynthesis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Isoantigens', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens', 'Lymph Nodes/cytology/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/immunology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/immunology', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Immunoblastic/immunology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*immunology']",,1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Immunol Immunopathol. 1991 Mar;58(3):377-84. doi: 10.1016/0090-1229(91)90128-w.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Isoantigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",,['10.1016/0090-1229(91)90128-w [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The rate of dissociation of this bound ligand was monitored by using a fluorescence method under two different conditions. In one case the monovalent ligand DCT was added in large excess to prevent the dissociating ligand from rebinding to unoccupied antibody combining sites. Under these conditions, dissociation of the bivalent ligand from IgE-sensitized cells proceeds to completion with kinetics that are well described by two rate constants that are independent of the time of preincubation of the bivalent ligand with the cells. In the second case, dissociation of (DCT)2-Cys from cell-bound anti-DNP IgE was monitored in the presence of a large excess of anti-DNP IgE in solution that acts as a sink to absorb the dissociated ligand. Under these conditions, the bivalent ligand becomes more resistant to dissociation as the preincubation time of the bivalent ligand with the cells is increased. An increasing fraction of the bound ligand does not dissociate on a measurable time scale in the presence of this sink. The results indicate that cell-associated IgE-receptor complexes undergo a time-dependent change that facilitates the reformation of the cross-linked state when one end of the ligand dissociates to break up the existing cross-link.

Intensive chemotherapy induced a complete remission of the T-lymphoblastic NHL. However, the patient died from massive infiltration of lympho-hemopoietic tissue by cells with the morphology and immunological phenotype of macrophages. Southern blot analysis revealed the presence of a clonally rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain (lgH) gene in tumorous tissue obtained at autopsy.

Infection of an interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent mouse myeloid cell line (FDC-P1) with a high titer retroviral vector expressing the human c-fms c-DNA, enabled CSF-1-dependent proliferation in short-term liquid culture assays as well as in clonal culture systems. CSF-1-dependent cell lines could be established after sorting for CSF-1R positive cells. In contrast to FDC-P1 cells, expression of the CSF-1R in CTLL cells, an IL-2-dependent mouse cytotoxic T-cell line, and in T-cell growth factor III/P40-dependent helper T-cells, ST2/K9.4a2, did not lead to CSF-1-dependent proliferation. These observations lead to the conclusion that ectopically expressed CSF-1R may function on certain myeloid cells where it is normally not expressed, suggesting the presence of signal transduction pathways which can be utilized by that foreign receptor.

This reorganization of the actin may be responsible for changes in cellular morphology during the degranulation process. The antigen-stimulated polymerization of actin can be blocked in a dose-dependent manner by protein kinase inhibitors which also block degranulation. Conversely, reagents such as PMA, 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol (diC8), and 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-glycerol (OAG) which stimulate protein kinase C (PKC) also activate the rise in F-actin, although they have no effect on degranulation by themselves. The actin response which can be stimulated by the PKC activators can also be blocked by protein kinase inhibitors indicating that the PMA- and OAG-induced response is probably through activation of a protein kinase. Depletion of PKC activity through long term (20 h) exposure of RBL cells to PMA, also inhibited the F-actin response when the cells were stimulated with either multivalent antigen or OAG. External Ca++, which is an absolute requirement for degranulation, is not necessary for the rise in F-actin, but may modulate the response. Furthermore, ionomycin, which induces a large Ca++ influx, does not stimulate the F-actin increase even at doses that cause degranulation. These results suggest that activation of a protein kinase, such as PKC, may be responsible for signaling the polymerization of actin in RBL cells and that a rise in intracellular Ca++ is neither necessary nor sufficient for this response.","['Apgar, J R']",['Apgar JR'],"['Division of Membrane Biology, Medical Biology Institute, La Jolla, California 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,IM,,"['Actins/*metabolism', 'Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*physiology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Carbazoles/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Diglycerides/pharmacology', 'Immunoglobulin E/immunology', 'Indole Alkaloids', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/*physiology', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Serotonin/metabolism', 'Sphingosine/pharmacology', 'Staurosporine', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",,1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1991 Mar;112(6):1157-63. doi: 10.1083/jcb.112.6.1157.,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Indole Alkaloids)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', '97161-97-2 (staurosporine aglycone)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,['10.1083/jcb.112.6.1157 [doi]'],PMC2288902,"['P01-AI24526/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-AI26950/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Influence of degree of dihydrofolate reductase inhibition.",4112-8,"An important unresolved issue in antifolate pharmacology is the basis for the observation that the major portion of cellular tetrahydrofolate cofactors is preserved after dihydrofolate reductase activity is abolished by antifolates despite the fact that tetrahydrofolate cofactor-dependent purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis ceases. This has been attributed to feedback inhibition of thymidylate synthase by dihydrofolate polyglutamates that accumulate in the presence of antifolates. This report combines network thermodynamic modeling and experimental observations to evaluate the effects of direct inhibition of thymidylate synthase at the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate binding site with a potent lipophilic quinazoline antifolate PD130883 on folate oxidation in cells. Computer simulations predict and the data indicate that marked PD130883 suppression of thymidylate synthase only slows the rate but not the extent of tetrahydrofolate cofactor interconversion to dihydrofolate upon complete suppression of dihydrofolate reductase with trimetrexate. These observations are consistent with earlier studies from this laboratory with fluorodeoxyuridine inhibition at the deoxyuridylate binding site. Hence, the much weaker inhibition by dihydrofolate polyglutamates at the level of thymidylate synthase cannot account for the apparent preservation of tetrahydrofolate cofactor pools in cells and has virtually no pharmacologic significance under conditions in which antifolates completely suppress dihydrofolate reductase. The extent of interconversion of tetrahydrofolate cofactors to dihydrofolate is strongly influenced by residual dihydrofolate reductase catalytic activity. Exposure of cells to 0.1 microM trimetrexate results in only approximately 60% of maximum dihydrofolate levels achieved when dihydrofolate reductase activity is abolished. Network thermodynamic simulations predict, and experiments verify, that inhibition of thymidylate synthase at the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate site by PD130883, when dihydrofolate reductase is only partially suppressed (approximately 85%) with 0.1 microM trimetrexate, substantially decreases (31-47%) the net level of interconversion of tetrahydrofolate cofactors to dihydrofolate. Further computer simulations predict that under conditions in which residual dihydrofolate reductase activity persists within the cells (more than about 5%), feedback inhibitory effects of dihydrofolate polyglutamates as well as other weak inhibitors of thymidylate synthase can significantly limit the extent of net interconversion of tetrahydrofolate cofactors to dihydrofolate and produce an apparent ""compartmentation phenomenon"" in which tetrahydrofolate cofactor pools are preserved within the cell in the presence of antifolates. Residual dihydrofolate reductase activity cannot, however, account for the partial interconversion of tetrahydrofolate cofactors to dihydrofolate after exposure to high trimetrexate or methotrexate levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Seither, R L', 'Trent, D F', 'Mikulecky, D C', 'Rape, T J', 'Goldman, I D']","['Seither RL', 'Trent DF', 'Mikulecky DC', 'Rape TJ', 'Goldman ID']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['Animals', '*Folic Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Quinazolines/pharmacology', 'Quinazolinones', 'Tetrahydrofolates/*metabolism', 'Thermodynamics', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Trimetrexate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1991/03/05 00:00,1991/03/05 00:01,['1991/03/05 00:00'],"['1991/03/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/05 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1991 Mar 5;266(7):4112-8.,"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '0SXY5ET48B (5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolic acid)', '123685-36-9 (PD 130883)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'UPN4ITI8T4 (Trimetrexate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,['S0021-9258(20)64293-4 [pii]'],,"['CA-09340/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-39807/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

The immunocytochemical labelling pattern of CR1 was evaluated semiquantitatively on cell smears using three different anti-CR1 monoclonal antibodies. The scoring method showed that seven patients with CML had a marked reduction in CR1 expression which did not change with in vitro stimulation of neutrophils with phorbol-myristate-acetate (PMA) whereas control cells responded to PMA, increasing the receptor level two-fold. In addition, functional analysis of neutrophils with low CR1 expression from CML patients showed a very low cytolytic activity against K562 tumour target, suggesting a relationship between the cellular content of CR1 and neutrophil tumouricidal activity. The involvement of CR1 in neutrophil-mediated lysis is consistent with complete lack of tumour toxicity following receptor neutralization by anti-CR1 monoclonal antibodies. Interferon therapy improved CR1 expression and the cytolytic response of neutrophils in three out of five CML patients with a moderately low CR1 score.

The phenotype of these cells was CD4-, CD8+, CD5+, CD6+ with poor expression of CD3, CD7, and CD25. Southern blot analysis of T-cell receptor beta-chain gene revealed one allele rearranged band. The serum antibodies were positive against human T-cell leukemia virus, type I-associated antigens, but monoclonal integration of proviral DNA was not detected in the leukemic cells suggesting that she was just a carrier of this virus. Interestingly, serum PTH-related peptide (PRP) was elevated. The combination therapy with vincristine and prednisolone for leukemia decreased not only the number of leukemic cells but also the serum PRP levels. The clinical course was aggressive.

Calmodulin inhibitors reduce both the basal and cholera toxin-enhanced secretory responses to antigen and Ca2(+)-mobilizing agents. These synergistic effects suggest that the activation of a Gs-like GTP-binding protein, together with a (probably calmodulin-dependent) event activated by an increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels, may jointly provide a sufficient signal for secretion. Antigen-stimulated secretion is inhibited by depleting cells of GTP with mycophenolic acid but is maximal in cells treated with mycophenolic acid plus cholera toxin. The simplest explanation is that cholera toxin selectively reactivates the Gs-coupled pathway leading to secretion in GTP-depleted cells without restoring the activity of a separate GTP-binding protein(s) that constrains antigen-stimulated secretion.","['Wilson, B S', 'Deanin, G G', 'Oliver, J M']","['Wilson BS', 'Deanin GG', 'Oliver JM']","['Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque 87131.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*physiology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calmodulin/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Line', 'Cholera Toxin/pharmacology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Immunoglobulin E/immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/immunology/physiology', 'Mycophenolic Acid/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/drug effects/*physiology', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Serotonin/*metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Terpenes/pharmacology', 'Thapsigargin', 'Trifluoperazine/pharmacology']",,1991/02/14 00:00,1991/02/14 00:01,['1991/02/14 00:00'],"['1991/02/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/14 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/14 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1991 Feb 14;174(3):1064-9. doi: 10.1016/0006-291x(91)91528-k.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Calmodulin)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Terpenes)', '214IZI85K3 (Trifluoperazine)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '65595-90-6 (W 7)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', '9012-63-9 (Cholera Toxin)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'HU9DX48N0T (Mycophenolic Acid)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,"['0006-291X(91)91528-K [pii]', '10.1016/0006-291x(91)91528-k [doi]']",,['GM37202/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

We have analyzed the effects of TNF alpha on the expression of GM-CSF and IL-3 receptors on AML cells. Incubation of blasts from seven patients with AML in serum-free medium with TNF (10(3) U/mL) and subsequent binding studies using 125I-GM-CSF and 125I-IL-3 show that TNF increases the specific binding of GM-CSF (30% to 280%) and IL-3 (40% to 600%) in all cases. From Scatchard plot analysis it appears that TNF upregulates (1) low-affinity GM-CSF binding sites, (2) common high-affinity IL-3/GM-CSF binding sites, and (3) unique (non-GM-CSF binding) IL-3 binding sites. The effect of TNF is dose dependent and is half maximal at a concentration of 100 U/mL, and becomes evident at 18 hours of incubation with TNF at 37 degrees C, but not at 0 degree C. The GM-CSF dose-response curve of AML-colony-forming units plateaus at a higher level in the presence of TNF, which indicates that additional numbers of cells become responsive to GM-CSF. Incubation of AML blasts with the phorbol ester 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (protein kinase C activators) does not influence GM-CSF receptor expression, suggesting that receptor upregulation by TNF is not mediated through activation of protein kinase C. On the other hand, the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide abrogates receptor upregulation induced by TNF. In contrast to these findings in AML, TNF does not upregulate GM-CSF receptor numbers on blood granulocytes or monocytes. We conclude that TNF exerts positive effects on growth factor receptor expression of hematopoietic cells.","['Elbaz, O', 'Budel, L M', 'Hoogerbrugge, H', 'Touw, I P', 'Delwel, R', 'Mahmoud, L A', 'Lowenberg, B']","['Elbaz O', 'Budel LM', 'Hoogerbrugge H', 'Touw IP', 'Delwel R', 'Mahmoud LA', 'Lowenberg B']","['Dr Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1991 Mar 1;77(5):989-95.,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",,['S0006-4971(20)84191-3 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

This bispecific Ab had a molecular mass of 100 to 110 Kd, and the capacity to react with both CD3+ T cells and CD10+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. We studied whether cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) could lyse patient CD10+ ALL cells after addition of the bispecific Ab. As effector CTLs, interleukin-2 (IL-2)-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and CTL clones were used. When IL-2-stimulated PBMCs were assayed for cytotoxicity to 61Cr-labeled CD10+ ALL cells, their activity was shown to be markedly enhanced by the addition of the bispecific Ab. Most of the CTL clones established lacked cytotoxicity for CD10+ ALL cells, but addition of the bispecific Ab induced a significant level of cytotoxicity.

To study the expression of these genes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and to determine the specific myeloid lineages and stages of myeloid differentiation at which the expression of these genes is acquired, we used a series of 79 cases of de novo AML as a differentiation model. The levels of c-fgr, hck, and c-fms (encoding the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor) mRNA transcripts were correlated with the presence of specific cell surface antigens and the morphologic and cytochemical features in these AML blasts. Relatively undifferentiated leukemic myeloblasts with an HLA-DR, CD34, CD33, CD13+/- cell surface immunophenotype (French-American-British [FAB] M1 or M2) were characterized by a lack of c-fms and c-fgr expression, while low levels of c-fms and c-fgr could be detected in undifferentiated myeloblasts (FAB M1 or M2), which also expressed CD14 at low antigen density. The hck transcripts were either undetectable in these cells or were expressed at low levels. In contrast, only hck mRNA transcripts could be identified in blasts with progranulocytic morphology (FAB M3), while c-fms, c-fgr, and hck were all expressed at high levels in blasts with differentiated myelomonocytic or monocytic features (FAB M4 and M5). No c-fms, c-fgr, or hck transcripts were evident in leukemic cells of the erythroid lineage (FAB M6). When undifferentiated leukemic myeloblasts (HLA-DR, CD34, and CD33) were induced to differentiate in vitro to cells with monocytic characteristics, the expression of c-fms, c-fgr, and the CD14 cell surface antigen were induced to high levels, accompanied by the acquisition of hck and CD13 expression. In contrast, when HLA-DR, CD34, and CD33 blasts were induced to differentiate in vitro to cells with granulocytic characteristics, only hck and CD13 expression were induced. Our data suggest that the acquisition of c-fgr and/or hck expression is associated with early commitment and differentiation events in distinct myeloid lineages.

The A6 reactivity was preserved with different fixatives (formalin, Bouin's fluid, Carnoy's fixative, and B5) and decalcification procedures and was slightly enhanced by trypsin digestion. The pattern of reactivity of A6 was similar to that obtained with MoAb UCHL-1, recognizing the CD45RO determinant of leukocyte common antigen; however, in pathologic tissues, A6 labeled a higher percentage of cells than UCHL-1. Cross-blocking and enzyme digestion studies (Pronase E [Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO] and neuraminidase [Sigma Chemical]) indicated that the two MoAbs may identify close epitopes on the same molecule.

Considerable work has focused on CD45 expression by lymphoid cells, but minimal work has involved granulocytes. Granulocytic, or myeloid, cell differentiation is accompanied by a number of morphologic and immunophenotypic changes. This study used flow cytometric and immunocytochemical methods in conjunction with morphologic assessment to investigate the expression of CD45 isoforms during differentiation of normal and malignant granulocytic cells. On normal bone marrow cells, the quantity of surface CD45 did not change during earlier stages but did increase significantly at the terminal stages (bands and polymorphonuclear leukocytes [PMNs]). CD45RO (the low relative molecular mass [Mr] isoform) was very dimly expressed on immature cells but became increasingly brighter beginning at approximately the myelocyte stage. The high Mr isoform (CD45RA) was virtually absent from the cell surface at all stages. Only a small percentage (3-15%) of PMNs expressed surface CD45RA. However, there was a cytoplasmic pool of each isoform associated with membrane-bound granules found throughout differentiation, with remarkable increases in expression at the terminal stages. In the case of acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs), most cases expressed surface CD45RA with, or without, CD45RO, regardless of their French-American-British (FAB) classification. This appeared to be a stable process at diagnosis and relapse in individual patients and may therefore serve as a diagnostic aid. The biologic significance of this aberrant expression of CD45RA by malignant cells is unknown but raises important questions regarding the cellular processes of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation in normal and malignant cells.","['Caldwell, C W', 'Patterson, W P', 'Toalson, B D', 'Yesus, Y W']","['Caldwell CW', 'Patterson WP', 'Toalson BD', 'Yesus YW']","['Department of Pathology, University of Missouri School of Medicine, Columbia 65212.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,IM,,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Cytoplasm/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocytes/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens']",,1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1991 Feb;95(2):180-7. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/95.2.180.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",,['10.1093/ajcp/95.2.180 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The clk gene product contains a C-terminal cdc2-like kinase domain, most similar to the FUS3 catalytic domain. The Clk protein, expressed in bacteria, becomes efficiently phosphorylated in vitro on tyrosine as well as serine/threonine, and phosphorylates the exogenous substrate poly(glu, tyr) on tyrosine. Direct biochemical evidence indicates that both protein-tyrosine and protein-serine/threonine kinase activities are intrinsic to the Clk catalytic domain.

However, children with DS-ALL were slightly older at the time of presentation and had higher hemoglobin values. The relative frequency of each major immunophenotype (early pre-B, pre-B, T, or B) was also comparable for patients with or without DS. For this report, treatment regimens were categorized as either conventional (no consolidation therapy) or intensive. Cox regression analysis revealed that the presence of DS, a higher leukocyte count, black race, or age older than 10 years was independently associated with a poorer event-free survival (EFS) for children treated with conventional chemotherapy. However, for the cohort of children who received intensive chemotherapy, DS was no longer an independent risk factor. In fact, event-free survival (EFS) was markedly improved to a level comparable with that observed in the children diagnosed as having NDS-ALL. On the other hand, serious toxicity, requiring interruption of treatment, was significantly more frequent in the intensively treated children with DS compared with similarly treated patients with NDS-ALL, although deaths resulting from toxicity occurred infrequently.","['Ragab, A H', 'Abdel-Mageed, A', 'Shuster, J J', 'Frankel, L S', 'Pullen, J', 'van Eys, J', 'Sullivan, M P', 'Boyett, J', 'Borowitz, M', 'Crist, W M']","['Ragab AH', 'Abdel-Mageed A', 'Shuster JJ', 'Frankel LS', 'Pullen J', 'van Eys J', 'Sullivan MP', 'Boyett J', 'Borowitz M', 'Crist WM']","['Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child, Preschool', 'Down Syndrome/*complications', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction']",,1991/02/15 00:00,1991/02/15 00:01,['1991/02/15 00:00'],"['1991/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1991 Feb 15;67(4):1057-63. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19910215)67:4<1057::aid-cncr2820670432>3.0.co;2-k.,['0 (Hemoglobins)'],,['10.1002/1097-0142(19910215)67:4<1057::aid-cncr2820670432>3.0.co;2-k [doi]'],,"['CA-15525/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,

In this study we assayed PKC activity in MOLT-3 human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells and found an approximately 50% decrease in activity in MDR sublines made resistant to the lipophilic antifolate trimetrexate, when compared with trimetrexate-sensitive parent cells. The PKC activity of a methotrexate-resistant subline without MDR (MOLT-3/MTX10,000) was identical to that of parent cells. Although a downward trend was noted in PKC activity in the membrane fraction of cells with increasing trimetrexate resistance, there was no absolute correlation between the degree of MDR and the relative decrease in PKC activity. Using the same method, we also confirmed an over 6-fold increase in PKC activity in the MDR human breast cancer subline MCF-7/DOXR when compared with the sensitive parent cell line, MCF-7/WT. Because of this divergent relationship between relative PKC activity and MDR, we tested the effect of PKC inhibition and activation on drug resistance. The PKC inhibitor staurosporine, at both subtoxic and toxic concentrations as well as at concentrations shown to be inhibitory to PKC, failed to increase drug resistance of parent and resistant MOLT-3 cells and decrease drug resistance of MCF-7/WT and MCF-7/DOXR cells. Short-term exposure to 3-phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, which activated PKC 7.0-fold and 4.7-fold, respectively, in the membrane of MOLT-3 and resistant cells, resulted in small (1.3- to 1.8-fold), approximately equivalent, increases (rather than decreases) in resistance to doxorubicin, whereas for vincristine no consistent trend was observed. Identical results were also obtained with phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate. These results indicate that PKC activity can be decreased and increased in MDR cells. Both staurosporine inhibition and phorbol ester activation failed to produce changes in drug resistance that would be considered consistent with the resulting degree of PKC activity. Short-term phorbol ester exposure can change the sensitivity of the cells to doxorubicin without changing the relative drug resistance. PKC activity in these cells may then be unrelated to MDR.","['Schwartz, G K', 'Arkin, H', 'Holland, J F', 'Ohnuma, T']","['Schwartz GK', 'Arkin H', 'Holland JF', 'Ohnuma T']","['Department of Neoplastic Diseases, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York 10029.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,,"['Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/enzymology/pathology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology', 'Staurosporine', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Trimetrexate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/enzymology']",,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Jan 1;51(1):55-61.,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Quinazolines)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'UPN4ITI8T4 (Trimetrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Surface marker analysis revealed that the majority of the cells reacted with monoclonal antibodies against platelet glycoprotein Ib (CD42b), glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (CD41a), MY 7 (CD13), MY 9 (CD33), and glycophorin A antigens. Cytogenetic analysis showed a human male near-tetraploid karyotype with a modal chromosome number of 92-96. Flow cytometry-derived DNA histograms demonstrated that the majority of the cells spontaneously contained 4 N DNA ploidy levels. Ultrastructural study showed that platelet peroxidase activity was weakly positive but myeloperoxidase activity was negative. Ferritin and theta-granule, which have been used as ultrastructural markers for the erythroid lineage, could not be detected. In response to phorbol myristate acetate, platelet factor 4 and beta-thromboglobulin, which were specifically synthesized in the process of megakaryocyte maturation, dramatically increased in UT-7 cells. This was accompanied by an increase in cell size, ploidy level, platelet peroxidase activity, and the surface density of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antigen. These findings suggest that UT-7 is a new leukemic cell line with megakaryocytic features and with the potential to differentiate into cells with more mature megakaryocytic properties in response to phorbol myristate acetate. This cell line showed strict dependency on interleukin 3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, or erythropoietin. The maximal effective doses of IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and erythropoietin for proliferation in liquid culture were 10 units/ml, 1 ng/ml, and 1 unit/ml, respectively. These concentrations were comparable to the doses that maximally stimulate the clonal growth of normal hemopoietic cells. IL-6 could stimulate the proliferation of UT-7 cells but not maintain the line in long-term culture. UT-7 cells may be a useful model for (a) the analysis of gene regulation of megakaryocytic maturation-associated proteins expressed in the process of megakaryocytic differentiation and (b) the study of signal transduction of hemopoietic factors associated with megakaryocytopoiesis.","['Komatsu, N', 'Nakauchi, H', 'Miwa, A', 'Ishihara, T', 'Eguchi, M', 'Moroi, M', 'Okada, M', 'Sato, Y', 'Wada, H', 'Yawata, Y']","['Komatsu N', 'Nakauchi H', 'Miwa A', 'Ishihara T', 'Eguchi M', 'Moroi M', 'Okada M', 'Sato Y', 'Wada H', 'Yawata Y', 'et al.']","['Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi-ken, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Factor 4/biosynthesis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-Thromboglobulin/biosynthesis']",,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Jan 1;51(1):341-8.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (beta-Thromboglobulin)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '37270-94-3 (Platelet Factor 4)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the receptor has been identified by cross-linking studies as an 84,000-dalton protein, very little is known about its biochemistry. In this report, we describe a soluble binding assay for the human GM-R which allowed us to characterize the receptor complex from various sources, including plasma membranes of placenta, neutrophils, and human myeloid leukemia cell lines. Preparation of membranes as well as solubilization by Triton X-100 and N-octylglucoside resulted in a 5-10-fold lower affinity of the receptor for GM-CSF. The Kd decreased from 20 to 80 pM in intact cells to 200-500 pM in both intact and solubilized membranes. Binding in solution was rapid, specific for GM-CSF, and best fit a ""one-site"" model with an approximate Kd of 500 pM. The dissociation rate constant for the soluble GM-R was very similar to that of intact cells (k2 = 0.013 min-1 versus 0.017 min-1, respectively). As expected, solubilized membranes obtained from those cells expressing the highest number of GM-R (neutrophils and dimethyl sulfoxide-induced HL-60 cells; approximately 500-800 sites/cell) possessed the highest concentration of soluble GM-R (approximately 2-3 x 10(8) GM-R/micrograms). Cross-linking of 125I-GM-CSF to soluble GM-R resulted in the appearance of two specifically labeled complexes. A major 110-kDa receptor-ligand complex is found when cross-linking is performed with intact cells; both 110- and 200-kDa species are seen when cross-linking is performed with either intact membranes or soluble GM-R. These studies define methods by which intact GM-R can be solubilized and measured in solution, permitting a more complete biochemical characterization of the intact GM-R complex.","['DiPersio, J F', 'Hedvat, C', 'Ford, C F', 'Golde, D W', 'Gasson, J C']","['DiPersio JF', 'Hedvat C', 'Ford CF', 'Golde DW', 'Gasson JC']","['Department of Medicine, UCLA School of Medicine 90024-1678.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Detergents', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism', 'Placenta/metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Solubility']",,1991/01/05 00:00,1991/01/05 00:01,['1991/01/05 00:00'],"['1991/01/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/05 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1991 Jan 5;266(1):279-86.,"['0 (Detergents)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,['S0021-9258(18)52432-7 [pii]'],,"['CA 30388/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 32737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 40163/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, a preferential usage of specific genetic elements has been shown in different ALL subtypes: V delta 1 DJ delta 1 rearrangements predominate in T-ALL, while most B-precursor ALLs show a recombination of V delta 2 to D delta 3. Recently we have proposed a strategy for the detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) based on the isolation of clonospecific probes following the in vitro amplification of V delta 1 DJ delta 1 junctions by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and now have adapted this method to the preparation of specific V delta 2 D delta 3 fragments. In the present study, clonospecific probes were generated from 11 T-ALL and 16 cALL patients (21 children, 6 adults). The sensitivity of these 27 probes in detecting residual leukemia cells varied between 10(-4) to 10(-6) as determined by semiquantitative evaluation of dilution experiments. PCR analysis of 55 bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) samples obtained from the 27 patients during complete clinical remission showed the following results: (1) Evidence for MRD was obtained in the BM of all patients (eight of eight) investigated 2 to 6 months after remission induction and also in 6 of 11 cases on maintenance therapy 7 to 19 months after diagnosis. (2) In contrast, all patients but one (10 of 11) analyzed 6 to 41 months after the termination of treatment lacked apparent evidence for leukemia DNA; the exception was a girl exhibiting 10(-4) to 10(-5) residual cells in her PB 5.5 years after diagnosis. (3) Longitudinal analysis in nine patients disclosed marked individual differences in the intervals between achievement of clinical remission and complete eradication of the leukemia cell clone. (4) Differences in the duration of MRD were not associated with distinct clinical-hematologic features.

In this study, we report data showing that immature human erythroblasts express the integrins VLA-4 and VLA-5 and that both these molecules act as fibronectin receptors on these cells. We have recently demonstrated that adhesion to Fn of purified human CFU-E and their immediate progeny preproerythroblasts was inhibited by antibodies directed against the human fibronectin receptor (VLA-5). Here we have extended those results and characterized by immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies the integrins expressed on surface-labeled normal human immature erythroblasts. A polyclonal antibody recognizing the common VLA beta 1 subunit yielded two polypeptides of 120 and 160 kD. Our data further demonstrate that the polypeptide of 160 kD contains alpha subunits corresponding to both alpha 4 and alpha 5. Thus, erythroblast lysates prepared in 0.3% CHAPS and immunoprecipitated with antibodies which specifically recognize the alpha 4 subunit showed a heterodimer with peptides of 120 (beta 1) and 160 kD (alpha 4) and the additional peptides of 70 and 80 kD which usually coprecipitate with the alpha 4 chain. On the other hand, specific anti-alpha 5 antibodies immunoprecipitated an alpha 5/beta 1 complex with peptides of 120 and 160 kD which under reducing conditions migrated as a single band of 130 kD. Similar experiments performed with an erythroleukemic cell line (KU 812) showed that these cells also coexpress both the VLA-4 and VLA-5 members of the integrin family. Furthermore, monoclonal antibodies recognizing the VLA alpha 4 chain blocked the adhesion of immature erythroblasts to Fn-coated surfaces, thus demonstrating that, as VLA-5, VLA-4 is also a functional Fn receptor on these cells.","['Rosemblatt, M', 'Vuillet-Gaugler, M H', 'Leroy, C', 'Coulombel, L']","['Rosemblatt M', 'Vuillet-Gaugler MH', 'Leroy C', 'Coulombel L']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Hopital de Bicetre, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Erythroblasts/*chemistry', 'Fibronectins/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Receptors, Antigen/*analysis', 'Receptors, Fibronectin', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*analysis/immunology/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1991 Jan;87(1):6-11. doi: 10.1172/JCI115002.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Fibronectin)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)']",,['10.1172/JCI115002 [doi]'],PMC294977,,,,,,,,,,,

Initial treatment and relapse therapy were similar in all patients according to the BFM- and CoALL-protocols (front line: 38 patients according to BFM-protocols and 13 patients according to CoALL-protocols; relapse: 12 patients in study ALL-REZ-BFM 83, 17 in ALL-REZ-BFM 85, 20 in ALL-REZ-BFM 87, and two in ALL-REZ-BFM 90). The conditioning regimens were different, consisting of cyclophosphamide (CY) total body irradiation (TBI) plus (n = 27), VP-16-TBI (n = 23), and CY-TBI and ARA-C (n = 1). Three patients had a second graft after conditioning with CY-TBI for the first transplantation. The second ablative regimen consisted of CY plus VP-16 in the first patient and CY plus busulfan in the two other patients, one of whom relapsed again. All patients but three had bone marrow (BM), either isolated or combined, relapses. Twenty-nine of the patients are in continuous complete remission (CCR), ranging from 1 to 67 months after transplantation with a median time of 30 months. One patient was lost to follow-up in continuous remission. Nine patients died from treatment-related complications (infections and graft-versus-host disease) and 12 patients suffered a leukemic relapse; three of them received a second graft and two are in CCR. Kaplan-Meier analysis yields an event-free survival (EFS) of 0.52 +/- 0.08. The probability of a 7-year relapse-free interval (RFI) is 0.68 +/- 0.08. EFS for patients with late relapses is 0.47 +/- 0.12 and for patients with early relapses 0.56 +/- 0.1. The RFI for patients with late relapses is 0.65 +/- 0.12 and for patients with early relapses 0.69 +/- 0.11. There is a nonsignificant trend towards superior results for patients grafted after conditioning with VP-16 plus TBI. When all patients who are not in CCR at day +125 (which is the median interval between relapse diagnosis and BM transplantation [BMT]) are excluded from the chemotherapy results, there is no significant difference between the results of BMT and chemotherapy for late relapses.

Previous studies have shown that this sensitive technique can often detect small numbers of leukemia cells in patients who are otherwise in complete remission. Nevertheless, the clinical significance of PCR positivity remains unclear because the majority of patients with PCR-detectable bcr-abl mRNA can remain disease-free for prolonged periods after allogeneic BMT. In the present studies, we applied PCR to detect bcr-abl-positive cells in 100 serial blood or BM samples from 24 patients with CML who underwent CD6 T-cell-depleted allogeneic BMT. After BMT, bcr-abl mRNA could be detected in 20 patients (83.3%) during complete cytogenetic or clinical remission. Patients in whom PCR positivity was sustained over time had a higher probability of CML relapse than patients in whom PCR was intermittently negative (P = .0095, log rank test). PCR detection of bcr-abl transcript between 2 and 10 weeks post-BMT also was associated with a high probability of subsequent relapse (P = .023, log rank test). In eight selected patients, we used a titration assay of the PCR-amplified product to estimate the number of residual tumor cells in each clinical sample post-BMT. PCR results in four patients showed a continuing increase in the number of tumor cells from early posttransplant until either cytogenetic or clinical relapse could be detected by conventional methods 1 to 2 years later. In contrast, PCR detected either no leukemia cells or relatively low and stable numbers of residual tumor cells throughout the follow-up period in four patients who remained in clinical remission. These results show that detection of the bcr-abl transcript by PCR after allogeneic BMT in patients with CML has important prognostic value. Estimation of the number of tumor cells in serial analyses can also be used to detect proliferation of the residual leukemic population. Sensitive detection of minimal residual disease can be used to assess the effectiveness of the transplant preparative regimen and to direct and evaluate further therapy post-BMT, before the development of overt relapse.","['Delage, R', 'Soiffer, R J', 'Dear, K', 'Ritz, J']","['Delage R', 'Soiffer RJ', 'Dear K', 'Ritz J']","['Division of Tumor Immunology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,1991/11/15 00:00,1991/11/15 00:01,['1991/11/15 00:00'],"['1991/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1991 Nov 15;78(10):2759-67.,"['0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']","['abl', 'bcr']",['S0006-4971(20)76728-5 [pii]'],,"['AI29530/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-AI62531/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

The most widely studied translocations, involving members of the Ig supergene family, have shown juxtapositions of proto-oncogenes with the rearranging loci. Such translocations can inappropriately activate expression of the proto-oncogenes and thereby play a role in tumorigenesis. Because the cytogenetic analysis of a bone marrow sample from a child with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia showed a (1;7)(p32;q35) translocation, we sought to determine if the translocation breakpoint was in the T-cell receptor (TCR)-beta gene locus on chromosome 7. Analysis of the TCR-beta gene by Southern blotting showed three rearranged bands. Nucleotide sequencing and Southern blot analysis of TCR-beta genomic clones, isolated from patient DNA, showed that one contained a normal rearrangement of the TCR-beta gene using V beta 12.2, D beta 2.1, and J beta 2.5, whereas two other clones contained DNA from derivative chromosomes 1 and 7. Chromosomal mapping showed that the (1;7) translocation breakpoint was 35 kb 3' to the c-tal gene locus.

We compared in vitro the effects of a combined treatment with GM-CSF (10 ng/mL) plus IL-3 (10 ng/mL) on the metabolism and cytotoxicity of Ara-C in normal bone marrow mononuclear cells (NBMMC) and AML blasts. NBMMC from six healthy volunteers and AML blasts from 10 patients were incubated for 20 hours with or without IL-3 plus GM-CSF, followed by a concurrent treatment with Ara-C for 4 additional hours. Exposure to the HGFs and Ara-C produced significantly higher intracellular Ara-CTP levels as well as higher Ara-CTP/dCTP pool ratios in AML blasts as compared with NBMMC. Treatment with HGFs resulted in [3H] Ara-C DNA incorporation that was significantly higher in AML blasts versus NBMMC. This selective improvement of Ara-C metabolism in AML blasts was associated with an enhanced Ara-C-mediated leukemia colony-forming unit (CFU) growth inhibition. In contrast, exposure to HGFs resulted in an improved colony growth of normal CFU granulocyte-monocyte and CFU-granulocyte, erythroid, monocyte, megakaryocyte. These in vitro studies indicate that a combined treatment with IL-3 plus GM-CSF may improve the selectivity of Ara-C against AML blasts.","['Bhalla, K', 'Holladay, C', 'Arlin, Z', 'Grant, S', 'Ibrado, A M', 'Jasiok, M']","['Bhalla K', 'Holladay C', 'Arlin Z', 'Grant S', 'Ibrado AM', 'Jasiok M']","['Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston 29425.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Blast Crisis/blood/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytarabine/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*pathology', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Reference Values', 'Stem Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1991/11/15 00:00,1991/11/15 00:01,['1991/11/15 00:00'],"['1991/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1991 Nov 15;78(10):2674-9.,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,['S0006-4971(20)76715-7 [pii]'],,['CA-45671/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

Cell growth was quantified by direct cell counts. Cell differentiation was estimated by measuring the expression of myeloid-specific cell-surface antigens (Mo-1 and fMet-Leu-Phe [fMLP] receptors), the ability of the cells to produce superoxide anions on stimulation with fMLP, the calcium ionophore A23187 and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and by monitoring the level of expression of messenger RNA (mRNA) for tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha). By itself, PT did not affect the proliferation of HL-60 cells in serum-containing medium. In contrast, PT (but not its B-oligomer) dose-dependently inhibited the Me2SO4-induced expression of Mo-1, fMLP receptors, and the oxidative responses to the chemotactic factor and to A23187, but not to PMA. The addition of Me2SO4 induced a significant increase in the steady-state levels of TNF alpha mRNA, and this effect was strongly inhibited by PT. Finally, the bacterial toxin did not reverse the block of cell division that follows the addition of Me2SO4. These results provide evidence for the involvement of a PT substrate (presumably a guanine nucleotide-binding protein) in the regulation of the maturation of the excitation-response coupling sequence in human myeloid cell precursors and show that the regulation of cell division and maturation of HL-60 cells are under distinct sets of control mechanisms.","['Naccache, P H', 'Caon, A C', 'Gilbert, C', 'Chouinard, G', 'McColl, S R']","['Naccache PH', 'Caon AC', 'Gilbert C', 'Chouinard G', 'McColl SR']","['Department of Medicine, Universite Laval, Ste Foy, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/metabolism', '*Pertussis Toxin', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/*pharmacology']",,1991/11/15 00:00,1991/11/15 00:01,['1991/11/15 00:00'],"['1991/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1991 Nov 15;78(10):2534-41.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,['S0006-4971(20)76697-8 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

By using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) with restriction endonuclease digests of DNA from both a leukemia cell line (RS4;11) bearing the t(4;11)(q21;q23) and from human/hamster hybrid cells, we have been able to construct a detailed restriction map of the chromosome 11q23 region and have localized the t(4;11) chromosome 11 breakpoint to a region located approximately 200 to 230 kb telomeric to the CD3 gamma region and approximately 580 kb centromeric to the PBGD gene. PFGE analyses of DNA from clinical leukemia specimens and cell lines indicated a tight clustering of breakpoints in all eight t(4;11) acute leukemias studied.

In the present report we examined three agents in the Rauscher retrovirus model: imexon, Ampligen and poly[I,C]-LC. Imexon reduced splenomegaly, viremia, and serum reverse transcriptase levels even when treatment was not initiated until 7 days after virus infection. Imexon also significantly prolonged the survival of infected mice. Thus it proved to be an effective antiviral agent in this system, although imexon did not completely eliminate retroviral infection in treated mice. Poly[I,C]-LC and Ampligen had immunomodulatory effects. Both of these BRM augmented the cytolytic activity of splenic natural killer (NK) cells in infected animals when treatment was initiated 24 h after infection. Poly[I,C]-LC had antiretroviral activity when administered on this schedule. In order to examine the role of NK cell augmentation in the antiviral activity of poly[I,C]-LC, we attempted to deplete NK activity by treatment with rabbit antibody to asialo GM1, a ganglioside on the surface of murine NK cells. Combined treatment of infected mice with poly[I,C]-LC and anti-asialo GM1 decreased the antiviral activity of poly[I,C]-LC.

Attention focuses primarily on the risk of death from cancer among individuals in the Life Span Study sample of the Radiation Effect Research Foundation in the period 1950-1985 based on the recently revised dosimetry, termed the DS86 doses. Mortality from malignant tumors is increased among A-bomb survivors as a late effect of A-bomb radiation. Besides the well-known increase of leukemia, there also has been demonstrated increase of cancer of the lung, breast, esophagus, stomach, colon, ovary, urinary bladder, thyroid, and of multiple myeloma, but no increase has yet been observed in mortality from cancer of the rectum, gallbladder, pancreas, prostate and uterus, and of malignant lymphoma. The pattern of appearance over time of radiation-induced cancer other than leukemia differs from that of leukemia. In general, radiation-induced solid cancer begins to appear after attaining the age at which the cancer is normally prone to develop (so-called cancer age), and continues to increase proportionately with the increase in mortality of the control group as it ages. Sensitivity to radiation, in terms of cancer induction, is higher for persons who were young at the time of the bomb (ATB) in general than for those who were older ATB. Furthermore, susceptibility to radiation-induced cancer tends to be higher in pre- than in post-natally exposed survivors (at least those exposed as adults). Other radiation effect modifiers and the shape of the dose response curve will also be discussed.","['Shimizu, Y', 'Kato, H', 'Schull, W J']","['Shimizu Y', 'Kato H', 'Schull WJ']","['Radiation Effects Research Foundation, Hiroshima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,J Radiat Res,Journal of radiation research,0376611,IM,,"['Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Risk']",8,1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Radiat Res. 1991 Dec;32 Suppl 2:54-63. doi: 10.1269/jrr.32.supplement2_54.,,,['10.1269/jrr.32.supplement2_54 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The frequencies of chromosome aberration in circulating lymphocytes were examined for persons residing in the HBRA and CA. Those in the HBRA had increased frequencies of detectable abnormalities in stable aberrations (translocations and inversions) and unstable aberrations (dicentrics and rings). Previous reports have shown that when samples of circulating lymphocytes taken from inhabitants were tested in vitro for mitotic responses to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and for the degree of unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) induced by UV-irradiation, there were higher responsiveness and UDS rates for those in the HBRA than in the CA. In contrast, mortality from all cancers and those from leukemia, breast and lung cancers that are inducible by radiation was not higher in the HBRA. Although the differences in the cancer mortality rates for the HBRA and CA are not significant, the findings are compatible with the assumption that the lower mortality from cancer in the HBRA is the result of the hormetic effects of the three-fold higher dose rate of background radiation in that areas.

Furthermore, the chromosomal aberrations in the survivors were observed to be of a more complex nature and had the characteristic findings of secondary leukemia. These observations therefore suggest that patients with a history of heavy exposure to atomic bomb radiation had leukemic cells originating from a stem cell which had been damaged by irradiation at the time of the bombing as well as cells involved in complex chromosome abnormalities. Molecular biologic studies on ras genes in acute and chronic leukemias and the bcr gene in chronic myelocytic leukemia were performed in exposed and non-exposed groups.

Due to the nature of target cell suppression, the induction of crisis, and the outgrowth of progenitors with altered phenotypes, this preleukemic event resembles the ""immortalization"" step of the in vitro transformation sequence following induction with either physical and chemical carcinogens. The radiological, temporal, and biological dictages governing this event have been extensively evaluated and will be discussed in light of their role in the induction and progression of chronic radiation leukemia.","['Seed, T M']",['Seed TM'],"['Biological and Medical Research Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Illinois 60439.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,J Radiat Res,Journal of radiation research,0376611,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*pathology', 'Dogs', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology/*radiation effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/blood/*pathology']",35,1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Radiat Res. 1991 Dec;32 Suppl 2:118-31. doi: 10.1269/jrr.32.supplement2_118.,,,['10.1269/jrr.32.supplement2_118 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

For some specific end-points the following conclusions can be formulated: i) the dose-response curves for myeloid leukemia and malignant lymphoma can be interpreted in terms of induction and inactivation; in particular, the data confirmed that a linear dependence of the induction on dose is adequate to describe the response to fission neutrons, while a pure quadratic dependence is consistent with the experimental data for low-LET radiation; ii) in the liver, a marked age-dependence was demonstrated for radiation-induced tumors with a much higher susceptibility in young than in old mice; also for these tumors the dose-effect curves can be described by a linear and a quadratic relationships for high- and low-LET radiation, respectively; iii) data on ovarian tumor induction suggested threshold-like dose responses: these peculiar shapes as well as the absence of a clear radiation quality dependence of the curves are difficult findings to explain using a simple model of radiation action, and they might better be related to a non-stochastic effect of hormonal imbalance following irradiation.","['Covelli, V', 'Coppola, M', 'Di Majo, V', 'Rebessi, S']","['Covelli V', 'Coppola M', 'Di Majo V', 'Rebessi S']","['ENEA, C.R.E.

The existence of these threshold effects can be explained by the following hypothesis. A high dose of radiation causes a persistent wound in a cell-renewable tissue. Disorder of the injured cell society partly frees the component cells from territorial restraints on their proliferation, enabling them to continue development of their cellular functions toward advanced autonomy. This progression might be achieved by continued epigenetic and genetic changes as a result of occasional errors in the otherwise concerted healing action of various endogenous factors recruited for tissue repair. Carcinogenesis is not simply a single-cell problem but a cell-society problem. Therefore, it is not warranted to estimate risk at low doses by linear extrapolation from cancer data at high doses without knowledge of the mechanism of radiation carcinogenesis.","['Kondo, S']",['Kondo S'],"['Atomic Energy Research Institute, Kinki University, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,J Radiat Res,Journal of radiation research,0376611,IM,,"['Animals', 'Contrast Media/adverse effects', 'DNA Repair/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology/*genetics', 'Nuclear Warfare', 'Thorium Dioxide/adverse effects']",57,1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Radiat Res. 1991 Dec;32 Suppl 2:1-13. doi: 10.1269/jrr.32.supplement2_1.,"['0 (Contrast Media)', '9XA7X17UQC (Thorium Dioxide)']",,['10.1269/jrr.32.supplement2_1 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

This strategy might also be of benefit in the cure of retrovirus-induced diseases. The effectiveness of several drug combinations was evaluated on DBA/2 mice injected with Friend leukaemia virus (FLV). Elliptinium (ELP), a known chemotherapeutic agent with possible antiviral activity, was given in association with norcantharidin (NCTD) (shown previously to increase the cytotoxic potential of human lymphocytes) and/or in association with tetrachlordecaoxide (TCDO), which augments both humoral and cellular immune responses. ELP alone at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg in long-term treatment significantly increased the survival of mice infected by FLV. When ELP, TCDO (2 micrograms/kg) and NCTD (2 mg/kg) were given together, the survival time was prolonged 1.6 times and 2 times as compared to the group treated by ELP alone or to non-treated controls, respectively. Moreover, the combined treatment gave more effective inhibition of hepatomegaly than ELP alone, suggesting that this protocol might have an organ-specific effect and might suppress the leukaemogenesis induced by FLV in some erythropoietic organs. These results indicate that a chemotherapeutic agent (ELP) associated with two immunomodulatory substances (NCTD and TCDO) is more effective than chemotherapy alone in controlling retroviral infection and in the prolongation of survival. These data taken together suggest that the role of the two immunomodulatory agents might be to suppress the retroviral infection synergistically with ELP and enhance immune functions.

The t(15;17) translocation is specifically found in this leukemia. We and others have shown that through this translocation the RAR alpha gene is rearranged and its expression altered in AML3 cells. The gene is truncated and fused to a novel gene (PLM). This results in a fusion protein whose transactivating properties may be implicated in the leukemogenesis of this disease. Retinoic acid cytoplasmic binding proteins (CRABP and CRBP) are not detected by PAGE chromatography in normal or malignant hematopoietic cells. During all-trans RA therapy, a) all-trans RA plasma concentrations are within in vitro differentiating concentration (med. 0.4 microgram/ml); b) increased expression of the normal remaining RAR alpha allele is rapidly observed and may explain the paradoxical induction of RA differentiation in these cells; c) CRABPII is induced in the bone marrow cells of AML3 patients and remains detectable 1 month after withdrawal of RA. AML3 in relapse after RA therapy is always less sensitive to RA in vitro and in vivo. Our data suggest that modification of the metabolisation pathways of RA may be one of parameters linked to this resistance.

Mice received 7 daily i.p. injections of liposome-entrapped Ro13-7410 at doses of 5, 10, 100, 500, or 1000 micrograms/kg bw/day. For comparison, two groups of mice were used as controls, one group received Ro13-7410 in corn oil and a second group received liposome-entrapped Ro13-7410 that had been solubilized with detergent. The liposomes were then tested for chemotherapeutic activity against human myelocytic leukemia (HL-60/MRI) implanted in athymic NCr-nu mice. The doses used in the chemotherapy experiment (20, 50, and 100 micrograms/kg bw/day) were selected based on the results of the toxicity experiment in CD2F1 mice. CD2F1 mice were marginally protected from toxicity after receiving retinoid in liposomes relative to controls. There were 2/5 survivors in the 1000 micrograms/kg bw/day Ro13-7410-liposome group after 7 daily i.p. doses compared to 0/5 for both the corn oil and solubilized liposome groups, and 4/5 survivors in the 500 micrograms/kg bw/day Ro13-7410-liposome group after 7 daily i.p. doses compared to 2/5 for both the corn oil and solubilized liposome groups. We observed no dramatic differences in toxicity among the treatment groups over the range of doses administered.

The most efficient of these systems consists of plasmid pTWE1, a derivative of pT7-7, and an ansB- strain of E. coli, CU1783. These cells produce and secrete amounts of asparaginase II that account for 10-15% of the total cellular protein. Most of the active recombinant enzyme can be released from the periplasmic space by a simple osmotic shock procedure. From the resulting material homogeneous asparaginase II was obtained by a two-step procedure. Overall yields of purified asparaginase were 10-15 mg asparaginase II per liter of E. coli culture.

The phosphorothioate analogs exhibited marked biologic efficacy in culture, as assessed by inhibition of surface TfR content and HL-60 cell growth, whereas their unmodified phosphodiester counterparts were ineffective. Phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides were more resistant to hydrolysis by serum and cellular nucleases and were more readily taken up by cells than phosphodiesters, thus providing a partial explanation for the differences in biologic activity. A length effect was observed, with antisense 30-mers exhibiting greater TfR inhibitory activity than 17-mers. The degree of receptor inhibition observed, however, was not sequence dependent, suggesting that the phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides may have pleiotropic activities in eukaryotic cells in addition to inhibiting gene expression by classic antisense complementary binding to mRNA.","['Ho, P T', 'Ishiguro, K', 'Wickstrom, E', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Ho PT', 'Ishiguro K', 'Wickstrom E', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Antisense Res Dev,Antisense research and development,9110698,IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Stability', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/chemical synthesis/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Organothiophosphates/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Transferrin/drug effects/*genetics/metabolism']",,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Antisense Res Dev. 1991 Winter;1(4):329-42. doi: 10.1089/ard.1991.1.329.,"['0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Organothiophosphates)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)']",,['10.1089/ard.1991.1.329 [doi]'],,['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

According to the univariant analysis, the risk for the development of the resistance depends on five pretherapeutical factors: febrility, absolute and relative neutrophilic granulocyte count in the blood, presence of monocytes and erythroblasts in the blood and all 4 factors which reconstruct the effect of the first induction cure to the bone marrow: cellularity, relative and absolute blast count and parameter S. By the multivariant analysis we distinguished 2 significant factors: parameter S used for the assessment of the selectivity level of the effects in the first induction cure to the bone marrow and the monocyte count in the blood.

Studies examining residential exposures of children and adults and studies of electrical and electronics workers are reviewed. Using conventional epidemiologic criteria for inferring causal associations, including strength and consistency of the relationship, biological plausibility, and the possibility of bias as an explanation, it is concluded that the evidence is strongly suggestive that such radiation is carcinogenic. The evidence is strongest for brain and central nervous system cancers in electrical workers and children. Weaker evidence supports an association with leukemia in electrical workers. Some evidence also exists for an association with melanoma in electrical workers. Failure to find consistent evidence of a link between residential exposures and adult cancers may be attributable to exposure misclassification. Studies so far have used imperfect surrogates for any true biologically effective magnetic field exposure.

Following the observation of a recurrent, mild delay in the prothrombin time in ALL children during maintenance chemotherapy, we explored the main parameters of the clotting function. METHODS: 17 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia were studied during maintenance chemotherapy for clotting function screening evaluation; 15 healthy children, matched for age and sex, were used as controls. RESULTS: A uniform pattern of slight prolongation of the prothrombin time with significantly reduced levels of factors VII, IX, and a trend toward reduced activity of factor X was observed in the absence of any demonstrable anticoagulant factor. CONCLUSIONS: Antileukemic maintenance chemotherapy is associated with a subclinical modification of the clotting parameters that is not responsible for hemorrhagic diathesis.

TGF beta is also an inhibitor of the proliferation and functional activities of normal T and B lymphocytes. The aim of this study was to evaluate its effect on the growth of a human leukemic cells of lymphoid and myeloid origin. METHODS: We tested its activity on the doubling time, the DNA synthesis rate and the clonal growth of a panel of lymphoid and myeloid leukemic cell lines. RESULTS: Among the myeloid cell lines, the proliferation in liquid cultures as well as the clonal growth of KG1, HL60 and U937 were suppressed by TGF beta 1 at doses ranging from 0.025 to 2.5 ng/ml; the degree of inhibition was, however, variable. BV 137, a Ph1-positive cell line derived from a very undifferentiated stem cell, was also highly responsive to TGF beta 1 inhibition. Among the six lymphoid neoplastic cell lines, only Nalm 6, a pre-B leukemic cell line, was consistently and reproducibly inhibited by the same doses of TGF beta 1. Conversely, two Burkitt lymphoma cell lines, Raji and Daudi, and three T-cell leukemias (Molt 4, Jurkat and PF 382) were insensitive to TGF beta inhibition.","['Piacibello, W', 'Severino, A', 'Stacchini, A', 'Aglietta, M']","['Piacibello W', 'Severino A', 'Stacchini A', 'Aglietta M']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche ed Oncologia Umana, Universita di Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 1991 Nov-Dec;76(6):460-6.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A growing body of evidence suggests that these enzymes also play a role in tumorigenesis. The ACHE and BCHE genes are amplified, mutated, and/or aberrantly expressed in a variety of human tumor types. These changes could be the result of chromosome breakage, since there is an unusually high frequency of chromosomal abnormalities near the map positions of these genes (3q26-ter and 11p-ter, respectively) in such tumors, particularly hemopoietic malignancies. Both ACHE and BCHE contain the consensus peptide motif S/T-P-X-Z, which is found in many substrates of cdc2-related protein kinases. Here we consider the intriguing possibility that phosphorylation by cdc2-related kinases may be the molecular mechanism linking cholinesterases with tumor cell proliferation. We also discuss the notion that inhibition of these enzymes by commonly used organophosphorous poisons may be tumorigenic in humans.","['Soreq, H', 'Lapidot-Lifson, Y', 'Zakut, H']","['Soreq H', 'Lapidot-Lifson Y', 'Zakut H']","['Department of Biological Chemistry, Life Sciences Institute, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Cancer Cells,"Cancer cells (Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. : 1989)",9000382,IM,,"['Acetylcholinesterase/genetics/*physiology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Brain Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Butyrylcholinesterase/genetics/*physiology', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/physiology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced/*enzymology/genetics', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced', 'Organophosphorus Compounds/adverse effects', 'Peptides/chemistry', 'Signal Transduction', 'Substrate Specificity']",48,1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Cells. 1991 Dec;3(12):511-6.,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '0 (Peptides)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'EC 3.1.1.7 (Acetylcholinesterase)', 'EC 3.1.1.8 (Butyrylcholinesterase)']","['ACHE', 'BCHE', 'FIM3', 'HRAS', 'MYC', 'RAF1']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to the intact receptor found at the cell surface, activated T cells produce a truncated form of the receptor (sIL-2R) that is secreted as a soluble molecule. Patients with neoplastic disease or diseases involving immune activation exhibit markedly elevated serum levels of sIL-2R. Although the functional significance of sIL-2R is unknown, the ability to measure this parameter rapidly and accurately in serum samples makes it a potentially useful index for monitoring disease activity. Recent studies indicate that a rise in serum levels of sIL-2R in apparently healthy individuals could be an important early signal of neoplastic, autoimmune, or inflammatory disease. Moreover, subsequent to diagnosis, serum levels of sIL-2R appear to be a reliable indicator of tumor burden and therapeutic response for many patients with leukemia and lymphoma, an indicator of metastasis for patients with solid tumors, and an indicator of exacerbation and clinical response in patients with diseases associated with immune activation.","['Zerler, B']",['Zerler B'],"['Molecular Therapeutics, Inc., Miles Research Center, West Haven, Connecticut 06516.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer Cells,"Cancer cells (Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. : 1989)",9000382,IM,,"['Adult', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*blood', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'HIV Infections/blood', 'HTLV-I Infections/blood', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Inflammation/*blood', 'Leukemia/blood/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma/blood/immunology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms/*blood/immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism']",86,1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Cells. 1991 Dec;3(12):471-9.,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have shown that LIF stimulates bone resorption and DNA synthesis in bone organ culture and, in vivo, LIF has been shown to have marked effects on bone remodeling. The present study examines further the dose-response, time course and mechanisms of action of LIF in neonatal mouse calvaria. 45Ca release was significantly increased by LIF at concentrations of 10-5,000 U/ml, and its stimulation of bone resorption increased with time from 24 to 96 hours. These concentrations of LIF also increased DNA synthesis at 24 hours. At 72 hours, low concentrations of LIF produced less marked stimulation of [3H]-thymidine incorporation, and 5,000 u/ml actually inhibited DNA synthesis at both this time point and at 96 hours. The effect of LIF on 45Ca release was partially inhibited when DNA synthesis was blocked by hydroxyurea (50 microM). The resorptive effect of supramaximal concentrations of LIF was not additive to that of parathyroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, prostaglandin E2, or transforming growth factor-beta. Although LIF-stimulated resorption is at least partially dependent on DNA synthesis, these results suggest that there are different mechanisms involved in mediating LIF's effects on bone resorption and DNA synthesis. The demonstration of effects of LIF at low concentrations indicates that this cytokine may be involved in the physiological regulation of bone metabolism in vivo.","['Lowe, C', 'Cornish, J', 'Martin, T J', 'Reid, I R']","['Lowe C', 'Cornish J', 'Martin TJ', 'Reid IR']","['Department of Surgery, University of Auckland, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Calcif Tissue Int,Calcified tissue international,7905481,IM,,"['Animals', '*Bone Resorption', 'Bone and Bones/*metabolism', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA/*biosynthesis', 'Dinoprostone/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Hydroxyurea/metabolism/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/pharmacology']",,1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Calcif Tissue Int. 1991 Dec;49(6):394-7. doi: 10.1007/BF02555849.,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,['10.1007/BF02555849 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Some thiosemicarbazones possess a broad spectrum of potentially useful chemotherapeutic properties (antitumor, antibacterial, antiviral, antimalarial). The present study reports the biological effects of pyridoxal thiosemicarbazone, H2L, and relative complexes with copper, [(Cu(HL)(OH2))2]++ and with cobalt, [Co(III)(L)(HL)] on the differentiation of Friend erythroleukemia cells (FLC). They are murine proerythroblasts chronically infected by a producing Friend leukemia virus complex; their exposure to dimethylsulfoxide (Me2SO) or other chemical agents induces these cells to terminal erythroid differentiation, therefore these cells represent a good model of differentiation in vitro. Here we describe induction differentiation experiment of pyridoxal thiosemicarbazone and relative complexes of copper and cobalt on FLC performed with concentrations of 50 ug/ml (ligand), 2 ug/ml (complexes). These have little effects on cell proliferation at doses used in these experiments. Higher doses have evident cytotoxic effects. The treatment with the copper complex induces a moderate differentiation of FLC and enhances effects on erythroid differentiation of Me2SO-induced FLC. On the contrary H2L and [Co(III)(L)(HL)] haven't inducing effects or enhancing effects on Me2SO-induced FLC hemopoietic differentiation.

There was no significant differences between the two arms for the incidence of acute GVHD grades I-IV, acute GVHD grades II-IV, chronic GVHD, interstitial pneumonitis, relapse, survival and disease-free survival. The actuarial incidence of acute GVHD grades II-IV in the CMP group was 10% and in the CM group 15% (ns). The incidence of leukaemic relapse in good risk patients was 42% in the CMP group and 40% in the CM group (ns), although the majority of these relapses were cytogenetic relapses only in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia. The incidence of acute GVHD grades II-IV in both arms of the current trial was significantly lower than in our previous trial comparing cyclosporin and methotrexate as single agents.

Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 60%, median survival of those achieving CR was 21 months. Mortality during induction was 30%; relapses occurred in 61% of those achieving CR. Twelve and 78 months overall-survival was 50 and 18% respectively, whereas 12 and 78 months disease-free-survival was 46 and 16% respectively. Fourteen variables were analyzed in their impact in both CR achievement and long term survival. Four variables were found to be associated with CR achievement: hemoglobin levels, major bleeding and infection at diagnosis, and site of treatment (private practice vs city hospital). All variables were associated with the 78 months survival, but two variables were related to 12 months survival: time of recovery of the bone marrow after ablative chemotherapy and amount of platelets transfused during the chemotherapy-induced hypoplasia. With regard to the first variable, the 12 months survival was 90 and 55% for patients recovering a normal bone marrow, before or after 25 days of initiation of chemotherapy (p less than 0.05).

This was supported by the fact that similar amounts of 5-FU were incorporated into cellular RNA in P388 and P388/5-FU when these cells were incubated with equitoxic concentrations of 5-FU. Furthermore, incorporation of 5-FU and FUrd into cellular RNA in P388/5-FU cells were significantly lower than in P388 cells when cells were exposed to them at the same concentration.

The use of recombinant DNA methods for the diagnosis of leukemias is reported with special reference to the contribution of cytogenetic findings, such as specific chromosome aberrations previously obtained. Therefore, cytogenetic studies on Ph1 chromosome and other specific aberrations found in leukemias are historically reviewed. Using Southern blotting, PFGE, PCR, and in situ chromosome mapping techniques we have analyzed many cases with CML and cases with ALL. We found M-bcr rearrangements not only in standard Ph1, but also in complex types and in Ph1 (-) ve CML. Chromosomal in situ hybridization was very informative identifying transposition of bcr and abl genes between chromosomes 22 and 9. In this connection, FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) technique was developed by us, which is expected to have an exceptional power of analysis. ALL had either M-bcr or m-bcr rearrangements, the latter being identified by PFGE. Next, application of PCR technique that enables to obtain more than 10(5) copies of target sequences could monitor minimal residual diseases in CML. Recently, the relevant gene were cloned respectively in FAB-M2 and APL (FAB-M3), so that detection of minimal residual diseases will be successfully performed in these types of leukemia.

Mice bearing L1210 leukaemia were injected intraperitoneally or intravenously with 25 mg per kg body weight hematoporphyrin derivative (HpD), 12.5 mg per kg body weight photofrin II (PII), 25 or 5 mg per kg body weight disulphonated aluminium phthalocyanine (AlS2Pc). Every 2 h and for up to 22 or 30 h, mice were sacrificed, leukaemic cells extracted from the peritoneum, washed, and resuspended in buffer for fluorescence measurements. HpD and PII emission spectra were almost identical 12 h after intraperitoneal injection with main peaks at 630 nm and no appreciable changes afterwards. In the first 12 h, the PII fluorescence spectrum was constant, while in the case of HpD a shoulder at 615 nm was detectable. Similar fluorescence behaviour was observed after intravenous administration of porphyrin derivatives. These results seem to confirm that the tumour localizing fraction is the part actually retained by the cells. The AlS2Pc spectrum peaked at 685 nm and did not change in any of our experiments. AlS2Pc is incorporated more rapidly with respect to porphyrins, as was clearly observed in the case of intravenous administration, where the AlS2Pc fluorescence was readily detectable after 2 h, whereas the PII emission became apparent only after 4-6 h.","['Cubeddu, R', 'Ramponi, R', 'Taroni, P', 'Canti, G']","['Cubeddu R', 'Ramponi R', 'Taroni P', 'Canti G']","['CEQSE-CNR, Istituto di Fisica del Politecnico, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,J Photochem Photobiol B,"Journal of photochemistry and photobiology.

By May 1991, data from a total of 5377 children treated with growth hormone (GH) were included in the main database. Of these children, 2691 were classified as having idiopathic GH deficiency (GHD), 866 as having GHD of known origin, and 1820 as having other causes of short stature. The majority of patients with idiopathic GHD have no history of perinatal trauma. In the patients with GHD of known origin, 137 were congenital cases and 729 acquired GHD. The largest number of congenital cases (114) belonged to the group of central malformations (e.g. septo-optic dysplasia and empty sella syndrome). Of the cases with acquired GHD, 73% were associated with tumours or leukaemia. Other causes of short stature include 12 groups of diagnoses, with more than 150 cases in four of them (idiopathic short stature, 635; defined syndromes with chromosomal aberrations, 337, of which 304 were Turner's syndrome; defined syndromes without chromosomal aberrations, 157; intrauterine growth retardation without stigmata, 366). Analysis of the KIGS data allows modern GH therapy for GHD to be compared with older treatment modalities. The study offers the advantage of larger numbers of cases than can be achieved in individual trials and allows assessment of the use of GH therapy for GHD of comparatively uncommon causes.","['Wilton, P', 'Wallstrom, A']","['Wilton P', 'Wallstrom A']","['Department of Clinical Research, Kabi Pharmacia Peptide Hormones, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Sweden,Acta Paediatr Scand Suppl,Acta paediatrica Scandinavica.

Several common mechanisms that cause DNA damage result in specific malignant disorders: First, proto-oncogenes can be activated by translocations. For example, translocation of the c-myc proto-oncogene from chromosome 8 to one of the immunoglobulin loci on chromosomes 2, 14, or 22 results in Burkitt's lymphomas. Translocation of the c-abl proto-oncogene from chromosome 9 to the BCR gene located on chromosome 22 produces a hybrid BCR/ABL protein resulting in chronic myelogenous leukemia. Second, proto-oncogenes can be activated by point mutations. For example, point mutations of genes coding for guanosine triphosphate-binding proteins, such as H-, K-, or N-ras or G proteins, can be oncogenic as noted in a large variety of malignant neoplasms. Proteins from these mutated genes are constitutively active rather than being faithful second messengers of periodic extracellular signals. Third, mutations that inactivate a gene can result in tumors if the product of the gene normally constrains cellular proliferation.

Such therapies also carry significant morbidity and mortality. With the increasing application of these therapies, a growing number of physicians are using medical decision making regarding critical care for these patients. The process by which ethical decisions are reached for these critically ill patients may be baffling because of several factors: rapidly evolving treatments, uncertain probabilities of the cure of the malignant disorder, the relatively young age of many of these patients, and the poor prognosis with critical illness. I discuss a process to reach acceptable decisions, providing a case example of the application of the process. This process is derived from the ethical principles that drive decision making in general medicine and attempts to maximize patients' autonomy. It involves a consideration of accurate information regarding the disease process and the prognosis, a clear delineation of the goals of the medical care, and communication with patients. Appropriate, ethical, and consistent decisions regarding the critical care of patients with hematologic malignancy can be reached when these considerations are addressed.","['Crawford, S W']",['Crawford SW'],"['Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,West J Med,The Western journal of medicine,0410504,IM,,"['Adult', 'Beneficence', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Critical Illness', '*Decision Making', 'Disclosure', 'Ethics Committees, Clinical', 'Ethics, Medical', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/surgery', 'Male', '*Patient Selection', 'Personal Autonomy', 'Prognosis', 'Quality of Life', 'Risk Assessment', 'Stress, Psychological', 'Uncertainty', '*Withholding Treatment']",23,1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,West J Med. 1991 Nov;155(5):488-93.,,,,PMC1003059,"['CA-15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,['KIE: 34375'],,,['KIE'],"['Death and Euthanasia', 'Professional Patient Relationship']","['KIE: KIE BoB Subject Heading: allowing to die', 'KIE: KIE BoB Subject Heading: patient care', 'KIE: KIE BoB Subject Heading: selection for treatment', 'KIE: Full author name: Crawford, Stephen W']"

This induction of differentiation is accompanied by adherence and loss of proliferation, as well as expression/repression of differentiation-associated genes. Long term culture of TPA-differentiated U-937 cells in the absence of phorbol ester for 32-36 days resulted in a process of retrodifferentiation. The retrodifferentiated cells detached from the substrate and reinitiated proliferation. Other cellular parameters, such as glycosidase activities, cytokine release, and filament expression, returned to levels similar to that observed in uninduced cells. Treatment of U-937 cells with TPA resulted in a rapid translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) from the cytosol to cell membrane fractions within 2-8 min. Increased levels of membrane-associated PKC activity persisted until 17-29 days. However, longer periods of incubation were associated with a return to the distribution of PKC in control cells. Activation of PKC has been implicated in the regulation of certain immediate early response genes, and in the present studies, TPA rapidly induced c-fos and c-jun gene expression. Levels of c-fos and c-jun transcripts remained elevated during periods of PKC activation and also returned to levels observed in control cells by 30-36 days, when the cells entered retrodifferentiation. Staurosporine, a nonspecific inhibitor of PKC, partially blocked TPA-induced adherence and growth inhibition and concomitantly prevented TPA-induced c-fos and c-jun gene expression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Hass, R', 'Pfannkuche, H J', 'Kharbanda, S', 'Gunji, H', 'Meyer, G', 'Hartmann, A', 'Hidaka, H', 'Resch, K', 'Kufe, D', 'Goppelt-Strube, M']","['Hass R', 'Pfannkuche HJ', 'Kharbanda S', 'Gunji H', 'Meyer G', 'Hartmann A', 'Hidaka H', 'Resch K', 'Kufe D', 'Goppelt-Strube M']","['Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Medical School, Hannover, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,IM,,"['Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*pathology', 'Monocytes/drug effects/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Staurosporine', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology']",,1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1991 Nov;2(11):541-8.,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']","['c-fos', 'c-jun', 'c-myb']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it failed to show any therapeutic effect on the gastric cancer. A radical subtotal gastrectomy was performed with lymphadenectomy.

However, chemotherapy for AML might make the patient vulnerable to surgical stress, although we could not demonstrate any concrete evidence which could prove the impairment of host immunity in this case.

When an acivicin inoculation regime that was sufficient to control the growth of intraperitoneally (i.p.) implanted WEHI 7.1 leukaemic cells was administered to Balb/c mice, the primary immune response was significantly inhibited to an antigen given either during or after the acivicin treatment. These results indicate that lymphocytes replicating in vivo in a specific primary immune response could be as sensitive to acivicin as leukaemic cells.","['Griffiths, M', 'Keast, D']","['Griffiths M', 'Keast D']","['University Department of Microbiology, Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre, Nedlands, Western Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Immunol Cell Biol,Immunology and cell biology,8706300,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Immunoglobulin M/biosynthesis', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Isoxazoles/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Spleen/immunology/pathology']",,1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunol Cell Biol. 1991 Dec;69 ( Pt 6):395-402. doi: 10.1038/icb.1991.56.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Isoxazoles)', 'O0X60K76I6 (acivicin)']",,['10.1038/icb.1991.56 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Since interleukin-4 (IL-4) is also involved in T-lymphocyte function, we have examined whether phytohemagglutinin (PHA)- or anti-CD3 (OKT3)-activated lymphocytes obtained from patients after allogeneic or autologous BMT are capable of proliferating in response to human recombinant IL-4, and compared these results to those obtained using human recombinant IL-2. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from marrow graft recipients were initially cultured for 3 days in the presence of PHA or OKT3. Such mitogen-activated lymphocytes exhibited little or no proliferation (as assessed by incorporation of [3H]-thymidine) following culture for an additional 3 days in the presence of IL-4 or IL-2. Results were similar for lymphocytes obtained from patients early (less than 4 months) after marrow grafting and those obtained from long-term marrow graft recipients with chronic graft-vs-host disease at the time of testing. In contrast, lymphocytes obtained from healthy individuals proliferated in response to IL-4, as well as to IL-2, following initial activation with PHA or OKT3. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that in normals equal numbers of CD4 and CD8 cells proliferated after stimulation with anti-CD3 antibody and IL-2. However, in BMT patients there was a predominant proliferation of CD8 cells using the same stimulator. These results indicate that defects in the IL-4-mediated T-lymphocyte activation/proliferation pathway may also contribute to the immunodeficiency observed following BMT.","['Klingemann, H G', 'Kohn, F R', 'Phillips, G L']","['Klingemann HG', 'Kohn FR', 'Phillips GL']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Eur Cytokine Netw,European cytokine network,9100879,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/prevention & control', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/surgery', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/*drug effects/transplantation', 'Lymphoma/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Multiple Myeloma/surgery', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/surgery', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur Cytokine Netw. 1991 Mar-Apr;2(2):131-6.,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Mitogens)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Except anti-mitochondria antibodies, autoantibodies were found with similar frequencies after allogeneic and autologous transplantation.

These results suggest that factors other than allogeneic reaction could be responsible for autoantibody formation after bone marrow transplantation, in particular, pre-graft conditioning treatment and/or viral and bacterial infection. Nevertheless, the number of patients with 2 or more autoantibodies was significantly higher after allogeneic than after autologous grafting (respectively, 82% and 36.7%; p less than 0.05).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study is comprised of 197 patients with MDS diagnosed in accordance with the FAB criteria and followed-up in our Department between Jan '75 and Dec '89. The following MDS subtypes were found: refractory anaemia (RA), 58 cases; sideroblastic refractory anaemia (SRA), 42 cases; refractory anaemia with excess of blasts (RAEB), 46 cases; RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T), 39 cases; and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML), 12 cases. The following scoring systems were applied: Mufti's 1985, Varela's 1985, Sanz's 1989 and our own of 1991. The statistical analysis was performed according to Kaplan-Meier actuarial system and the log-Rank test of actuarial survival. RESULTS: (1) Three groups (A, B and C) can be defined by the Bournemouth system, with median survivals of 57.6, 17 and 7.6 months, respectively. The majority of cases (118) were included in group B. Group A has not reached 25% of actuarial survival probability, whereas groups B and C did at 32 and 10 months, respectively. With regard to the morphologic subtypes, RA and SRA were included in groups A and B, and RAEB, RAEB-T and CMML pertained mostly of group C. Sixty cases (90.9%) evolving into acute leukaemia (AL) corresponded to those last groups. (2) The three groups defined by Varela's system (0-1, 2-5 and 6 or more) have median survival of 85.6, 24 and 14 months, respectively. Like in the former system, group 0-1 has not reached 25% actuarial probability, this appearing at 70 and 20 months, respectively, in groups 2-5 and greater than 6. The distribution of the cytological varieties, RA and SRA amongst the groups is heterogeneous although there are more common within the cases included in groups 0-1. All the cases evolving into AL were included in the groups 2-5 and greater than 6. (3) The 3 groups of the system proposed by Sanz (0-1, 2-3 and 4-5) had median survival of, respectively, 58, 15 and 14 months. Like in the preceding cases, group 0-1 has not reached the 25% actuarial probability, while this figure appears at 28 months for group 2-3 and at 20 months for group 4-5. RA and SRA varieties are included chiefly in group 0-1, while RAEB and RAEB-T appear mostly in groups 2-3 and 4-5. The distribution of the cases and evolving into AL in heterogeneous according to this system, although they predominate in groups 2-3 and 4-5. (4) The prognostic groups are defined by the system proposed by us (namely 0-2, 3-5, 5 greater than or equal to 6) with median survivals of 89.3, 17 and greater than 11 months, respectively. Striking difference was seen when studying the cumulated survivals observed, on each of the three percentages considered, between the groups. The different cytological varieties distributed reasonably with higher incidence of RA and SRA in group I and RAEB, RAEB-T and CMML in group III. This system offers statistical significance when comparing RA with SRA, RAEB with RAEB-T and, obviously. RA+SRA with RAEB+RAEB-T+CMML. The evolution into AL showed also statistical significance with respect to the three groups. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Three prognostic groups regarding the patient's survival could be established in our series with all the scoring systems analyzed, except that of Sanz. 2. Low risk (RA and SRA) and high risk (RAEB, RAEB-T and CMML) cytological varieties can be identified with all the scoring systems; that of Sanz is also capable of discriminating RA from SRA. 3. Some prediction on the possibility of evolution into AL can be attained of with each system. 4. The scoring system proposed by us shows higher discriminating capability on the cytologic varieties as well as higher predictive value on the possibility of evolution into AL. Nevertheless, it must be evaluated in other series in order to reach general acceptance.","['Rubio-Felix, D', 'Giraldo, M P', 'Perella, M', 'Gimeno, J', 'Franco, E', 'Giralt, M']","['Rubio-Felix D', 'Giraldo MP', 'Perella M', 'Gimeno J', 'Franco E', 'Giralt M']","['Servicio Regional de Hematologia y Hemoterapia, Hospital Miguel Servet, Zaragoza.']",['spa'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Sangre (Barc),Sangre,0404373,IM,,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*mortality', 'Prognosis', '*Severity of Illness Index', 'Survival Analysis']",,1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Sangre (Barc). 1991 Dec;36(6):463-9.,,,,,,Analisis de cuatro sistemas de puntuacion pronostica en 197 sindromes mielodisplasicos.,,,,,,,,,

As described in a companion paper, one of these extracts (derived from Albizia amara) has been further processed and found to contain a group of structurally-unique macrocyclic alkaloids that demonstrate a variety of biological activities. Therefore, this approach should prove a value in facilitating the identification of plant extracts that contain substances capable of binding to DNA and the subsequent activity-directed fractionation for the procurement of active principles. As a prescreen or monitor, these relatively uncomplicated hplc procedures can be used in laboratories not prepared to perform more complicated or costly bioassay techniques.

A clinicopathologic analysis of six cases.,1023-31,"Six patients with malignant lymphoma of lymphoblastic type involving cutaneous sites at time of diagnosis are presented. Skin sites of the head and neck were involved in all patients and included the scalp (three patients), forehead (two patients), and malar region of the face (one patient). Two patients also had additional sites of skin disease (neck, breast, and anterior trunk). In two patients the skin was the predominant site of disease, whereas in the remaining patients staging workup revealed generalized lymphoma. The histologic findings in each patient were typical of lymphoblastic lymphoma; the neoplastic cells were small with blastic nuclear chromatin. In three patients the neoplastic cells were convoluted, and in three they were nonconvoluted. Immunophenotypically, four lymphomas were of pre-B cell type, and two lymphomas were of T cell type. There was no correlation between histologic features and the immunophenotype. Since the majority of lymphoblastic lymphomas are of T cell type, the predominance of pre-B cell tumors involving the skin may suggest that pre-B cell neoplasms have a predilection for cutaneous involvement. In further support of this hypothesis, both lymphomas that appear to have arisen in the skin had a pre-B cell immunophenotype.","['Sander, C A', 'Medeiros, L J', 'Abruzzo, L V', 'Horak, I D', 'Jaffe, E S']","['Sander CA', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Abruzzo LV', 'Horak ID', 'Jaffe ES']","['Hematopathology Section, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Am Acad Dermatol,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,7907132,IM,,"['Adult', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/pathology', 'Child', 'Chromatin/ultrastructure', 'Cytoplasm/ultrastructure', 'Facial Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Forehead/pathology', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Scalp/pathology', 'Skin/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*pathology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/pathology']",,1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Am Acad Dermatol. 1991 Dec;25(6 Pt 1):1023-31. doi: 10.1016/0190-9622(91)70302-i.,['0 (Chromatin)'],,"['0190-9622(91)70302-I [pii]', '10.1016/0190-9622(91)70302-i [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify this differentiation factor, RNA was isolated from HL-60 cells grown on bone marrow matrix and assayed by Northern analysis for expression of mRNA for human differentiation factor, tumor necrosis factor, and macrophage colony-stimulating factor, all inducers of monocyte/macrophage differentiation. Expression of differentiation factor, tumor necrosis factor, or macrophage colony-stimulating factor mRNA was not enhanced in HL-60 cells grown on matrix compared to cells grown on uncoated plastic flasks. Thus, the maturation factor does not appear to be differentiation factor, tumor necrosis factor, or macrophage colony-stimulating factor within the limits of detection of Northern analysis. Elution of the active conditioned medium fraction on a Sephacryl S-200 column revealed a molecular weight of approximately 40,000. The active protein eluted on a DEAE-cellulose ion-exchange column at an ionic strength of 0.3 M NaCl, indicating that it is fairly anionic. Thus, bone marrow matrix is able to induce HL-60 cells to produce a maturation-inducing 40 kilodalton protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Mane, S', 'Winkelmann, J C', 'Luikart, S D']","['Mane S', 'Winkelmann JC', 'Luikart SD']","['Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis 55455.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,IM,,"['Biological Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Bone Marrow/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Culture Media', 'Extracellular Matrix/*physiology', 'Heparitin Sulfate/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Radioligand Assay', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1991 Dec;2(12):637-43.,"['0 (Biological Factors)', '0 (Culture Media)', '9050-30-0 (Heparitin Sulfate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three of them progressed into acute leukemia (AL) without any detectable change in the chromosomal complement of the bone marrow cells; 2) twenty-five patients who had at the beginning of the study, different pathological chromosomal clones in bone marrow cells. There was no chromosomal evolution detectable during the disease; eight of them progressed into acute leukemia; 3) thirty-six patients who had either normal or pathological chromosomal findings at the first examination and in whom further clonal abnormalities had developed during the course of the disease. Twelve of them progressed into acute leukemia. Two to nine cytogenetic examinations were successfully performed with a mean of three studies per patient. The results confirmed strictly individual development of chromosomal abnormalities during the course of the disease, with an unfavorable prognosis for the patients with complex chromosomal changes.

We showed that terminal differentiation was induced when differentiating concentrations of the drug were present for only 1-2 h in the culture medium. Conditions inducing differentiation also inhibited PLC activity for a long lasting period (at least 5 h). When terminal differentiation affected only part of the cell population, inhibition of phospholipase C activity was found to be less marked and reversible over the period studied. Moreover in experiments done in an HL-60 clone resistant to PMA, no inhibition of PLC activity was provoked by this tumour promotor. In order to study the involvement of protein kinase C in this process, we measured modifications of PLC activity by PMA in the presence of two different protein kinase C inhibitors, staurosporine and H-7. They both prevented the inhibition of PLC activity by PMA indicating that this inhibition is likely to be related to the effect of PMA on protein kinase C activity. This was also confirmed by the fact that active protein kinase C, by itself, was able to decrease PLC activity when added to membrane preparations or to streptolysin O-permeabilized control HL-60 cells. These results indicate that PMA acts in inhibiting phospholipase C activity through its effect on protein kinase C activation and/or on protein kinase C translocation to the plasma membrane and that terminal differentiation, might be related to changes in both protein kinase C and PLC activities.","['Cost, H', 'Barreau, P', 'Basset, M', 'Le Peuch, C', 'Geny, B']","['Cost H', 'Barreau P', 'Basset M', 'Le Peuch C', 'Geny B']","['INSERM, Unite 204, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Biochem Funct,Cell biochemistry and function,8305874,IM,,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Clone Cells', 'Enzyme Activation/*drug effects', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)/pharmacology"", 'Humans', 'Inositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Isoquinolines', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Piperazines', 'Protein Kinase C/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Staurosporine', 'Streptolysins/pharmacology', 'Subcellular Fractions/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/drug effects/*metabolism']",,1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Biochem Funct. 1991 Oct;9(4):263-73. doi: 10.1002/cbf.290090408.,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Streptolysins)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,['10.1002/cbf.290090408 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

When the cells were primed with fatty acids for 24 h, 48 h or 72 h, the TF activity remained essentially unchanged. However, the extent of TF-activation induced by LPS depended on the length of priming, and the dose and the degree of unsaturation of the fatty acids to which cells were exposed.

With disease progression, STL and SSF increased significantly, whereas PRF showed a steady decrease from diagnosis to blast crisis. The most significant part of these changes took place during the chronic phase, before the clinical onset of disease transformation. Hematologic parameters, in comparison, revealed significant changes later, shortly before blast crisis. The remaining duration of the chronic phase diminished from 25.5 months at the time of diagnosis, when the median STL was 2.0c, to 19.6 months for patients showing an STL of 2.1c, to 15.0 months with an STL of 2.2c and to 1.0 months for those with an STL of greater than or equal to 2.3c. Prognostically relevant limits for SSF and PRF were at 20%. When the SSF passed this limit or the PRF fell below it, the mean remaining chronic phase of these patients amounted to only 14.1 and 10.1 months. Interactive cytometry allows analysis of the DNA cytometric equivalent of changes in leukemic progenitor cells, which are well known from cytogenetic and cell kinetic studies. These three DNA cytometric parameters reflect the ""natural history"" of CML with the development of a cytogenetically hyperdiploid clone during disease progression in most patients and a simultaneous loss of proliferative potential on the level of myelobasts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Kropff, M', 'Chatelain, R', 'Muller, C P', 'Wagner, A', 'Wenzler, T', 'Bohmer, H', 'Bocking, A']","['Kropff M', 'Chatelain R', 'Muller CP', 'Wagner A', 'Wenzler T', 'Bohmer H', 'Bocking A']","['Institute of Pathology, Aachen University of Technology, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Anal Quant Cytol Histol,Analytical and quantitative cytology and histology,8506819,IM,,"['Blast Crisis/*pathology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Ploidies', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Risk Factors', 'Stem Cells/*chemistry', 'Survival Rate']",,1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anal Quant Cytol Histol. 1991 Dec;13(6):433-9.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An assay for the enzyme is described, which is based on methionine quantitation by o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) derivatization and reversed-phase liquid chromatography. The enzymatic reaction is linear for at least 120 min under reducing conditions (125 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) and running the assay below an oil layer. This reducing system does not interfere with formation of the methionine-OPA adduct, which is separated from interfering compounds and an internal standard (norvaline) by a mobile phase adjusted to pH 5.0. The inclusion of internal standard increases the precision of the assay and corrects for the variable fluorescence yield due to occasional inaccurate pH adjustment before the derivatization step. Norvaline was suitable for this purpose because it elutes close to methionine and is not a natural amino acid present in biological extracts. This nonradioactive assay for methionine synthase was evaluated by comparison with a conventional method based on isolation of radioactive methionine by anion-exchange chromatography and by determination of enzyme activity in extract from cultured cells and liver.","['Garras, A', 'Djurhuus, R', 'Christensen, B', 'Lillehaug, J R', 'Ueland, P M']","['Garras A', 'Djurhuus R', 'Christensen B', 'Lillehaug JR', 'Ueland PM']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Anal Biochem,Analytical biochemistry,0370535,IM,,"['5-Methyltetrahydrofolate-Homocysteine S-Methyltransferase/*analysis/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Autoanalysis/methods', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/methods', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Liver/*enzymology', 'Methionine/*analysis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence/methods', 'o-Phthalaldehyde']",,1991/11/15 00:00,1991/11/15 00:01,['1991/11/15 00:00'],"['1991/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anal Biochem. 1991 Nov 15;199(1):112-8. doi: 10.1016/0003-2697(91)90277-z.,"['0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '643-79-8 (o-Phthalaldehyde)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'EC 2.1.1.13 (5-Methyltetrahydrofolate-Homocysteine S-Methyltransferase)']",,"['0003-2697(91)90277-Z [pii]', '10.1016/0003-2697(91)90277-z [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Depletion of the normal stem cell compartment, as well as the proliferative advantage and frequent pharmacoresistance of the blastic clone, contribute to the poor prognosis of CML patients in this phase. Recent clinical trials have shown that idarubicin (IDR) in combination with cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C) is more active than daunorubicin at comparable doses in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Furthermore, IDR alone also exhibits antitumoral activity in the BC of CML. METHODS: Twelve Ph+ CML patients in BC (male 8, female 4; median age 45 yrs., range 19-55 yrs.) were treated with IDR 12 mg/m2/die for 3 consecutive days in sequential combination with Ara-C (1 hour i.v. infusion) 120 mg/m2/12 hrs. for 7 consecutive days. BC exhibited a myeloid phenotype in 9 and a lymphoid phenotype in 3 cases. Median duration of the previous chronic phase had been 36 months (range 6-180). RESULTS: Clearing of peripheral and bone marrow blasts was achieved in all but one patient. Three other patients were classified as resistant because of blastic regrowth, and 3 died of infection during postchemotherapeutic aplasia. Two patients achieved complete remission (CR) and 3 partial remission (PR). The median duration of response was 11 months (range 6-32). CONCLUSIONS: In BC of CML the IDR/Ara-C combination led to an encouraging rate of either partial or complete responses. The relatively long duration of unmaintained response was even more interesting, with the duration of PR approaching that of CR. These data suggest that IDR should be considered as one of the first-line drugs in the treatment of BC of CML.","['Lambertenghi-Deliliers, G', 'Annaloro, C', 'Cortellaro, M', 'Pozzoli, E', 'Oriani, A', 'Polli, E E']","['Lambertenghi-Deliliers G', 'Annaloro C', 'Cortellaro M', 'Pozzoli E', 'Oriani A', 'Polli EE']","['Istituto di Scienze Mediche, Universita, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/*drug therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Infections/chemically induced/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction']",,1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 1991 Sep-Oct;76(5):406-8.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In a phase I-II study we administered oral IDA to 14 predominantly elderly patients (age range 40-79, median 74) with advanced forms of MDS, namely chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) (one case), refractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB) (7 cases) or refractory anaemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-t) (6 cases). IDA was given at a dose of 30 mg/m2 once each 2 weeks for 8 doses. RESULTS: There was one complete remission (CR) and one partial response (PR), for an overall response rate of 14%. Mean survival from time of initiation of therapy was 10.0 months (+/- 8.0 months [SD]; median, 7.0 months). 5 patients developed severe side-effects, including 3 with life-threatening infections, and there were two deaths from cytopenias during the drug therapy.

Compared with IFN-alpha, IFN-beta exerts greater in vitro antiproliferative activity on many cell lines, stimulates peripheral blood stem cells of hairy-cell leukemia (HCL) patients to differentiate to erythroid burst forming cells, has higher specific type I IFN receptor affinity and modulates the expression of class II histocompatibility antigens. IFN-beta would, therefore, be expected to have a greater, or at least similar, antitumor activity as that of the various types of IFN-alpha. METHODS: We have treated 12 patients affected by HCL with IFN-beta and have investigated the biological and immunological changes induced by such treatment. RESULTS: A rise in beta 2-microglobulin and neopterin values throughout IFN-beta therapy was documented in most patients. An increase in NK activity was observed only in clinical responders whose CD57+/CD16+ cell ratio dropped below baseline. There was also a modulation in IFN-gamma synthesis that was dependent on baseline levels and in line with the clinical response. IFN-beta provoked a reduction in CD3+ and CD4+ cell subsets in patients with WBC greater than or equal to 10.0 x 10(9)/1 and greater than or equal to 50% circulating HCs, an expansion in absolute number of CD3+ and CD8+ cell fractions and a slight rise in the absolute values of CD2+ and CD4+ cell subpopulations in patients with WBC less than or equal to 5.0 x 10(9)/1 and less than or equal to 50% circulating HCs. There was no correlation between either the IFN-beta induced increase in beta 2-M or Np levels and clinical response. Most immunological parameters improved or normalized later during the course of IFN-beta treatment, when pathological-hematological signs of disease remission were already evident.

This possibility leads to misdiagnosis of leukemia and incorrect therapies might be administered. METHODS: We report two patients presenting with diffuse bone marrows involvement by neoplastic cells. Initial studies were not consistent with a diagnosis of leukemia and the cases were further studied extensively by indirect immunofluorescence, immunocytochemistry, electron microscopy and cytogenetics. RESULTS: In both cases blast cells were large, poorly differentiated, with immunological reactivity to the anti-desmin antibody. Ultrastructural findings of muscular features and chromosomal translocation t(2;13) (q37;q14) further confirmed the diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma of the alveolar subtype. This was then confirmed histologically in one patient.

The cytogenetic study was carried out on bone marrow cells at the time of diagnosis. The G- banding technique was used for chromosome identification. The follow-up was for 50 months. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Five patients (3 with RA and 2 with RA-S) showed a single 5q- marker. They had a long survival without evolution to leukemia. All cases with 5q- plus additional abnormalities: del(12p), del(7q), del(14q), i(11q) and i(17q), showed a neoplastic evolution in a short period of time. We can conclude that the presence of the 5q- marker with complex karyotypes or additional abnormalities is associated with a high risk of neoplastic evolution, indicating the prognostic value of cytogenetic study in myelodysplasia.","['Larripa, I', 'Acevedo, S', 'Palau Nagore, M V', 'Bengio, R', 'Mondini, N', 'Slavutsky, I']","['Larripa I', 'Acevedo S', 'Palau Nagore MV', 'Bengio R', 'Mondini N', 'Slavutsky I']","['Cytogenetic Department, Instituto de Investigaciones Hematologicas Mariano R.

This culture system has recently been proposed as a method for purging autografts. METHODS: In our study we evaluated for cytogenetic conversion cells harvested from the non-adherent (NA) fraction of LTBMCs from CML patients. Moreover we investigated the effects of prior therapy (busulfan or hydroxyurea) on CML hematopoiesis maintained under long-term culture. RESULTS: Time-course analysis of a large number of metaphases of NA cells from LTBMCs showed that the disappearance of Ph1+ cells is fortuitous. Although most of the analyzed cells were more mature cells, a complete cytogenetic conversion at the level of the early hematopoietic compartment, located within the adherent stromal layers, seems unlikely, at least for the first 3,4 weeks of culture. Thus the possibility exists of reinfusing an indefinite number of Ph1+ progenitor or stem cells, which renders proper evaluation of the clinical benefits of this purging method difficult. Moreover we found that prior chemotherapy (busulfan or hydroxyurea) significantly affected CML hematopoiesis, reducing time-course recovery of clonogenic cells from LTBMCs. CONCLUSIONS: Overall data suggest caution in the reinfusion of bone marrow cells maintained under long-term culture for previously treated CML patients.","['Santucci, M A', 'Zaccaria, A', 'Testoni, N', 'Russo, D', 'Zuffa, E', 'Baccarani, M', 'Tura, S']","['Santucci MA', 'Zaccaria A', 'Testoni N', 'Russo D', 'Zuffa E', 'Baccarani M', 'Tura S']","['Istituto di Cancerologia, Universita di Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Purging/methods', 'Busulfan/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Clone Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Culture Techniques/methods', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Selection, Genetic', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/pathology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 1991 Sep-Oct;76(5):357-62.,"['G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytogenetic study].,525-9,"As a preliminary step in the search for chromosomal location of a susceptibility gene predisposing to schizophrenia, cytogenetic screening of patients might be useful. Search for chromosomal aberrations has successfully directed and accelerated the identification of several disease genes, such as the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene, retinoblastoma, Burkitt's lymphoma and chronic myeloid leukemia. Although karyotypes abnormalities do not account for a large portion of cases of Schizophrenia, the two candidate regions predisposing to this disease resulted from observation of chromosomal abnormalities. First, the identification of a partial trisomy of the 5q11-q13 region (Basset et al., 1988) led Sherrington et al. (1988) to report a positive linkage with markers localized on the long arm of chromosome 5, which has not yet been replicated (Kauffman et al., 1989; Kennedy et al., 1988; St Clair et al., 1989). Second, on the basis of frequent cytogenetic abnormalities of the sex chromosome (DeLisi, 1985) in addition to epidemiological observations, Crow (1988) suggested that there could be a locus for psychosis within the pseudoautosomal region, a data which has been recently confirmed (Collinge et al., 1991). With the hypothesis that such aberrations could be more frequent among schizophrenics who have at least one affected first-degree relative, we undertook cytogenetic screening on a sample recruited from consecutive psychiatric admissions to a Psychiatric facility (Hopital Saint Paul) involving patients living in a limited geographical area on the island of La Reunion, a French Department in the Indian Ocean.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Gorwood, P', 'Leboyer, M', 'Jay, M', 'Hillaire, D', 'Carteault, F', 'Dugain, A M', 'Berg, S', 'Des Lauriers, A', 'Feingold, J']","['Gorwood P', 'Leboyer M', 'Jay M', 'Hillaire D', 'Carteault F', 'Dugain AM', 'Berg S', 'Des Lauriers A', 'Feingold J']","[""Unite de recherche d'Epidemiologie genetique (INSERM U155), Chateau de Longchamp, Paris.""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",France,Encephale,L'Encephale,7505643,IM,,"['Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Pedigree', 'Research', 'Schizophrenia/*genetics']",51,1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Encephale. 1991 Nov-Dec;17(6):525-9.,,,,,,Formes familiales de schizophrenie.

Changes in expression of c-myb and c-myc during the HMBA-induced terminal differentiation of murine erythroleukemia cells were characterized by an early decrease (within 4 hrs), followed by the recovery of c-myc mRNA by 10 hrs, and the retention of suppression of c-myb expression for the rest of the induction period. Two MELC variants were used to further define the relationship between the differentiation and the protooncogene expression. R1 was a MELC variant completely resistant to HMBA, and R1 (VCR), a vincristine resistant R1, became inducible by HMBA again. The cell differentiation and the c-myb and c-myc expression were determined on R1 or R1 (VCR) cultured with HMBA respectively. The results demonstrated that the c-myc mRNA increased and remained relatively high as the cells grew to a saturated density regardless of the induction of differentiation. The R1 (VCR) cultured with HMBA displayed an early decrease in c-myb mRNA and a subsequent suppression of its expression, while the R1 cultured with HMBA showed a stable level of c-myb mRNA. These results suggest that the c-myb expression, rather than c-myc expression, is closely related to the HMBA-induced terminal differentiation.","['Chen, Z X']",['Chen ZX'],"['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Suzhou.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi,Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology],7910681,IM,,"['Acetamides/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Drug Resistance', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', '*Genes, myc', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Vincristine']",,1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi. 1991 Jul;13(4):261-4.,"['0 (Acetamides)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']","['C-MYB', 'C-MYC']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prophylaxis of disseminated intravascular coagulation was made by platelet transfusions and heparin. In case of leukemic resistance, patients received a second course with 2 days of rubidazone (arm A) or Amsa (arm B) and 3 days of Ara C. Patients who achieved complete remission (CR) received three consolidation courses with the two drugs used for induction and maintenance therapy for 3 years. Two patients in arm A and one in arm B were allografted in first CR. Initial characteristics were similar in both arms. In arm A, 18 patients (86%) reached CR, two had hypoplastic death, and one had leukemic resistance after two courses. In arm B, 12 patients (66%) achieved CR, two had early death (CNS bleeding, one case; ventricular fibrillation, one case), and four had resistant leukemia after two courses. The difference in CR rate between the two arms was not significant. In arm A, disease-free survival (DFS) showed a plateau at 54.3% after 34 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 32.1% to 74.9%), with eight CRs longer than 34 months. In arm B, DFS was significantly shorter (P less than .03), showing a plateau at 16.7% after 38 months (95% confidence interval, 4.7% to 44.6%), and only two prolonged CRs were seen. The difference in DFS remained significant after censoring allografted patients and patients who died in CR (one in arm A, two in arm B). Our results suggest that Amsa-Ara C combinations may be inferior to anthracycline-Ara C combinations in the treatment of APL, because they seem to provide shorter DFS and, possibly, a higher incidence of initial leukemic resistance.

A Pediatric Oncology Group study.,526-31,"As part of a comprehensive prospective clinicopathologic study by the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG), 2,092 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were evaluated by uniform morphologic, cytochemical, and immunologic methods to assess the frequency and implications of granular lymphoblasts. All cases were Sudan black or myeloperoxidase negative and met French-American-British (FAB) morphologic criteria for ALL. Granular ALL, characterized by the presence of more than 5% marrow blasts with at least three clearly defined azurophilic cytoplasmic granules, was identified in 56 of the 1,252 fully studied cases (4.5%). The frequency of granular features did not differ among early pre-B (4.3%), pre-B (3.6%), and T (5.8%) ALL; no cases were identified among the 12 patients with B ALL. Within the early pre-B/pre-B group, granular ALL was equally distributed between good- and poor-risk clinical groups but was more frequent among FAB L2 than FAB L1 cases (12% vs. 2%; P less than or equal to 0.001). Patients were treated with standard POG protocols for early pre-B/pre-B and T ALL. Complete remission (CR) rates were significantly lower for those with granular lymphoblasts, regardless of risk group, immunophenotype, or FAB type. Analysis of event-free survival (EFS) showed a significantly poorer outcome for granular early pre-B/pre-B cases with FAB L2 morphologic characteristics (P less than 0.001) and for those classified as poor risk (P = 0.015). These findings suggest a relationship between granules and L2 morphologic characteristics in childhood ALL and indicate that the presence of granular lymphoblasts conveys a worse prognosis for certain subgroups of children with ALL.","['Cerezo, L', 'Shuster, J J', 'Pullen, D J', 'Brock, B', 'Borowitz, M J', 'Falletta, J M', 'Crist, W M', 'Head, D R']","['Cerezo L', 'Shuster JJ', 'Pullen DJ', 'Brock B', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Falletta JM', 'Crist WM', 'Head DR']","['Orlando Regional Medical Center, Florida.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,IM,['Am J Clin Pathol. 1992 Jan;97(1):156-7.

The cytostatic effect is complete after 30 min and cannot be washed out with buffer. Viability measurements showed that the leukemic cells were killed in a time dependent manner. As no influence on the cell nucleus could be observed this is most probably due to interaction with the cell membrane.

In this work, the activity of O6-AGT in different cell lines and the relationship between the depletion of the enzyme and the frequency of micronuclei induced by cisplatin (DDP), Ning Xin platin (camphoramine chloroacetic platinum, CCP) or carboplatin (JM-8) in KB and CHL cells were studied. Experiments indicate that KB cells showed higher O6-AGT activity (greater than 400 dpm/300 micrograms protein extracts) which belonged to Mer+ cells, but CHL, HL-60 and L1210 cells showed very low O6-AGT activity (less than 50 dpm/300 micrograms protein extracts) which can be considered to be Mer- cells. Cytotoxicity studies indicated that no mer- selection was observed in these platinum complexes for KB, HL-60, CHL and L1210 cells. However, a good relationship between the depletion of O6-AGT and the frequency of micronuclei induced by the platinum complexes was obtained. CCP caused the highest depletion of the enzyme and exhibited highest potency in damaging chromosome.","['Wang, L G', 'Liu, X M', 'Fan, P D', 'Ji, X J']","['Wang LG', 'Liu XM', 'Fan PD', 'Ji XJ']","['Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Yao Xue Xue Bao,Yao xue xue bao = Acta pharmaceutica Sinica,21710340R,IM,,"['Animals', 'Carboplatin/*toxicity', 'Chromosomes/*drug effects', 'Cisplatin/*toxicity', 'DNA Damage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'KB Cells/drug effects/enzymology', 'Leukemia L1210/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Methyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Micronucleus Tests', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/*toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology']",,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Yao Xue Xue Bao. 1991;26(8):561-6.,"['0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '109207-13-8 (camphoramine chloroacetic platinum)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, immunologic and immunohistochemical studies revealed another 40 cases to be proven B-cell lymphomas. Poor performance status and elevated levels of BUN and GPT were significantly associated with shortened survival in a Cox's proportional hazards model. A poor performance status and high levels of serum BUN and GPT suggested a marked deterioration in a patient's condition.

We studied the antitumor effects of these compounds on the cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum, DDP)-resistant human leukemia cell line, K562/DDP. K562/DDP cells were 10-fold resistant to DDP, while the cells showed minimal cross-resistance to carboplatin (2.1-fold) and DWA2114R (3.3-fold), and were as sensitive to NK121 (1.6-fold) and 254-S (1.0-fold) as the parent cells. Increases in exposure time of K562 cells to DWA2114R resulted in progressive shifting of the dose-response curve to the left, or more effective cell growth inhibition of the cells. Time dependency indices (ID80 obtained from dose-response curve after 1 hr-exposure of K562 cells to drug followed by 72 hr-culture without drug/ID80 after 24 hr-exposure) of DDP, NK121 and 254-S were 10, 8 and 20, respectively.

Little or no influence of tumor cell density was observed in the growth inhibition of MOLT-3 or K562 cells induced by these new compounds even if cells were concentrated to a density of 10(8) cells/ml. These results indicate that NK121 and 254-S may overcome the drug resistance developed in the patients after treatment with DDP.

Being phosphorylated to the triphosphate of araC-araCTP (5'-triphosphate of araC), 5'-chloro-araC has the same mechanism of action as arabinosylcytosine. In alkaline solutions 5'-chloro-araC is transformed to another (cytostatically inactive) araC analog--2',5'-anhydroarabinosylcytosine--but at physiological pH and temperature conditions, it has sufficient stability to be phosphorylated and thus activated. A lower rate of araCTP formation from 5'-chloro-araC explains the somewhat lower cytotoxic effect of this compound against various established cell lines in vitro compared to araC. Lipophilicity that would allow an oral drug formulation and certain other superior physico-chemical and biochemical characteristics of 5'-chloro-araC make this compound an interesting candidate for further investigations.","['Novotny, L', 'Reichelova, V', 'Balazova, E', 'Scheithauer, W', 'Benesova, M', 'Ujhazy, V']","['Novotny L', 'Reichelova V', 'Balazova E', 'Scheithauer W', 'Benesova M', 'Ujhazy V']","['Department of Experimental Therapy, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Czechoslovakia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Biotransformation/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/pathology', 'Culture Media', 'Cytarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pyrimidine Nucleosides/metabolism', 'Temperature', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",,1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 1991 Oct;2(5):495-502. doi: 10.1097/00001813-199110000-00010.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Pyrimidine Nucleosides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', ""32659-31-7 (5'-chloro-5'-deoxyarabinosylcytosine)""]",,['10.1097/00001813-199110000-00010 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The study aimed at two different, but strictly linked issues: (1) identification of the eradication capability of BMT, and (2) evaluation of the effect of BMT, both in preventing relapse and in producing long-term disease-free survival. Fifty-four patients allografted for leukaemia were evaluated at various intervals, after bone marrow transplantation, for the presence of host haemopoiesis using red-blood-cell and cytogenetic markers. Among 40 patients in remission, 10 showed functional host and donor haemopoiesis (mixed chimerism), while in 30, host haemopoiesis was never detected (complete chimerism). Seven of the 14 evaluable patients who relapsed showed the reappearance of host haemopoiesis at the time of relapse. The records of received doses of TBI indicate that patients who achieved mixed chimerism, either relapsing or not, received significantly lower doses than complete chimeras. However, some patients with complete chimerism received a TBI dose equivalent to the dose received by those with mixed chimerism, suggesting that the TBI dose is not the only factor determining the reappearance of host haemopoiesis. The data on chimerism and relapse suggest that there is heterogeneity in radiosensitivity between normal marrow cells and leukaemic cells, and further, within the different types of leukaemia. The incidence/severity of acute and chronic graft-vs-host disease (GvHD) was significantly higher in complete chimeras than in mixed chimeras suggesting that mixed chimerism may play a role in the development of tolerance; however, it could be the tolerance (i.e. absence of GvHD) which is responsible for the persistence of host haemopoietic cells. One-hundred-and-sixty-eight patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukaemia were analyzed for risk factor associated with relapse. All patients received marrow from an HLA identical sibling after preparation with cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg and total body irradiation (TBI) of 330 cGy on days -3, -2, -1. There was a difference of +/- 18% between the nominal total dose of 990 cGy and the actual received dose as indicated by dosimetric recordings. While interstitial pneumonitis had minimal impact on survival there was a considerable difference in the incidence of relapses. The incidence of relapse was higher in patients receiving less, than in patients receiving more than 1000 cGy respectively and this had a major impact on survival. However, transplant-related mortality was slightly higher in the group of patients receiving higher doses of TBI.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Frassoni, F']",['Frassoni F'],"['Centro Trapianti Midollo Osseo, Divisione Ematologia, Ospedale San Martino, Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Med Oncol Tumor Pharmacother,Medical oncology and tumor pharmacotherapy,8405039,IM,,"['Bone Marrow Purging/methods', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chimera/physiology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Erythrocytes/immunology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Oncol Tumor Pharmacother. 1991;8(3):189-201. doi: 10.1007/BF02987179.,,,['10.1007/BF02987179 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The present report was aimed to study the effect of the vinca alkaloid, vincristine (VCR), on the terminal divisions and self-renewal of the blast progenitors. A primary colony assay was utilized to reflect the former and a secondary colony assay and suspension culture to reflect the latter in AML patients. The results indicated that in many of the cases studied, VCR was considered to be almost equally toxic to terminal divisions and self-renewal of the blast progenitors. An almost equivalent cytotoxicity of VCR was also noted against normal hematopoietic cells, assessed by colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) assay. This study suggested that successful chemotherapy with VCR may be more easily achieved in combination with other drugs that are highly inhibitory to the self-renewal of the blast progenitors.","['Yamashita, Y', 'Tohda, S', 'Nagata, K', 'Suzuki, T', 'Imai, Y', 'Nara, N']","['Yamashita Y', 'Tohda S', 'Nagata K', 'Suzuki T', 'Imai Y', 'Nara N']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Jpn J Med,Japanese journal of medicine,0247713,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Macrophages/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Regression Analysis', 'Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/*pharmacology']",,1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Jpn J Med. 1991 Sep-Oct;30(5):412-9. doi: 10.2169/internalmedicine1962.30.412.,['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)'],,['10.2169/internalmedicine1962.30.412 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The level of C2 in the culture supernatants was measured by immune hemolysis, those of Bf and C1-INH by ELISA. CM-AML was added to the monocyte cultures on day 3 and replaced by culture fluid on day 6. Compared to the control cultures, CM-AML significantly increased C2 and Bf levels and slightly decreased C1-INH levels in the culture fluids on day 6. On day 9, Bf synthesis enhancement still could be observed but C2 and C1-INH levels did not significantly differ from those of the control. CM-AML significantly increased the synthesis of factor B by the HepG2 cells too. A strong correlation was found between the results of the Bf protein and RNA determinations, which means that the supernatants of AML blasts affect the gene expression of factor B at a pretranslational level. The selective complement synthesis modifying effect of CM-AML was not due to interferons (IFN) because neither IFN-alpha nor IFN-gamma could be detected in these conditioned media.

The TF1 cell line responds to rhu IL-3, rhu GM-CSF and to a lesser extent to rhu Erythropoietin (EPO) and mast cell growth factor (MGF), but not to rhu G-CSF. It is dependent upon rhu GM-CSF for survival in culture. For the proliferation assay 1 x 10(4) TF1 cells were incubated with 20 ng - 0.256 pg rhu GM-CSF or rhu IL-3 at 37 degrees C and 5% CO2 in humidified atmosphere. After 48 h the cells were washed twice with PBS and were incubated with 4-Methylumbelliferyl-heptanoate for 60 min.

However, the treatment-associated mortality can be as high as 30% increasing with age, previous chemotherapy and intensity of chemotherapy. GM-CSF was first applied in 36 patients with high risk AML after chemotherapy to reduce the time of critical neutropenia. The early death rate was significantly lower in the GM-CSF group compared to 56 patients of a historic control group with similar risk factors and identical chemotherapy (p less than 0.009). The rate of complete remissions was also significantly higher in the GM-CSF group (p less than 0.09). More recently, GM-CSF was used as a priming agent 24 h prior to start of chemotherapy. 25 patients have entered the study up to now. The cell biological effects of GM-CSF in vivo include an immediate increase of leukemic blasts and of normal myeloid cells in the peripheral blood with a median of 2.0, an increase of cells in the S-phase of the cell cycle in bone marrow biopsies, an increase in DNA polymerase activity, an increase in Ara-C cytotoxicity and immunophenotypic changes compatible with differentiation of leukemic blasts along the pathway of normal myeloid progenitors. GM-CSF has a dual effect on normal and leukemic myeloid cells. It can be safely applied in patients with AML. Prospective randomized trials have to be performed to establish its role in reducing treatment toxicity and in improving the overall treatment results.","['Wormann, B', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Frisch, J', 'Zuhlsdorf, M', 'Rottmann, R', 'Boeckmann, A', 'Reuter, C', 'Freire, E A', 'Innig, G', 'Schulz, G']","['Wormann B', 'Hiddemann W', 'Frisch J', 'Zuhlsdorf M', 'Rottmann R', 'Boeckmann A', 'Reuter C', 'Freire EA', 'Innig G', 'Schulz G', 'et al.']","['Department of Internal Medicine A, University of Munster, University Hospital, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Germany,Behring Inst Mitt,Behring Institute Mitteilungen,0367532,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/pathology/*therapy', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Behring Inst Mitt. 1991 Dec;(90):28-38.,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'DAT protocol 1']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In MF, the monoclonality of the T cells became detectable first in the skin when plaques develop to tumors then in lymph nodes, and finally in the blood lymphocytes, indicating this disease develops from local (skin) malignancy to systemic malignancy. In parapsoriasis en plaque, no monoclonality was detected in any sample. We could distinguish cutaneous ATL from the carrier state by detecting the T cell monoclonality and HTLV-I integration with these probes. One patient with CTCL showed detectable T cell monoclonality; 1 out of 4 patients with LP did the same. Four samples from patients with B cell lymphoma revealed detectable monoclonal rearrangement of immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes. In AR, no monoclonality was detected in any sample.

However, most of these studies were not specifically designed to establish the tobacco-leukemia relationship and therefore their capacity to evaluate this hypothesis is rather limited. This hypothesis could be supported by the fact that tobacco causes cancer in sites which are not in direct contact with tobacco smoke. Likewise, the presence of benzene and radioactive compounds would provide some biologic plausibility to the hypothesis that tobacco could be a cause of leukemia. However, since the etiology of leukemia is not well understood, the small excess risk detected may be confounded by some uncontrolled factor.","['Mur Pastor, P']",['Mur Pastor P'],"['Departamento de Salud Comunitaria, Universidad de Alicante.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Spain,Gac Sanit,Gaceta sanitaria,8901623,IM,,"['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Plants, Toxic', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking/*adverse effects', 'Tobacco/classification', 'Tobacco Smoke Pollution/adverse effects']",36,1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Gac Sanit. 1991 Mar-Apr;5(23):87-92. doi: 10.1016/s0213-9111(91)71052-2.,['0 (Tobacco Smoke Pollution)'],,"['S0213-9111(91)71052-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0213-9111(91)71052-2 [doi]']",,,Tabaco y leucemia.,,,,,,,,,

Further study revealed that the higher binding potency of ED-71 to plasma-specific vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) compared with that of calcitriol accounts for its stability in the blood circulation. The pharmacological effect of ED-71 for the animal models with osteoporosis seemed to be better than that calcitriol.

In addition to mature cell types, there is evidence that progenitors and perhaps stem cells can engraft the murine bone marrow. Recent work suggests that provision of exogenous human cytokines significantly increases the level of human cell engraftment and stimulates the development of multiple lineages.

The highest cancer risk was found in compounding, mixing, milling and vulcanizing sections. Hence, beta-naphthylamine, benzidine and solvents (benzene) were used in technological processes in the past, bladder cancer and leukemia were considered as most specific for the rubber industry.

In addition, utilizing FAB eliminated the problem of thermal decomposition, which was very difficult to control under EI and CI experimental conditions.

First, the combined use of hydroxyurea (HU) and interferon (500-1000 mg daily) in interferon-resistant cases facilitated maintenance of reduced leucocyte production, or a reduction in the dose of interferon, although suppression of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1)-positive clones was not observed in most cases. In order to try and decrease the rate of lymphoblastic crisis during the course of interferon therapy, we recently added methotrexate (MTX) (10-15 mg, weekly) to the treatment protocol. Since then, no lymphoblastic crisis has been observed. Second, the in vitro expression of alpha interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) mRNA was shown to be markedly decreased in granulocytes of one representative interferon-resistant case, compared to that in granulocytes of the three interferon-sensitive cases. Interestingly, it was found that the transcriptional activity in this case became almost normal when the blood granulocytes were controlled by the addition of HU. These findings suggest that the in vitro transcriptional assay of ISG mRNA may be clinically useful for predicting alpha interferon efficacy. Third, when genetically manipulated, alpha interferon-producing NIH/3T3 cells were co-transplanted using diffusion chambers into nude mice bearing a CML cell line, KU812, the CML tumour growth was shown to be markedly suppressed. This experimental model for alpha interferon replacement gene therapy suggests some directions for future studies on interferon therapy.","['Asano, S', 'Ogura, H', 'Tani, K', 'Inoue, T', 'Tojo, A', 'Ozawa, K']","['Asano S', 'Ogura H', 'Tani K', 'Inoue T', 'Tojo A', 'Ozawa K']","['Department of Hematology-Oncology, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,IM,,"['Animals', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis']",,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1991;27 Suppl 4:S21-5. doi: 10.1016/0277-5379(91)90559-v.,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,['10.1016/0277-5379(91)90559-v [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

There are four areas in which alpha interferon has proven or potential activity: antiviral, premalignant, adjuvant and advanced disease settings. The three main viral diseases in which interferon alfa-2b has been shown to have activity are chronic viral hepatitis, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and human papilloma virus infections. In vitro studies suggest that alpha interferon may inhibit transformation of some premalignant conditions into malignant disease; e.g., vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia. In the adjuvant setting, it is possible that a biological response modifier, such as alpha interferon, may have a role in helping the immune system to destroy residual tumour cells following tumour bulk reduction with radiation or chemotherapy. A higher response rate has been seen in patients with small tumour bulk compared to those with large tumour bulk (e.g., malignant melanoma, ovarian carcinoma), and in patients with early, rather than late, disease (e.g., chronic myelogenous leukaemia, hairy cell leukaemia, multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma). This may be due to efficacy in a small tumour bulk setting or due to an immunoadjuvant role. In advanced disease, the question is how best to exploit the possible synergistic effects between alpha interferon and other therapeutic modalities. The optimum dose, schedule and patient populations for combined treatment have yet to be determined. The major objective of this paper is to determine how best to capitalize upon the current state of knowledge to build for future trials of alpha interferon, and to determine whether the existing data suggest an adjuvant role for interferon after initial tumour regression.","['Bonnem, E M']",['Bonnem EM'],"['Schering-Plough Research, Kenilworth, NJ 07033.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,IM,,"['Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Virus Diseases/*therapy']",54,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1991;27 Suppl 4:S2-6. doi: 10.1016/0277-5379(91)90555-r.,['0 (Interferon-alpha)'],,['10.1016/0277-5379(91)90555-r [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Further studies revealed that 24 h after exposure to 10 J/cm2 ultraviolet A light and 8-methoxypsoralen (300 ng/mL), apoptotic cells increased from 3 (control) to 31% (p less than 0.001). Ultraviolet A light alone also significantly increased the number of apoptotic cells. These morphological changes were confirmed by parallel findings on DNA electrophoresis. Treatment with 2 to 5 J/cm2 of ultraviolet A light and 8-methoxypsoralen caused an approximately 30% increase in cytosolic free calcium levels in peripheral blood leukocytes 1 h after exposure. Associated with this was a 51% increase in 45Ca2+ uptake over the first 60 min. Similar findings in a different lymphoid cell (CCRF-CEM) confirmed the results obtained with peripheral blood leukocytes. The use of calcium-free medium prevented a rise in cytosolic free calcium and decreased the number of cells undergoing apoptotic cell death. Cycloheximide inhibited ultraviolet A light - 8-methoxypsoralen induced apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells; it also decreased calcium levels in control CCRF-CEM cells. This study shows that ultraviolet A light - 8-methoxypsoralen caused apoptotic cell death in lymphoid cells; this appeared to be associated with calcium influx, presumably because of the requirement of endogenous endonucleases for calcium.","['Marks, D I', 'Fox, R M']","['Marks DI', 'Fox RM']","['Department of Haematology and Medical Oncology, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Canada,Biochem Cell Biol,Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire,8606068,IM,,"['Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Leukocytes', 'Methoxsalen/*pharmacology', '*Photochemotherapy', '*Ultraviolet Therapy']",,1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Cell Biol. 1991 Oct-Nov;69(10-11):754-60. doi: 10.1139/o91-115.,"['9007-49-2 (DNA)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'U4VJ29L7BQ (Methoxsalen)']",,['10.1139/o91-115 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The effects of treatment duration (5 or 14 days) and route of administration (b.i.d. subcutaneous injection or administration in drinking water) were also evaluated. In all cases AZT therapy suppressed or reduced virus-induced splenomegaly and increased survival time. AZT therapy was more effective when started 1 h rather than 4 h after virus inoculation. A mutual influence between the dosage of the antiviral drug and the virus inoculum size was observed. A 5-day therapy was inadequate to suppress infection. AZT therapy led to similar results whether administered subcutaneously or in drinking water. The present results suggest that AZT efficacy declines when the inoculum size is increased, when the initiation of treatment is delayed and when treatment duration is shortened.","['Sinet, M', 'Desforges, B', 'Launay, O', 'Colin, J N', 'Pocidalo, J J']","['Sinet M', 'Desforges B', 'Launay O', 'Colin JN', 'Pocidalo JJ']","['Unite de Recherches U 13 INSERM, Hopital Claude Bernard, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Antiviral Res,Antiviral research,8109699,IM,,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*drug effects', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Organ Size/drug effects', 'Zidovudine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",,1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Antiviral Res. 1991 Sep;16(2):163-71. doi: 10.1016/0166-3542(91)90022-j.,['4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)'],,"['0166-3542(91)90022-J [pii]', '10.1016/0166-3542(91)90022-j [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Conversely, if the cholesterol content was enhanced by exchange diffusion with cholesterol:phosphatidylcholine liposomes, the cells' susceptibility to MC540-sensitized irradiation was decreased. However, contrary to expectations, dye-binding was slightly enhanced and plasma membrane fluidity remained unchanged. Growing the cells in fatty acid-supplemented medium had profound effects on their lipid composition. Cells enriched in polyunsaturated fatty acids had more fluid plasma membranes. However, dye-binding was not significantly affected and photosensitivity was slightly reduced. These results suggest that cholesterol is one, but probably not the only, determinant of the expression of cellular dye binding sites and, consequently, the cell's susceptibility to MC540-sensitized irradiation. By contrast, plasma membrane fluidity does not appear to play a major role in the regulation of dye-binding site expression.","['Gaffney, D K', 'Feix, J B', 'Schwarz, H P', 'Struve, M F', 'Sieber, F']","['Gaffney DK', 'Feix JB', 'Schwarz HP', 'Struve MF', 'Sieber F']","['Department of Biochemistry, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism/*radiation effects', 'Cholesterol/*metabolism', 'Fatty Acids/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Dyes/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxycholesterols/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Liposomes/metabolism', '*Membrane Fluidity', 'Phosphatidylcholines/metabolism', 'Photosensitivity Disorders/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidinones/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 1991 Nov;54(5):717-23. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-1097.1991.tb02080.x.,"['0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Hydroxycholesterols)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '58823-12-4 (merocyanine dye)', '767JTD2N31 (25-hydroxycholesterol)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",,['10.1111/j.1751-1097.1991.tb02080.x [doi]'],,"['CA42734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA49089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,

When subcutaneously inoculated, DL812 cells invade many organs and cause marked splenomegaly without forming local tumors. Disseminated DL812 leukemias are clinically completely cured by a single intraperitoneal injection of 1 mg ACNU, but more ACNU-resistant leukemias relapse immediately. A novel antitumor antibiotic, spergualin, is effective against various mouse leukemias. The effects of its analog with stronger anti-leukemia activity, 15-deoxyspergualin (DSG), on the relapse of DL812 leukemias after ACNU treatment were investigated. DDD mice were subcutaneously inoculated with 10(6) DL812 cells and intraperitoneally injected with 1 mg ACNU once on day 11 and with 100 micrograms DSG daily from day 12 on. The relapses were clinically completely suppressed for at least 30 days. Winn assays with spleen cells revealed that host immunity did not play a major role in maintenance of the clinical cure. Thus, when DSG treatment was discontinued after 15 or 30 daily injections, leukemias relapsed immediately. When it was extended to 50 daily injections, permanent cure was attained in 1 of 15 mice but relapses occurred under DSG treatment in the others. DSG is available for combined treatment of the leukemia. The current and previous results suggest that DL812 leukemias may serve as a model in study on immunochemotherapy of the disease.","['Takeda, Y', 'Kaneko, T', 'Matsuzawa, A']","['Takeda Y', 'Kaneko T', 'Matsuzawa A']","['Department of Clinical Oncology, University of Tokyo.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Antibiot,The Japanese journal of antibiotics,0154402,IM,,"['Animals', 'Guanidines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Nimustine/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Spleen/drug effects']",,1991/12/01 00:00,1991/12/01 00:01,['1991/12/01 00:00'],"['1991/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Jpn J Antibiot. 1991 Dec;44(12):1323-8.,"['0 (Guanidines)', '0S726V972K (Nimustine)', '71O2A541CU (spergualin)', 'UJ0ZJ76DO9 (gusperimus)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, HPC showed activity in a mitoxantrone-resistant P388 leukemia. Treated/control values between 120 and 160% in survival time could be obtained following a daily application of the lipid. Examination of the activity of possible cleavage products of HPC gave no information about the mechanism of action of the used etherlipids.

This is a retrospective cohort study. The study population was obtained from a register at the Farmers' Pension Fund and comprised 5922 men. Viewed as a whole the cohort shows a significant lower incidence for all tumours than expected. The same is true of SIR for cancer of colon, lung, prostate, bladder and other urinary organs with SIR of 47, 41, 71 and 51, respectively. However, some etiologic factors may contribute to the increased risk of some cancer sites among farmers. There was an excess for Hodgkin's disease SIR 251, and for cancer of lips, skin (excl. melanomas), nervous system, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and leukemia with SIR of 183, 150, 128, 142 and 151, respectively, however not statistically significant.

RHT was produced by an electromagnetic deep regional heating device (BSD Medical Corporation, Salt Lake City, Utah). Of these patients, 62% (40 patients) had received ifosfamide-containing drug regimens before entering the RHT study, 26% (17 patients) were pretreated by surgery and/or radiation and 12% (8 patients) were treated primarily. A total of 426 RHT treatments (mean 6.6 RHT/patient) were applied predominantly within the pelvic region (82%) bearing relative large tumours (mean volume 500 cm3). For systemic chemotherapy, all patients received ifosfamide (1.5 g/m2, days 1-5), etoposide (100 mg/m2, days 1, 3, 5) and 2-mercaptoethanesulphonic acid (mesna; 300 mg/m2 x 4, days 1-5) with RHT only given on days 1 and 5 in repeated cycles every 4 weeks. Detailed thermal mapping by invasive thermometry was performed in all patients. In 61 patients evaluable for tumour control the overall objective response rate including 9 complete responders (CR), 4 partial responders (PR) and 8 patients with favourable histological response (FHR) was 34% (95% confidence limits, 23%-46%). Following CR, the patients are alive and remain disease-free (mean disease-free survival 15.6 months). Of the patients with PR and FHR, 3 died from metastatic and/or local disease after 4, 17, and 39 months, and 1 patient died from other disease (acute myelocytic leukemia) after 27 months. The other 8 patients remain stable at 29, 25, 17, 11, 10, 8, 7, and 6 months. Twenty-two patients revealed no change and 18 patients showed local tumour progression (PD). Side-effects of RHT were tolerable and there was no indication of enhanced bone marrow toxicity due to the addition of RHT to the systemic chemotherapy. By analysis of temperature parameters, the time-averaged temperatures of all RHT treatments calculated for 20% (T20), 50% (T50) or 90% (T90) of measured tumour sites differed significantly between responders (CR + PR + FHR) and non-responders (PD), respectively (T20, P = 0.001; T50, P = 0.0005; T90, P = 0.0001). the data further support a strong potential for ifosfamide plus etoposide combined with RHT in pretreated patients with advanced sarcomas.","['Issels, R D', 'Mittermuller, J', 'Gerl, A', 'Simon, W', 'Ortmaier, A', 'Denzlinger, C', 'Sauer, H', 'Wilmanns, W']","['Issels RD', 'Mittermuller J', 'Gerl A', 'Simon W', 'Ortmaier A', 'Denzlinger C', 'Sauer H', 'Wilmanns W']","['Institut fur Klinische Hamatologie, University of Munich, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Hyperthermia, Induced', 'Ifosfamide/administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Sarcoma/*therapy']",,1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 1991;117 Suppl 4:S141-7. doi: 10.1007/BF01613220.,"['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'UM20QQM95Y (Ifosfamide)']",,['10.1007/BF01613220 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The initial assessment was made by a wedge testicular biopsy after completion of treatment (median 9.7 years; range 4.1-16.3 years) and the subsequent assessment (median 18.6 years; range 15.4-26.8 years) consisted of the clinical examination of pubertal stage, measurement of serum gonadotrophins and testosterone and, in 19 patients, semen analysis. All 37 men completed pubertal development normally and had a testosterone concentration within the normal adult range. Six men showed evidence of severe damage to the seminiferous epithelium, five were azoospermic and one, who did not provide semen for analysis, had a reduced mean testicular volume (11 mls; normal greater than or equal to 15 mls) and a raised basal FSH level (13 UI 1-1; normal less than or equal to 6 IU 1-1).

New investigational agents include alpha-interferon (IFN), which was shown to be active in small series of patients and for a short period of time. METHODS: Human recombinant alpha-IFN-2b (INTRON-A) was administered at a dose of 3MU daily for 6 to 12 mo. to 26 patients with early stage and previously untreated CLL, and to 3 previously treated patients. Response (regression to stage 0, or reduction of leukemic cell mass to less than 50%) was evaluated after 6 and 12 mo. RESULTS: 15 of 26 pts. (58%) had a stable response for more than 1 year, 9 (31%) had temporary or minor response, and 2 (7%) had disease progression. In the remaining 3 cases, treatment was discontinued within 3 mo. because of side effects.

Hence, alternative approaches are warranted in heavily pretreated patients. Some studies suggest the enhancement of cyclophosphamide (CY) activity when given by continuous infusion. METHODS: To evaluate the effectiveness of this scheduling in refractory ALL, we treated 15 adult patients (4 primary resistant, 11 relapsed and refractory to salvage regimens) with a seven-day course of CY 350 mg/m2/day by continuous i.v. infusion, associated with vincristine, cytosine-arabinoside and prednisone. RESULTS: The median time for hematologic recovery was 18 days, with negligible extramedullary toxicity. Two patients died while aplastic, 3 were non responders, 10 (66%) achieved complete remission after the first cycle. The response duration ranged from 5 to 32 (median 14) weeks, and the median survival of responders was 23 weeks. It is noteworthy that half of the responding patients had been resistant to prior CY in different schedules and other drug combinations. CONCLUSIONS: These data seem to confirm that CY exerts its best antineoplastic activity by continuous infusion.","['Ciolli, S', 'Leoni, F', 'Caporale, R', 'Salti, F', 'Ferrini, P R']","['Ciolli S', 'Leoni F', 'Caporale R', 'Salti F', 'Ferrini PR']","['Divisione di Ematologia, USL 10/D, Universita, Firenze, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Agranulocytosis/chemically induced/mortality', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cyclophosphamide', 'Cytarabine', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prednisone', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Vincristine']",,1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 1991 Jul-Aug;76(4):293-7.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'COAP protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In some cases the simultaneous appearance of MM and ANLL has been described. METHODS: In this series the simultaneous appearance of MM and various myelopathies in 91 untreated patients with MM, and the development of myelopathies during the course of the disease in 72 treated patients were studied. RESULTS: Simultaneous appearance of MM (IgA/lambda) and refractory anaemia with ring sideroblasts (RAS) was observed in one case (1.1%). Development of myelopathies in treated patients with MM was found in 4 out of 72 cases (cumulative risk at 8 years 28.3%). In one case (IgG/lambda MM) a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) developed 6 years after the initial diagnosis. Cytogenetic analysis was normal. In the second patient (IgG/k MM) a similar MPD was observed 5 years after the initial diagnosis. The karyotype was 46, XX, -5 + t (20;?). The third patient with lambda light chain disease developed RAS 11 months after the initial diagnosis. The karyotype was 46, XY/hypodiploidy + M. Finally, the fourth case (IgG/k MM) developed ANLL (M4) 28 months after the initial diagnosis and the karyotype was 45, XX, -7, t(1;3). CONCLUSIONS: The simultaneous appearance of MM and various myelopathies is unusual and probably represents a neoplastic transformation of a single progenitor in both lymphoid and myeloid malignancies. On the contrary, the development of myelopathies during the course of treated patients is a common phenomenon. The time of development and the cytogenetic findings strongly suggest that they are related to treatment with cytostatics.","['Economopoulos, T', 'Pappa, V', 'Panani, A', 'Stathakis, N', 'Dervenoulas, J', 'Papageorgiou, E', 'Asprou, N', 'Raptis, S']","['Economopoulos T', 'Pappa V', 'Panani A', 'Stathakis N', 'Dervenoulas J', 'Papageorgiou E', 'Asprou N', 'Raptis S']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Propaedeutic, Athens University, Evangelismos Hospital, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Refractory/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Anemia, Sideroblastic/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/*epidemiology/radiotherapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Risk', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",,1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 1991 Jul-Aug;76(4):289-92.,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CMVP regimen']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently purified to homogeneity a band 5 TrACP from human osteoclastomas and two isoforms of band 5 TrACP (5a and 5b) from the spleen of a patient with hairy cell leukemia. 3. Although the N-terminal amino acid sequences and the apparent molecular weights of the osteoclastoma, hairy cell leukemia spleen TrACPs were identical, there were several differences in the physical and biochemical properties between the three isoenzymes. 4. Based on these findings, it is concluded that these isoenzymes are different enzymes, but that they could have originated from a similar ancestral gene. 5.

Growth capability was determined in vitro by colony assay in semisolid medium in the presence of interleukin 3 (IL-3) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The 18-mer antisense directed against the specific BCR/ABL mRNA breakpoint region diminished the colony formation by CML-CP and CML-BC cells, but not by NBMC. Scrambled oligomer did not affect significantly the growth of leukemic and normal cells. If CML-BC cells were mixed with NMBC and incubated with specific BCR/ABL antisense oligomer, leukemic colonies were selectively inhibited, as was shown by reverse, transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) performed to detect BCR/ABL mRNA in single colonies.
