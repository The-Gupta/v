Studies on the prevention of the cytotoxic effects of 5 X 10(-4) M 3-deaza-6-azaUrd showed that uridine or cytidine gave complete protection. 2'-Deoxycytidine also gave partial protection, but orotic acid or thymidine had no effect on the growth inhibition by 3-deaza-6-azaUrd. These results suggested that growth inhibition by 3-deaza-6-azaUrd might be due to interference in pyrimidine biosynthesis. Activation of 3-deaza-6-azaUrd to its 5'-phosphate derivative appeared to be catalyzed by uridine kinase. 3-Deaza-6-azaUrd was shown to complete with uridine for phosphorylation (Ki = 4.7 mM) and, therefore, to be a possible alternative substrate for uridine kinase from mouse kidney (Km for uridine = 82 microM). The enzyme was partially purified by streptomycin sulfate precipitation, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and gel filtration. This preparation was found to be free of pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase and uridine monophosphate kinase.","['R0-1 CA-20581/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R0-1 CA-26032/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The majority of TG cells were OKT3+, OKT8+, and OKT4-, 3A1-. These cells failed to express suppressor cell activity and displayed depressed levels of natural killer activity, but mediated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.

The stimulatory capacity of 8 of these CLL cells was reduced when a common DR antigen was shared with the normal responding cell. We suggest that cells from certain selected CLL patients may be used in the mixed-lymphocyte reaction for determining the D-locus specificity of normal donors. CLL cells when expressed 1 DR antigen only, induced more clearly defined typing responses than cells with 2 DR antigens. There was no correlation between the ability of a CLL cell to induce a typing response and the T-cell status of the patient.

Two variants were found that had decreased phospholipid methyltransferase enzyme levels and were unable to cause an influx of Ca2+ or release histamine in an IgE-mediated reaction. However, these cells were able to release histamine through an ionophore-induced reaction, indicating that the releasing mechanism distal to the Ca2+ channel was intact. One cell line, 1C1.B1, had low specific activity for phospholipid methyltransferase I. A second variant, 2H3.B6, had reduced phospholipid methyltransferase II activity. Although both variants were unable to incorporate label from [methyl-3H]methionine or [3H]serine into phosphatidylcholine, they were able to incorporate [methyl-3H]choline and myo-[2-3H(N)]inositol into phospholipids. Fusion of the two cell lines and isolation on selective media resulted in the growth of eight independent hybrids. All eight had an increased number of chromosomes and normal phospholipid methyltransferase activities. Stimulation of the hybrids with IgE resulted in CA2+ influx and histamine release. These results indicate that phospholipid methylation precedes and is necessary for Ca2+ influx, and they further support the hypothesis that methylation is a necessary early step in the IgE-mediated histamine release reaction in RBL cells.",['DE-05237/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States'],PMC349001,,,,,,,,

Two dose levels of Aza-CR were studied (0.1 and 0.5 mg/mouse), and cytotoxicity was measured by the spleen colony assay. For the combination of Aza-CR plus VCR, cytotoxicity was essentially additive or antagonistic when VCR preceded Aza-CR and additive or synergistic when VCR followed Aza-CR. When Aza-CR was combined simultaneously with either Ara-C or ADRIA, cytotoxicity was markedly antagonistic but was additive if drugs were given sequentially. When Ara-C was given as a 24-hour infusion before Aza-CR, the resultant cell kill was antagonistic (although slightly greater than that obtained for Ara-C alone). However, antagonism was even more marked when Aza-CR was given before the 24-hour infusion of Ara-C; cell kill was less than that observed with Ara-CR alone.

The killing of the neoplastic B cell lines was significantly less than that of K562, but significantly greater than that of the EBV-derived BLCLs of non-neoplastic origin. An additional finding was a similar NK susceptibility profile for the neoplastic, true histiocytic cell line U-937 (i.e., K562 greater than U937 greater than BLCLs). Furthermore, all cell lines, with the exception of the BLCLs, could effectively compete for the observed killing in cold target inhibition assays.

CHO cell colony formation was inhibited by 50% following either an 8.5-hr exposure of exponentially growing cells to 10 micrograms ICRF 159 per ml or a 24-hr exposure to 3 micrograms ICRF 159 per ml. This effect was cell cycle phase specific; early G1- and G2-phase cells were more sensitive than were late-G1- or early and mid-S-phase CHO cells. Stationary-phase CHO cells were unaffected by the drug at concentrations up to 500 micrograms/ml. Incubation of L1210 cells with 3 micrograms ICRF 159 per ml for 24 hr or with 10 micrograms ICRF 159 per ml for 6 hr inhibited cell growth by 50%. In contrast, 24-hr incubation of human lymphocytes with up to 50 micrograms ICRF 159 per ml had no effect on their viability or on their ability to be stimulated by phytohemagglutinin. Constant exposure of Friend leukemia, L1210, human neuroblastoma, and phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human lymphocytes to 10.0 to 50 micrograms ICRF 159 per ml resulted in inhibition of cell division which led to cell growth at higher ploidy levels. Thus, proliferating human cells of normal or tumor origin and murine leukemic cell lines all had a similar sensitivity to the drug. Detailed analysis of cell cycle progression in L1210 cells in the presence of the drug determined that cell progression through G1 phase (G1A to G1B transition) was slowed by approximately 50%. The rate of traverse of cells through S phase was also slowed. However, the most pronounced effect was the accumulation of cells in G2 phase occurring almost immediately after addition of the drug. The data suggest that the L isomer has a range of cytotoxicity and identical cytokinetic effects similar to that of the clinically tested racemate (+/-)-ICRF 159 (NSC 129943) and, therefore, that the more soluble L isomer may have increased clinical applicability.",['CA23296-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Ion-exchange chromatography of tissue extracts resolved six peaks of radioactivity believed to represent methotrexate and metabolites with up to five additional glutamyl residues. Polyglutamate formation in L1210 cells and small intestine was shown to be independent of dose at least to 400 mg/kg as long as intracellular levels of drug in excess of the dihydrofolate reductase-binding capacity (exchangeable) were maintained. Both the total amount of polyglutamates and the average length of the polyglutamyl chain increased with time as long as exchangeable level of drug was present intracellularly. The results also showed differences in the extent of metabolism of methotrexate polyglutamates among the tissues examined. Although these differences were at times very large, there was no consistent correlation between these differences and other pharmacological parameters or cytotoxicity. Tumor cells appeared to synthesize more polyglutamates than did the normal tissues examined. However, differences in total drug persistence and sensitivity to drug among tumor cells and among normal tissues did not reflect the relative extent of polyglutamate synthesis in each group. It is concluded that the extent of polyglutamate synthesis per se may not be a determinant of drug sensitivity in murine tissues. However, the accumulation of these metabolites may contribute in some way to overall therapeutic response or relative cytotoxicity.","['CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-09207/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-22764/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Both unique DNA and cDNA probes enriched in such sequences were reacted with a large excess of mouse or rat DNA. The extent of hybridization and the thermal stability of hybrids formed under various stringency conditions were used as a measure of the amount of sequence divergence which had taken place. The results confirmed that messenger sequences are relatively conserved during evolution. Furthermore, experiments involving both unique DNA probes representative of the full length of nucleus-confined RNA molecules and cDNA probes complementary to their poly(A)-adjacent fragments indicated that the polyadenylated nucleus-confined sequences have, on average, diverged during evolution much more than mRNA sequences.

The binding capacity of the membranes for folic acid was partially inhibited by reduced folate analogues. It is concluded that the liver plasma cell membrane and the membranes of myeloblasts in AML and circulating leukocytes in CGL contain a binding protein for folic acid which may be concerned in the transport of folates into these cells.",,,,,,,,,,

Progression from rapidly growing to stationary-phase cultures was accompanied by the marked reduction in accumulation of all snRNAs except the 4.5S snRNAs.

Similar reductions were noted when cells were induced to differentiate, except that decreases in the levels of U2 and 4.5S were more dramatic than those seen for cells entering stationary-phase.

The maximum level of resistance transfer cannot be enhanced with noninhibitory carrier RNA or facilitators of RNA uptake, and the maximum inhibition (40-60%) is independent of the MOI.

We observed the proliferation of poorly, partially, and well differentiated neoplastic cells with a predominance of immature cells of the granulocytic series and fewer cells of the erythroid and megakaryocytic cells lines. Disturbances of the lymph node architecture consisted of invasion by abnormal cells of the trabecular stroma, disrupting the reticulin mesh and extending toward the pericapsular area. In the lymph node a loose network of thin and thick fibers replaced the original framework. Generalized lymph node involvement at autopsy showed preservation of the architecture, both in cases with total replacement of the lymphoid population by abnormal cells and in cases with involvement by single cells or small groups of cells. Partial involvement occurred chiefly in the medullary zone, probably the result of hematogenous dissemination from the vascular plexus in medullary cords. Further abnormal cell development was linked to trabecular infiltration. The extensive involvement seen at autopsy took place by lymphatic dissemination. In lymph nodes studied at autopsy an abnormal immunoblastic reaction was observed. At first these abnormal cells were suspected of representing the myeloproliferative malignant disease, but the application of special staining techniques revealed their polyclonal cytoplasmic immunoglobulins. The chloroacetate esterase stain and the immunohistochemical stains for muramidase and hemoglobulin were especially useful in demonstrating that myeloproliferative diseases develop in the environment found in lymph nodes.",,,,,,,,,,

In the observations of some authors the factor VIII level is distinctly increased in the majority of acute leukemic cases, whereas the vitamin K-dependent blood coagulation factors show a low activity in some patients [6, 9]. It is not easy to interpret the different behaviour of the factor XI and XII level especially before antileukemic treatment. In 3/4 of all studied cases the factor XI activity was low, whereas the factor XII level was high in 1/4 of patients above the normal range.

In RAJI cells the HLA-A, -B, and -C antigen heavy chains become core-glycosylated in the endoplasmic reticulum as evidenced by their sensitivity to endo-H digestion and tunicamycin treatment. Beta2-Microglobulin is present in excess in the endoplasmic reticulum of the RAJI cells and associates with the heavy chain at the time of synthesis of the heavy chain. Pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that the RAJI HLA-A, -B, and -C antigen heavy chains become terminally glycosylated since their changed characteristics included resistance to endo-H digestion, sensitivity to neuraminidase treatment, and incorporation fucose. DAUDI HLA-A, -B, and -C antigen heavy chains are synthesized normally and become core-glycosylated but not terminally glycosylated. Other glycosylated cell surface proteins, like the HLA-DR antigens, display normal glycosylation in DAUDI cells. Therefore it is unlikely that the absence of terminally glycosylated HLA-A, -B, and -C antigen heavy chains is the result of a general defect in the biosynthetic machinery of DAUDI cells. However, DAUDI cells lack the ability to synthesize beta2-microglobulin, the common subunit of all HLA-A, -B, and -C antigens. Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that beta2-microglobulin is of importance for intracellular transport of newly synthesized HLA-A, -B, and -C antigens.",,,,,,,,,,

In this study the intracellular levels of folate and methotrexate were measured in the erythrocytes and liver of patients treated chronically with methotrexate. These tissues showed an accumulation of methotrexate as polyglutamates and a concomitant loss of folate. Folate concentrations were below normal in nine of 12 red cell and three of five liver samples.

The intermediate for N2 substitution was 2-deamino-2-chloroactinomycin D. For C-7 substitution, 7-hydroxyactinomycin D was used as the intermediate. Treatment of 2-deamino-2-chloroactinomycin D with an excess of the appropriate amine produced the N2-substituted derivatives. Condensation of the required alkyl or acyl halides with 7-hydroxyactinomycin D, aided by solid anhydrous potassium carbonate, yielded the C-7-substituted analogues. Calf thymus DNA-binding affinity was determined by equilibrium binding and also by thermal denaturation of DNA techniques, inhibitory activity of nucleic acid synthesis was examined using P388 cells in vitro, cytotoxicity measurements to tumor cells in vitro employed human lymphoblastic leukemic cells (CCRF-CEM), and antitumor activity was assayed against P388 mouse leukemia in CDF1 mice. Synthesis of a number of new analogues in each series and determination of the biophysical, biochemical, and biological properties established a more thorough structure-activity relationship in these analogues. These results establish that with the selection of omega-(n-alkylamino) groups at the N2 site or O-n-alkyl or O-acyl groups at the C-7 site a variety of modifications can be carried out on the actinomycin molecule while preserving biological activity. N2-3'-Amino-n-propyl- and N2-10'-amino-n-decylactinomycin D, 7-methoxy- and 7-ethoxyactinomycin D, and the 7-O-(1'-adamantoyl) ester of 7-hydroxyactinomycin D were found to be the most effective antitumor agents in vivo and in vitro.

Previous work has shown that these sequences are coded in the mouse genome, expressed in some normal cells and released as pseudotypic particles from cells producing murine C-type retroviruses. VL30 sequences have some similarities to standard retrovirus RNA, but differences also exist. To further assess the similarities and differences, several aspects of VL30-specific metabolism were investigated. We studied the initiation of VL30-specific DNA synthesis during an endogenous reverse transcriptase reaction. Short initial VL30-specific cDNA transcripts were covalently attached to RNA as measured by equilibrium banding in caesium sulphate density gradients. Therefore, reverse transcription of VL30-specific cDNA is initiated by an RNA primer. The intracellular synthesis of VL30 RNA was investigated by pulse labelling uninfected JLS-V9 cells with 3H-uridine. Hybridization of the pulse-labelled nuclear RNA indicated that the major VL30-specific RNA evident after a 15 min label was the same size as the mature VL30 RNA. Thus, VL30 RNA is apparently not synthesized via a higher mol. wt. precursor. Both of these results demonstrate similarity of VL30 RNA sequences to standard retroviruses. One unique feature of VL30 RNA was detected. JLS-V9 cells contained both the monomeric VL30 RNA and a hydrogen-bonded 38S form which yielded the monomer when denatured. This contrasts with standard murine leukaemia virus which is only found as a monomer within cells.","['1-CP-71008/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-14195/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA-15747/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

Intratumoral injection of MMC-D showed a superior effect on subcutaneously implanted B16 melanoma, while intravenous injection of MMC-D exhibited reduced activity against P388 and L1210 leukemia compared with MMC. Prior administration of MMC-D at 24 hr before tumor inoculation resulted in a significant increase of the life span of mice bearing L1210 leukemia, suggesting that it shows sustained pharmacological activity.

In contrast, interferon treatment of these same cells results in the inhibition of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMuLV) production. We have analyzed enzymatic pathways which are induced by interferon in these cells. After interferon treatment, the level of the (2'-5')oligoadenylate [(2'-5)An] synthetase activity and the phosphorylation of the 67000-dalton protein (P1) are enhanced in NIH 3T3 cells to approximately the same level as interferon-sensitive mouse L-cells. Moreover, NIH 3T3 and L-cells, contain approximately the same levels of enzymes which inactivate (2'-5')An. Both exogenously added (2'-5')A3 or double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) failed to inhibit protein synthesis in NIH 3T3 extracts even though they were potent inhibitors of L-cell extract-directed protein synthesis. Direct measurements of the (2'-5')An-dependent ribonuclease F (RNase F) failed to detect such activity in NIH 3T3 cells. Our results, therefore, suggest that the presence of RNase F activity is necessary for the interferon-induced antiviral activity against EMCV and against VSV. The induction of protein kinase activity by interferon treatment of NIH 3T3 cells appears to have no direct effect on EMCV and VSV replication.",,,,,,,,,,

Although some clones grow well in IL 2-containing CM alone, the combination of antigen, ""filler"" cells, and CM improves cloning efficiency and may favor the retention of stable clones expressing a ""normal"" phenotype. The antigen recognition repertoire of T cells appears to be much larger than was predicted using conventional approaches. CTLs can react with at least 23 different determinants on the H-2Kb molecule of the MHC. CTLs demonstrate MHC-restricted recognition of viral and haptenic determinants, but the restriction is not strict for all cloned cells, and a variety of reactivity patterns are found. Antigen-responsive cloned T cells appear to recognize antigens in association with alloantigens encoded by the I-A region of the MHC. However, the relevant structures formed in hybrid animals include all possible combinations of peptides including those formed by trans-complementation of I-A and I-E region gene products. Culture supernatants from antigen-responsive cloned T cells contain a variety of biological activities including IL 2, B cell-stimulating factor, colony-stimulating factor, migration inhibition factor, interferon, and factors that modulate expression of Ia antigens on macrophages and influence production of complement components. These factors may be important in mediating interactions between T lymphocytes and other cells. Cloned T cells have proved to be useful for studying the importance of particular phenotypic characteristics associated with given immunological functions. Although expression of Lyt-2 generally correlates with cytolytic activity and Lyt-1 with helper activity, important exceptions have been found with T cell clones.

The maximum titer (1,280 U) was obtained at 24 hr after inoculation. This induced IFN had the characteristics of type I IFN, i.e., stability at pH2 and lability at 56 C. An increase in natural killer cell (NK) activity was also observed for the first 3 days after inoculation. In addition, plasma lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was elevated in these mice. Inoculation of ascitic fluid or serum of EAC-bearing mice into normal mice increased plasma LDH activity six- to sevenfold over normal levels and elevated activities persisted throughout the life of the mice. These results suggest that the LDH-elevating agent was responsible for IFN induction and for enhancing NK activity. Because lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) can be eliminated from tumor cells by passage in vitro, we attempted to grow EAC in tissue culture for several months and re-examined whether the inoculation of such cells could elevate plasma LDH activity induce IFN and enhance NK activity. The results showed that inoculation of the passaged cells had no effect on these activities in normal mice. Therefore, we concluded that the IFN inducer was LDV which contaminated the EAC and then enhanced the NK activity. N-tropic murine leukemia virus also contaminated EAC, but this virus was not responsible because cultured cells of EAC still shed this virus.",,,,,,,,,,

Formal proof that the augmenting agent was IFN was obtained by using pure IFN proteins in combination with both mock-IFN preparations, which showed no enhancing activity, and anti-IFN antisera, which inhibited the action of the completely purified IFN proteins.

IgE-mediated histamine release from rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3 cells) was inhibited by 3-deazaadenosine (DZA) in the presence of L-homocysteine thiolactone (Hcy) or the combination of adenosine, erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl) adenine (EHNA), and Hcy in a dose-dependent fashion. There were no significant changes in the cellular cAMP levels by these inhibitors. Histamine release induced by anti-IgE or dextran from normal rat mast cells was also blocked by DZA plus Hcy in a dose-dependent manner. DZA at 10(-3) M in the presence of 10(-4) M Hcy or the combination of 10(-3) M adenosine, 10(-4) M EHNA, and 10(-3) M Hcy inhibited lipid (perhaps phospholipid) methylation into RBL-2H3 cells without affecting choline incorporation. In the presence of 10(-3) M DZA plus 10(-4) M Hcy there was a 170-fold increase in [35S]AdoHcy with the concomitant appearance of 3-deaza-AdoHcy when the cells were incubated with [35S]methionine, thus indicating that these drugs inhibited methylation reaction(s) through the intracellular accumulation of AdoHcy and 3-deaza-AdoHcy. In contrast, histamine release from rat mast cells induced by the calcium ionophore A23187, compound 48/80, polymyxin B, or ATP was not inhibited by these compounds. These results suggest that IgE- or dextran-mediated histamine release involves methylation reactions(s), whereas the other secretagogues bypass this early step.",,,,,,,,,,

Female mice, 4 to 5 weeks old, were infected with R-MuLV and treated with interferon every 24 h starting 6 h after virus inoculation. Under these conditions injection of 3-5 X 10(4) units of interferon caused a partial inhibition of the leukemia process. Daily application of 3 X 10(5) units completely or almost completely inhibited the erythroleukemia. After 14 days of treatment with these high doses of interferon, spleen weights of interferon-treated infected mice were comparable to those of uninfected animals which received only interferon. Also, no Rauscher cells in spleens and livers of R-MuLV-infected interferon-treated infected animals could be demonstrated and the spleen structure was well preserved in these mice. In interferon-treated infected animals no virus could be detected in the serum as judged from the absence of reverse transcriptase activity in the serum. Moreover, no virus-infected cells could be demonstrated in spleen or liver as deduced from negative immunofluorescence data using anti-p30 and anti-gp70 sera. No virions budding from spleen cell membranes were seen by electron microscopic studies. However, when interferon treatment was stopped the leukemic process was reactivated and all the mice died. In control experiments interferon caused an inhibition of red blood cell formation and a 50 to 100% enlargement of the spleen. Pharmacokinetic data showed that, after intraperitoneal inoculation, maximum amounts of interferon were present in the peripheral blood after 1-2 h. After 12-24 h almost all interferon activity had disappeared from the blood.",,,,,,,,,,

They showed that thymocytes from mice with sarcomas were suppressive in both systems, and that suppression was independent of whether or not the sarcomas expressed MuLV antigen gp70. Furthermore, normal thymocytes, when combined with mitomycin-C-treated cells from any of several different MCA-induced sarcomas, suppressed the in vitro generation of a secondary cytolytic response to LSTRA.

The two populations are distinguishable by the anti-H-2.28 serum, k/r anti-h2, which is directed, in part, against the H-2.28 family of public determinants encoded by the D end of the b haplotype. Sequential precipitates of lentil-lectin-purified glycoprotein extracts metabolically labeled with radioactive amino acids reveal that approximately one-quarter to one-third of the H-2Dd antigens, designated H-2Dd (b28+), react with this antiserum, whereas two-thirds to three-quarters, designated H-2Dd (b28-), do not. Paired-label tryptic peptide maps in this and a previous study indicate that H-2Dd (b28+) and H-2Dd (b28-) are closely related structurally and are more likely to represent modified forms of the same gene product rather than products of different genes, although the existence of closely related genetic loci is not rigorously excluded. Together, H-2Dd (b28+) and H-2Dd (b28-) have a radioactivity level seven times higher than H-2Ld, which also reacts with the anti-H-2.28 serum but which lacks the H-2.4 determinant. As yet unresolved, however, is the question of whether the observed quantitative differences between these three antigens reflect actual molar differences at the cellular level, or whether the variation is the result of metabolic or compositional factors. In any case, a complex serological and structural relationship is found to exist between antigens encoded by the D/L end of the MHC.",,,,,,,,,,

Using these probes in conjunction with the fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) the pattern and sequence of cell surface antigenic expression on haemopoietic progenitor cells have been mapped. A cell is identified in bone marrow which has a unique membrane phenotype and the nuclear enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Its composite phenotype is identical to that seen in the common variant of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). It is suggested that this cell is a putative B lineage progenitor which provides the major target for ALL. Detailed analysis of erythroid differentiation with monoclonal antibodies on the FACS reveals an intriguing pattern of antigenic expression in which HLA-DR, glycophorin and band III appear in sequence.

In contrast, the intracellular steady-state concentration of virus-specific RNA of both MMTV and MuLV was not significantly affected in these cells. This was the case regardless of whether total cellular RNA or polysomal poly(A)-containing RNA was examined. These results are consistent with the suggestion that interferon-caused inhibition is related to a host-mediated effect on a post-transcriptional step in virus synthesis.",,,,,,,,,,

Indirect membrane immunofluorescence showed that the absorbed serum, which had lost the capacity to bind P3HR-1 cells, nevertheless gave bright staining on a small proportion of B95-8 cells. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis of 125I-labelled MA polypeptides showed that the absorbed serum was able to isolate MA polypeptides from both B95-7 and QIMR-WIL cells, but not from P3HR-2 cells.

In the presence of Mn2+ the endonucleolytic activity was stimulated about 3-fold by the addition of ATP. The earlier identified Mr = 40,000 Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV)-associated endonuclease which functions in the presence of both Mg2+ and Mn2+ has also been shown to be similarly stimulated by ATP. For both endonuclease activities stimulation was only observed at ATP concentrations above 0.5 mM, and it did not increase upon elevating the ATP concentration above 2.5 mM. ADP and dATP also stimulated both activities, although not to the same extent as ATP. GTP had no apparent effect and AMP seemed to inhibit both activities. The effect ATP analogs had on the F-MuLV associated endonuclease activity could suggest that the endonuclease reaction in the presence of ATP might involve the cleavage of beta-gamma phosphate bonds in ATP. Neither adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate nor (beta, gamma-methylene)adenosine 5'-triphosphate stimulated the activity, whereas significant stimulation was observed in the presence of (alpha, beta-methylene)adenosine 5'-triphosphate. Although no ATPase activity could be detected in the purified F-MuLV endonuclease preparation, the data do not exclude the possibility that ATP may be cleaved in amounts which are equivalent to the number of nicks introduced into DNA by the virus-associated endonuclease. In the presence of ATP and Mg2+ the F-MuLV-associated endonuclease nicked both supercoiled and linear DNA duplexes extensively, although the former was nicked more readily than the latter. Single-stranded DNA functioned poorly as a substrate. The nicks introduced by the enzyme contained a 5'-phosphoryl terminus and a 3'-hydroxyl group.",,,,,,,,,,

A number of clones released virus which reproduced the entire range of effects typical of the FLY-P complex. However, in other clones, there appeared to be no correlation between the assays for leukemogenicity and the assays for either ecotropic virus, reverse transcriptase activity, or virus antigens.

It was found that cell lines started from tumors at different times vary in both their chromosome number and their ability to release histamine by an IgE-mediated reaction. RBL-I and III have approximately 44 chromosomes and did not respond to an IgE-mediated reaction. RBL-II and RBL-IV have 68-73 chromosomes and showed moderate levels of histamine release (percent release mean = 5 +/- 2 and 10 +/- 4, respectively). The cloning of the RBL-IV line resulted in some sublines which were excellent histamine releasers (range 39-100%) and some which were relatively refractory (less than 10%) to IgE-mediated histamine release. These clones did not differ significantly in chromosome number. Recloning the releasing lines gave rise to poor releasers, whereas the recloning of poor releasers did not produce good releasers indicating that the mutational drift in culture is toward loss of histamine-releasing capacity. The number of IgE receptors and the rate of IgE association and dissociation were similar for the different cell lines. The study failed to disclose significant molecular weight differences in the IgE receptor from the various clones and sublines indicating that the failure to release probably does not reside in the receptor. The various cloned sublines are phenotypically stable, and the isolation of excellent histamine-releasing sublines are useful for studies of the complex phenomenon of the histamine release.",,,,,,,,,,

Cell cycle progression and the effect of the drug on various transition points in the cell cycle (i.e. G1 to S phase, through a window in early S phase and G2 phase to mitosis) were monitored by flow cytometry. Formation of Chinese hamster ovary cell colonies was inhibited by 50% following 24 hr of exposure to 0.05 micrograms ACM per ml whereas 1 hr of exposure to 1.0 micrograms ACM per ml reduced colony formation by only 30%. Stationary cultures required a drug concentration more than 5 times higher to reduce colony formation by an equivalent amount when present for 24 hr. Short-term (1-hr) exposure to drug concentrations up to 1.0 micrograms/ml had no effect on colony formation of stationary-phase Chinese hamster ovary cells. Cell growth was inhibited by 50% in suspension cultures of Friend leukemia and L1210 cells when exposed for 24 hr to 0.024 and 0.053 micrograms ACM per ml, respectively. Continuous drug exposure of Friend leukemia and L1210 cells to ACM concentrations of 0.05 to 0.1 micrograms/ml led to a slow down in cell progression manifested as an accumulation of cells in G2 + M phase by 24-hr and then in G1 phase by 48-hr culture. However, brief (1-hr) exposure of L1210 cells to 0.5 micrograms/ml resulted in an irreversible accumulation of cells in G2 + M phase. A more detailed examination of drug effects on the cell cycle determined that 0.1 micrograms ACM per ml resulted in a slow down in L1210 cells leaving G1 phase and entering mitosis and an accumulation of cells in G2 phase, although early S-phase cells appeared unaffected. At a 5 times higher drug concentration, exit of cells from G1 was almost completely halted, passage of cells through early S was slowed, and the entrance of cells into mitosis plateaued 3.5 hr after addition of the drug; G2-phase cells were only mildly affected. The RNA content of all cells examined was reduced by 35 to 50% depending upon dose and time of exposure.

The antitumor effect of HFIF produced at RPMI as assessed by intralesional injection of various metastatic nodules resulted in an overall 71% local response. Phase I studies in 13 patients demonstrated that HFIF can be administered safely by the subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous routes in doses up to 25 million units per day without any serious untoward effects. Intrathecal administration of HFIF into patients with CNS leukemia was also well tolerated. Pharmacokinetic studies indicated significant levels of HFIF in serum and cerebrospinal fluid after intravenous and intrathecal administration, respectively.

Increasing doses of DHAzaCR above 1 mg per mouse enhanced cytotoxicity to LCFU but not to NCFU. The NCFU dose-survival curve showed a plateau with DHAzaCR, such that increasing the dose from 1 to 80 mg per mouse produced no further decrease in NCFU survival. In contrast, AzaCR produced a biphasic dose-NCFU survival curve without a plateau. Although DHAzaCR produced less cytotoxicity on a milligram basis than did AzaCR, both DHAzaCR and AzaCR elicited a biphasic dose-survival curve for LCFU. An infusion of DHAzaCR was less cytotoxic than was a similar dose of DHAzaCR administered as an iv bolus. Although high doses of AzaCR administered as an iv bolus. Although high doses of AzaCR delayed LCFU repopulation, both low and high doses of DHAzaCR were associated with prompt LCFU repopulation. Confirming this prompt repopulation of LCFU, there was a good correlation between the increase in life-span of mice with leukemia predicted by LCFU data following DHAzaCR treatment, compared to the discrepancy between predicted survival and observed survival following AzaCR. Therefore, the kinetics of cytotoxicity of DHAzaCR differ from those of AzaCR.","['CA13053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA24960/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CM43731/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, the unblocking factors of regressor serum were also strain related: No unblocking of allogeneic progressor serum was observed. There was no requirement for H-2 compatibility between leukocytes and tumor cells from which the LAI-inducing antigen was obtained. Absorption of CBA blocking serum with anti-I-Jk antiserum (and with anti-Ik containing this antibody specificity) removed blocking activity; absorption of regressor serum did not reduce its unblocking activity. These observations indicated that certain blocking factors resembled other suppressor factors in possessing antigenic determinants coded by the I-J subregion of the major histocompatibility complex.

In general, the effectiveness of the agent--within the usual range of concentration for induction--both for hemoglobin and for virus synthesis, was in the order HMBA greater than DMSO greater than SB. Reverse transcriptase activity was, however, more easily induced than hemoglobin synthesis in that stimulation was seen at lower concentrations of the same inducing agent. This clonal analysis confirmed that virus and hemoglobin production are regulated independently in these erythroleukemic cells chronically infected with FLV-P.","['CA 10,000/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13,047/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

It was not extractable with chloroform, was heat-stable (65 degrees C, 30 min), pronase-sensitive and had a molecular weight less than or equal to 5000 daltons as determined by high performance liquid chromatography. Thus, it appears to be a small, acid-soluble, heat-stable peptide. It had no interferon activity. It was not present or present only at very low levels in normal plasma. Furthermore, it was not elevated in chicks infected only with the nonleukemogenic helper virus of AMV, and was, therefore, associated with leukemia rather than virus-replication. Leukemic myeloblasts, purified by passage in suspension culture, released the inhibitor. It acted directly on the colony-forming cell and inhibited normal cells much more than leukemic cells. In normal marrow, macrophage and granulocyte progenitors were affected. A similar inhibitor in normal plasma inhibited only granulocyte progenitors.","['CA-12197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-19275/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

During the development of leukaemia in AKR as well as in (C57BL x CBA) F1 mice the capacity to react upon injection of polyanions with leukocyte mobilization gradually decreased.

One-thousand units of HIF did not decrease the number of antibody-forming normal cells, and up to 500 units of HIF did not inhibit the total Ig secreted by these cells.

When put in culture, a lymphoblastic cell line (NIXT) expressed neither particles nor infectious virus but supported the growth of pure ecotropic murine leukemia viruses (MuLVs) without generating any envelope recombinant (RM) MuLV in more than 20 months of culture. These cells did not support the growth of RM-MuLVs and completely excluded the entry of all RM-MuLV pseudotypes of murine sarcoma virus, suggesting specific viral interference. Radioimmunocompetition and immunofluorescence assays with broadly reactive anti-MuLV-p30 and -gp70 antisera were negative. However, in immunofluorescence with antisera specifically reactive against RM-MuLV gp70, about 5-20% of the population of parental cells or their clones were positive. NIXT cells treated with this antiserum bound protein A and exhibited complement-dependent cytotoxicity as assessed by several assays. NIXT cells could partially absorb neutralizing antibody specific for RM-MuLVs. Based on radioimmunoprecipitation tests, NIXT cells bore, on the cell surface, a glycosylated protein (gp70) reactive with RM subgroup as well as some group-specific anti-gp70 antisera. The glycoprotein was also found free in the supernates of NIXT cells. Using affinity chromatography, we determined the peptide pattern of the gp70 from NIXT cells to determine its structural relationship to gp70s of other MuLVs. NIXT gp70 was found to be highly related to class III endogenous xenotropic gp70s but, in addition, had peptide characteristics of RM-gp70s. Apparently, NIXT cells code for an unusual gp70 protein in the absence of other MuLV expression. The possible role of this glycoprotein in leukemogenesis is discussed.",,PMC319247,,,,,,,,

Although low amounts of p30 could be found in both tissues within the first week of life, the overall increase in the amount of p30 within each tissue followed much the same course as that shown by RT. In addition, a protein complex consisting of p30 and RT was first found in thymus and spleen lymphocytes of 15 and 20 week-old animals, respectively. The complex increased in amount in both organs as the animals aged, reaching a maximum level in 30 week-old mice.

Analysis of the virion proteins by gel electrophoresis demonstrated that the pr65 gag precursor was incorporated into the 7C virus and that the processing of this precursor was severely diminished. Polymerase proteins pr180gag-pol and pr120pol were also detected in virions, and a third possible polymerase protein, p70, was reduced in size compared to its normal counterpart, p80.

Carbohydrate, although contributing approximately 20 to 25% of the m.w., appears not to be involved in the antigenic site of the ALL antigen as judged by precipitation of a molecule after tunicamycin treatment of cells or glycosidase digestion. Charge shift electrophoresis and labeling with the lipophilic nitrene reagent hexanoyl diiodo-N-(4-azido-2-nitrophenyl)-tyramine suggests that the cALL antigen is probably not an integral membrane protein; however, it remains tightly bound to the plasma membrane after subcellular fractionation. A glycoprotein of the same m.w. has been detected by immunoprecipitation on bone marrow cells of nonleukemic patients. serologic studies indicate that the cALL-associated antigen is found on the terminal transferase-positive lymphoid cells, and it therefore seems likely that the gp100 molecule is a normal gene products of lymphocyte precursors.",,,,,,,,,,

Two-parameter flow cytometric analysis of DNA and RNA showed these cells to be unbalanced with excessive RNA relative to DNA content. Fifty % of cells remained viable after a 96-hr exposure to 2 x 10(-8) M MTX. In contrast, 10(-4) M MTX inhibited cell cycle progression of cells in both G1 and S phases and also prevented the development of unbalanced growth. In this instance, cell viability was reduced to 10% after 96 hr of drug exposure. The relative contribution of inhibition of thymidylate and purine biosynthesis to MTX cytotoxicity was investigated by addition of exogenous thymidine (10(-5) M) or hypoxanthine (10(-4) M). Thymidine reduced the cytotoxicity and inhibition of DNA synthesis caused by both doses of MTX and prevented classical unbalanced growth with 2 x 10(-8) m MTX; treatment with 10(-4) M MTX resulted in a form of unbalanced growth where cells had a relative excess of DNA compared with RNA content. The addition of hypoxanthine enhanced the classical unbalanced growth pattern seen with 2 x 10(-8) M MTX but was accompanied by a partial reduction of both the MTX-induced cytotoxicity and the inhibition of DNA synthesis (to an extent similar to that seen with exogenous thymidine). Potentiation of cell killing was observed with the addition of hypoxanthine to cells treated with 10(-4) M MTX. Complete rescue from MTX cytotoxicity at both concentrations was found only when both thymidine and hypoxanthine were present. These finding suggest that MTX cytotoxicity is associated with inhibition of DNA synthesis resulting from the disturbance of both thymidylate and purine biosynthesis.",,,,,,,,,,

In a genetic analysis these strains were hybridized and IF production was determined in spleen-cell cultures from F1 and F2 generations, and from backcrosses of F1 hybrids to parent strains. The results indicate that, in parent strains, a single dominant autosomal gene is responsible for differences in IF production in spleen cultures. LPS-induced IF in spleen-cell cultures resists pH 2 for as long as 48 h, but is labile to heating at 56 degrees C for 30 min.

Here minute cytomorphological criteria acquire a new validity by their significance in the microscopic cut preparation and in the electron-microscope as well as by their correlation to cell-immunological parameters.

Incorporation of 5-azacytidine into RNA increased 85% following 3-deazauridine pretreatment, but 5-azacytidine incorporation into DNA did not change significantly. In cells pretreated with 3-deazauridine, there was an 80% reduction of intracellular cytidine triphosphate, the natural feedback inhibitor of uridine-cytidine kinase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the phosphorylation of 5-azacytidine. Intracellular levels of 5-azacytidine triphosphate, the presumed lethal metabolite of 5-azacytidine, increased from 28.8 pmol/10(6) cells in control cells to 56.4 pmol/10(6) cells following 3-deazauridine treatment. The sequence of 3-deazauridine followed by 5-azacytidine demonstrated synergistic cell killing when measured by an in vitro soft-agar cloning assay. Similar biochemical alterations were also seen in human leukemic myeloblasts. It appears that 3-deazauridine-induced alterations in 5-azacytidine metabolism may account for the enhanced cytotoxicity of this drug sequence.","['CA 09200/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 24187/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Therefore, a study was designed to determine the distribution and the therapeutic effect of a bleomycin emulsion and aqueous bleomycin after different routes of application. The tissue distribution of radioactively labelled bleomycin emulsion and aqueous bleomycin was determined in tumor-free CF 1 and tumor-bearing (EL 4, L 1210) C 57 Bl 6 and DBA 2 mice after local (s.c., i.t.) and systemic (i.v.) injection. The distribution studies for aqueous 57Co-bleomycin showed increased activity in the injection sites and the lymph nodes draining the injection sites after s.c. and i.t. injection compared to i.v. administration of the drug. In comparison to the aqueous local administration, the application of 57Co-bleomycin emulsion resulted in a disproportional increase of the 57Co-bleomycin concentration at the injection sites and in the draining lymph nodes. To prove the therapeutic relevance of the bleomycin tissue distribution tumor-bearing (line 10) strain 2 guinea pigs were treated with different modes of bleomycin. Animals with already lymphogenously metastasized tumors have been cured by means of low i.t. doses of the bleomycin emulsion. Guinea pigs treated with i.t. administration of aqueous bleomycin need, compared to the bleomycin emulsion, five times higher doses for tumor-free survival. Intravenously treated animals died either because of progressive tumor growth or because of toxic bleomycin effects. These findings made by animal experiments favor the i.t. treatment of head and neck carcinomas with a bleomycin emulsion.",,,,,,,,,,

Although there is general agreement that IF can boost the activity of human NK cells, two laboratories have reported a failure to boost ADCC. We have therefore examined in more detail the effects of IF on human ADCC. We have found, by several lines of evidence, that IF can indeed appreciably augment the activity of K cells, the subpopulation of lymphocytes that mediate ADCC: (1) human leucocyte IF, purified to homogeneity, boosted ADCC: (2) IF augmented ADCC against target cells that were completely resistant to NK activity; and (3) the ADCC activity of leukaemic cells from a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) which lacked any detectable NK activity was boosted by IF. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that human NK and K cells are the same subpopulation of lymphocytes and that the mechanisms regulating their activity are similar. However, the absence of NK activity in the CLL patient strongly supports the idea that not all FcR-positive cells are NK and that ADCC effectors devoid of NK may exist. However, further evidence is required to analyse this point.",,,,,,,,,,

Incubation of normal BALB/c spleen cells with this I-RNA (but not with normal RNA) resulted in leukocyte migration inhibition reactions (LMIR) against AKR extracts but not against purified protein derivative or BALB/c sarcoma extracts. This transfer was abolished by pretreating I-RNA with RNAse but not with pronase. The active fraction of I-RNA was retained by and could be eluted from Poly-U Sepharose columns. Normal cells pretreated with I-RNA also reacted in the presence of an anti-idiotypic anti-serum of anti-(BALB/c anti-AKR) specificity. Pretreatment of cells with anti-idiotypic serum plus complement did not inhibit the subsequent transfer of LMIR with I-RNA. Idiotypic receptors were expressed on I-RNA treated cells less than one hour after I-RNA treatment. Using an I-RNA of double specificity, the results suggested that I-RNA entered into and acted on the cells through a nonspecific mechanism. Finally, I-RNA could induce BALB/c anti-AKR idiotypic markers in C57Bl/6 cells, genetically committed for different idiotypes, while RNA extracted from C57Bl/6 immune cells could not induce in BALB/c cells their own genetically acquired idiotypes. This series of data would prove that I-RNA acting as a mRNA is able to induce in normal noncommitted cells the de novo synthesis of antigen receptors similar or identical to those present in the surface of in vivo immunized lymphoid cells of the same strain.",,,,,,,,,,

This enhancement of FUra accumulation was maximum (5-fold increase) after a 6-h exposure to 100 microM methotrexate. The nucleotide derivatives of FUra, including a 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridylate, and 5-fluorouridine-5'-triphosphate were also increased nearly 5-fold following methotrexate treatment. In cells pretreated with methotrexate, there was an increase in intracellular 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate pools which ranged from 2 to 8 times control values following concentrations of methotrexate between 0.1 microM and 10 microM. Both the increase in 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate and FUra accumulation could be prevented by the addition of Leucovorin (N5-formyltetrahydrofolate) at concentrations which rescued cells from the inhibitory effects of methotrexate. Pretreatment with 6-methylmercaptopurine riboside, which inhibits amidophosphoribosyltransferase, the first committed step in de novo purine synthesis, also resulted in a similar elevation in 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate pools and enhancement of FUra accumulation. If the 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate pools were reduced following methotrexate pretreatment by the addition to the cultures of hypoxanthine, which utilizes 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate for the conversion to IMP, the intracellular accumulation of FUra was not enhanced. Also, if the inhibitor of 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate synthetase, 7-deazaadenosine, was given to cultures with methotrexate, there was no increase in 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate pools, nor enhancement of FUra accumulation. In addition, when 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine was added with the methotrexate to cell cultures, there was no increase in 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate pools, nor enhancement of intracellular FUra accumulation. These results indicate that the ability of methotrexate to enhance FUra accumulation was probably the consequence of the antipurine effect of methotrexate which resulted in a reduction of the complex feedback inhibition on 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate synthesis and utilization. The resultant increased 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate pools were then capable of being utilized for the conversion of FUra to 5-fluorouridylate, the possible rate-limiting step in FUra intracellular metabolism and the major determinant of the rate of intracellular FUra accumulation. When methotrexate preceded FUra, there was synergistic cell killing as determined by soft agar cloning. The exact mechanism of this sequential synergistic antitumor activity may be the result of the enhanced incorporation of FUra into RNA, since the increased 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridylate which is formed is unlikely to increase substantially the inhibition of dTMP synthesis induced by methotrexate pretreatment.","['CA 09200-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 27130/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA24187-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

This inhibitory activity has no influence on cells which generate CFUc in suspension culture or on the erythroid colony forming (CFUe) and burst forming (BFUe) units.

Based on differences in RNA content, two distinct subcompartments, G1A and G1B, were recognized in the G1 phase of exponentially growing cells. After mitosis, cells reside in the low-RNA, G1A compartment from which they cannot enter the S phase directly. An increase in RNA above a critical level is required for G1 cells to be able to initiate DNA replication; G1 cells with RNA values above this level are classified as G1B. Cell transition from G1A to G1B and from G1B to S was analyzed in a stathmokinetic experiment on L1210 cells with a doubling time of 10 hr. The half-time of cell residence in the indeterminate state of G1 was found to be 1 hr, and the duration of the deterministic portion of G1 phase was 2 hr. The indeterminate state, although not identical with G1A, is most likely located in G1A. Cell quiescence induced by serum deprivation (3T3 cells) or by addition of n-butyrate (L1210) results in cell arrest at a state which, judged by RNA content, is similar to that of G1A of exponentially growing cells. The exit from this state, however, is much slower after stimulation of these blocked cells than the transition of G1A to G1B in cells growing exponentially. Thymidine or hydroxyurea arrest cells in G1B or perhaps at the border between G1B and S. Prolonged incubation of 3T3 cells to confluence results in a marked loss of cellular RNA below the level of the G1A state. This deep quiescent state (G1Q) is distinctly different from the G1A state of cycling cells or cells blocked in G1A by serum deprivation.",,PMC350355,,,,,,,,

Thus, anti-Ia sera stain a proportion of myeloblasts in normal bone marrow, inhibit myeloid progenitor (CFU-GM) colony formation in the presence of complement and can be used to label and separate CFU-GM on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS). Winchester et al. subsequently reported that erythroid progenitors (BFU-E and CFU-E) were also inhibited or killed by anti-Ia (p28,37) and complement. These observations raised the possibility that HLA-DR (or presumptive I-region equivalent) products might have a regulatory role in early haematopoiesis. We have now analysed HLA-DR and HLA-ABC antigen expression on normal erythroid progenitors using monoclonal antibodies to non-polymorphic determinants and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. In parallel experiments, we tested a monoclonal antibody to glycophorin, a well defined erythroid-specific cell-surface membrane glycoprotein. We report that HLA-DR, HLA-ABC and glycophorin are all expressed at various stages during erythroid differentiation.",,,,,,,,,,

Exposure of P388 and L1210 cells to 3 mM PALA for 3 hr before adding 5-aza-Cyd at 75 microM was accompanied by a two-fold increment in acid-soluble and 3-fold increment in acid-insoluble incorporation of 5-aza-Cyd in both cell lines. RNA incorporation of 5-aza-Cyd increased from 97.5 +/- 3.4 pmol 5-aza-Cyd per microgram D-ribose in control cells to 299.2 +/- 4.2 pmol 5-aza-Cyd per microgram D-ribose in PALA-treated cells; a smaller increment in DNA incorporation of 5-aza-Cyd was also noted. Sequential treatment of cells with PALA and 5-aza-Cyd was associated with a 40% reduction in protein synthesis compared to only a 2 and 8% reduction, respectively, produced by the drugs given alone. Sequential administration of PALA and 5-aza-Cyd resulted in greater than additive cytotoxicity as measured by both growth inhibition and in vitro soft-agar cloning assays. Exposure of both cell lines to 3 mM PALA for 3 hr produced 50 and 65% reductions in intracellular levels of cytidine triphosphate and uridine triphosphate; intracellular accumulation of 5-azacytidine triphosphate, the lethal metabolite of 5-aza-Cyd, increased from 43.4 +/- 2.1 pmol/10(6) cells to 92.4 +/- 3.3 pmol/10(6) cells in PALA-treated cells. PALA was able to augment the metabolism and cytotoxicity of 5-aza-Cyd in a uridine-cytidine kinase-mutant 5-aza-Cyd-resistant L5178Y subline. This sequential drug combination has a rational biochemical basis and may offer significant advantages over either drug when administered alone, especially in cells which are resistant to 5-aza-Cyd.","['CA-24187/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-27130/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Both preculture of nonsensitized lymphocytes prior to the treatment with immune RNA and additional culture of lymphocytes after 1-hr treatment with immune RNA enhance the growth-inhibitory activity of immune RNA-treated lymphocytes. Preculture for 5 hr and additional culture for 24 hr are sufficient for maximal enhancement of the growth-inhibitory activity. There is no significant difference in inhibition between lymphocytes treated with immune RNA for 1 hr and 24 hr. The growth inhibition by lymphocytes is augmented proportionally to the increase in the dose of immune RNA in vitro but not in vivo. In mice given i.p. injections of immune RNA-treated syngeneic spleen cells (before or after inoculation with L1210 cells), a significant prolongation of the mean survival time [27.0 +/- 5.4 (S.D.) days, 0.05 < p < 0.1] was not achieved when compared with control mice (21.4 +/- 1.6 days). Evidence is presented that suppressor cells in the spleens of L1210-bearing mice are involved in preventing effector cell function in vivo. The present study revealed that 8 X 10(3) and 5 X 10(5) suppressor cells were sufficient to inhibit completely the activity of immune RNA-treated effector cells in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Suppressive activity was abolished by treatment with anti-Thy 1.2 serum and complement and partially abolished with irradiation (1500 R). The suppressor cells belonged to a radiation-sensitive T-cell population. The limited activity of immune RNA in vivo is probably due to the destruction of immune RNA by RNase present in the host plasma and tissues and the acquisition of suppressor cells which inhibits nonadherent peritoneal exudate cell activity in the animal.",,,,,,,,,,

The effect of human fibroblast, lymphoid, and myeloid interferons on inhibition of colony formation was assessed. The effect of interferon on colony formation formed a continuum from complete inhibition to stimulation of growth. Of 40 evaluable tumor specimens, 18 showed at least a 70% inhibition of colony formation in the presence of interferon, at concentrations of 1000 units/ml or less. Four specimens (acute myelogenous leukemia, osteogenic sarcoma, neuroblastoma, ovarian carcinoma) showed at least 3-fold stimulation of colony formation with interferon. Two of 12 normal bone marrow specimens grown with colony-stimulating, factor-conditioned media showed greater than 70% colony inhibition with interferon. A dose-response relationship was seen in all tumor specimens tested. While fibroblast interferon was the most active in this system, all interferons showed the same magnitude and direction of activity. Continuous exposure and 1-hr incubation of tumor cells with interferon were identical in terms of colony inhibition. These data support the ability of this assay system to select tumors responsive in vitro to interferon, suggest the optimal species and concentration for inhibition or stimulation of growth, and support a direct role of interferon in the regulation of cell growth independent of other immunoregulatory actions of interferon. Such information may prove useful for predicting response in vivo to interferon in Phase II trials.",,,,,,,,,,

A 1.4-log (25-fold) increase in the inhibition of soft agar colony formation was observed when MTX preceded 5-fluorouracil as compared to the reverse sequence. L1210 cells converted 39% of the total intracellular MTX into MTX poly(gamma-glutamate)s within 4 hr of exposure to 1 microM MTX. MTX and MTX(gamma-glutamate) formed reversible ternary complexes with FdUMP on one site of thymidylate synthase, whereas with 7,8-dihydropteroylpentaglutamate and I-5,10-methylenetetrahydropteroylpentaglutamate stoichiometric binding of FdUMP to two sites on thymidylate synthase was observed. The dissociation constants for FdUMP in the ternary complexes formed in the presence of MTX, MTX(gamma-glutamate), 7,8-dihydropteroylpentaglutamate, and I-5-10-methylenetetrahydropteroylpentaglutamate were estimated to be 370, 27, < 10, and < 10 nM, respectively, by equilibrium dialysis. We propose that the sequence-dependent effect of MTX plus 5-fluorouracil on L1210 cell viability results from MTX and MTX polyglutamate inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase (tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase; 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate:NADP+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.5.1.3) and consequently a trapping of intracellular folates as dihydropteroylpolyglutamates, which increase the extent of FdUMP binding to thymidylate synthase.","['CA 06167/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 08010/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 08341/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC350129,,,,,,,,

Two different lines of experimentation indicated that high-molecular-weight viral RNA is required for abrogation. First, the decay of abrogating ability of virus stocks heated at 43 degrees C was quantitatively correlated with a loss of intact virion 35S RNA. Second, Act D virions, which lack such RNA although they contain normal structural proteins, failed to abrogate. These findings imply that abrogation does not result from the mere entry of virion structural proteins into a cell. Additional data indicate that the role of viral RNA in abrogation is not that of a template for DNA synthesis. Virus particles lacking reverse transcriptase activity as a result of either mutation or heat inactivation exhibit abrogating activity even though they do not synthesize detectable viral DNA. In addition, abrogation was shown to take place in the presence of cytosine arabinoside, an inhibitor of DNA synthesis. Thus, abrogation does not depend on viral or cellular DNA synthesis, and the role of viral RNA in this process must involve some other function. The nature of this viral function and its occurrence in Fv-1 permissive cells are discussed.",,PMC288812,,,,,,,,

Concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin, and pokeweed mitogen stimulated spleen lymphocytes, but not spleen macrophages, to produce a D-factor with an apparent molecular weight of 40,000 to 50,000. On the other hand, lipopolysaccharide and copolymer of polyinosinic and polycytidylic acids stimulated both spleen lymphocytes and spleen macrophages to produce D-factors. Spleen macrophages produced D-factors with molecular weights of 40,000 to 50,000 and 20,000 to 25,000, whereas spleen lymphocytes produced only the larger molecules. In addition to D-factor, colony-stimulating factor (CSF), which stimulates growth and differentiation of normal bone marrow cells, and interferon, were detected in conditioned medium of spleen cells treated with concanavalin A or lipopolysaccharide. On gel filtration of the conditioned medium with Sephadex G-100, CSF was eluted between the larger D-factor and the smaller one. The fraction with interferon activity overlapped that of the larger D-factor. Incubation of the conditioned medium at pH 2 abolished the activity of interferon but did not affect the activity of either D-factor or CSF. The addition of cytochalasin B suppressed the production of interferon but not of D-factor or CSF by the spleen cells.

We now report that exposure of KG-1 cells to human CSFs in liquid culture results in a rapid (within 3 hr) burst of RNA synthesis and, after a lag of about 10 hr, a stimulation of DNA and protein synthesis. RNA and protein synthesis were maximally stimulated about 2-fold and DNA synthesis was stimulated about 2.5-fold. The stimulation was specific; various growth factors, hormones, and mouse CSFs had no effect on KG-1 macromolecular synthesis. Treatment with CSF did not discernibly alter the morphological appearance of the KG-1 cells (primarily myeloblasts) nor did it qualitatively affect the pattern of newly synthesized proteins separable by one- and two-dimensional electrophoresis. Several myeloid leukemia cell lines that were not responsive to CSF in agar culture, including a dedifferentiated variant of KG-1, showed little or no stimulation of macromolecular synthesis upon exposure to CSF. We have used the CSF-dependent stimulation of macromolecular synthesis of KG-1 to develop a rapid, sensitive microassay for human CSFs.

Nonproducer cells contain a Pr76 gag precursor protein and also a protein that is indistinguishable from the Pr180 gag-pol protein of nondefective viruses. The RNA of the DVP is 7.5 kilobases (kb) long and is 0.7 kb shorter than the 8.2-kb RNAs of the helper viruses of AMV, MAV-1 and MAV-2. Comparisons based on RNA.cDNA hybridization and mapping of RNase T1-resistant oligonucleotides indicated that DVP RNA shares with MAV RNAs nearly isogenic 5'-terminal gag and pol-related sequences of 5.3 kb and a 3'-terminal c-region of 0.7 kb that is different from that found in other avian tumor viruses. Adjacent to the c-region, DVP RNA contains a contiguous specific sequence of 1.5 kb defined by 14 specific oligonucleotides. Except for two of these oligonucleotides that map at its 5' end, this sequence is unrelated to any sequences of nondefective avian tumor viruses of four different envelope subgroups as well as to the specific sequences of fibroblast-transforming avian acute leukemia and sarcoma viruses of four different RNA subgroups. The specific sequence of the DVP RNA is present in infectious stocks of AMV from this and other laboratories in an AMV-transformed myeloblast line from another laboratory, and it is about 70% related to nucleotide sequences of E26 virus, an independent isolate of an AMV-like virus. Preliminary experiments show DVP to be leukemogenic if fused into susceptible cells in the presence of helper virus. We conclude that DVP RNA is the leukemogenic component of infectious AMV and that its specific sequence, termed AMV, may carry genetic information for oncogenicity. Thus we have found here a transformation-specific RNA sequence, unrelated to helper virus, in a highly oncogenic virus that does not transform fibroblasts.","['CA 10697/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 11426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC350008,,,,,,,,

A series of cell clones (IFN clones), isolated in the presence of IFN (10(4) U ml-1) from cultures of NIH-3T3 cells which had been treated with IFN, and then infected with KiMSV (KiMLV) in conditions where every cell was infected, were shown to be phenotypically untransformed.

However, cells isolated using an identical procedure, but in the absence of IFN, were uniformly transformed and all produced KiMSV (KiMLV) or contained rescuable KiMSV.

In sera from tumor-bearing mice, and at highest levels in sera from mice that reject their tumors, was an antibody that immunoprecipitates a specific protein from [35S]-methionine-labeled A-MuLV-transformed BALB/c cells. This protein was not the previously characterized A-MuLV-specific protein (P120) but a 50,000-molecular-weight protein (P50). Such sera may also immunoprecipitate P120, but no other protein was reproducibly precipitated by them. A monoclonal antibody (RA3-2C2) that has been shown to stain normal B-lymphocytes also selectively immunoprecipitated P50. P50 was present in A-MuLV-transformed lymphoid and fibroblastic cells of a variety of mouse strains. One A-MuLV-transformed cell line had a very low P50 level, the L1-2 tumor of C57L origin. This tumor was previously shown to be rejected by C57L mice and is used to produce anti-P120 (anti-AbT) sera. P50 was not a Moloney MuLV protein and was found at low levels in normal cells of cells transformed by agents other than A-MuLV; thus, it was probably a host cell protein whose concentration was selectively accentuated by A-MuLV transformation. P50 was phosphorylated and, by using indirect immunofluorescence, anti-P50 serum stained live A-MuLV-transformed cells. The protein was not glycosylated and did not label by lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination. Thus, P50 was very like P120 in its cellular localization and properties, but it did not exhibit proptein kinase activity in vitro. The selective accentuation of this protein in A-MuLV transformants and its strong antigenicity in syngeneic animals suggest that it is a unique and functionally important protein.","['AI-09072/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-09302/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-14051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC353673,,,,,,,,

To investigate further the possible virological and immunological differences in these lymphomas, several lymphoma cell lines were derived. Although the majority of these cell lines expressed only the parental MoLV, one lymphoma cell line (5F4) was found which expressed only a defective virus. 5F4 virions lacked detectable reverse transcriptase activity and by immunoprecipitation lacked a serologically detectable reverse transcriptase. The lack of reverse transcriptase did not appear to be due to a deletion in the viral genome. Intracellularly 5F4 cells synthesized normal gag gene precursors but had little, if any, detectable Pr180gag-pol or an altered precursor. These results suggest that the defect of the 5F4 virus is associated with the inability to translate the appropriate precursor for reverse transcriptase. The possible origin of the detective 5F4 virus was also examined by competition radioimmunoassays. These results demonstrate that the type-specific proteins, gp71 and p12, are serologically identical to those of the endogenous ecotropic virus and distinct from the MoLV proteins. Competition assays of 5F4 cell extracts further demonstrated the lack of any detectable MoLV type-specific proteins, although the tumor was presumably induced by MoLV.

Comparable results were obtained for the kinetic parameters independently of stain or staining procedure; intercalating dyes with cells of a high RNA content not treated with RNAse and acridine orange being the exceptions. Of the two methods of numerical analysis, the planimetric technique was more consistant.

Cloning of antigen-activated human lymphocytes can be accomplished through the use of T-lymphocyte growth factor, which permits the long-term growth of antigen-activated lymphocytes. In the study reported here, the remission lymphocytes of a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia were sensitized in culture to the patient's own leukemic myeloblasts and then grown from wells containing one or a few replicating units. Sufficient cells of three clones were growth for further testing of specificity: one responded only to the sensitizing myeloblast but not to normal cells tested; one responded to the sensitizing myeloblasts and one allogeneic myeloblast but not to normal cells; and one responded to none of the cells tested, although it proliferated vigorously with growth factor alone. These results demonstrate the feasibility of cloning human lymphocytes putatively responsive to leukemia-associated antigens in order to improve their discriminatory capacity in the primed lymphocyte typing test.

The enzyme consists of a single polypeptide chain of mol. wt. approx. 72,000 as determined by both glycerol density gradient centrifugation and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The preferred divalent cation for DNA synthesis is Mn2+ on a variety of template-primers, and its optimum concentration appears to be significantly lower than reported results of other mammalian type-C viral enzymes. The purified enzyme also contained RNAase H activity. Both DNA polymerase and RNAase H activities appear to reside on the same molecule as demonstrated by the copurification of both activities through various purification steps. The divalent cation requirement for maximum activity of RNAase H is also similar to that of the DNA polymerase. RNAase H without detectable polymerase activity was generated by a limited chymotrypsin digestion of the purified reverse transcriptase. This RNAase H activity was inhibited equally effectively as RNAase H in the intact reverse transcriptase by antisera prepared against reverse transcriptase of feline leukemia virus. These results indicate that the RNAase H catalytic activity of reverse transcriptase is distinct from the polymerase portion of the molecule. Since the RNAase H activity appears to be more stable, the measurement of RNAase H activity with a proper antibody might be useful for assaying tumor cells for the presence of the viral enzyme.",,,,,,,,,,

This effect is accompanied by enhanced togavirus replication in splenocytes, a decrease in the number of antibody-producing cells in the spleen, a decrease of antihemagglutinins titer in the blood without any significant change in the virus-neutralizing antibody and interferon titers. RLV-induced immunosuppression is termporary and of varying intensity with regard to individual parameters of immune response and to different variants of WN virus (highly virulent, poorly virulent). It is assumed that the differentiated and temporary nature of the immunosupressive effect of RLV is conducive to selective stimulation of the visceral phase of togavirus reproduction followed by inhibition of the neural phase under the influence of restored immune mechanisms and interferon.

In addition slides from concentrated blood lymphocytes of 50 normal subjects served as control. The following results were achieved. 1. In normal blood only about 50% of T-lymphocytes reveal a positive DAP IV reaction. 2. Lymphocytes positive to DAP IV show a typical dot-like paranuclear pattern of activity for acid phosphatase. 3. Only 5 cases out of 15 acid phosphatase positive acute lymphoblastic leukemias presented a positive reaction for the DAP IV.

In the present study we found that if these cells were treated with interferon (IF) for 24 to 48 h the intracellular virus particles accumulated at a two- to threefold-higher level than that observed in untreated cells. Nevertheless, despite this accumulation, no difference between IF-treated and untreated cells was observed in the amount of the total cytoplasmic viral RNA or in its 35S or 21S species. When cellular virions were sedimented from the cytoplasmic fraction, a markedly higher amount of viral RNA was detected in the viral pellet of IF-treated cells than was detected in untreated cells, whereas the amount of viral RNA left in the virus-free cytoplasm of IF-treated cells was much lower than that in the untreated cells. Furthermore, the amount of the cytoplasmic polyriboadenylic acid-containing viral RNA was also remarkably higher in the IF-treated cells. Viral polyribosomes appeared to be fully functional in IF-treated cells, since no effect of IF on viral protein synthesis could be detected. Analysis of the nuclear viral RNA showed no difference between IF-treated and untreated cells after 24 h of IF treatment. Both contained a comparable amount of 35S viral RNA. However, at 48 h a significant accumulation of viral RNA was observed in the nucleus of the IF-treated cells as compared with the untreated cells, although in both cases only 35S species were evident. This accumulation appeared to activate a degradation process which destroyed nuclear viral RNA, since a dramatic shift toward smaller-sized molecules of viral RNA and a remarkable reduction in its amount were observed after 72 h of IF treatment.",,PMC288863,,,,,,,,

Several enzymatic activities increase in cells shortly after treatment with interferon. One of these enzymes, oligo-isoadenylate synthetase, synthesizes (2'-5') isoadenylate oligomers which strongly stimulate the activity of a cellular ribonuclease, RNase F (ref. 7). Interferon also significantly increases the activity of a protein kinase which phosphorylates the initiation factor eIF-2 and can inhibit in vitro protein synthesis. Such interferon-induced enzymes, which affect RNA and protein metabolism, might be responsible for many of its effects on viruses. Indeed, inhibition of viral protein and RNA synthesis appears to have a major role in the antiviral state. We have now investigated possible interactions of the two enzymes with viral constituents during the course of infection and found that in two different membrane-coated RNA viruses, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Moloney murine leukaemia virus (M-MuLV), there is an accumulation of the 2'-5') oligo-isoadenylate synthetase (E) in the virions. Most of the enzyme is bound to the virion ribonucleoprotein core. The incorporation of E into the virions suggests a direct involvement of the enzyme in regulation of virus functions.",,,,,,,,,,

This is consistent with previous reports that REV is more closely related to retroviruses of mammalian origin than to other avian viruses.

Detection of infectious xenotropic virus usually required extensive amplification on indicator cells. Dual-tropic (mink cell focus-forming) virus has not been found in the leukemias. Expression of ecotropic virus in tail extracts prepared at 6.5 months of age, although greatly enhanced compared with unirradiated controls, was not found to be prognostic of tumor development in individual mice.

In mixed lymphocyte tumor cell cultures (MLTC), the generated type-1 IF was definitely shown to originate from the lymphocytes and not from the tumor cells. Supplementation of leukocyte cultures with 10% fetal calf serum instead 10% human AB serum had little influence on tumor cell-induced IF production, but strongly reduced CP-induced IF production. Lymphocyte fractionation procedures involving iron/plastic treatment, nylon wool columns, Ig-anti-Ig columns and rosette (E, EA) separation led to the identification of null cells as highly efficient producers of type-1 IF. T cells obtained by different ways (E-rosette sedimentation, passage through 1 nylon and 2 Ig-anti-Ig columns, or thoracic duct lymphocytes) were poor IF producers in response to tumor cells, HSV and CP, but secreted anti-viral activity when stimulated with phytohemagglutinin. In MLTC, the level of generated type-1 IF roughly stimulated with phytohemagglutinin. In MLTC, the level of generated type-1 IF roughly paralleled nautral killer (NK) cell activity. Evidence is presented that type-1 IF can be produced by an Fc receptor-negative null cell subset, whereas NK activity requires Fc receptor-positive cells. It is suggested that production of type-1 IF represents one of the earliest functions in the differentiation process of mononuclear phagocytes and is likely to develop before the appearance of Fc receptors, diffuse esterase staining and latex phagocytosis.",,,,,,,,,,

Interferon also inhibited secondary plating of blast progenitors (self-renewal). This effect was in marked contrast to the effect of adriamycin, which reduced primary plating efficiency of blast progenitors but did not affect self-renewal. Inhibition of blast progenitor proliferation by interferon was markedly reduced when interferon was added after 24 hr of culture and was absent when added after 72 hr. Inhibition of self-renewal was observed even when interferon was added at 72 hr.

An unusual helper virus precursor polyprotein of 93 000 daltons was also detected and characterized. It was labeled with [3H]fucose, suggesting that it was an intermediate precursor containing gp70 on which further modification of the core oligosaccharide had occurred relative to gPr83env. The usual viral proteins were also found in sarcoma virus particles and they were undistinguishable in size from those of Moloney murine leukemia virus (cl-1 strain). These experiments together with pulse-labeling experiments performed in the presence of the arginine analog canavanine, which prevents proteolytic cleavage, suggest that the product derived from the Mo-MuSV-specific sequences must be expressed as a separate gene product since we were unable to detect in transformed cells a polyprotein containing both viral (e.g., 'gag', 'pol' or 'env') and non-viral components. Cell-free protein synthesis studies performed with Mo-MuSV-124 genomic RNA have confirmed this interpretation and have identified three size classes of polypeptides as translation products of the sarcoma virus genome. They are P63gag, P42-P38 and P23. Intracellular p63gag and cell-free synthesized P63gag, appear to have identical sizes, antigenic determinants and tryptic peptides. The P42-P38 proteins contain core protein determinants. P23 is not related to the products of the replication genes of MuLV. Thus, P23 is a candidate for the 'src' gene product of Mo-MuSV-124.",,,,,,,,,,

Peritoneal macrophages were activated by nonspecific immunopotentiators such as interferon or bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the killing of MBL-2 leukemic target cells was measured. Macrophages from mice submitted to stress showed decreased responsiveness to interferon or LPS. In addition, the role of corticosteroids as mediators in the phenomenon was also studied. Indeed, we observed that corticosteroids were able to inhibit macrophage cytotoxicity and could at least play some role.

Interferons of type I and type II differ not only antigenically but also in molecular weight and stability at low pH. We have investigated whether mouse type I and type II interferons also differ in properties relating to their biological action. We present evidence which suggests that the molecular mechanism leading to antiviral and antigrowth effects induced by both types of interferon in susceptible cells must differ in at least one important step. Antiviral and antigrowth activities of type I but not of type II interferon are both inhibited when gangliosides are added to cell cultures together with the interferon. Whereas type I interferon strongly binds to ganglioside affinity columns and can be eluted with solutions of N-acetylneuraminyllactose, type II interferon passes through such columns unretarded. L-1210 mouse leukemia cells (L-1210S) respond equally well to antiviral and antigrowth activities of type I and type II interferons. Type I interferon-resistant L-1210 cells (L-1210R), derived from L-1210S cells after continuous culture in the presence of mouse fibroblast interferon, lack antiviral and antigrowth response to mouse type I interferon [Gresser, I., Bandu, H.T. & Brouty-Boye, D. (1974) J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 52, 553-559]. However, these cells display the same sensitivity toward type II interferon as do the parent L-1210S cells from which they were derived and respond equally well to its antiviral and antigrowth activities.",,PMC349434,,,,,,,,

In vitro studies confirmed that these tumors are antigenically distinct by demonstrating that the cytotoxic responses of spleen cells from mice immunized in vivo and reexposed to tumor in vitro are immunologically specific. Studies of ACIT with cells from mice immunized in vivo demonstrated similar specificity. Mice receiving 5 x 10(6) FBL-3 on day 0 all died by day 13. Treatment on day 5 with cyclophosphamide (CY), 180 mg/kg, prolonged the median survival time (MST) to day 23. Treatment on day 5 with CY plus 2 x 10(7) normal nonimmune C57BL/6 cells or CY plus cells sensitized to EL-4(G-) had no additional effect on survival whereas 2 x 10(7) C57BL/6 cells sensitized to FBL-3 in vivo prolonged MST to day 64 and cured 13 of 32 mice.

In addition, Ab 89 was unreactive with conventional immunoglobulins, private and public HLA antigens, or Ia-like antigens. More importantly, Ab 89 was reactive with some B cell lymphoid malignancies. Of the 57 B cell lymphomas tested, it was found that Ab 89 reacted with approximately 10% of B cell D-PDL and B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Of interest was the finding that N.B. serum contained a circulating antigen which could specifically block the reactivity of Ab 89. The data obtained suggests that Ab 89 defines a tumor-associated antigen shared by a unique subgroup of B cell lymphomas.

Each of the six sarcomas exhibited unique TATA when assayed for tumor rejection in syngeneic hosts. In three instances, however, in sarcomas CI-I, CII-5 and CII-7, TATA activity was lost during early in vivo passages. This activity was reestablished invivo from the in vitro-passaged lines in CI-I and CII-7 and these sarcomas along with CI-3, CI-4 and CII-10 maintained a stable TATA phenotype throughout the 50 transplant passages; TATA was lost permanently, however, in CII-5. These results indicate a dimorphic nature of early-passage neoplasms. No cross-reacting antigens were detected among these sarcomas, including also Meth A, a sarcoma well characterized as to its membrane antigens; nor was any evidence obtained for the existence of alien (inappropriate) H-2 antigens employing tumor rejection assays in F1 hybrids of BALB/c with strains bearing several haplotypes and also with studies of H-2 serology. In three sarcomas, some evidence was obtained for the existence of alloantigens of the non-H-2 type since it was found that (BALB/c X DBA/2)F1 hybrids could not be immunized by respective sarcomas. These findings suggest the existence on these sarcomas of a tumor antigen that is expressed normally in DBA/2 mice, although no definitive evidence has been obtained. Assays for MuLV, for the viral structural proteins gp70 and p30 and for reverse transcriptase showed that three sarcomas were positive and three others, as well as Meth A, were negative.

In contrast, erythroleukemia cells bound the dye even in the presence of serum; binding was not affected by reversing the sign of the charge carried by MC540, but was abolished upon removal of certain hydrophobic side chains. When the erythroleukemia cells were induced to differentiate, the distribution of dye-binding regions was altered by the cell such that staining became localized to one region of the membrane. Concomitantly, conconavalin A binding sites were redistributed and became localized in the same region of the membrane as the merocyanine binding sites.

The diagnostic difficulty may be further compounded when the granulocytic sarcoma develops before there is peripheral blood or bone marrow evidence of leukemia. Previous criteria for the diagnosis of chloroma have been ambiguous because of the capricious nature of the hydroperoxidase activity and the lack of definitive histochemical criteria. In this case, a combination of Sudan black B and myeloperoxidase histochemical staining and ultrastructural evaluation was applied. The light microscopic histochemical studies suggested the presence of Phi bodies and rods both in the formalin-fixed tumor and in the cells derived from the subsequent pleural effusion; this was confirmed by electron microscopy, which demonstrated the peridicity of the crystalline rod substructure. These observations show that light microscopic histochemical studies can facilitate the diagnosis of granulocytic sarcoma or chloroma in the absence of peripheral blood or bone marrow manifestations of leukemia.",,,,,,,,,,

Continuous i.p. bleomycin at 8 u/kg/day caused a 0.5 log greater reduction of LCFU-S than did an identical dose given by intermittent bolus administration. The infusion minipump provided constant bleomycin plasma levels of 0.62 +/- 0.03 mu/ml and a total plasma AUC (area under the plasma decay curve) of 89.0 mu.h/ml for 6 days at 8 u/kg/day. Intermittent bolus bleomycin at 8 u.kg/day had a terminal-phase plasma t1/2 of 15 min and a total 6-day plasma AUC of 90.8mu.h/ml. These pharmacokinetic data validate the osmotic minipump as a constant drug-delivery system, and suggest that the two administration schedules resulted in equal total bleomycin dosages. Although high peak bleomycin plasma levels (i.e. 32 mu/ml) were achieved with the intermittent bolus administration, continuous-infusion bleomycin's greater inhibition of LCFU-S was probably related to the drug's schedule-dependent cell-killing characteristics. The results of this study provide further rationale for the continuing use of infusion bleomycin schedules in cancer patients.",,PMC2010280,,,,,,,,

With PM and SPM, stimulation was achieved over a 10-fold antigen concentration, 5 microgram/ml to 0.5 microgram/ml, and with whole cells the optimum R/S cell ratio was 80:1 to 100:1. Assuming a 50-fold enrichment of plasma membrane antigens over cells by purifying the PM, this observation suggests that cells are at least 200 times more efficient than PM. A specific tumor antigen that induces CTL in vitro was solubilized with sodium deoxycholate and fractionated on Ultrogel AcA34 followed by affinity chromatography on Lens culinaris lentil lectin-Sepharose 4B column. The purification scheme was shown to have enriched for the specific CTL-inducing activity. The specificity of the induction and effector phases of the reaction was assessed and the data clearly indicate that the reactions were specific. Furthermore, we ruled out the possibility that the induction of CTL by soluble tumor antigen in a secondary reaction could be due to the nonspecific induction of helper activity, which then caused a polyclonal expansion of memory cells.",,,,,,,,,,

IF stimulated the anti-protein synthesis activity of DT in both mouse cells that are known to be highly resistant to this toxin and in human HeLa cells that are highly sensitive to this toxin. This stimulation was dependent on IF dose. The effect of IF on DT action was strictly species specific, indicating that it was not a consequence of the mere binding of IF to the cell membrane, but rather reflected the cellular changes that followed this initial binding. IF was found to be capable of potentiating intact DT, but could not potentiate its fragments in any combination.

Insulin binding was studied in normal rat erythrocytes and erythroblastic leukemic (EBL) cells by standard 125I-insulin competitive binding assays. EBL cells exhibited marked insulin degradation, which was time, temperature, and concentration dependent and was mediated by both cell-bound and soluble enzymes. Bacitracin or bovine serum albumin was used to inhibit such degradation in a dose-dependent fashion to allow meaningful data analysis. Insulin binding studies showed a greater than 10-fold increase of specific binding to EBL cells compared with erythrocytes. Scatchard analysis was consistent with increases predominantly in the number of receptors on EBL cells. Concordant with increased insulin binding, EBL cells demonstrated increased transport of alpha-aminolsobutyric acid and increased incorporation of uridine into ribonucleic acid in response to physiologic doses of insulin (100 microunits/ml). It can be concluded that EBL cells may serve as useful models of erythroblasts to explore the relationships between insulin binding, response, and cell maturation.",,,,,,,,,,

Viruses harboring the G(IX) (+) oligonucleotide induce expression of the gp70-associated antigen G(IX) and possess gp70s with more rapid electrophoretic mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gels than viruses that possess the G(IX) (-) oligonucleotide. The latter viruses fail to induce G(IX) on infected fibroblasts. The G(IX) (+) and G(IX) (-) oligonucleotides lie in corresponding positions in the 3' third of the oligonucleotide maps of their respective viruses. We have determined the nucleotide sequences of the G(IX) (+) and G(IX) (-) oligonucleotides. The sequence of the G(IX) (-) oligonucleotide is U-A-U-C-U-C-A-A-C-C-A-C-C-A-U-A-C-U-U-A-A-C-C-U-C-A-C-C-A-C-[unk]-G, and the sequence of the G(IX) (+) oligonucleotide is U-A-U-C-U-C-A-A-C-C-A-C-C-A-U-A-C-U-U-G. Thus, a single base change could result in the interconversion of the two oligonucleotides. Consideration of the amino acids specified by the two oligonucleotides suggests that this single base difference may result in the presence of an additional oligosaccharide chain in the gp70s of the G(IX) (-) viruses. Evidence supporting this prediction has been obtained by M. R. Rosner, J.-S. Tung, E. Fleissner, and P. W. Robbins (personal communication). It is entirely possible that the single nucleotide change that apparently results in a different electrophoretic mobility of the gp70s of the G(IX) (+) and G(IX) (-) viruses is also responsible for the presence or absence of the G(IX) antigenic determinant; however, the validity of this possibility awaits further investigation.",,PMC348553,,,,,,,,

H-2D gene control appears to ensue at a step subsequent to virus infection, since elimination of virus infected cells does not become apparent until 3--5 weeks after virus infection. Nonetheless, almost immediately after virus infection, expression of H-2D-coded antigens is markedly elevated on the surface of thymocytes from resistant (H-2Dd) but not susceptible mice (H-2Ds or H-2Dq). This increased H-2D antigen expression triggers a vigorous cell-mediated immune response which probably plays a key role in resistance to leukaemia via elimination of virus-infected cells. A hypothesis is put forth to explain the induction of increased sythesis and expression of H-2D antigens. This hypothesis postulates that the oncogenic segment of RadLV bears a close resemblance to H-2.4, the private specificity for H-2Dd, allowing it to integrate at or near the H-2Dd murine gene. Subsequent to integration, the rates of transcription and translation are altered with a resulting increase in cell surface antigen expression. Other possibilities are also discussed.",,,,,,,,,,

Two ascites lines of the tumour, as well as a tissue culture adjusted and cloned tumour line, were used in these studies with similar results being obtained. K36 expresses on its cell surface D-region encoded H-2K antigens but does not express K-region encoded H-2K alloantigens. It also expresses on its cell membrane, H-2 specificities of foreign haplotypes not present on normal AKR lymphoid cells. The molecular basis of the H-2Dd specificity on K36 (H-2k) was analysed by immunoprecipitation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The specificity was shown to be present on a glycoprotein of apparent molecular weight 45,000. However, antisera against the H-2Dd private specificity (H-2.4) precipitate additional glycoprotein of 45,000D and also 70,000D. In tryptic peptide maps of the isolated 45,000D fraction precipitated by anti-H-2.4 serum from radiolabelled K36 glycoprotein, all H-2Dd specific peptides were present in the same quantitative ratio. This is consistent with the structural identity of the foreign H-2Dd from the K36 tumour with normal H-2Dd and supports the hypothesis of a regulator system controlling the H-2 allelism. Under certain circumstances such a system could cause suppression of one and derepression of the other H-2 gene products.",,,,,,,,,,

Exposure of MuLV-infected embryonic thymuses to interferon during the organ culture period significantly reduced the incidence of lymphomas in mice receiving such thymus transpalnts. Interferon also prevented the appearance of detectable numbers of MuLV antigen-containing lymphocytes in infected organ-cultured thymuses. In contrast, despite the use of very high interferon concentrations, no effects were seen on the number of viable thymic lymphocytes, their proliferation or responsiveness to the polyclonal T-cell mitogens concanavalin A (Con A) and leukoagglutinin (LA).

Myeloid (non-lymphoid) leukemia was most common (83 cases), and there were 13 lymphoid cases, two cases of erythroleukemia, and two undifferentiated leukemias. Histologic studies of marrow particles revealed significant admixtures of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and abnormal erythroid elements, particularly in acute myelomonocytic leukemia. Interpretations of cytochemical results were confirmed by ultrastructural studies in 90% of the cases. Clinically significant discrepancies between cytochemical and ultrastructural interpretations were rarely found. Only two myeloid and five lymphoid cases did not mark typically with any cytochemical stain. The single most reliable special stain was the periodic acid-Schiff stain, whereas the stain most difficult to interpret was the alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase stain. Sudan black stain was particularly helpful in demonstrating Auer rods. Five of six cases unclassified by cytochemistry were categorized by electron microscopy. Although patterns of cytochemical staining were delineated for each type of leukemia, significant intragroup variation in cytochemical reactions was recognized. This study indicates that ultrastructural examination should be routinely used for categorization of cases with equivocal cytochemical findings and for analysis of unclassified cases.",,,,,,,,,,

Conformation-dependent type-specific determinants of p30 were affected only by methylacetimidate. Group- and interspecies-specific determinants of p30 are similar to those of gp70 in that they also appear to be sequential antigenic sites. Therefore, the broadly reactive group- and interspecies-specific determinants of gp70 and p30 can be followed into small peptides. Accordingly, a cyanogen bromide cleavage fragment derived from the carboxyl-terminal one-third of Rauscher leukemia virus p30 was found to carry group-specific determinants but no detectable interspecies-specific determinants. In contrast, a peptide obtained by limited trypsin cleavage of p30, which was derived from the NH(2)-terminal region of the protein, contained at least one of the interspecies determinants shared with feline leukemia virus p27.",,PMC288632,,,,,,,,

The SM-FeSV primary translational product is a 180,000-dalton polyprotein which is immediately processed into a highly unstable 60,000-dalton molecule containing the p15-p12-p30 fragment of the FeLV gag gene-coded precursor protein and a 120,000-dalton FeSV-specific polypeptide. The GA- and ST-FeSV genomes code for polyproteins of 95,000 and 85,000 daltons, respectively, which in addition to the amino-terminal moiety (p15-12 and a portion of p30) of the FeLV gag gene-coded precursor protein also contain FeSV-specific polypeptides. However, the GA- and ST-FeSV polyproteins appear to be relatively stable molecules (half-lives of around 16 h) and are not significantly processed into smaller polypeptides. Immunological and biochemical analysis of each of the above FeSV translational products revealed that the sarcoma-specific regions of the GA- and ST-FeSV polyproteins are antigenically cross-reactive and exhibit common methionine-containing peptides. These findings favor the concept that these sarcoma-specific polypeptides are coded for by the similar subsets of cellular sequences incorporated into the GA- and ST-FeSV genomes during the generation of these transforming agents.",,PMC288536,,,,,,,,

In contrast to this constancy, gag gene products coded for by these strains vary significantly. The gag and env gene products are synthesized from separate mRNA's, and the mRNA for the env gene product is approximately 18S. Unlike other acute leukemia viruses, which can transform various undifferentiated cells, have large unique sequence cellular gene inserts fused to helper virus gag genes, and have one known genome-length intracellular mRNA, the spleen focus-forming virus transforms only specific hematopoietic stem cells, is an env gene rather than a gag gene recombinant virus, and has a second distinct and smaller class of intracellular mRNA.

A detailed characterization and a study of requirements for the expression of pyrophosphate exchange and pyrophosphorolysis reactions indicated that a variety of RNA and DNA template-primers supported these catalytic reactions. Furthermore, hydrogen bonding of template to primer was essential, although RNA:RNA template-primers, e.g. poly(rA) . (rU)9 or 70 S RNA . tRNA complex, were not utilized for these reactions. AMV enzyme required Mg2+, and RLV enzyme Mn2+, as the preferred divalent metal ion for the expression of these activities. Response of various catalytic reactions to site-specific inhibitors revealed that polymerization and pyrophosphate exchange reactions were susceptible to reagents that affected either the substrate or the template binding site, intrinsic zinc, or sulfhydryl groups. RNase H and pyrophosphorolysis activities, on the other hand, exhibited susceptibility only to the template site-specific reagent. We, therefore, conclude that RNase H and pyrophosphorolysis reactions are catalyzed through the template binding site while polymerization and pyrophosphate exchange reactions require additional participation of the substrate binding site, as well as that of intrinsic zinc and the presence of reactive sulfhydryl groups.",,,,,,,,,,

Using a double selection system devised to select against the temperature-sensitive (ts) lesion associated with a mutant of Rauscher-MuLV and the xenotropic host range of BALB:virus-2, recombinant viruses were obtained at frequencies ranging from 0.01 to 0.1%. Recombinant viruses were identified on the basis of the type specific antigenic determinants in the translational products of gag (p15, p12, p30, and p10 proteins), pol (reverse transcriptase), and env (gp70 glycoprotein) genes. By this approach, the partial genetic maps of a large number of recombinants were obtained. The fact that p10 of Rauscher-MuLV ts 25, the mutant utilized, was the only protein uniformly lacking in recombinant viruses, localized the lesion inhibiting gag precursor cleavage in this mutant at the carboxy terminus of its gag gene. The recombinant viruses demonstrated two host range phenotypes as defined by Fv-1 host cell restriction. In each case, NB-tropic recombinants possessed the p30 of BALB:virus-2 p30. Thus, it was possible to assign the site of Fv-1 action at, or closely linked, to the viral p30. The target within the viral genome of a second host restriction was also mapped. A serum factor, previously shown to specifically inactivate xenotropic virus infectivity, was demonstrated to exert its action on the viral env gene product. The system described here allows the generation of specific recombinant genotypes that should be useful in defining those regions of the viral genome involved in leukemogenesis.",,PMC2185776,,,,,,,,

Therefore, it has become difficult to discriminate smoldering ATL having only abnormal lymphocytes from a healthy human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) carrier only by morphology and serology. We found that patients with smoldering ATL with visceral organ involvement such as skin or lung lesions had much higher titer (about 1 : 1,000) of anti-HTLV antibodies than those with other subtypes of ATL (about 1 : 250); the difference was highly significant (p less than 0.001). In addition, the period of survival of patients with smoldering ATL having antibody with high titer was much longer than that of patients with other subtypes of ATL, suggesting the role of a host immune response. Four cases of HTLV-negative ATL were found to have the same chromosomal abnormality as that has been seen in HTLV-positive typical ATL; the situation was quite similar to Burkitt's lymphoma. Since it has been considered that HTLV does not include oncogenes, a common oncogenic mechanism, ATL specific cellular oncogenes, might exist: they might be activated by HTLV or a mechanism other than a virus.",,,,,,,,,,

Lymphadenopathy, hypercalcemia, and a leukemic blood picture were seen in the majority. The clinical course was short with a median survival of 5 months. Serum antibodies to human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) were detected in all the 10 cases investigated. Marker studies showed a mature (post-thymic) T4+ T-cell phenotype. Functional studies in 3 cases demonstrated that the cells did not provide help but rather suppressed B-cell differentiation. Cells from 2 cases of T4+ prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) were shown to have helper function. Type C viral particles were identified by electron microscopy (EM) on cultured cells from 4 ATLL patients and these were shown to react with the monoclonal antibody (McAb) to the HTLV proteins p19 and p24. Such findings were not observed in HTLV negative T-cell leukemias except for cells of a T-PLL which showed evidence of budding and extracellular release of C-type particles after 5 days culture with phytohemagglutinin (PHA). A close association between the localization of the receptor for T-cell growth factor, demonstrated by McAb anti-Tac, and areas of the cell membrane showing release of HTLV viral particles was documented at EM level by the immunogold method. This technique also demonstrated the specific binding of anti-p19 to HTLV. Cytogenetic studies on PHA stimulated cultures from 2 ATLL revealed trisomy for 7q and this was also observed in 1 of 2 T-PLL and 2 of 4 Sezary syndrome cases. The clinical, morphological, immunological, and cytogenetic features of ATLL in black patients diagnosed in the U.K. are identical to those reported from Japan and the U.S.A. There is also strong evidence that the disease is caused by HTLV-I.",,,47,,,,,,,

The compound responsible for this effect has been isolated from homogenates of the tumor by ion-exchange HPLC, and its presence monitored by enzyme-inhibition assay. The inhibitor has also been prepared by incubation of tiazofurin with P388 cells in culture. Chromatographically, the inhibitory principle exhibits a moderately strong set negative charge at pH 3, and elutes in the general vicinity of the nucleoside-5'-diphosphates; its absorption maximum in aqueous solution (pH 7) lies at 252 nm. Exposure of the molecule to snake-venom phosphodiesterase or to nucleotide pyrophosphatase destroys its inhibitory potency, whereas other phosphodiesterases are either less effective or inert. Since these results suggested that the anabolite might be a dinucleotide with a phosphodiester linkage of the kind found in NAD, attempts were made to synthesize such an analogue from the 5'-monophosphate of thiazole nucleoside and ATP-Mg2+, using a purified preparation of NAD pyrophosphorylase; modest yields were obtained of a compound with chromatographic, spectral and enzyme-inhibitory properties identical to those of the material isolated from P388 tumor nodules. This enzyme-synthesized material was radioactive when [3H]ATP was used as cosubstrate, and yielded both AMP and thiazole nucleoside-5'-monophosphate on treatment with phosphodiesterase. It resisted attack by NAD glycohydrolase. An apparently identical dinucleotide was also synthesized chemically by means of the Khorana condensation. Mass spectral analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance studies with homogeneous preparations of both the enzymically and chemically synthesized compound were compatible with its being a dinucleotide in which the nicotinamide of NAD has been replaced by thiazole-4-carboxamide. Versus IMP dehydrogenase, the dinucleotide exhibited a K1 of approximately 2 X 10(-7) M and was non-competitive with NAD as the variable substrate. Other NAD utilizing enzymes, including representative dehydrogenases and poly ADP ribose polymerase, were, by comparison to mammalian IMPD, resistant to inhibition by TAD. The properties of this novel dinucleotide are compared and contrasted with those of analogs of NAD containing modifications in the pyridine, adenine or ribofuranose rings, as well as in the pyrophosphate bridge.",,,,,,,,,,

Our work on PSF and that of other groups who have studied what is almost certainly the same factor under names such as hemopoietic growth factor, IL-3, BPA or multi-CSF suggests that this factor may provide an alternative means of generating cells for transplantation and replacement therapy. At present the only established sources of PSF are the activated T cell or tumors in which we think the gene has been anomalously activated, such as WEHI-3B; the long-term bone marrow culture system, however, seems to be defining a factor or influence that may be identical with, or is able to replace, the T cell factor. Finally, our experiments with the heterogeneous P cell lines and the initiation of oncogenesis by activation of the PSF gene raise some caveats about the use of cultured cells for human therapy. In the mouse system the production of immortalized factor-dependent lines appears to be more frequent in cells taken from long-term bone marrow cultures rather than normal bone marrow. Obviously, further information on the mechanism of immortalization and on the frequency and mechanism of activation of PSF genes in such lines will be of great importance in guiding the practical use of in vitro-derived cells and in the understanding of leukemogenesis.",,,34,,,,,,,

The ratio of alpha to beta IFN transcripts varied greatly, depending on the cell type. The levels of the individual IFN-alpha RNAs were very different: IFN-alpha 1, -alpha 2 and -alpha 4 RNAs constituted the major fraction of the IFN-alpha transcripts measured, while IFN-alpha 6, -alpha 7, -alpha 8 and -alpha 14 were minor components in normal, induced leucocytes. Moreover, there was a striking difference in the proportion of individual IFN-alpha mRNA species in different cell types, in particular between normal and leukaemic cells; for example all cases of myeloblastic leukaemia examined showed a high expression of IFN-alpha 14. Use of different induction protocols did not significantly affect the proportion of IFN mRNAs.

This antibody was shown to have anti-human Thy-1 reactivity because (1) it precipitated a molecule with a molecular weight of about 24,000 daltons, (2) it had a pattern of reactivity similar to that of previously described anti-human Thy-1 antibodies and (3) purified human Thy-1 antigen specifically inhibited binding of Ab 390 to a known antigen-positive cell line. It was the intent of this study to investigate the distribution of Thy-1 on normal and malignant haematopoietic cells in humans and non-human primates. We show here that Ab 390 did not react with human peripheral blood leucocytes, bone marrow cells or splenocytes by immunofluorescence but did react with subcapsular and cortical fetal thymocytes by peroxidase-antiperoxidase immunohistology. A section of fetal spleen demonstrated staining of connective tissue and blood vessels and rare reactive lymphocytes. Adult spleen contained Thy-1-positive cells surrounding the white pulp and in the marginal zone, but single-cell suspensions of splenocytes did not react with Ab 390. Ab 390 was tested against a variety of fresh human leukaemia cells and human cell lines and was shown to react with only the acute lymphoblastic leukaemia T cell lines RPMI 8402 and HPB-MLT. Non-human primate studies revealed reactivity with a number of T cell lines from New World primates (cotton-topped and red-bellied marmosets) and peripheral blood granulocytes (owl monkey). Our studies support previous findings that suggest that human Thy-1 may be a marker for early T lymphocytes in man, and its distribution on non-human primate T cell lines suggests the same for certain species of non-human primates. Not consistent with the distribution on human cells was the demonstration of Ab 390 reactivity with owl monkey granulocytes.","['CA-22794/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CO-23909/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CO-23910/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

Status epilepticus had occurred in one-third of the group with seizures. Initial seizure rates among patients in continuous complete remission were significantly related to the method of central nervous system prophylaxis. Those who had received intrathecal methotrexate repeatedly with or without moderate doses of methotrexate intravenously or prior prophylactic cranial irradiation had a 20-fold higher seizure risk during remission induction, and a 37-fold higher risk during the 6th to 12th month of therapy, than did those who had received irradiation and only five intrathecal injections of methotrexate early in the course of treatment. Other clinical factors associated with an increased frequency of seizures were escalation of intravenous methotrexate dosage following cranial irradiation and treatment of meningeal leukaemia with intrathecal methotrexate. Parenterally administered methotrexate thus seems to increase susceptibility to seizure development in childhood leukaemia patients.","['CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Hybrids between pseudodiploid lines, in contrast, show extinction of Pgp-1. Thy-1+ or Pgp-1+ revertants were isolated by cell sorting from hybrids in which extinction occurred, demonstrating that all genes required for expression of these cell-surface antigens were present in antigen-negative hybrids. Thy-1- hybrids did not contain detectable cytoplasmic Thy-1 messenger RNA, while Thy-1 message could be detected in parental lines and Thy-1+ revertants. No obvious rearrangements of the Thy-1 structural genes could be demonstrated in Thy-1- hybrids and their Thy-1+ revertants, nor could rearrangements be demonstrated when parental cells and Thy-1- hybrids were compared. These results are consistent with the idea that diffusible gene products regulate both Thy-1 and Pgp-1 expression in these hybrids. These products act in a gene dosage-dependent manner in somatic cell hybrids.

Clonogenic mouse bone marrow and L 1210 cells were grown in agar-containing glass capillaries. Using these colony assays and a ID90 of BCNU, cyclic somatostatin influenced the BCNU-cytotoxicity neither at simultaneous nor at subsequent application. However, when given 2 h prior to BCNU, the inhibition of colony growth was almost totally abolished. This cytoprotective effect was seen with normal granulopoietic as well as with leukemic cells. The effect did not show up, if the inactive linear somatostatin was used.

These cells had fewer granules than normal circulating LGL but displayed a variety of organelles possibly involved in the process of granule formation. This process apparently originated from the fusion of vesicles that had a characteristic cup-shape (and appeared to be derived from the Golgi apparatus) with smaller vesicles, mostly of the coated type. This fusion resulted in the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVB) whose limiting membrane was constituted by that of the cup-shaped vesicle. MVB gradually matured into electron-dense granules. A number of cup-shaped vesicles were found positive for the cytochemical localization of thiamine pyrophosphatase (TPP) activity that is a specific marker of the trans aspect of the Golgi apparatus, a finding which confirmed that they were Golgi-derived. The smaller, mostly coated, vesicles were positive for acid phosphatase (AP) and evidence was obtained indicating that they subserved the function of transporting acid hydrolases from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the cup-shaped vesicles or to the MVB. The plasma membrane did not appear to contribute to MVB or granule formation since endocytic vacuoles induced by reacting the cell surface with the appropriate monoclonal antibodies (followed by peroxidase labelled anti-immunoglobulin) were never seen while fusing with granules or MVB. Rather, these vesicles formed secondary lysosomes after having encountered smooth or, more rarely, coated vesicles. Granulogenesis in LGL, therefore, resembles the process of granule formation observed in secretory cells. The active process of granulogenesis detected in the patient cells and a number of other findings indicate that they were LGL at early stages of maturation. The surface phenotype consistently found in these cells (OKT3+, Leu 1+, OKT8+, Leu 2a+, OKT11+, Leu 5+ and OKM1) is different from that of the majority of the normal LGL and may correspond to that of immature LGL.",,,,,,,,,,

The inhibitory effect of compound 48/80 was specifically reversed by exogenously added calmodulin. Phosphorylation of plasma membranes with [gamma-32P] ATP followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoretic analysis at low pH revealed a Ca2+-dependent phosphoprotein with an apparent molecular mass of 138,000 daltons which co-migrated with the Ca2+-dependent phosphoprotein from human erythrocytes and was separable from sarcoplasmic reticulum (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase. The 32P incorporated into the phosphoprotein could be chased with unlabeled ATP and the protein-phosphate bond was unstable at alkaline pH suggesting an acylphosphate ATPase intermediate like that previously characterized in other (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPases.","['GM 26199/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 28538/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Complete tumor eradication in this model requires more than 30 days and is dependent upon the transfer of specifically immune T cells. To evaluate the relative contributions of host and donor T cells to tumor elimination and the maintenance of tumor immunity, donor cells obtained from Thy congenic mice were used for adoptive transfer. Thus, host and donor T cells could be readily distinguished by the expression of either Thy-1.2 or Thy-1.1 antigen. The results demonstrated that the majority of immunologically competent T cells present in hosts cured by adoptive therapy were of host origin. A small population of donor T cells, however, persisted long after transfer. At day 60, a time point shortly after tumor eradication had been completed, 5% of splenic T cells were of donor origin, and by day 120 this percentage had decreased to less than 2%. Functional studies performed at both time points revealed that this small number of residual donor T cells contained the subpopulation of tumor-reactive T cells present in the host. Thus, host T cells did not make a substantial contribution to the expression of the anti-tumor response and presumably have little role in either tumor eradication or the long-term maintenance of tumor immunity.","['CA 19170/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 30558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

Nuclei isolated from this human promyelocytic leukemia cell line contained (ADP-ribose)n synthetase activity, whereas little or no enzymatic activity was detectable in normal human blood neutrophils. Furthermore, the activity of (ADP-ribose)n synthetase was decreased in HL-60 cells when they were induced to mature with retinoic acid (RA). To determine whether reduced (ADP-ribose)n synthetase activity is simply a result of induced maturation or whether it is a necessary precedent event for the maturation process, we evaluated the effects of nicotinamide (NAm) and its methyl derivative, N'-methylnicotinamide (N'-Met-NAm), agents which decrease ADP-ribosylation. Treatment of HL-60 cells with these drugs caused the cells to undergo maturation and to acquire certain of the morphologic, functional, and biochemical characteristics of normal neutrophils. N'-Met-NAm was more potent than NAm in inducing maturation; at a concentration of 0.8 mM, it caused greater than 80% of the cells to mature, whereas a tenfold greater concentration of NAm was required to induce a similar degree of maturation. NAm and N'-Met-NAm also potentiated the maturation of HL-60 cells induced by RA. Exposure of cells to noninducing concentrations of these compounds caused a leftward shift in the dose-response curve for RA; maturation was observed at 10(-11) M RA in the presence of either 2 mM NAm or 0.2 mM N'-Met-NAm while 10(-9) M RA was required to induce maturation in their absence. A leftward shift in the dose response curve for maturation in the presence of low doses of NAm or N'-Met-NAm did not occur with another inducer, dimethyl formamide (DMF). Two enzymes, NAD glycohydrolase and tissue transglutaminase, that are abundant in macrophages, were induced by RA but not by NAm. N'-Met-NAm decreased by about 75% the amount of endogenous (ADP-ribose)n in a selected fraction of chromosomal proteins which included histone H1 and the nonhistone high mobility group proteins. The results of this study support the concept that ADP-ribosylation of chromosomal proteins influences the regulation of human myeloid cell maturation.",,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-III antibodies were present in 35 (53%) of the 66 subjects tested in June, 1982. 4 of the seronegative subjects had HTLV-III antibodies when re-tested one year later, a seroconversion rate of 1.2% per month. In the HTLV-III seropositive subjects, AIDS developed at a rate of 6.9% per year (minimum incidence of AIDS = 4.6% per year) and other clinical signs of immunodeficiency (lesser AIDS) at 13.1% per year. All 6 of the AIDS cases and at least 8 of the 10 lesser AIDS cases had detectable HTLV-III antibodies 1 week to 21 months before diagnosis. Of 24 other subjects with stable lymphadenopathy, 19 (79%) had or acquired HTLV-III antibodies. Lower helper T-cell counts were very closely related to HTLV-III seropositivity (r = -0.53, p = 0.0001), even in the 26 healthy subjects with no clinical abnormalities (r = -0.37, p = 0.07). In both univariate and multivariate analyses, the lifestyle risk factors for HTLV-III seropositivity were large number of homosexual partners (p less than or equal to 0.03) and receptive anal intercourse (p less than or equal to 0.03), with an apparent synergistic interaction between these two activities (chi 2 = 8.71, p = 0.003). These data suggest that frequent receptive anal intercourse with many homosexual partners predisposes to HTLV-III infection with the consequent emergence of lymphadenopathy and the various manifestations of lesser and fully fledged AIDS.","['N01-CM-37609/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CP-21007/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Y01-CP-50500/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,"['PIP: 036723', 'POP: 00157270']",['PIP'],"['*Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Americas', 'Antibodies', 'Behavior', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Diseases', 'Hiv Infections', '*Homosexuals', 'Immunologic Factors', 'Life Style', 'North America', '*Northern America', 'Population At Risk', 'Prospective Studies', '*Sex Behavior', 'Social Behavior', 'United States', 'Viral Diseases']",['PIP: TJ: LANCET.']

Digestion of the carbohydrate part of gp70 antigens by glycosidase treatment abrogated the precipitation mediated by IgM antibodies, whereas that mediated by IgG antibodies was not markedly affected.

Inocula containing variable numbers of BM or spleen CFUs from 60-day-old and 360-day-old donors were tested. According to their origin, the suspensions differed with respect to the CFU replication rate, the CFU ability to differentiate towards the T lineage and the content of the suspensions in thymic precursors. Two levels of inhibition were observed: BM suspensions from 60-day-old donors containing 1,500 CFUs had the best protective effect: 14.5% of TLS; 1,500 CFUs from 360-day-old donors were slightly but not significantly less efficient (28.5%). The second level of inhibition (36-46% of TLS) was obtained with all the following inocula: a) 1,200 and 300 spleen CFUs or 300 and 95 BM CFUs from 60-day-old donors, b) 1,500 spleen CFUs from aged donors. Seventy-six spleen CFUs from 60-day-old donors, 120 BM or 175 spleen CFUs from aged donors had no effect. These results suggest that in addition to the high replication rate of the BM CFUs as compared with spleen CFUs, cells endowed with an optimal protective effect are present in BM suspensions and are either absent or present in very small amount in spleen suspensions. These cells which induce an early repopulation of the thymus might correspond to thymic precursors.",,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate the expression of this cloned gene in different genomic environments, we introduced it into cell lines derived from fibroblast, lymphoid, and neuronal tissues by DNA-mediated gene transfer. When integrated into the genome of mouse L cells, cell-surface Thy-1 can be detected with anti-Thy-1 monoclonal antibodies. These L-cell lines contain between two and four copies of the cloned Thy-1 gene stably integrated in the host genome. After subcloning into a plasmid vector containing the bacterial Eco-gpt gene as a selectable marker, the Thy-1 gene was introduced into the Thy-1-deficient mouse lymphoma AKR1 (Thy-1-d), and the rat neuronal cell line, B50. The resulting transformants also contain two to four copies of the cloned Thy-1 gene but express up to 50-fold more cell-surface Thy-1.2 than the L cell transformants. The expression of vastly differing amounts of cell-surface Thy-1 from similar numbers of genes suggests that the gene encoding this differentiation antigen is under tissue-specific regulation.","['CA13287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HD18012/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",PMC391740,,,,,,,,

However, during blast crisis, certain cells that morphologically looked like myelocytes, metamyelocytes, and some cells with segmented nuclei stained with anti-PCNA serum. This staining, which remained nuclear in location, was less intense than in blast cells, suggesting low density of the antigen in these nonblast cells.

The diagnosis of this condition is difficult due to the absence of any specific clinical signs or laboratory findings. However, histologic studies have demonstrated a segmental vasculitis that is often necrotic. Ocular findings frequently include choroidal involvement that is characteristic. Nevertheless, angiographic studies of this disease are extremely rare. The findings in three patients suspected of having P.A.N. are presented. Fluorescein angiography established the diagnosis of P.A.N. in two cases and ruled-out its presence in the third case. In the first case angiography demonstrated a retinal vasculitis with multiple arteriolar and capillary occlusions. There was also ischemic involvement of the choriocapillaris and a mild anterior optic nerve vasculitis. All findings resolved, leaving numerous Elschnig spots. In the second case the angiogram showed acute multifocal ischemia of the choriocapillaris. The ocular examination and fluorescein angiogram in the third case were entirely normal, thereby ruling-out P.A.N. on the basis of insufficient criteria. Acute multifocal choroidal ischemia is present in a variety of rare conditions: Toxemia of pregnancy, Disseminated Intravascular coagulopathy, Moskowitz Disease (T.T.P.), Leukemia and Malignant Hypertension. However, the presence of multifocal choroidal ischemia in the presence of a systemic connective tissue disorder strongly favors the diagnosis of P.A.N. The relative contributions of co-existent Malignant Hypertension and P.A.N. in producing choroidal ischemia are discussed. The spectrum of clinical manifestations and laboratory findings in P.A.N. as well as hypotheses concerning pathogenesis (immune-complex deposition) are described. Among all systemic vasculitis , only P.A.N., and rarely Scleroderma, feature choroidal involvement. This is possibly due to the fact that the degree of vasculitis in P.A.N. is sufficiently severe to cause clinically significant choroidal involvement.",,,,,,,,,,

Infection of long-term marrow cultures with this virus led to a dramatic change in the relative numbers of stem cells, granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells and mature cells found in normal haematopoietic cell development. However, although the balance between self-renewal, differentiation and development was disturbed, injection of the cultured cells into irradiated syngeneic recipients did not lead to the development of leukaemia. Thus, although the control had been 'loosened', the host regulatory mechanisms were sufficient to impose a restraint on unlimited growth of the cells. We now show that the stem cells from the src-infected cultures show a remarkably increased capacity for self-renewal in vitro in situations which are inimical to the maintenance of self-renewal in normal uninfected stem cells and that self-renewal/differentiation can be modified by the culture conditions.",,,,,,,,,,

Acute non-lymphocytic leukaemias and the late stages of Hodgkin's disease might be due to such autostimulation. More chronic proliferative diseases (eg, chronic myeloid leukaemia and the early stages of Hodgkin's disease) may involve the expansion of an abnormal, immortalised, clone of pluripotential haemopoietic stem cells or committed haemopoietic progenitor cells that are not autonomous but remain strictly dependent for their proliferation and survival on the presence of exogenous PSF.",,,,,,,,,,

Infection by HTLV-I and HTLV-II retroviruses thus occurs more frequently in ELAS patients and drug addicts than in the UK population as a whole, but the low prevalence of these infections in ELAS and AIDS patients indicates that these two strains of lymphotropic retroviruses have no aetiological role in ELAS and AIDS.",,,,,,,,,,

The efficacy is widely assumed to be related to the high doses of drugs and radiation administered before transplantation. Relapse rates in 31 transplants from monozygotic twins were compared with those in 339 transplants from HLA-identical siblings managed with similar chemoradiotherapy. The actuarial relapse rate in the twins was 59% (95% confidence interval +/- 20%) compared with 18 +/- 4% in the non-twin siblings. The high relapse rate in identical twins may be related to the absence of graft-versus-host disease after transplantation. If success depends substantially on the immunotherapeutic effect of allogeneic bone-marrow, only limited benefit can be expected from autotransplantation and intensification chemotherapy for AML.","['CA 23175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR00865/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

On a combination of a convenient and rapid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a more sensitive electroblot (Western) assay, 100% of the AIDS sera were scored positive. Similarly, 84% of the lymphadenopathy patients were found to have serum antibodies to HTLV-III. A lower, but significant, proportion (21%) of healthy homosexual men with an increased risk of AIDS were also positive. No heterosexual controls, including those with heterophile antibodies during the course of infectious mononucleosis and patients with T-cell or B-cell lymphoma, had antibodies to HTLV-III. The results strongly indicate that the antibodies to HTLV-III are diagnostic of AIDS or indicate significant risk of the disease, and suggest that HTLV-III is the primary cause of human AIDS.",,,,,,,,,,

The two cell lines, EL4 (G-) which is not virus infected and the MuLV-producing subline EL4G +, had the same cytographic size distribution and a doubling time of twenty-four hours. Reflective of the morphological similarities, the expression of the T-cell specific alloantigen Thy 1.2 for the two lines did not differ. In contrast to the Thy 1.2 expression, antibody-detectable H-2Kb and H-2Db activity was much greater on the MuLV-producing EL4G + subline as indicated by fewer cells needed to remove 50% of the cytotoxic activity of the antibody ( AD50 ). Comparison of the EL4(G-) AD50 / EL4G +AD50 ratio indicated an increase in H-2b antigen expression on EL4G + of 15.6 fold for H-2Kb and 7.81 fold for H-2Db. To investigate the possibility of a selective association between MuLV and EL4G + H-2 antigens, the specific activity for H-2Kb, H-2Db and Thy 1.2 of EL4G + membrane and MuLV preparations obtained from EL4G + cultures was compared. The relative proportion of (Thy 1: H-2Kb: H-2Db) in membrane preparation was (1.14:2.45:1.95) compared to the proportion (0.31:3.15:0.95) in virus preparations. Although the amount of Thy-1 activity was markedly elevated in the virus preparation, H-2b antigenic activities were not significantly different in the two preparations. These data are consistent with an active association of lymphoid surface glycoproteins and MuLV, and suggest an association between productive MuLV infection and an increase in the expression of H-2 antigens in the EL4G + cell cultures.","['CA15338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18609/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Ligands attached to glycophorin were, therefore, cleared from the cell surface more slowly than Concanavalin A. In nondifferentiating cells, immunoelectron microscopy showed that spectrin is largely excluded from coated pits. After erythroid differentiation proceeded for several days, glycophorin was totally excluded from the coated pits along with spectrin.

Glutamate formed from glutamine by phosphate-dependent glutaminase undergoes quantitative transamination by aerobic tumor mitochondria to yield aspartate. However, when malate is also added there is a pronounced decrease in aspartate production and a large formation of citrate and alanine, in both state 3 and 4 conditions. In contrast, addition of malate to normal rat heart, liver, or kidney mitochondria oxidizing glutamate causes a marked increase in aspartate production. Further analysis showed that extramitochondrial malate is oxidized almost quantitatively to pyruvate + CO2 by NAD(P)+-linked malic enzyme, present in the mitochondria of all tumors tested, but absent in heart, liver, and kidney mitochondria. On the other hand intramitochondrial malate generated from glutamate is oxidized quantitatively to oxalacetate by mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase of tumors. Acetyl-CoA derived from extramitochondrial malate via pyruvate and oxalacetate derived from glutamate via intramitochondrial malate are quantitatively converted into citrate, which is extruded. No evidence was found that malic enzyme of tumor mitochondria converts glutamate-derived malate into pyruvate as postulated in other reports.

In all four species, tiazofurin, given as a single bolus iv injection, is removed from the circulation in a triphasic manner, with a generally prolonged terminal half-life. In all cases, the mean concentration of unchanged drug prevailing during this terminal phase was well within the cytotoxic range (IC50 vs. P388 cells is 2 microM in vitro). Urinary excretion accounted for between approximately 40 and 90% of the administered dose in all four species, with only minor quantities (less than 3%) of drug-derived radioactivity detected in the feces. The metabolism of tiazofurin was examined in mice and rats: although no evidence was uncovered for hydroxylation of tiazofurin at carbon atom 5 of the thiazole ring, phosphorylation of the drug at its 5'-hydroxyl was demonstrable in nearly every organ of both species, but, liver, striated muscles, and kidney were the only tissues catalyzing the synthesis of thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide to any prominent degree. This synthesis did not appear to be a saturated process, even at doses as high as 8000 mg/m2. Since rodent skeletal muscle accumulated high concentrations of tiazofurin phosphates in vivo, it is suggested that musculature may serve as a reservoir for the drug, and contribute to its rather protracted terminal half-life in plasma.",['N01-CM-97264/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

In mice, reconstitution of hemopoiesis can be achieved by transfusion of peripheral blood cells only. The same result can be obtained in dogs and probably in baboons. In dogs, experiments with fresh and cryopreserved blood mononuclear cells have confirmed a dose-response relationship--below a certain number of mononuclear cells failure of hemopoietic reconstitution can be predicted. In man, isolated anecdotal case reports suggest that pluripotential stem cells in the circulation may or may not be valuable in repopulating a bone marrow defective as a result of primary disease or following chemotherapy. Indirect evidence from in vitro culture of circulating myeloid progenitor cells suggests but does not prove that pluripotential stem cells circulate in normal man.

However, L12 cells contained two major p53-specific mRNA species of a substantially larger size (3.5 and 6.5 kilobases) than the p53-specific mRNA in the p53-producing cells. Genomic DNA analysis uncovered an apparent alteration in the 5' proximal part of only one p53 gene, which is unique to the L12 cell line. It is thus possible that the nonproducer phenotype of L12 cells is due at least in part to an alteration within a p53-specific DNA sequence. These findings define a system in which production of p53 appears to be efficiently regulated at the level of stable mRNA and which can be used to study the mechanisms controlling p53 expression in Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed cells.",,PMC368735,,,,,,,,

This was accompanied by a pronounced increase in the percentage of HLA-DR + T cells, and functionally by increased suppressor T cell activity and decreased helper T cell activity and T cell proliferation. These alterations in T cell subsets and functions were not observed in 6 patients who were kept CMV-negative by a deliberate transfusion policy. In the 6 patients helper T cell activity and T cell proliferation capacity recovered well after day 30. Differences between the two groups were most striking 60 days after BMT.

In addition, a variant of the P388 leukemia rendered resistant to the drug in vitro, and maintaining stable resistance in vivo, P388/TR, was also studied. Intraperitoneal administration of tiazofurin (100 mg/kg) resulted in a 3- to 30-fold greater accumulation of thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide (TAD), the proposed active metabolite of the drug in S versus R lines. In general, levels of TAD, percent inhibition of IMP dehydrogenase (mean 40% in S versus 10% in R), depression in the concentration of guanosine nucleotides, (50% in S versus 20% in R) and percent elevation of levels of IMP (500% in S versus 60% in R) correlated well with sensitivity or resistance. However, the B16 melanoma, although resistant to tiazofurin treatment, showed certain biochemical features characteristic of an S line. The sensitive and resistant tumors displayed comparable abilities to phosphorylate tiazofurin, but there was significant depression only in the R lines of the pyrophosphorylase which converts tiazofurin-5'-monophosphate to TAD (mean 78 nmoles/mg protein/hr in S versus 22 nmoles/mg protein/hr in R). The naturally resistant tumors were also found to exhibit a greater ability to degrade synthetic TAD than the sensitive lines (mean 102 nmoles/mg protein/hr in R versus 29 nmoles/mg protein/hr in S lines). The state of sensitivity or resistance could not be attributed to the basal levels of IMP dehydrogenase, to the specific activities of the enzymes of purine salvage, or to the basal concentration of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides. Moreover, treatment with tiazofurin did not influence the enzymes of TAD synthesis or of purine salvage.",,,,,,,,,,

Immunotoxins were prepared by linking monoclonal anti-Thy 1.1 antibodies to PAP and ricin A chain through a disulfide bond. Both the conjugates were shown earlier to specifically inhibit protein synthesis of Thy 1.1-positive target leukemic cells (AKR SL3). In the present study, the efficacy of the immunotoxins to prevent the growth of AKR SL3 cell-induced tumor was checked in vivo in a model system. Injection of AKR SL3 cells s.c. into AKR/Cum (Thy 1.2-positive) mice developed into a solid tumor which was fatal. Administration of 31-E6:PAP and 31-E6:ricin A chain suppressed tumor growth. Suppression was specific, as similar treatment could not prevent the growth of a nontarget Thy 1.2-positive leukemia cell line (AKR SL1) derived from a congenic mouse. Unconjugated anti-Thy 1.1 immunoglobulin antibodies also showed significant tumor protection; however, administration of F(ab')2 fragment could not prevent the tumor growth. Injection of F(ab')2:PAP efficiently protected mice from AKR SL3-induced tumor. All the conjugate-treated mice showed antibody response against the toxin polypeptide. Anti-toxin antibody response was found as early as 26 days after the initiation of therapy and lasted as long as 179 days of observation. Further studies indicate that the presence of anti-toxin antibodies blocked completely the inhibitory ability of the respective immunotoxin in vitro. Anti-ricin antibodies neutralized the activity of 31-E6:ricin A chain conjugate but not OX-7:PAP immunotoxin, and similarly, anti-PAP antibodies inhibited the activity of the latter and not the activity of 31-E6:ricin A chain conjugate. These observations indicate that the use of alternate immunotoxins having an immunologically distinct toxin polypeptide may be necessary for tumor therapy during relapse, as exposure to the conjugates results in the formation of specific neutralizing anti-toxin antibodies. The anti-toxin antibodies did not prevent the binding of immunotoxin to target cells. Nevertheless, preincubation of conjugate with anti-toxin antibodies specifically blocked the respective conjugate-induced inhibition of polyuridylic acid translation in a cell-free assay system.",['CA 29889/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

That the active form of this agent is a nucleotide and that the nucleotide is formed by the action of hypoxanthine (guanine) phosphoribosyltransferase were shown by the facts that (a) L1210 cells deficient in hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase were insensitive to the analog; (b) hypoxanthine, but not adenine, prevented the formation of the analog nucleotide by enzyme preparations containing activities of both hypoxanthine and adenine phosphoribosyltransferases; and (c) the cytotoxicity of the analog was prevented by hypoxanthine. The ribonucleoside of this analog was not toxic to cell cultures and hence is not phosphorylated or cleaved to the base. In intact HEp-2 cells and L1210 cells, the analog was metabolized to the nucleoside 5'-phosphate which accumulated to concentrations as high as 1000 nmoles/10(9) cells; no di- or triphosphates were detected. In HEp-2 cells, the analog reduced the pools of purine nucleotides with some accumulation of IMP. The toxicity of minimal inhibitory concentrations of the analog to HEp-2 cells could be prevented or reversed by 4(5)-amino-5(4)-imidazolecarboxamide (AIC); the toxicity of higher concentrations could be prevented or reversed by a combination of adenine and guanosine but not by AIC. The analog inhibited the incorporation of formate into purine nucleotides and into macromolecules at concentrations that had no effect on utilization of hypoxanthine; at higher concentrations the incorporation of hypoxanthine was inhibited. Low concentrations also inhibited the utilization of uridine and thymidine. The incorporation of hypoxanthine and AIC into guanine nucleotides, but not adenine nucleotides, was inhibited. These results indicate two sites of inhibition of the biosynthesis of purine nucleotides, the more sensitive one being on an early step of the pathway and the less sensitive one on the IMP-GMP conversion. That the blockade of de novo synthesis probably was at the site of feedback inhibition was indicated by the fact that the analog inhibited the accumulation of formylglycinamide ribonucleotide in azaserine-treated cells but did not inhibit the synthesis of 5'-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate. Comparative studies were performed with the related analog, 2-amino-6-chloropurine, which has been reported to produce a similar dual blockade of the purine pathway. This purine was less toxic than its 1-deaza analog; it produced a modest decrease in adenine nucleotides but increased pools of guanine nucleotides.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,,

These monoclonal antibodies, which were previously prepared against first-trimester human fetal cells, reacted with several human brain tissue tumors such as neuroblastoma, glioma, and leiomyosarcoma through a common differentiation antigen, Thy-1. The conjugates were tested in vitro for their cytotoxic effects on a neuroblastoma cell line LA-N-I. The conjugate maintained its full drug and antibody activities. Moreover, the specific conjugate exhibited a higher efficacy in inhibition of RNA synthesis and was more cytotoxic than the nonspecific Ig-drug conjugate. Fluorescent microscopy showed that the specific conjugate was able to penetrate the cell membrane. Both the specific antibody and the drug were also observed to accumulate in the cell nucleus. Flow microfluorometric analysis of cellular DNA traverse showed that the specific antibody-drug conjugate caused a higher accumulation of neuroblastoma cells in stage G2 of the cell cycle than did the free drug, perhaps indicating a more efficient prevention of the progression of cells through mitosis.",,,,,,,,,,

Moderate to severe (grades II-IV) GvHD was totally prevented. 2 of 13 evaluable patients showed mild (grade I) skin GvHD only. Although peripheral blood recovery was slower than that obtained with other forms of GvHD prophylaxis, no fatal infections occurred. All patients survived the early post-transplant period.",,,,,,,,,,

A significant and dose-dependent reduction of spleen weights of the RMLV-infected mice treated with (2'-5') ApApA was also observed. The antileukaemic effect of (2'-5-') ApApA was enhanced by simultaneous i.p. injection of amphotericin B (20 micrograms/mouse).

The proliferative stage of the cell determined the dUTPase activity rather than the phenotypic origin of the population. This was demonstrated with peripheral blood lymphocytes: the activity of dUTPase in resting cells was very low and a 15- to 27-fold increase took place during mitogenic stimulation. Mitogens slightly enhanced the uracil-DNA glycosylase activity. The physiological roles of these enzymes may be connected with their subcellular location. The subcellular distributions of the enzymes were different; uracil-DNA glycosylase was most abundantly present near to cellular DNA, i.e., in nuclei, but dUTPase was nearly exclusively a cytoplasmic enzyme.",,,,,,,,,,

Leukemia cells that contained Thy 1.1 antigen were selectively killed compared to Thy 1.2-containing cells. The composition of the conjugates was determined by radioimmunoassay, and most of the immunotoxins contained about equal molar quantities of antibody and ribosomal inhibitor. Ricin A chain linked to antibody by a noncleavable m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester cross-link was not cytotoxic, but PAP coupled to the same antibody was. Both immunotoxins linked by a cleavable disulfide bond were cytotoxic. Disulfide-linked F(ab')2-PAP was cytotoxic, but it was about 45 times less efficient than disulfide-linked IgG-PAP. There was only a 3.2-fold difference in their ability to inhibit ribosomes in vitro. The relative difference between in vitro action and cytotoxicity could be accounted for by differences in the affinity of the immunotoxins to the cell surface. Neither PAP or ricin A chain disulfide linked to a monoclonal antibody against Mr 15,000 envelope protein, a murine leukemia virus coat protein, were not cytotoxic, although both conjugates bound to the cell surface. Because of its stability, ease of purification, and lack of an analogue of ricin B chain, PAP may be more useful than ricin A for immunotoxin synthesis.",['CA 29889/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The increase was specific for glucocorticoid receptor ligands. A direct correlation was found between the magnitude of glucocorticoid-mediated increase of GS activity and the cellular levels of specific glucocorticoid receptors assayed in the same cell specimen. Moreover, the basal levels of the enzyme measured in cells prior to exposure to dexamethasone correlated negatively with receptor density.

Coupling was accomplished in up to 85% yield by the use of the peptide bond forming reagent diethyl phosphorocyanidate at room temperature. The products were found to bind bacterial (Lactobacillus casei) and mammalian (L1210 mouse leukemia) dihydrofolate reductase with an affinity comparable to methotrexate and were also equitoxic to L1210 cells in culture. Cytotoxicity increased up to 3-fold as the number of CH2 groups in the amino acid side chain was extended from two to five. The alpha-aminoadipate and alpha-aminopimelate analogues were poor substrates for carboxypeptidase G1, confirming that this enzyme has a strict requirement for a C-terminal L-glutamic acid residue. The in vivo antitumor activity of the chain-extended analogues against L1210 leukemia in mice was comparable to that of the parent drug on the qd X 9 schedule, but higher doses were required to achieve the same increase in survival. The results were consistent with findings, reported separately, that these compounds are poor substrates for folate polyglutamate synthetase and therefore would not be expected to form gamma-polyglutamates once they enter a cell.

When HL-60 cells were exposed to compounds that induce maturation, consistent alterations in purine metabolism were found to occur within 24 h of culture. Perturbation of guanosine nucleotide synthesis and decreases of up to 50% in intracellular guanylate pool sizes were associated with the induced maturation of these cells in response to diverse inducing agents. While immature HL-60 cells were observed to synthesize purine nucleotides by both de novo and salvage pathways, the activity of both pathways decreased in cells induced to mature, although the relative contribution of purine salvage increased. Moreover, incorporation of the salvage pathway precursor, [14C]hypoxanthine from the intermediate, inosine monophosphate (IMP), into guanylates was reduced by approximately 65% in induced HL-60 cells, reflecting decreased activity of both hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase and IMP dehydrogenase. When various inhibitors of IMP dehydrogenase (mycophenolic acid, 3-deazaguanosine, and 2-beta-D-ribofuranosylthiazole-4-carboxamide) were evaluated for their effects upon HL-60 cells, each agent was found to induce the cells to mature morphologically and functionally. Like other inducers, these agents decreased HL-60 cell proliferation and caused the cells to acquire an ability to phagocytose opsonized yeast and reduce nitroblue tetrazolium. Each agent reduced intracellular guanosine nucleotide pool sizes and induced HL-60 cell maturation at micromolar concentrations. These observations suggest that the size of intracellular guanosine nucleotide pools, the biosynthesis of guanosine nucleotides, and the activity of IMP dehydrogenase may be central to the regulation of terminal maturation in myeloid cells.",,PMC437028,,,,,,,,

The specific activities and kinetic constants of the ecto-ATPase of the cell preparations were determined with [gamma-32P] adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as substrate. B-enriched lymphocytes had nearly fourfold greater specific activity and apparent Vmax than T-enriched lymphocytes, while the Km values of both cell types showed no significant difference. The specific activities and kinetic constants of the ecto-ATPase of the CLL PBL were significantly higher than the corresponding values of PBL or of B-enriched lymphocytes. Judging from the kinetic constants the ecto-ATPase of the CLL-B lymphocyte appears to be an enzyme that is distinctly different from that of the normal B cell. On the basis of the kinetic properties, the ecto-ATPase of the B cell appears to be identical with that of the T cell.

At a concentration of greater than or equal to 1 nm, this agent was found both to decrease HL-60 cell proliferation and to cause the cells to acquire an ability to phagocytose opsonized yeast and to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium dye, functions characteristic of mature myeloid cells. In addition, this agent at similar concentrations caused a marked depression of intracellular guanosine nucleotide pools and a reduction in the incorporation of [14C] hypoxanthine into guanylates. These results suggested that the selenazole nucleoside caused an inhibition of inosinate monophosphate dehydrogenase, a key enzyme of guanylate biosynthesis. We therefore measured the activity of this enzyme indirectly by simultaneous-UV-radioactivity HPLC as well as by a direct radiometric method and demonstrated markedly reduced enzyme activities by both assays in drug treated cells. Dose response studies indicated that concentrations of drug which caused greater than 30% inhibition of IMP dehydrogenase activity induced greater than 50% maturation of the cells.

Analysis of the stained cells on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) apparatus revealed that 10 to 30% of spleen or BM cells of TLI-treated mice were TL+ cells whereas no TL+ cells could be found in the same organs in the normal untreated mice. The appearance of TL+ cells in the spleen and BM of TLI-treated mice was found to be thymic independent, as thymectomy of mice neither prevented nor altered the kinetics of TL+ cell appearance.

Two enzyme activities of leukemia cells were significantly higher than those of cells from healthy subjects, irrespective of total and differential counts of leukemic cells. Upon anion-exchange chromatography, the arylsulfatases of chronic myelogenous leukemia cells and normal leukocytes were separated into the basic B enzyme and its anionic variant (B1) and A enzyme. However, the amount of B1 enzyme relative to B enzyme or the activity ratio of B1 enzyme to total arylsulfatase B (B + B1) was higher in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells than in normal cells. The anionic property of the enzyme was found to be due to phosphate groups bound to the carbohydrate moiety of the arylsulfatase, based on the following results. When B1 enzyme was treated with alkaline phosphatase followed by isoelectric focusing, it was changed to a less anionic enzyme with heterogeneous components which are ascribed to phosphodiester groups linked to the heterogeneous carbohydrate moiety of the enzyme; no effect was observed by sialidase treatment. Upon treatment of B1 enzyme with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H, which cleaves sugar chains of a high mannose type in glycoproteins, the anionic heterogeneous components were converted to the basic component similar to B enzyme. From our present and previous observations, it can be concluded that the increase of phosphorylated forms of the lysosomal hydrolase represents one characteristic of rapidly proliferating neoplastic cells.",,,,,,,,,,

Seven of eight cases of T-CLL were DAP IV-positive, whereas all B-CLL cases like normal B-cells were invariably enzyme-negative. Parallel studies with OKT antibodies and Fc receptors showed that the cases positive to DAP IV also revealed OKT4 reactivity and, to some extent, Fc IgM receptor. In a single DAP IV-negative T-CLL with azurophilic granules, the leukemic cells were shown to be reactive for OKT8 and bore Fc IgG receptor.

Stereological methods were applied to assess relative and absolute values concerning the whole cell and nuclear and cytoplasmic components of the average cell in each population, and comparisons were made between the morphologically and immunologically defined subsets. The CLL-lymphocyte possessed the smallest cell volume, a high nucleo-cytoplasmic volume ratio, densely packed heterochromatin, a small nucleolar volume and a sparse Golgi complex. The 7 B-derived cases were characterized by a larger volume of rough ER and a more irregular plasma membrane than the two T-derived cases, which typically displayed dense granules in paranuclear aggregations. The prolymphocyte could be distinguished from the CLL-cell by its larger cell volume, lower nucleo-cytoplasmic volume ratio, proportionally lesser heterochromatin, typically condensed at the periphery and around a prominent nucleolus. All 4 cases of PLL were of B-nature and shared the features of B-CLL regarding increased rough ER and low content of granules. The hairy cell exhibited the largest cell volume, the lowest nucleo-cytoplasmic volume ratio, an indented nucleus and a remarkable irregular cellular surface with long ""hairy"" processes. The cytoplasmic inclusions of ribosome-lamella complexes were recorded exclusively in hairy cells, in half of the patients. The centrocyte was characterized by a cell volume of intermediate size, a high nucleo-cytoplasmic volume ratio and the highest degree of nuclear irregularity recorded. The amount of rough ER was considerably less than in B-CLL and B-PLL. Finally, the blast from the cases of lymphoblastic lymphoma, all of T-nature, displayed a smooth plasma membrane, a high euchromatin-heterochromatin volume ratio and dense granules, characteristically clustered in the vicinity of the Golgi complex. Stereology on the ultrastructure of malignant lymphoid cells provides a more accurate characterization and may be helpful in classification.",,,,,,,,,,

Chromosomal damage was determined in vitro on lymphocytes stimulated with concanavalin A (Con A) and incubated for two generation cycles with bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR). The baseline frequency of SCEs was significantly higher in untreated BALB/Mo than in BALB/c lymphocytes. The frequencies of SCEs were significantly increased by increasing doses of MMC in both BALB/c and BALB/Mo T lymphocytes. Treatment with a low dose of MMC (0.3 mg/kg) produced an additive effect on SCE frequency in BALB/Mo lymphocytes, which was gradually suppressed by increasing the MMC concentration (3-5 mg/kg). Indeed, the levels of SCEs became significantly lower in BALB/Mo than in BALB/c lymphocytes at the highest MMC concentration tested (10 mg/kg), indicating that a negative synergistic effect was eventually produced. Chromosomal aberrations (breaks and total aberrations) were significantly increased by the highest MMC doses (5-10 mg/kg) and were more frequent in BALB/Mo than in BALB/c lymphocytes at 10 mg/kg MMC. The frequencies of micronuclei were increased by all MMC doses and were significantly higher in BALB/Mo than in BALB/c lymphocytes at 10 mg/kg MMC. These results are referred to interferences of M-MuLV and MMC with the function of enzymes, such as DNA topoisomerases, involved in the mechanism of SCE production.",,,,,,,,,,

It is not yet certain whether transplants in first remission will result in higher survival rates than transplants in second remission; relapse rates were similar in the two groups.",['N01-AI-22669/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The present studies have examined the toxicity, and in some cases, metabolism, of CdA in (1) multiple established human cell lines of varying phenotype, (2) leukemia and lymphoma cells taken directly from patients, (3) normal bone marrow cells, and (4) normal peripheral blood lymphocytes. Nanomolar concentrations of CdA blocked the proliferation of lymphoblastoid cell lines with a high ratio of deoxycytidine kinase to deoxynucleotidase. The drug had virtually no effect on the growth of cell lines derived from solid tissues. The CdA inhibited the spontaneous uptake of tritiated thymidine by many T and non-T, non-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell specimens at concentrations less than or equal to 5 nM. The same concentrations did not impair either thymidine uptake or granulocyte-monocyte colony formation by normal bone marrow cells. In common with deoxyadenosine, but unlike several other agents affecting purine and purine metabolism, CdA was lethal to resting normal T lymphocytes and to slowly dividing malignant T cells. In both resting and proliferating lymphocytes, the CdA was phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase and entered a rapidly turning over nucleotide pool. Dividing lymphocytes also incorporated abundant CdA into DNA. The selective toxicity of CdA toward both dividing and resting lymphocytes may render the drug useful as an immunosuppressive or antileukemic agent.","['CA 31497/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 23200/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'RR 00833/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

The allogenic reaction results in severe depletion of T-lymphocytes, but causes hyperplasia and hypersecretion of B-cells. Among the long-term survivors of acute host versus graft reactions, there is a high incidence of nonthymic lymphomas associated with ecotropic murine leukemia virus that may be of donor F1 origin. The present studies were done to determine whether ecotropic murine leukemia virus played any role in the pathogenesis of acute host versus graft disease in RFM mice perinatally inoculated with (T6 X RFM)F1 spleen cells. In RFM/(T6 X RFM)F1 chimeras, N-tropic murine leukemia virus can be detected as early as 3 days. The progression of the disease was accompanied by increasing viral expression. The inoculation of N-tropic virus of F1 donor origin into RFM neonates failed to induce disease, although the virus proliferated. Detection of progressively rising titers of antibody to murine leukemia virus linked the virus to the development of hyperimmunoglobulinemia by virtue of its ability to serve as a replicating source of antigens. These and other studies provided evidence that the seemingly paradoxical appearance of hyperimmunoglobulinemia in T-cell-deficient mice with the host versus graft syndrome is due, at least in part, to the stimulation of presensitized F1 donor B-cells, which are not destroyed in the allogenic reaction, as are the T-cells. Another unusual finding was the detection of polytropic murine leukemia virus in 25-day-old RFM/(T6 X RFM)F1 chimeras. It is suggested that the allogenic host versus graft reaction favored the formation of recombinants.",,PMC264680,,,,,,,,

T-cells were Acph+, ATPase- and 5'N-. The vast majority of T- and B-cells displayed ANAE and B-G activities with two distinct staining patterns (T-like and B-like pattern). A high proportion of lymphoid cells in the germinal centre (G.C.) and the vast majority of lymphoid cells in the mantle-zone (M.Z.) were shown to belong to B-cell system because of the expression of ATPase and 5'N in their membranes. Some lymphoid cells positive for ANAE and B-G with a B-like pattern and for AcPh were recognizable in the G.C. In the M.Z. only a few lymphoid cells being ANAE+, with a T-like pattern, and AcPh+ were shown to belong to the T-cell system. In contrast, in this zone a high proportion of small lymphoid cells (64% +/- 10%) showed ANAE activity, mostly with B-like pattern. Therefore, these findings indicate that in the M.Z. a high proportion of B-cells ATPase+ and 5'N+ also display ANAE activity. By comparison of the results obtained from lymphoid tissue sections, B-CLL and immunocytoma cell suspensions and normal circulating lymphocytes we can conclude that B-ANAE-positive cells of the M.Z. do not usually appear in the peripheral blood. They circulate in large numbers only in some pathological conditions (like our reported B-CLL). Therefore, B-ANAE-positive lymphoid cells of the mantle, with a B-like staining pattern, include a wide range of subsets which exclude large lymphoid cells and plasma cells.",,,,,,,,,,

Cells from patients with ADA deficiency contain less than normal, and sometimes undetectable, amounts of ADA catalytic activity and ADA protein. The molecular defects responsible for hereditary ADA deficiency are poorly understood. ADA messenger RNAs and their translation products have been characterized in seven human lymphoblast cell lines derived as follows: GM-130, GM-131, and GM-2184 from normal adults; GM-3043 from a partially ADA deficient, immunocompetent !Kung tribesman; GM-2606 from an ADA deficient, immunodeficient child; CCRF-CEM and HPB-ALL from leukemic children. ADA messenger (m)RNA was present in all lines and was polyadenylated. The ADA synthesized by in vitro translation of mRNA from each line reacted with antisera to normal human ADA and was of normal molecular size. There was no evidence that posttranslational processing of ADA occurred in normal, leukemic, or mutant lymphoblast lines. Relative levels of specific translatable mRNA paralleled levels of ADA protein in extracts of the three normal and two leukemic lines. However, unexpectedly high levels of ADA specific, translatable mRNA were found in the mutant GM-2606 and GM-3043 lines, amounting to three to four times those of the three normal lines. Differences in the amounts of ADA mRNA and rates of ADA synthesis appear to be of primary importance in maintaining the differences in ADA levels among lymphoblast lines with structurally normal ADA. ADA deficiency in at least two mutant cell lines is not caused by deficient levels of translatable mRNA, and unless there is some translational control of this mRNA, the characteristic cellular ADA deficiency is most likely secondary to synthesis and rapid degradation of a defective ADA protein.",['HD-15036/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],PMC370370,,,,,,,,

The pathogenesis of vasculitis in B/W F1 mice is due to the deposition of circulating murine leukemia virus (MuLV) gp70-immune complexes in the subendothelial space of vascular walls. Whereas, the vasculitis in SL/Ni mice is mediated by the budding of MuLV particles from vascular smooth muscle cells and the humoral immune response (Gross natural antibody) to virions and MuLV related cell surface antigens of vascular smooth muscle cells. The vasculitis in MRL/1 mice seems to be mediated mainly by the deposition of gp 70-immune complexes in vascular walls. However, the perivascular infiltration of thy1 . 2 antigen positive T-lymphocytes in an early stage of vasculitis suggests that the cellular immune response is, at least in part, important for the initiation of vasculitis in MRL/1 mice. The collective evidence suggests that several immunologic mechanisms are at works in the production of naturally occurring vasculitides in B/W F1, SL/Ni, and MRL/1 mice. The common pathogenesis of glomerulonephritis in B/W F1, SL/Ni and MRL/1 mice is the deposition of circulating gp70-immune complexes in the glomeruli. In addition, in the case of SL/Ni mice, glomerulonephritis is in some part initiated by local formations of the immune complex in the mesangium. The occurrence of vasculitis in MRL/1 mice is markedly accelerated by the treatment of methoxamine hydrochloride (Mexan), as was shown previously in SL/Ni mice.",,,,,,,,,,

The biological and physicochemical properties of glucocorticoid receptors in CEM-C1 cells were compared to those from a clone (CEM-C7) sensitive to glucocorticoid-mediated lysis. In a whole-cell binding assay, CEM-C1 cells exhibited high affinity for [3H]dexamethasone (Kd, 22 nM), nuclear translocation of steroid:receptor complex (nt, 43%) and were found to contain, on the average, 12,000 receptor sites/cell (R0). These steroid-binding parameters were similar to those displayed by wild-type CEM-C7 cells: Kd, 19 nM; nt, 47%; and R0, approximately 14,000 sites/cell. The ion-exchange and gel permeation profiles were indistinguishable from those of identically treated CEM-C7 cytosols. Thus, diethylaminoethyl cellulose chromatography of CEM-C1 cytosol showed that [3H]triamcinolone acetonide:receptor complex was eluted at 50 mM phosphate and 220 mM phosphate under ""activating"" and ""nonactivating"" conditions, respectively. Receptor complex of activated CEM-C1 cytosol bound to DNA-cellulose and was eluted at 100 mM salt. Filtration of unactivated CEM-C1 cytosol over Sephacryl S-300 generated a single peak of radioactivity for receptor complex with a calculated Stokes' radius of 55 to 59 A. Dexamethasone induced glutamine synthetase in CEM-C1. The dose dependence (50% effective dose, approximately 20 nM) and maximal fold increase (1.9, 1 microM dexamethasone) were comparable to those observed in CEM-C7. Since CEM-C1 cells contain apparently normal, functional cytosolic receptor, the results suggest that resistance to glucocorticoid in these cells involves a defect(s) at another locus.",,,,,,,,,,

Minor variations were seen in the cellular surface contour, the B blast tending to be more irregular than the T blast. Features most predictive of the immunologic cell type were abundant rough ER in B-derived ALL, increasing with plasmacytoid differentiation, and an increase in dense granules which were often clustered in the vicinity of a well-developed Golgi complex in T ALL. The light microscopic criteria of the FAB classification were nearly all confirmed at the EM-level except that nuclear irregularity was observed to the same degree in both categories.

Morphometric measurements included at least 200 megakaryocytes in each case observed in Giemsa-stained semithin sections of resin-embedded core biopsies. Twenty specimens were evaluated from the controls and inflammatory disorders and from each of the following CMPD: 1, chronic granulocytic leukaemia (CGL); 2, polycythaemia vera (P. vera); 3, chronic megakaryocytic-granulocytic myelosis without or with minimal increase in reticulin fibre content (CMGM); 4, myelofibrosis or osteomyelosclerosis (MF/OMS). Megakaryocytes were classified as follows: 1, normal megakaryocytes at all stages of maturation; 2, giant forms; 3, microforms; 4, intussusceptions; 5, a-nuclear cytoplasmic fragments; 6, naked nuclei or necrotic forms. The results of this study demonstrate obvious abnormalities of megakaryopoiesis in addition to the increase in absolute numbers of megakaryocytes per marrow area and their different sizes as reported earlier (Thiele et al. 1982). Aberrations are particularly conspicuous when pure granulocytic proliferation or neoplasia of CGL is compared with the so-called mixed cellularity of megakaryocytes and granulocytes in CMGM including MF/OMS. Abnormalities of the giant forms of megakaryocytes are especially evident and comprise irregular cellular and nuclear perimeters (as calculated by a modified shape factor) in the two latter entities (CMGM-MF/OMS). This remarkable feature is associated with a disorganization of nuclear development and/or a disproportionate nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio which has never been observed in CGL previously. In combination with this striking cellular anomaly, which is compatible with an extreme amoeboid shape of giant forms in CMGM and MF, intussuceptions and a-nuclear cytoplasmic fragments are frequently encountered. The final stage of megakaryopoiesis, i.e. naked nuclei, are increased in number in all CMPD, probably because of enhanced proliferation and platelet shedding. Naked nuclei are often small in CGL (as remnants of the frequent micromegakaryocytes) and large in P. vera and CMGM/MF (depending on the high incidence of giant megakaryocytes in these latter disorders).",,,,,,,,,,

DMSO induced TGase activity of differentiating FL cells in a dose-dependent manner over the concentration range 0-280 mM. The increase in TGase activity was observed after 1 day's cultivation of the cells with 280 mM DMSO and continued to 4 days. Another differentiation inducing agent, butyric acid (1.4 mM), was as effective as DMSO in enhancing TGase activity in FL cells. Treatment of controls, a lymphoma cell line and mouse erythrocytes, with DMSO or butyric acid had no effect. These results suggest that the increase in TGase activity in DMSO- or butyric acid-treated FL cells may be related to cell differentiation.",,,,,,,,,,

Seven days after the fourth serial mouse passage, each mouse was treated with goat immune gamma globulin against K-562 cells. One control group was treated similarly, but with nonimmune (normal) gamma globulin, while another control group was not treated. The goat gamma globulin was not toxic for nude and lasat mice, and the immune, but not the normal, gamma globulin suppressed local subcutaneous growth of myelosarcomas, lymphosarcomas, and Burkitt lymphoma cells. On the other hand, the growth of lung, breast, and prostatic carcinomas and a melanoma of human origin were not altered by the immune gamma globulin. Since suppression of cell growth occurred equally well in decomplemented mice, a complement-mediated cytotoxicity apparently cannot be considered as responsible for the abrogation. The Fab fragment of the immunoglobulin did not suppress the growth of the myelosarcomas. We conclude that antibody suppression of the in vivo proliferation was specific for malignant hematopoietic cells and that the Fc portion of IgG is necessary for in vivo cytolysis of leukemia cells.

The dialogue of the cell-surface membrane between antigen and cell-surface recognition structures is of fundamental importance in the determination of the pathway that leads through a chain of precise, genetically regulated steps of differentiation. This insight of the molecular level has provided the basis for our current thinking. It demonstrates that the cell membrane surfaces are genetically defined and regulated and that immunobiologic mechanisms are fundamentally interconnected. The membrane and its structure serve a very important function, both in terms of conducting biological dialogue at the cell surface and the translation of this dialogue to physiological events that lead to limiting, suppressing, or controlling an immune response, as opposed to permitting, inducing, or overwhelming an immune response. These concepts are aligned with the Burnet's clonal selection theory of immunity. One of the inevitable assumptions of this theory is that heterogeneity of lymphocytes exists at the level of cell-surface antigen receptors. Similarly, the variety of responses, both cell-mediated and humoral, against a specific antigen implies that functional heterogeneity of lymphocytes also exists. Thus, an understanding of the immune system should incorporate those features of lymphocytes which govern immune recognition and those that relate to subsequent immune function. Over the past decade, evidence has been accumulating that there is considerable heterogeneity among lymphoid cell subpopulations. Our current understanding of this degree of heterogeneity largely stems from the discovery of cell-surface markers which are unique to subpopulations of lymphoid cells and the observation that certain specific immunologically mediated events are predominantly, if not exclusively, expressed by some lymphoid cells but not others. These studies have been further extended by the description of the sequential ontogenetic appearance of the cell-surface markers as relation to the acquisition of immune competence. The purpose of this review is to summarize our current knowledge of the cell-surface markers that are present on lymphoid cells.",,,567,,,,,,,

Normal cells express low levels of p21 ras encoded by cellular genes (Ki-ras and Ha-ras) homologous to the Ki and Ha murine sarcoma virus transformation genes. A bone marrow-derived mouse cell line, 416B, has been shown to express unusually high levels of p21 ras. In this manuscript, we investigated the molecular biology of p21 ras gene expression in 416B and other normal mouse cells. We identified four distinct polyadenylated and polysome-associated RNAs, two related to Ki-ras and two to Ha-ras. The levels in 416B cells of the two Ki-ras RNAs, sized 5.2 and 2.0 kilobases, were both elevated approximately 25-fold over levels found in normal mouse cells; there was no corresponding change in 416B cells in the levels of the two Ha-ras RNAs. We partially purified the two Ki-ras mRNAs and separated them by velocity sedimentation in sucrose density gradients. Both the 5.2- and 2.0-kilobase mRNAs could be translated in vitro into p21 ras. These results show that a cellular onc protein can be translated from two distinct cellular mRNA species.",,PMC369938,,,,,,,,

Whereas normal and LLV+ marrow were depleted of CFU-S after three serial transplantations at 14-day intervals, SFFV+ donor marrow exhibited prolonged self-renewal capacity. SFFV+ CFU-S from B6. Fv2rr chimeric mice gave rise to normal erythroid and myeloid progenitor cells and were easily detected and quantified over 17 serial marrow transfers equivalent to 260 cumulative days. Marrow cellularity on day 14 of each transfer remained constant during the entire transplantation time. When SFFV fell below detectable levels at passage 15, CFU-S self-renewal exhibited rapid and total decline. Since the frequency of LLV-infected cells in late marrow transfers rose during the period of CFU-S decline, we conclude that SFFV is directly associated with the triggering of CFU-S self-renewal. It is also suggested that this proliferative event may be a prerequisite for the development of FV-induced leukemia.",,,,,,,,,,

Measurements of IMP dehydrogenase in the tumors of treated mice revealed that this enzyme was inhibited in a dose-responsive way, with approximately 50% inhibition engendered by the administration of the drug at a dose of 25 mg/kg and greater than 90% inhibition by all doses greater than 100 mg/kg. The inhibition of enzyme activity, seen after a dose of 250 mg/kg, reached a maximum 120 min after treatment and had subsided substantially 8 hr after dosing; by 24 hr. enzyme activity was fully restored. These results, coupled with the observation that the antitumor activity of the drug could be prevented in large part by the simultaneous administration of guanosine, support the conclusion that 2-beta-D-ribofuranosylthiazole-4-carboxamide, after anabolism, exerts its antineoplastic effects via a state of guanine nucleotide depletion. In extracts of the tumors of mice given parenteral injections of the thiazole nucleoside, a potent dialyzable inhibitor of IMP dehydrogenase was demonstrable: its concentration fluctuated in parallel with enzyme inhibition. Although the chemical identity of the proximate inhibitory species has yet to be established, it is concluded on kinetic grounds that it is neither the native nucleoside nor its 5'-monophosphate.",,,,,,,,,,

The hairy cells of fifteen of the sixteen patients which were tested with latex showed significant phagocytosis. Cells of thirteen of the seventeen patients showed phagocytosis of staphylococcus; six of the seventeen, phagocytosis of zymosan; and four of seventeen, phagocytosis of pseudomonas. Of the four substances tested, staphylococcus and latex yielded consistently higher numbers of ingested particles per hairy cell than did zymosan or pseudomonas. Observation of serial sections by transmission electron microscopy revealed that each type of particle is fully enclosed within the cytoplasm of the hairy cell. A Lysostaphin assay performed on the hairy cells of two patients showed that lysis of the phagocytosed particles by the hairy cell differs significantly from that by normal mononuclear cells. The results support our earlier study which suggested that hairy cells have phagocytic capabilities which differ not only among patients, but also within a single patient over time.",['CA-19266-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The commonest composite phenotype was HLA-DR+ p30+ CALLA+ p24+. Significant correlations were seen between expression of HLA-DR, p30, and CALLA, but not p24. p30- and CALLA phenotypes were found in patients with high white-blood-cell counts (WBC) and splenomegaly. With standard chemotherapy, disease-free survival from time of remission was shorter in p30- and CALLA- patients than in others. Splenomegaly was associated with poor disease-free survival and provided prognostic information independent of phenotype.

Exposure of the HL60 cells to either TPA or DMF results in decreases in the relative abundancy of translational products with molecular weights of 20,000, 17,000, and 15,000. Exposure of the HL60 cells so as to generate macrophage differentiation results in elevations of translational products with molecular weights of 60,000, 47,000, 42,000, 32,000, 27,000, 14,000, and 12,300, while DMF-induced myeloid differentiation is associated with increases in the abundancy of translational products with molecular weights of 60,000, 42,000, 35,000, 32,000, 27,000, 13,000 and 12,300. The addition of the macrophage inducer TPA to HL60 cells previously exposed to the myeloid inducer DMF results in changes in the relative abundance of several translational products, yielding a pattern which differs quantitatively from that obtained from cells treated with DMF or TPA alone. These changes in the relative abundancies of the HL60 translational products suggest that the steady state levels of several different populations of mRNA or the ability of these mRNAs to be translated are being modified during the induction of myeloid or macrophage differentiation in the HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line.",,,,,,,,,,

The fragiligraphy curves showed that CLL cells are more resistant to osmotic pressure than the CL, whereas the curves for CPMN and CML cells showed an overlap. Surface alterations in CL appeared as early as 1 min of dialysis, while in CLL cells the membrane did not show major alterations even after 5 min of dialysis. CPMN also showed alterations earlier than CML cells, but this difference was not as prominent as in the case of lymphocytes and was observed for a maximum of 3 min of dialysis.

A model for the changes in gamma-glutamyltransferase during leukotriene release is proposed for the cell line, and differences from the guinea pig lung system are reported. Leukotriene C4 is converted to the more potent leukotriene D4 by the action of gamma-glutamyltransferase on guinea pig ileum during bioassay. gamma-Glutamyltransferase may represent a control feature in the biosynthesis of leukotriene D4, and thus be involved in leukotriene-induced bronchoconstriction in the lung.",,PMC346780,,,,,,,,

A review of the 168 cases of acute lymphocytic leukaemia treated at the University Hospital, Kuala Lumpur, since 1968 revealed another instance of coning, which occurred in a patient with CNS leukaemia. 4 of these 7 children with coning and/or uncal herniation did not have papilloedema, and the diagnosis was made only at necropsy. Coning was recognized 48 h after lumbar puncture in 2 children. In the other 5 cases, there was no relation between coning and lumbar puncture.

In addition, 13 cases of chronic myelocytic leukemia in blast crisis were studied. Ultrastructural examination resulted in reclassification of 6 cases of ANLL de novo; two of these were reclassified from M2 (myeloblastic leukemia with maturation) to M3 variant (microgranular variant of hypergranular promyelocytic leukemia). The classification of the cases of CML in blast crisis was identical by light microscopy and TEM. IN 1 case of myeloblastic crisis, however, basophilic granules were demonstrated by TEM but were not appreciated by light microscopy. Classification of the cases of secondary leukemia was possible by light microscopy and cytochemistry in all 14 cases, but was often difficult since the cytochemical reactions were usually less intense than in de novo ANLL.

To characterize the actin molecules before and after differentiation, the actin was purified through three sequential steps: DEAE-sephadex A- 50, polymerization/depolymerization, and sephadex G-150 chromatography. There were no essential differences between the inhibitory activity of actins from control M1 cells and CM-treated M1 cells on both DNase I and heavy meromyosin (HMMM) K(+)-EDTA-ATPase; the same dose response as with skeletal muscle actin took place. After the treatment with CM, however, the specific activity for the activation of HMMM Mg(2+)- ATPase by actin became two-fold that of untreated M1 actin, which was one third of the value for skeletal muscle actin. The V(max) for the control and the CM-treated M1 cell, as well as the skeletal muscle actins, proved to be the same. By contrast, the K(app) values for the control and CM-treated M1-cell actins were 3- and 1.5-fold the value for skeletal-muscle actin. This means that CM treatment of the M1 actin produced a twofold affinity for the Mg(2+)-ATPase of skeletal-muscle myosin. The critical concentrations for polymerization were compared under different salt concentrations and temperatures. Although no marked difference was found for the presence of 2 mM MgCl(2), 0.1 M KCl in place of MgCl(2) at 5 degrees C gave the following values: 0.1 mg/ml for skeletal-muscle actin, 0.7 mg/ml for control M1 actin, 0,5 mg/ml for CM- treated M1 actin, and 1.0 mg/ml for the D(-) subline that is insensitive to CM. Although the critical concentration of D(-) actin is extraordinarily high, this actin showed normal polymerization above the critical concentration. This together with the data presented in our previous paper, that the D(-) actin in the crude extract did not polymerize, suggests that an inhibitor for actin polymerization is present in the subline. The kinetics experiment at 0.1 M KCl and 25 degrees C revealed a slower polymerization of untreated M1- and D(-)-cell actins as compared with CM-treated M1 actin. This delayed polymerization was due to a delay during the nucleation stage, not during the elongation stage. By isoelectric focusing, the ratios of beta- to gamma-actin showed a marked difference depending on the states of cells: about 4.9 for control M1, 2.8 for CM-treated M1, and 7.6 for D(-)-subline actins. Tryptic peptide maps also revealed the presence of different peptides. Thus, the functional differences of actin before and after the differentiation was accompanied by some chemical changes in actin molecules.",,PMC2112838,,,,,,,,

(b) A minimum of three triple bonds is necessary for the inhibitory action. (c) With the 20-carbon delta 8 and delta 6 acetylenic acids, activity decreased when the number of triple bonds increased from three to four. These structure activity relationships were not observed with cyclo-oxygenase. The delta 4 acetylenic acids proved to be an interesting group of compounds.

The potency of the delta 4 acetylenic acids increased with chain length, and 21:4 (4a, 7a, 10a, 13a) was the most potent compound inhibiting SRS formation.

In both strains thymomas arose with short latent periods, comparable with the latencies of nonthymic tumors induced by intraperitoneal injection of A-MuLV and significantly shorter than those of thymomas induced by intrathymic injection of Moloney leukemia virus. Cells of the BALB/c thymomas were predominantly Thy-1-; those of C57BL/Ka thymomas were predominantly Thy-1+. Tissue culture lines were established and cloned. Some of these expressed low amounts of Thy-1 and one also expressed Lyt-1. Virus from cloned lines transformed 3T3 cells in vitro and induced Abelson disease in vivo when injected intraperitoneally into neonates. The A-MuLV p120 protein has been precipitated from metabolically labeled cell lysates of one cloned Thy-1+ line.

Virus replication occurs in cells of the lymphatic system. Lymphoid cells therefore represent the target cells for virus replication and leukemic transformation. To investigate whether virus activation occurs during lymphoid cell differentiation, hematopoietic stem cells carrying the endogenous Mov-1 genome were transplanted to sublethally irradiated BALB/c mice. Effective colonization of the recipients was demonstrated by Southern DNA hybridization. No activation of the endogenous Mov-1 genome occurred during a 4-month observation period after the transplantation. Thus the first step in development of disease in BALB/Mo mice involves activation of the Mov-1 locus in a nonhematopoietic cell followed by superinfection of lymphatic cells and subsequent virus replication and virus spread.",,PMC346083,,,,,,,,

Three male and seven female patients aged 7-34 years received concentrated bone marrow buffy-coat cells which had been incubated with OKT3 before infusion. In-vitro studies confirmed that almost all immunocompetent T lymphocytes in the bone-marrow samples were coated with OKT3 at the time of infusion. In vitro, neonatal rabbit complement inhibited the proliferation of bone-marrow T lymphocytes in samples preincubated with OKT3 to less than 4% of the mitogenic responses of the untreated bone marrow. In contrast, fresh autologous complement did not effectively lyse OKT3-treated bone-marrow cells. Infusion of OKT3-treated bone marrow was safely accomplished, and engraftment was achieved in all patients (mean 23 days). Nine of ten patients survived for more than 100 days after bone-marrow transplantation, but significant acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) requiring treatment with steroids developed in five of the ten. This finding suggests that further modifications for bone-marrow pretreatment will be needed to achieve effective prophylaxis against acute GvHD in histocompatible bone-marrow transplantation.","['P01-CA21373/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA25091/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The remarkable phenotypic divergence in this solitary, nongerm cell neoplasm is unusual but not so surprising in light of the APUD nature and neural crest origin of both the melanocyte and the thyroid C cell, which gives rise to MTC.

In the guinea pig, the leukotrienes released cyclo-oxygenase products from the perfused lung and contracted strips of parenchyma. The effects of SRS-A, SRS and LTD4 were indistinguishable. LTC4 and LTD4 had similar actions although LTD4 was more potent than LTC4. Indomethacin (1 microgram/ml) inhibited the release of cyclo-oxygenase products from perfused guinea-pig lung and caused a marked reduction in contractions of guinea-pig parenchymal strips (GPP) due to LTC4 and LTD4. The residual contraction of the GPP was abolished by FPL 55712 (0.5 - 1.0 microgram/ml). It appears, therefore, that a major part of the constrictor actions of LTC4 and LTD4 in guinea-pig lung are mediated by myotropic cyclo-oxygenase products, i.e. thromboxane A2 (TxA2) and prostaglandins (PGs). In rabbit and rat lung, however, SRS-A, SRS and the leukotrienes were much less potent in contracting parenchymal strips and there was little evidence of the release of cyclo-oxygenase products. FPL 55712 at a concentration of 1 microgram/ml failed to antagonise leukotriene-induced contractions.",,,,,,,,,,

Five patients had severe hypercalcaemia which correlated with disease activity, although osteolytic lesions were found in only one. Other clinical features were lymphadenopathy and a high white blood-cell count (range 27-67 X 10(9)/l) with a predominance of pleomorphic lymphoid cells with pronounced nuclear irregularities prominent at ultrastructural level. The cells in all cases formed rosettes with sheep red blood-cells and lacked terminal transferase. Analysis with OKT monoclonal antibodies in four cases confirmed a mature T-cell phenotype defined as helper/inducer (T4+, T6-, T8-) in three. Combination chemotherapy resulted in short-lived remissions; four patients died and two have survived 3-6 months. The disease in these patients is indistinguishable on clinical and pathological grounds from adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma in Japan. Geographical clustering among certain racial groups suggests common aetiological factors in the pathogenesis of this disease. The finding of high titre antibody against the structural core protein (p24) of a new human C-type leukaemia virus (human T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma virus) in all tested cases from this series and data from all but one case from Japan suggest that one such factor may be viral.",,,,,,,,,,

This increase was dependent on the presence of glucocorticoid receptors and required both RNA and protein synthesis. Removal of dex following stimulation to maximal levels resulted in a decrease of GS activity to preinduced levels with a half-time of 5 hours. Glutamine deprivation of cells resulted in increased GS activity. However, even in the total absence of glutamine, dex treatment elicited a 2.0-2.5-fold increase in GS activity, ruling out inhibition of glutamine uptake as a mechanism for the dex-induced increase. Experiments with 5'-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) demonstrated that GS elevation was sensitive to BrdU substitution of DNA, while dex-induced growth inhibition was not. Therefore GS elevation and growth inhibition in this cell line appear to be independently expressed steroid responses.",,,,,,,,,,

The distribution and amount of this antigen has been measured on 4 human neuronal and 2 neuroglial cell lines and on fresh tumour cells of neuronal origin. In 3 out of 4 neuronal lines (LAN-1, TR14, CHP 212) more than 90% of cells were Thy-1+, however, LAN-1 cells showed only weak immunofluorescence and bore on average 2.4 times fewer molecules of Thy-1 per cell than those of either TR14 or CHP 212. The mean number of Thy-1 molecules per TR14 cell was shown to be approximately 2.25 x 10(5). In contrast, only 66% of cells in the fourth neuronal line (CHP 100) were Thy-1+, although these showed strong immunofluorescence. Both glial cell lines, UCH-203 and H314/123, showed strong Thy-1 immunofluorescence on more than 90% of cells. Similarly, with fresh neuronal tumour cells, although approximately 80% of tumours were Thy-1+ (essentially 100% of cells in these being positive) there were considerable differences in the intensity of labelling by immunofluorescence between different tumours. Such heterogeneity in cell lines and malignancy may reflect normal in vivo variation. Different phenotypes might therefore represent separate neural cell lineages, or simply differences in maturational status within a lineage. The very low frequency of Thy-1+ cells in normal bone marrow (less than 0.1% of nucleated cells) indicates that anti-Thy-1 antibodies may be valuable in both the diagnosis and subsequent treatment of neuroblastoma.",,,,,,,,,,

Of most importance has been major histocompatibility complex (MHC) linked Ir genes. The MHC genes have been demonstrated to be the prime factor in determination of the ability to respond to an antigenic stimulus. One of the more intriguing findings has been the capacity of a relatively small number of Ir genes to determine immune reactivity to a diverse collection of antigens. This review will deal with the extent of the antigen diversity and the nature of the antigenic determinants. Data are summarized for over 100 independent antigen systems involving infectious agents (bacteria, viruses, parasites), as well as living but not infectious agents (histoincompatible cells). Finally, the more recent findings utilizing antigenically defined (to varying degrees) proteins are presented. The contributions of each antigen type to the understanding of Ir gene function are discussed.

In the serum-containing culture medium, SL-1250 was rapidly deacylated to 4-carbamoylimidazolium 5-olate (SM-108). Thus, SL-1250 might be acting on the cells in the form of SM-108. The growth of L5178Y cells was completely inhibited by 10(-5) M SL-1250. It should be noted that this growth inhibition was significantly reversed in the presence of equimolar concentrations of guanine, guanosine, or guanosine 5'-monophosphate to those of SL-1250. However, hypoxanthine and xanthine were not effective. These effects of purine addition were observed to be quite similar in growth inhibition by SM-108. It was found that inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.14; IMP dehydrogenase), a key enzyme of de novo purine synthesis, from Ehrlich carcinoma cells was inhibited by SM-108 only when 5-phospho-alpha-D-ribose 1-diphosphate (PRPP) and MgCl2 coexisted with SM-108. In contrast, a chemically synthetic ribonucleotide of SM-108 inhibited IMP dehydrogenase without PRPP and MgCl2, and the mode of inhibition was competitive with the Ki value of 2 x 10(-8) M. On the other hand, the inhibition of either growth of L5178Y cells or IMP dehydrogenase in the presence of PRPP and MgCl2 by these compounds was reversed by adenine. A nucleotide of SM-108 was chromatographically identified when [14C]SM-108 was incubated in the enzyme solution with PRPP and MgCl2. This conversion by enzyme was also inhibited by adenine. Viewed together, these results strongly suggest that SL-1250 is, after being converted to SM-108, activated to its nucleotide form by adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.7) and that this SM-108 nucleotide blocks de novo synthesis of guanosine 5'-monophosphate by inhibiting IMP dehydrogenase.",,,,,,,,,,

The presence of HBV markers in liver and serum of 23 leukaemic children with liver disease was investigated at the time of a diagnostic biopsy just before treatment withdrawal. Although, at this time, none had HBV antigens or antibodies in the serum by radioimmunoassay, HBsAg was detected by direct immunofluorescence in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes in 13 children, 7 of whom also had hepatitis-B core or e antigens in hepatocyte nuclei. This pattern of both cytoplasmic and nuclear fluorescence was present in 4 of 6 patients with the histological features of chronic active hepatitis on liver biopsy. The failure of release of viral antigens into serum and the absence of an adequate immune response were probably due to the intense chemotherapy used to induce and maintain remission, since HBV markers appeared in the serum within 15 months of stopping treatment in 8 of the children in whom viral antigens had been detected in liver tissue but in none of those whose biopsy specimens were negative by immunofluorescence. These results suggest that HBV infection may be an important cause of chronic liver disease in children with leukaemia and show that during treatment serological tests may fail to detect the presence of the virus.",,,,,,,,,,

Five hundred cells in each case, categorized ultrastructurally as to the cellular size and nuclear shape, showed an essentially pleomorphic cellular distribution in ATLL in remarkable contrast with the monomorphism of B-""histiocytic"", B-well-differentiated lymphocytic, and T-lymphoblastic lymphomas. Some B-lymphomas and Sezary syndrome also showed pleomorphism. Cases of ATLL were classified according to the predominant cells and degree of nuclear irregularity, which delineated a spectrum of node-based, peripheral T-cells neoplasms probably encompassing T-immunoblastic sarcoma, T-zone lymphoma, as well as multilobated T-cell lymphoma. The characteristic fine structure of ATLL, in comparison with that of B-lymphomas, included slight to marked nuclear irregularity with convoluted-shape predominance, a specked chromatin pattern of the large cells, prominent lysosomes, and glycogen accumulation in addition to the difference in cellular distribution. Although T-lymphoblastic lymphoma and Sezary syndrome shared some of these features, the ultrastructural differentiation of ATLL from them seems to be possible.",,,,,,,,,,

The complexes typically involve 2-16 molecules associated over double-stranded regions 120 +/- 30 base pairs long. Formation of such complexes suggests that poly(A)+RNA contains repeated-sequence elements that are highly represented in the mRNA population. Hybridization of polysomal poly(A)+RNA with a recombinant human DNA plasmid, p lambda H15C, which is shown to contain at least three regions complementary to two different members of the Alu family of DNA repeat sequences, showed a total of five regions where R loops are formed. The hybridized regions comprising these groups are 260 +/- 180, 240 +/- 170, 150 +/- 70, 180 +/- 60, and 180 +/- 80 base pairs long. The relative frequencies of R loops formed at these different sites indicate that sequences in this recombinant DNA are represented in the mRNA population at different frequencies. The hybridizing sequence of the RNA molecules is located near one terminus in 13% of the R loops and internally in 53% of the R loops. Surprisingly, 35% of the R loops apparently involve RNA molecules hybridized over their entire length of only 200 +/- 110 base pairs.","['CA 16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 20124/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 23965/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC348965,,,,,,,,

They were evaluated with standardised intelligence tests during the first month of treatment and periodically thereafter. There were two therapy schedules--one using standard drugs for induction and maintenance, the other a more intensive schedule. Central-nervous-system prophylaxis (2400 rad cranial radiation and six doses of intrathecal methotrexate) was given to all. Significant reductions were found in overall IQ score for the majority of children, younger patients being most affected. More extensive testing of surviving children, with and without decline in IQ, all of whom were normal on the first test, revealed patterns of functional deficits and residual strengths that could not be characterised with IQ testing alone. These deficits, which could affect learning and academic performance, were not seen in six children studied years after receiving similar chemotherapy that included intrathecal and oral methotrexate but not cranial irradiation.","['CA 14489/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CP 65803/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The first type C-budding virus particles appeared in scarce blast cells of the subcapsular zone. Most of these blast cells were ""X-cells,"" i.e., the thymus lymphoid cells most actively engaged in DNA synthesis. Virus replication spread to the entire cortical blast cell population and, from day 7 on, to the small cortical lymphocytes. The first virus-producing cells were derived from a very few target cells (approximately 0.001-0.003% of thymocytes) susceptible to RadLV infection. For determination of the phenotypes of these target cells, various thymocyte subpopulations obtained through a battery of cell separation methods were tested for their ability to support the replication of RadLV/VL3 virus in short-term culture. Most of these target cells were sensitive to the lytic effect of hydrocortisone and migrated in the fastest fraction of a 1Xg sedimentation gradient, together with the majority of [3H] thymidine-incorporating blast cells. They exhibited an intermediate density and expressed H-2 and Thy 1,2 cell surface antigens, although they were not found preferentially among the high Thy 1,2 population to which most of the cortical blast cells belonged. The spread of RadLV within the thymus and the surface phenotype characteristics of target cells indicate that these cells correspond to the thymocyte subset at the earliest stage of thymic lymphopoiesis and may be transitional between the prothymocytes and the subcapsular blast cell population.",['N01-CP71052/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

To verify this hypothesis, we selected a group of 853 deaths of female inpatients with mental diseases recorded in the Dr. G. Marinescu Hospital between 1929 and 1978. Using proportionally and indirect standardization methods, we did not find any association between the incidence of breast cancer death and neuroleptic therapy, widely used in the above-mentioned hospital after 1959. Several authors reported a low cancer death incidence in mental patients. Between 1925 and 1978, 2168 deaths were recorded in this hospital. Besides death certificates, we also studied 1444 complete autopsy protocols (66.60% of all the deaths). Cancer deaths represented 1.94% of 1231 deaths recorded between 1925 and 1960. Cancer deaths represented 7.04% of 937 deaths in the period of 1961-1978, in comparison with 13.36% of the whole population of Romania (p less than 0.001). Among these 937 deaths, statistically significant lower cancer ratios than in general population were found in ten-year age groups, i.e. between 15 and 74 years in women and between 45 and 74 years in men.

Alterations of the cell surface are blamed responsible for the abnormal proliferative behaviour and metastasis of cancer cells. In addition, the disturbance of membrane-bound receptor structures might result in defects of ""endocrine"" control mechanisms leading to the typical uncontrolled growth of tumor cells. In this context, the membrane-bound adenylate-cyclase system deserves special interest, since hormone impulses stimulate this enzyme via specific receptors to produce cyclic AMP. This nucleotide transmits hormonal signals within the cell. Our own studies on lymphoma and leukemic cells are mentioned because they demonstrate alterations of the cAMP producing system in malignant cells. Finally, the phenomenon of cell fusion is discussed. Recently great attention has been paid to this technique, since hybridization experiments enable us to get new insight into the process of neoplastic transformation.",,,,,,,,,,

In a case of chronic myelocytic leukemia and a case of acute myelocytic leukemia, some megakaryoblasts showed the same phenomenon. These megakaryoblasts did not phagocytize latex particles. The limiting membranes of the engulfing megakaryoblasts were stained with ruthenium red but those of the engulfed hematopoietic cells were not stained. By phase microscopy, the engulfed cells were actively moving inside the megakaryoblasts and it was observed that the engulfed cells were actually living within the engulfing cells.

By contrast, Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphocytes are relatively resistant to deoxynucleosides. Growth inhibition is associated with the development of high deoxyribotriphosphate pools after exposure to the respective deoxynucleotides. We show that malignant T and null lymphocytes are deficient in ecto-ATPase activity. We show this cell surface enzyme to be of broad specificity, capable of degrading both ribotriphosphates and deoxyribotriphosphates. High levels of this ecto-enzyme are found in deoxynucleoside-resistant, Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphocytes. Ecto-ATPase deficiency may represent a mechanism for increased sensitivity to deoxynucleoside growth inhibition.",,PMC370829,,,,,,,,

For this reason, the authors have collected bone marrow from 46 patients, including 24 with acute leukaemia, 7 with chronic myeloid leukaemia, 10 with lymphosarcoma and 5 with solid tumours. The mean of total cryopreserved CFU-c was 8.5 X 10(6) (range: 0.2-25). Ten cases of autologous bone marrow transplantation are reported. Seven patients had been prepared with high dosage chemotherapy alone (TACC) and three with chemotherapy combined with total body irradiation. Haematopoiesis restarted within 9 to 15 days in 5 patients and within 22 to 34 days in the other 5. Complete remission was obtained in all 5 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia grafted during their first relapse, the longest remission up to now being 390 days. One patient with chronic granulocytic leukaemia is still in second chronic phase after 360 days. Stem cells were transplanted early in the course of a T-lymphosarcoma, during complete remission; maintenance chemotherapy was withdrawn, and the chances of success of this treatment alone are being evaluated. The kinetics of blood and bone marrow CFU-c populations after transplantation were studied in 4 cases and were found to correlate closely with haematopoietic recovery following ablative bone marrow therapy. Stem cell transplantation can only be justified in acute leukaemia if it is carried out immediately after complete remission to consolidate the results and, hopefully, to prolong the remission.",,,,,,,,,,

The results show that CNS relapse rates are lower in patients receiving effective treatment before CNS symptoms arise, but the bone marrow relapse rate was not significantly affected by prophylactic therapy. In patients with an initial white blood count of 50000/microliter or more, multiple CNS relapses resulted in a lower survival rate. The data from the group receiving the least effective CNS prophylaxis indicate that CNS leukaemia is not necessarily followed by bone marrow relapse and death. These observations suggest that reseeding of the bone marrow by leukaemic cells from the CNS is not a major factor in the evolution of ALL. CNS prophylaxis is of value in averting the CNS complications of ALL and those associated with its therapy, but the improved survival in childhood ALL during the past decade is probably not due to the successful prevention of CNS leukaemia. Improvements in survival are probably the result of more effective systemic chemotherapy and better general management.",,,,,,,,,,

The D10 value (radiation dose required to reduce survival to 10%) was significantly higher for the five radioresistant strains (491 +/- 30 rad) than for control cultures (405 +/- 18 rad). There was a significant correlation between individual D10 values and D0 survival-curve parameters, indicating that changes in the exponential slope of the survival curves accounted for much of the increase in D10 values. This novel radiation phenotype could be a manifestation of a basic cellular defect, predisposing to a variety of tumours in family members. Thus in-vitro radioresistance, like radiosensitivity, may be a phenotype of a mechanism that increases cancer risk in man.",,,,,,,,,,

When differentiation was scored by benzidine staining, it had an inhibitory effect on Me2SO-treated cells. On the other hand, when differentiation was followed by determination of globin mRNA accumulation, it had a pleiotropic effect on Me2SO-treated cells. At the early phase of differentiation (2--3 days) the rate of globin mRNA accumulation was higher in the promoter-treated cells than in the control. This unexpectedly high level of accumulation was followed by a sharp reduction and most of the globin RNA sequences disappeared at later stages of differentiation (days 4--5). The reduction can be related to the effect of the promoter on the stability of globin RNA in the cytoplasm which was reduced from a half-life of 16 h to that of 8 h only. Other parameters, such as the rate of globin mRNA synthesis and its capability to serve as a template for cell-free protein synthesis were not affected by treatment with the promoter throughout the differentiation process.",,,,,,,,,,

It occurs within the first 24h after implantation and influences decisively the course of infiltration. In contrast, The presence of BNML cells leads to mesothelial contraction only in the terminal stage and, therefore, exerts no direct effect on infiltration. In addition, the two leukemias differ with regard to their cellular motility. Whereas L5222 cells locomote within the mesentery, only stationary movements are recorded with BNML cells. Based on the different interactions with the mesothelium and cell motilities, two distinct modes of infiltrating the mesentery could be ascertained for the two rat leukemias.",,,,,,,,,,

This chemical isomerization was inhibited by the radical scavenger 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinooxy free radical (HTMP); the inhibition suggests that the thiyl radical (RS) is added reversibly to the triene system at C-12, resulting in the overall cis leads to trans isomerization of the 11,12 double bond. Because the amount of 11-trans-SRS-Cys produced by intact rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-1) cells was consistently higher than the amount produced in boiled cells, we believe that intact RBL-1 cells contain enzyme systems that form peroxides, which are known to enhance the formation of thiyl radicals, required for cis leads to trans isomerization.

Compared to the cys+ lines, the cysteine auxotrophic cell lines have been found to contain reduced amounts of cystathionase, the enzyme which catalyzes te conversion of cystathionine to cysteine, the terminal step in the cysteine biosynthetic pathway. We have developed a semiquantitative in vitro translation assay for the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) which encodes cystathionase and have tested two pairs of cys-, cystathionase- and cys+, cystathionase+ cell lines for their intracellular content of this RNA. There is a close correlation between the cys- phenotype, reduced intracellular cystathionase content, and the intracellular content of enzyme-specific messenger RNA. Thus, the absolute cysteine requirement of the human leukemic, cys-, cystathionase- cell lines tested is likely due to an intracellular reduction in the functional messenger RNA coding for cystathionase. Among the possibilities that could amount for these phenomena are (1) a reduction in the rate of transcription of the cystathionase mRNA precursor, (2) an alteration in the nuclear and/or cytoplasmic processing of the primary transcripts, or (3) an alteration in the mRNA structure, resulting in a decreased efficiency of translation.",['CA 21920/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Of the lymphomas studied, six thymic lymphomas (Group 1) had the Thy-1.1 antigen, T-cell antigen, and receptors for guinea pig red blood cells; five extrathymic lymphomas (Group 2) lacked T- and B-cell antigens, receptors for guinea pig red blood cells, and surface immunoglobulin, but three of them had complement receptors. An absorption test revealed that Group 2 lymphomas possess a very low amount of the Thy-1.1 antigen compared to Group 1 lymphomas. None of the leukemias studied had detectable T- and B-cell antigen. Four leukemias had undifferentiated blast cell morphology and bore the Thy-1.1 antigen; three leukemias (Group 3) reacted with anti-lymphocyte serum, but one leukemia (Group 4) did not. Two leukemias (Group 5) had only the complement receptor and morphologically showed granulocytic appearance. Three leukemias (Group 6) had none of the membrane markers used and morphologically resembled erythroblasts. Based on these results, an attempt was made to classify these leukemias and lymphomas into T-cell lineage, B-cell lineage, stem cell, myeloid, and erythroid groups, respectively. Furthermore, the stage of differentiation in the lymphocyte maturational pathway of the leukemias and lymphomas belonging to Groups 1 to 4 is discussed.",,,,,,,,,,

These substances are released from a variety of tissues in response to immunological or non-immunological stimulation. A slow-reacting substance is believed to be implicated in hypersensitivity reactions such as asthma; in order to fully understand its bronchoconstrictor role, the structural elucidation of these materials has been a necessary (albeit difficult) task. Studies on both immunologically generated slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A) and other slow-reacting substances (SRSs) have indicated a precursor role for arachidonic acid in their biosynthesis; this, coupled with enzymic and chemical activity destruction data, gave an insight into the structure of these moieties. In order to define the structure of these materials homogeneous SRS-A was required; a purification scheme was developed relying on the high resolution separative capability of reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, resulting in extensively purified SRS-A. It was then possible to demonstrate that SRS-A possessed a characteristic ultraviolet spectrum, allowing us for the first time to define a major structural moiety in the molecule (conjugated triene). To complement studies on, and to act as a model for the more pathologically relevant SRS-A, a slow-reacting substance was produced from rat basophilic leukaemia (RBL-1) cells. The structure of this biologically active species has been determined by mass spectrometric examination of the intact molecule as a derivative, together with analytical protein chemical studies, and shown to be the novel peptidolipid 5-hydroxy-6-cysteinylglycinyl-7,9,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid.",,,,,,,,,,

However the presence of Thy-1.2 alloantigen on the purified Thy-1 glycoprotein could not be established unequivocally. The present paper demonstrates that Thy-1.2 alloantigen, identified by F7D5 monoclonal antibody, is localized on the Thy-1 glycoprotein. The limited neutralization by the glycoprotein of the reactivity of AKR anti-C3H allosera to thymocytes is explained by the fact that the antiserum contains antibodies to determinants other than Thy-1.2. The alloantisera are shown to react with viral proteins encoded for by endogenous murine leukemia virus and expressed at the surface of Friend cells and thymocytes.",,,,,,,,,,

Phenotypic analysis of the chicken bone marrow cells transformed in vitro allowed the separation of these seven viruses into three groups based on the differentiation phenotype of the transformed cell. Nucleic acid hybridization studies revealed that these seven viruses had acquired cellular sequences. Interestingly, these studies also showed that the viruses within the same biological grouping had acquired related sequences. This indicates that viruses that have acquired the same or similar cellular sequences have very similar oncogenic capabilities. Analysis of proteins expressed in cells transformed by these viruses demonstrated that the cellular sequences were usually inserted within the gene for the viral core proteins, gag. Therefore the cellular sequences are expressed as a gag-related fusion protein which has an amino-terminal region derived from the gag gene and a carboxy-terminal half derived from the cellular sequences. Two exceptions to this are discussed. The general conclusion from these studies is that defective leukaemia viruses transform cells by virtue of acquired host cellular sequences. The ability of these viruses to transform cells and the target cell specificity of the transformation depends on these cellular sequences.",,,,,,,,,,

Peak serum MTX levels were significantly reduced by the milky meal and both meals delayed drug absorption in most children. The area under the absorption curve was also significantly reduced by the milky meal.

The primary structural requirement observed for the conversion by this lipoxygenase enzyme system was a delta 5,8,11 unsaturation in a polyenoic fatty acid. Such fatty acids as 20:4 (5,8,11,14) 20:5 (5,8,11,14,17), 20:3 (5,8,11), 19:4 (5,8,11,14) and 18:4 (5,8,11,14) were readily converted to compounds that comigrated with 5-HETE and 5,12-DiHETE and to biologically active SRS. Chain length did not have an influence on the formatin of these hydroxyacids.

SRS has been named leukotriene (LT) C and may be formed by a novel lipoxygenase pathway which also synthesizes 5,6-oxido-7,9,11,14-icosatetraenoic acid (LTA) and 5,12-dihydroxy-6,8,10,14-icosatetraenoic acid (LTB). Homogenates of RBL-1 cells, when incubated with C-arachidonic acid, form 5-hydroxy-icosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) and 5,12-dihydroxy- and 5,6-dihydroxy-icosatetraenoic acid. The latter is the spontaneous breakdown product of the labile intermediate LTA. Formation of both compounds is stimulated by calcium. We have now produced biologically active SRS in a cell-free system generated from RBL-1 cells. Glutathione was essential for SRS synthesis and calcium stimulated its formation.","['5-P30-CA16217-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5-R01-HL21874-02/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The activities of adenylate cyclase, guanylate cyclase and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases were also determined. Under basal conditions, cAMP levels were always higher in the normal leucocytes, whilst cGMP levels were of the same order of magnitude in both normal and leukaemic cells, causing the cAMP/cGMP ratios to be significantly lower in leukaemic leucocytes. Leukaemic cells significantly increased cyclic nucleotide levels in response to theophylline, but did not respond to serotonin, carbamylcholine or D,L-isoproterenol. Preincubation of these leucocytes with theophylline produced a detectable cAMP response to D,L-isoproterenol but no cGMP response to serotonin or carbamylcholine was found.
