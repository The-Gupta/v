Next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques targeting these loci have been successfully applied to lymphoblastic leukemia and multiple myeloma for minimal residual disease detection. However, adoption of NGS for primary diagnosis remains limited. METHODS: We addressed the bioinformatics challenges associated with immune cell sequencing and clone detection by designing a novel web tool, CloneRetriever (CR), which uses machine-learning principles to generate clone classification schemes that are customizable, and can be applied to large datasets. CR has 2 applications-a ""validation"" mode to derive a clonality classifier, and a ""live"" mode to screen for clones by applying a validated and/or customized classifier. In this study, CR-generated multiple classifiers using 2 datasets comprising 106 annotated patient samples. A custom classifier was then applied to 36 unannotated samples. RESULTS: The optimal classifier for clonality required clonal dominance >/=4.5x above background, read representation >/=8% of all reads, and technical replicate agreement. Depending on the dataset and analysis step, the optimal algorithm yielded sensitivities of 81%-90%, specificities of 97%-100%, areas under the curve of 91%-94%, positive predictive values of 92-100%, and negative predictive values of 88%-98%. Customization of the algorithms yielded 95%-100% concordance with gold-standard clonality determination, including rescue of indeterminate samples. Application to a set of unknowns showed concordance rates of 83%-96%. CONCLUSIONS: CR is an out-of-the-box ready and user-friendly software designed to identify clonal rearrangements in large NGS datasets for the diagnosis of lymphoid malignancies.","['(c) American Association for Clinical Chemistry 2021.

Identification and understanding of chromosomal abnormalities are key diagnostic and prognostic factors for patients with AML, as they play an important role in risk stratification algorithms. Hypodiploidy, a rare cytogenetic abnormality resulting in a karyotype with fewer than 46 chromosomes, is a rare finding in AML. It is often characterized by the involvement of chromosomes 5, 7, and/or 17, as well as the structural aberration t(8;21)(q22;q22), which is frequently accompanied by the clonal loss of a sex chromosome. Modal number (MN) has been shown to play a role in prognosis, with lower values associated with poorer survival. While hypodiploidy is frequently discussed within the context of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), its impact has garnered little relevance within AML studies. In this review, we aim to elucidate the characteristics of hypodiploidy in AML, investigate its prognostic significance, and explore its relationship with monosomal karyotypes, a more favored method of risk stratification.",['Copyright(c) by the Association of Genetic Technologists.'],"['Yeh, Wilson', 'Tirado, Carlos']","['Yeh W', 'Tirado C']",,"['The International Circle of Genetics Studies, Los Angeles, CA.', 'University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Los Angeles, CA.', 'The International Circle of Genetics Studies, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Baylor Scott and White Health, Department of Pathology, Temple, TX.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Assoc Genet Technol,Journal of the Association of Genetic Technologists,9807282,,,,2021/09/08 06:00,2021/09/08 06:01,['2021/09/07 12:24'],"['2021/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/07 12:24 [entrez]', '2021/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/08 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Assoc Genet Technol. 2021;47(3):122-126.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Constipation secondary to vinca alkaloids, psychological stressors, and opioid use are common issues for children newly diagnosed with leukemia. This study investigated the morbidity associated with constipation including infections, mucositis, and healthcare utilization in hospitalized children with ALL receiving induction chemotherapy. METHODS: We analyzed data from 48 children's hospitals in the Pediatric Health Information System, extracting patients 1-21 years of age with ALL, hospitalized for induction from October 2015 through December 2019. Data were analyzed using nonparametric statistics, and comparisons of outcomes between those with and without constipation were presented as adjusted odds ratios (aOR). RESULTS: We identified 2586 (56%) patients with constipation out of a total of 4622 unique ALL patients in induction. Compared to patients without constipation during induction, patients with constipation were significantly more likely to have mucositis (aOR = 2.30; p = 0.0010), perirectal issues (aOR = 3.21; p = 0.0092), or abdominal radiograph exposure (aOR = 2.40; p < 0.0001). The median length of induction hospitalization was significantly greater in those with constipation compared to those without constipation (10 days vs. 8 days; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Children with ALL suffering from constipation during induction therapy have increased length of stay, mucositis, imaging, and overall healthcare utilization compared to children without constipation. Further research should explore the causative relationship between constipation and infections. Increased attention should be given to constipation management in patients with ALL at the start of induction therapy, particularly in patients with complications or prolonged hospitalizations.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Belsky, Jennifer A', 'Batra, Sandeep', 'Stanek, Joseph R', ""O'Brien, Sarah H""]","['Belsky JA', 'Batra S', 'Stanek JR', ""O'Brien SH""]",,"['Section of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'Riley Hospital for Children at Indiana University Health, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'Section of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'Riley Hospital for Children at Indiana University Health, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio, USA."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,,,2021/09/08 06:00,2021/09/08 06:00,['2021/09/07 08:52'],"['2021/08/04 00:00 [revised]', '2021/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/08 06:00 [medline]', '2021/09/07 08:52 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.29336 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2021 Nov;68(11):e29336. doi: 10.1002/pbc.29336.

Nine patients received InO in one cycle and seven of these patients achieved complete hematological remission after salvage chemotherapy including InO. Negative minimal residual disease was confirmed in all four evaluable patients. Eight patients were successfully bridged to the subsequent HCT. After HCT, veno-occlusive disease (VOD) developed in three patients, and caused the death of one. No patient received maintenance therapy. At present, five patients are disease-free and alive, and the overall and progression-free survival rates at 1 year were 60% and 40%, respectively.

However, there are a number of different selection methods established in different laboratories around the world. Cellbased PD panning methods using primary tumor cells are particularly heterogeneous between laboratories, which can lead to inconsistent results. Therefore, the present study evaluated different cellbased PD selection methods regarding their potential to generate acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blastbinding antibodies. In addition to this evaluation, the present study improved the PD procedure by optimizing selection as well as depletion strategies. To the best of our knowledge, the current study demonstrated for the first time that antigen diversity during the depletion step is of importance for the enrichment of tumortargeting phage antibodies. It is demonstrated that medium levels of depletion antigen diversity led to the most promising antibody candidates. In addition, it was determined that purification of blast cells from patients with AML by immunomagnetic separation ameliorated the selection of AMLbinding phages during panning. Furthermore, suggesting a common designrelated mechanism using a 'singlepot' PD library, such as the wellknown Tomlinson singlechain fragment variable (scFv) library, the present study identified specific binding consensus phage particles in independent panning procedures. By means of these optimized strategies, four promising AML blastbinding phage particles were isolated and soluble scFvFc (scFv cloned to a fragment crystallizable of an IgG2a mouse antibody) fusion proteins were produced. These scFvFc antibodies bound the surface of AML blasts and were successfully internalized into their cytoplasm, indicating that they are potential immunoconjugate candidates for AML immunotherapy.",,"['Weber, Theresa', 'Pscherer, Sibylle', 'Gamerdinger, Ulrike', 'Teigler-Schlegel, Andrea', 'Rutz, Natalja', 'Blau, Wolfgang', 'Rummel, Mathias', 'Gattenlohner, Stefan', 'Tur, Mehmet Kemal']","['Weber T', 'Pscherer S', 'Gamerdinger U', 'Teigler-Schlegel A', 'Rutz N', 'Blau W', 'Rummel M', 'Gattenlohner S', 'Tur MK']",,"['Institute of Pathology, Justus Liebig University Giessen, University Hospital Giessen and Marburg, D35392 Giessen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Justus Liebig University Giessen, University Hospital Giessen and Marburg, D35392 Giessen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Justus Liebig University Giessen, University Hospital Giessen and Marburg, D35392 Giessen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Justus Liebig University Giessen, University Hospital Giessen and Marburg, D35392 Giessen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Justus Liebig University Giessen, University Hospital Giessen and Marburg, D35392 Giessen, Germany.', 'Department for Hematology, Oncology and Palliative Care, Helios Dr Horst Schmidt Kliniken, D65199 Wiesbaden, Germany.', 'Department for Hematology, Justus Liebig University Giessen, University Hospital Giessen and Marburg, D35392 Giessen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Justus Liebig University Giessen, University Hospital Giessen and Marburg, D35392 Giessen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Justus Liebig University Giessen, University Hospital Giessen and Marburg, D35392 Giessen, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Greece,Mol Med Rep,Molecular medicine reports,101475259,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'consensus phage', 'depletion antigen diversity', 'enrichment of blasts', 'internalizing antibody', 'phage display technology']",2021/09/08 06:00,2022/01/18 06:00,['2021/09/07 07:49'],"['2021/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/07 07:49 [entrez]', '2021/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3892/mmr.2021.12407 [doi]', '767 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Med Rep. 2021 Nov;24(5). pii: 767. doi: 10.3892/mmr.2021.12407.

The clinical course was characterized by the late onset of fever, GI symptoms, rash, and respiratory distress, including oxygen requirement with sustained VL of SARS-CoV-2 around 7 log10 RNA copies/mL for 6 weeks. It is important to note that the hyperinflammatory status developed early at the third week of hospitalization-in a context of high VL and immunocompromised status.

PTPs antagonize tyrosine kinases by removing phosphate moieties from molecular signaling residues, thus inhibiting signal transduction. Two PTPs, SHP-1 and SHP-2 (SH2 domain-containing phosphatases 1 and 2, respectively) and another inhibitory phosphatase, SH2 domain-containing inositol phosphatase (SHIP), are essential for cell function, which is reflected in the defective phenotype of mutant mice. Interestingly, SHP-1, SHP-2, and SHIP mutations are identified in many cases of human leukemia. However, the impact of these phosphatases and their mutations regarding the onset and progression of leukemia is controversial. The ambiguity of the role of these phosphatases imposes challenges on the development of targeting therapies for leukemia. This fundamental problem, confronted by the expanding investigational field of leukemia, will be addressed in this review, which will include a discussion of the molecular mechanisms of SHP-1, SHP-2, and SHIP in normal hematopoiesis and their role in leukemia. Clinical development of leukemic therapies achieved by targeting these phosphatases will be addressed as well.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Hao, Wang, Sholy, Cao and Kang.']","['Hao, Fang', 'Wang, Chen', 'Sholy, Christine', 'Cao, Min', 'Kang, Xunlei']","['Hao F', 'Wang C', 'Sholy C', 'Cao M', 'Kang X']",,"['Center for Precision Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, United States.', 'Center for Precision Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, United States.', 'Center for Precision Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, United States.', 'Center for Precision Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, United States.', 'Center for Precision Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, United States.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'PTP inhibitor', 'SHIP', 'SHP-1', 'SHP-2', 'leukemia', 'signaling pathway', 'thrapeutic target']",2021/09/08 06:00,2021/09/08 06:01,['2021/09/07 07:46'],"['2021/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/07 07:46 [entrez]', '2021/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/08 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2021.730400 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Aug 19;9:730400. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.730400. eCollection 2021.,20210819,,,,PMC8417302,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review focuses on the metabolic, phenotypic and genetic characteristics underlying this dynamic evolution, from myelodysplastic stem cells (MDS-SCs) to leukemic stem cells (LSCs). MDS-SCs are more likely to be derived from healthy hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), whereas LSCs may originate from healthy progenitors, mostly LMPP (lymphoid-primed multipotential progenitors). Moreover, overexpression of CD123 and CLL1 markers by LSCs and MDS-SCs in high risk-MDS [HR-MDS] has led to exciting therapeutic applications. Single-cell sequencing has suggested that clonal evolution in the stem cell compartment was non-linear during MDS initiation and progression to AML, with pre-MDS-SC acquiring distinct additional mutations in parallel, that drive either MDS blast production or AML transformation. In AML and HR-MDS, common metabolic alterations have been identified in malignant stem cells, including activation of the protein machinery and dependence on oxidative phosphorylation. Targeting these metabolic abnormalities could prevent HR-MDS from progressing to AML. Strikingly, in low risk-MDS-SC, the expression of ribosomal proteins is decreased, which may be accompanied by a reduction in protein synthesis.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Joudinaud and Boyer.'],"['Joudinaud, Romane', 'Boyer, Thomas']","['Joudinaud R', 'Boyer T']",,"['Laboratory of Hematology, Lille Hospital, Lille, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, University of Amiens, Amiens Hospital, Amiens, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'leukemic stem cell', 'myelodysplastic syndromes', 'single cell', 'whole genome sequencing']",2021/09/08 06:00,2021/09/08 06:01,['2021/09/07 07:45'],"['2021/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/07 07:45 [entrez]', '2021/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/08 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.730899 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Aug 20;11:730899. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.730899. eCollection 2021.,20210820,,,,PMC8417738,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although progress on the genetic and molecular understanding of this disease has been made, the standard of care has changed minimally for the past 40 years and the five-year survival rate remains poor, warranting new treatment strategies. Here, we applied a two-step screening platform consisting of a primary cell viability screening and a secondary metabolomics-based phenotypic screening to find synergistic drug combinations to treat AML. A novel synergy between the oxidative phosphorylation inhibitor IACS-010759 and the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitor AC220 (quizartinib) was discovered in AML and then validated by ATP bioluminescence and apoptosis assays. In-depth stable isotope tracer metabolic flux analysis revealed that IACS-010759 and AC220 synergistically reduced glucose and glutamine enrichment in glycolysis and the TCA cycle, leading to impaired energy production and de novo nucleotide biosynthesis. In summary, we identified a novel drug combination, AC220 and IACS-010759, which synergistically inhibits cell growth in AML cells due to a major disruption of cell metabolism, regardless of FLT3 mutation status.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Lu, Han, Busquets, Collins, Lodi, Marszalek, Konopleva and', 'Tiziani.']","['Lu, Xiyuan', 'Han, Lina', 'Busquets, Jonathan', 'Collins, Meghan', 'Lodi, Alessia', 'Marszalek, Joseph R', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Tiziani, Stefano']","['Lu X', 'Han L', 'Busquets J', 'Collins M', 'Lodi A', 'Marszalek JR', 'Konopleva M', 'Tiziani S']",,"['Department of Nutritional Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, United States.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Nutritional Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, United States.', 'Department of Nutritional Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, United States.', 'Department of Nutritional Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, United States.', 'TRACTION - Translational Research to AdvanCe Therapeutics and Innovation in ONcology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Nutritional Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, United States.', 'Department of Oncology, Dell Medical School, LiveSTRONG Cancer Institutes, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, United States.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['FLT3-inhibitor', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'complex I inhibitor', 'high-throughput screening', 'metabolomics']",2021/09/08 06:00,2021/09/08 06:01,['2021/09/07 07:45'],"['2021/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/07 07:45 [entrez]', '2021/09/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/08 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.686765 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Aug 20;11:686765. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.686765. eCollection 2021.,20210820,,,,PMC8417744,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further exploration of the causes of immune evasion in the bone marrow (BM) environment, the primary leukemia site, and peripheral blood (PB) and understanding how T cells are affected by AML induction chemotherapy or the influence of age may help to select patients who may benefit from ICI treatment. In this study, we comprehensively compared the distribution of PD-1 and TIGIT, two of the most well-studied IC proteins, in PB and BM T cells from AML patients at the stages of initial diagnosis, complete remission (CR), and relapse-refractory (R/R) disease after chemotherapy. Our results show that PD-1 was generally expressed higher in PB and BM T cells from de novo (DN) and R/R patients, while it was partially recovered in CR patients. The expression of TIGIT was increased in the BM of CD8(+) T cells from DN and R/R patients, but it did not recover with CR. In addition, according to age correlation analysis, we found that elderly AML patients possess an even higher percentage of PD-1 and TIGIT single-positive CD8(+) T cells in PB and BM, which indicate greater impairment of T cell function in elderly patients. In addition, we found that both DN and R/R patients accumulate a higher frequency of PD-1(+) and TIGIT(+) CD8(+) T cells in BM than in corresponding PB, indicating that a more immunosuppressive microenvironment in leukemia BM may promote disease progression. Collectively, our study may help guide the combined use of anti-PD-1 and anti-TIGIT antibodies for treating elderly AML patients and pave the way for the exploration of strategies for reviving the immunosuppressive BM microenvironment to improve the survival of AML patients.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Xu, Liu, Yao, Zeng, Zhang, Lai, Zhong, Zha, Zheng, Lu, Li,', 'Jin, Hebbar Subramanyam, Chen, Huang and Li.']","['Xu, Ling', 'Liu, Lian', 'Yao, Danlin', 'Zeng, Xiangbo', 'Zhang, Yikai', 'Lai, Jing', 'Zhong, Jun', 'Zha, Xianfeng', 'Zheng, Runhui', 'Lu, Yuhong', 'Li, Minming', 'Jin, Zhenyi', 'Hebbar Subramanyam, Sudheendra', 'Chen, Shaohua', 'Huang, Xin', 'Li, Yangqiu']","['Xu L', 'Liu L', 'Yao D', 'Zeng X', 'Zhang Y', 'Lai J', 'Zhong J', 'Zha X', 'Zheng R', 'Lu Y', 'Li M', 'Jin Z', 'Hebbar Subramanyam S', 'Chen S', 'Huang X', 'Li Y']",,"['The Clinical Medicine Postdoctoral Research Station, Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital; Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine; Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine; Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine; Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine; Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine; Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Laboratory Center, Tianhe Nuoya Bio-Engineering Co.

However, the effectiveness of Flu/Bu4 for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) remains poorly understood. Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed nationwide registry data in Japan from 2006 to 2018 and compared transplant outcomes of adult MDS patients receiving Flu/Bu4 and busulfan/cyclophosphamide (Bu4/Cy) using propensity score (PS) matching. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Among 2,482 MDS patients, 153 patients were assigned each to the Flu/Bu4 and Bu4/Cy groups. The 3-year OS rates were 52.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 43.8-60.8%) and 49.5% (95% CI, 40.8-57.6%) in the Flu/Bu4 and Bu4/Cy group, respectively (P = 0.548). The 3-year progression-free survival (P = 0.858), the cumulative incidence of relapse (P = 0.536), and cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality (P = 0.684) were not significantly different between the two groups. According to the findings of subgroup analyses, no patient had a favorable OS when using either of the two regimens. In conclusion, although our PS-matched cohort mainly comprised older patients who had a low hematopoietic cell transplantation-comorbidity index and low-risk disease status, Flu/Bu4 could be an alternative to Bu4/Cy for MDS patients prior to allo-HSCT.","['(c) 2021.

Moreover, a recent study has demonstrated that patients expressing both fusion genes have a better outcome than patients that are expressing the MLL-AF4 fusion protein alone. All this may point to a clonal process where the reciprocal fusion gene AF4-MLL could be lost during disease progression, as this loss may select for a more aggressive type of leukemia. Therefore, we were interested in unraveling the decisive role of the AF4-MLL fusion protein at an early timepoint of disease development. We designed an experimental model system where the MLL-AF4 fusion protein was constitutively expressed, while an inducible AF4-MLL fusion gene was induced for only 48 h. Subsequently, we investigated genome-wide changes by RNA- and ATAC-Seq experiments at distinct timepoints. These analyses revealed that the expression of AF4-MLL for only 48 h was sufficient to significantly change the genomic landscape (transcription and chromatin) even on a longer time scale. Thus, we have to conclude that the AF4-MLL fusion protein works through a hit-and-run mechanism, probably necessary to set up pre-leukemic conditions, but being dispensable for later disease progression.",['(c) 2021.

The lack of recurrent mutations in TN-ET patients makes its pathogenesis ambiguous. Here, we screened 483 patients with suspected ET in a single institution, centrally reviewed bone marrow specimens, and identified 23 TN-ET patients. Analysis of clinical records revealed that TN-ET patients were mostly young female, without a history of thrombosis or progression to secondary myelofibrosis and leukemia. Sequencing analysis and human androgen receptor assays revealed that the majority of TN-ET patients exhibited polyclonal hematopoiesis, suggesting a possibility of reactive thrombocytosis in TN-ET. However, the serum levels of thrombopoietin (TPO) and interleukin-6 in TN-ET patients were not significantly different from those in ET patients with canonical mutations and healthy individuals. Rather, CD34-positive cells from TN-ET patients showed a capacity to form megakaryocytic colonies, even in the absence of TPO. No signs of thrombocytosis were observed before TN-ET development, denying the possibility of hereditary thrombocytosis in TN-ET. Overall, these findings indicate that TN-ET is a distinctive disease entity associated with polyclonal hematopoiesis and is paradoxically caused by hematopoietic stem cells harboring a capacity for cell-autonomous megakaryopoiesis.",['(c) 2021.

Despite the wide application of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in CML treatment, TKIs drug resistance or intolerance limits their further usage in a subset of patients. Furthermore, TKIs inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of the BCR/ABL oncoprotein while failing to eliminate the pathologenic oncoprotein. To develop alternative strategies for CML treatment using therapeutic antibodies, and to address the issue that antibodies cannot pass through cell membranes, we have established a novel intracellular delivery of anti-BCR/ABL antibodies, which serves as a prerequisite for CML therapy. METHODS: Anti-BCR/ABL antibodies were encapsulated in poly(D, L-lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles (PLGA NPs) by a double emulsion method, and transferrin was labeled on the surface of the nanoparticles (Ab@Tf-Cou6-PLGA NPs). The characteristics of nanoparticles were measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Cellular uptake of nanoparticles was measured by flow cytometry (FCM). The effect of nanoparticles on the apoptosis and proliferation of CML cells was testified by FCM and CCK-8 assay. In addition, the anti-cancer impact of nanoparticles was evaluated in mouse models of CML. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that the Ab@Tf-Cou6-PLGA NPs functioned as an intracellular deliverer of antibodies, and exhibited an excellent effect on degrading BCR/ABL oncoprotein in CML cells via the Trim-Away pathway. Treatment with Ab@Tf-Cou6-PLGA NPs inhibited the proliferation and induced the apoptosis of CML cells in vitro as well as impaired the oncogenesis ability of CML cells in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our study indicated that this approach achieved safe and efficient intracellular delivery of antibodies and degraded BCR/ABL oncoprotein via the Trim-Away pathway, which provides a promising therapeutic strategy for CML patients, particularly those with TKI resistance.",['(c) 2021.

This study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of patients with nonurinary source bacteraemia caused by ESBL-producing Escherichia coli (E. coli) or Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-producing EK) receiving beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations (BLICs) versus carbapenem treatment and assess the risk factors of mortality with these two drugs. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective single-centre study of adult hospitalised patients with ESBL-producing EK bloodstream infection (BSI) from nonurinary source at our centre over a 4-year period. One hundred and eighty patients who received BLICs or carbapenems were included in the analysis. The outcome variables were 14-day treatment failure and 30-day mortality. For more reliable results, propensity score analysis was performed to compare the efficacy of the two drugs and analyse their risk factors for 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Out of 180 patients, 114 received BLICs, and 66 received carbapenem therapy. Compared to carbapenem-treated patients, those treated with BLICs were older and had higher age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index, but they had shorter stay in the hospital. Additionally, their Pitt bacteraemia score, SOFA score, rate of leukaemia, and immune compromise were lower. After propensity score matching (PSM), the baseline characteristics of patients in the two treatment groups were balanced. BLICs were associated with a higher 14-day treatment failure rate (20.6%, 13/63) than carbapenems (16.3%, 7/43), although the difference was not significant in either univariate analysis (P = 0.429) or multivariate analysis (P = 0.122). And the 30-day mortality rate in BTG (11.1%, 7/63) and CTG (11.6%, 5/43) did not significantly differ (univariate analysis, P = 0.926; multivariate analysis, P = 0.420). In the multivariate analysis, after PSM, leukaemia was the only independent predictor of mortality in both BTG and CTG. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that BLICs had higher 14-day treatment failure rate compared with carbapenems, although there were no statistically significant differences because of the small number of patients, therefore, further evaluation of the efficacy of BLICs is needed.",['(c) 2021.

OBJECTIVE: The study investigated the in vitro pro-apoptotic properties of Conyza bonariensis (C. bonariensis) towards human lymphoblastic leukemia Jurkat cells. METHODS: C. bonariensis are extracted with non-polar solvent by maceration. MTS cell viability assay was employed to determine the cytotoxic activity of the extract towards human leukemia Jurket cells and normal Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) cells. The phytochemical composition of the extract was chemically characterized using HPLC. Flow cytometric studies (FACS) were conducted to explore the pro-apoptotic potential of the extract. Western blot studies were employed to identify the molecular targets involved in the induction of apoptosis. RESULTS: The n-hexane extract showed selective cytotoxic activity towards Jurkat cells. FACS analysis indicated that the extract induced early and late apoptosis in Jurkat cells. Western blot studies revealed that the extract down-regulated the expression of DNMT1, SIRT1, and UHRF1 with a simultaneous up-regulation of the expression of p73 and caspases-3 proteins. HPLC characterization of the extract revealed the presence of phenolic compounds. CONCLUSION: Overall these findings demonstrate that the anticancer effects of a Conyza bonariensis extract towards human lymphoblastic leukemiais due to the modulation of the activity of multiple oncogenic and tumor suppressor proteins and that its phenolic content is involved are proposed to be responsible for these activities.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Saleem, Mohammad', 'Schini-Kerth, Valerie B', 'Hussain, Khalid', 'Khalid, Syed Haroon', 'Asif, Muhammad', 'Alhosin, Mahmoud', 'Akhtar, Muhammad Furqan', 'Ahmad, Bashir', 'Raza, Atif', 'Mahrukh']","['Saleem M', 'Schini-Kerth VB', 'Hussain K', 'Khalid SH', 'Asif M', 'Alhosin M', 'Akhtar MF', 'Ahmad B', 'Raza A', 'Mahrukh']",,"['Punjab University College of Pharmacy, University of The Punjab Lahore .

Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only well-established cure for the hematological manifestations of these diseases. AREAS COVERED: In recent years, analysis of large series from international databases (mainly from the European Bone Marrow Transplantation [EBMT] database) has improved knowledge about HSCT in IBMFS. This review, following a thorough Medline search of the pertinent published studies, reports the most recent data on HSCT in IBMFS. EXPERT OPINION: Despite the common features, IBMFS are very different in their manifestations and in the occurrence and management of HSCT complications. Thus, a 'disease-specific' HSCT using an optimized conditioning regimen based on the characteristics of the disease is essential for achieving long-term survival. The phenotypical heterogeneity associated with extramedullary abnormalities has to be carefully evaluated before HSCT because transplantation may only correct impaired hematopoiesis. HSCT may be associated with the risk of treatment-related mortality and with significant early and late morbidity. For these reasons, the benefits should be carefully weighed against the risks.",,"['Pierri, Filomena', 'Faraci, Maura', 'Giardino, Stefano', 'Dufour, Carlo']","['Pierri F', 'Faraci M', 'Giardino S', 'Dufour C']",,"['Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Italy.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Italy.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Department of Hematology-Oncology, IRCSS-Istituto G.

Methods: In February 2018, the gas explosion in underground coal mine was simulated by large tunnel explosion experiment system, SD rats were randomly divided into control group and 6 distance groups (40 m, 80 m, 120 m, 160 m, 200 m, 240 m) with 18 rats in each group. The respiratory function of rats 24 h before and after explosion was detected. Post-explosion rats were anesthetized and sacrificed, histopathological changes of lung were observed by HE staining. Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the in situ expression of autophagy marker protein microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3B) . The expression levels of autophagy related gene 12 (Atg12) , LC3B, P62, lysosomal associated membrane protein 2 (Lamp2) , B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl2 interaction protein (Beclin-1) were detected by Western blot. Results: After gas explosion, the rats in 80 m distance point group had the hightest mortality (n=13, 72.22%) and the most severe lung injury degree, and the histopathological scores was (4.00+/-0.00) point. After gas explosion, the minute ventilation volume (MVb) , maximum inspiratory flow rate (PIFb) and maximum expiratory flow rate (PEFb) of rats were lower than before the gas explosion (P<0.05) . The respiratory frequency of rats in 80 m, 200 m, and 240 m distance point groups were significantly higher than that in the control group (P<0.05) . The expression levels of LC3B in 40 m, 80 m, 120 m, 160 m, and 200 m distance point groups were higher than that in the control group (P<0.05) . The relative expression levels of Atg12 and LC3B/ in lung tissues of rats in different distance point groups were higher than those in the control group (P<0.05) . The relative expression levels of Beclin1 in 40 m, 80 m, 120 m, and 160 m distance point groups were significantly higher than that in the control group (P<0.05) . The relative expression levels of P62 in 80 m, 160 m and 200 m distance point groups were lower than that in the control group (P<0.05) . The relative expression levels of Lamp2 and Bcl-2 in lung tissues of rats in all distance groups except 240 m distance group were lower than those in the control group (P<0.05) . Conclusion: Gas explosion could induce increased autophagy in lung tissues of ALI rats. Autophagy-related signaling pathway could be involved in the pathophysiological process of ALI in rats caused by gas explosion, then the autophagy and the severity of the lesion showed a significant positive correlation.",,"['Hou, R Y', 'Wang, J N', 'Zhou, Q', 'Guan, Y', 'Li, H B', 'Dong, X W', 'Li, J', 'Wu, W D', 'Ren, W J', 'Yao, S Q']","['Hou RY', 'Wang JN', 'Zhou Q', 'Guan Y', 'Li HB', 'Dong XW', 'Li J', 'Wu WD', 'Ren WJ', 'Yao SQ']",,"['School of Public Health, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang 453003, China.', 'School of Public Health, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang 453003, China.', 'North China University of Science and Technology, Tangshan 063210, China.', 'North China University of Science and Technology, Tangshan 063210, China.', 'School of Public Health, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang 453003, China.', 'School of Public Health, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang 453003, China.', 'School of Public Health, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang 453003, China.', 'School of Public Health, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang 453003, China.', 'School of Public Health, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang 453003, China.', 'School of Public Health, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang 453003, China.']",['chi'],['U1904209/National Natural Science Foundation of China-Henan Joint Foundation'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhonghua Lao Dong Wei Sheng Zhi Ye Bing Za Zhi,Zhonghua lao dong wei sheng zhi ye bing za zhi = Zhonghua laodong weisheng zhiyebing zazhi = Chinese journal of industrial hygiene and occupational diseases,8410840,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lung injury', 'Autophagy', 'Gas explosion', 'Large roadway', 'Rats']",2021/09/07 06:00,2021/09/09 06:00,['2021/09/06 23:30'],"['2021/09/06 23:30 [entrez]', '2021/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.cn121094-20201010-00568 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Lao Dong Wei Sheng Zhi Ye Bing Za Zhi. 2021 Aug 20;39(8):568-573. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.cn121094-20201010-00568.,,20210908,,"['*Acute Lung Injury', 'Animals', 'Autophagy', '*Explosions', 'Lung', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Categorization of patients into risk stratified groups (favourable, intermediate and unfavourable) according to cytogenetic findings can serve as a valuable independent prognostic factor. The aim of this study was to assess the one-year disease free survival rate in AML patients after induction remission presenting at tertiary care hospital of Karachi. METHODS: It was a longitudinal study conducted at the department of Medical oncology of Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center, Karachi from Jun 2017-Jan 2019. Ninety-three diagnosed cases of AML of age 15-55 years of either gender were included in the study. All patients received the first cycle of ""3+7"" regime for induction chemotherapy. This includes Daunorubicin 45 mg/m2 on days 1 to 3 and Cytarabine in a dose of 100 mg/m2 from day 1-7. Marrow response was assessed on the 21th day of induction therapy. If the bone marrow includes lesser than five percent blast cells then it was labelled as complete remission (CR). The patients who achieved CR and normal haematopoiesis were eligible to receive 4 cycles of consolidation therapy with cytarabine 3 mg/m2 every 12 hour on days 1, 3 and 5. Consolidation cycles were monthly administered. All the patients who achieved CR were follow up for the duration of one year for disease free survival. On follow up monthly visits, outcomes were assessed using CBC report and physical examination. RESULTS: After 1 year, out of 72 AML patients, 19 patients remained in complete remission, 5 patients lost to follow up, 3 relapses, 19 showed persistent disease & 28 died during consolidation. According to cytogenetic status, CR was achieved in 6 patients (50%) with favourable cytogenetic, 14 patients (28%) with intermediate cytogenetic and 2 patients (20%) with unfavourable cytogenetic status. The highest median survival time was observed in patients with favourable cytogenetic status as 5.23 months. However, there was no significant difference was observed in survival time with respect to cytogenetic status. CONCLUSIONS: The ""3+7"" regime of Daunorubicin & Cytarabine is effective in inducing induction remission and increases 1 year survival, however chemotherapy related morality rate was high in unfavourable cytogenetic group.",,"['Shaikh, Mehwish Roshan', 'Haider, Ghulam', 'Shahid, Aisha', 'Rahool, Raja', 'Beg, Shumyla', 'Memon, Paras', 'Nouman, Maryum']","['Shaikh MR', 'Haider G', 'Shahid A', 'Rahool R', 'Beg S', 'Memon P', 'Nouman M']",,"['Department of Medical Oncology, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Karachi, Pakistann.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Karachi, Pakistan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Pakistan,J Ayub Med Coll Abbottabad,"Journal of Ayub Medical College, Abbottabad : JAMC",8910750,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Cytogenetic; Poor prognosis', 'Survival rate; Remission; AML, Induction chemotherapy']",2021/09/07 06:00,2021/11/26 06:00,['2021/09/06 17:12'],"['2021/09/06 17:12 [entrez]', '2021/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/26 06:00 [medline]']",['7240/3147 [pii]'],ppublish,J Ayub Med Coll Abbottabad. 2021 Jul-Sep;33(3):475-479.,,20211125,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']","['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cytarabine', 'Daunorubicin', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Young Adult']",,,,['Bhunisha'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

These genetic alterations may be associated with an unfavorable prognosis. OBJECTIVE: Up to our knowledge, this is the first study performed to evaluate the clinical implication and prognostic significance of FLT3-ITD and ASXL1 mutations and their coexistence on the outcome of Egyptian AML patients. METHODS: Our study included 83 patients with AML who were subjected to immunophenotyping and detection of FLT3-ITD and ASXL1 gene mutation by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR, respectively. RESULTS: FLT3-ITD and ASXL1 mutations were detected in 20.5% and 18.1% of AML patients respectively. Seven patients (8.4%) had co-expression of both genes' mutations. FLT3-ITD mutation was significantly higher in younger age, higher WBCs count and poor cytogenetic risk patients (P= 0.01, < 0.001 and 0.008 respectively). ASXL1 mutation was significantly higher in intermediate cytogenetic risk patients (P= 0.2). The mean period of survival and relapse-free survival (RFS) were significantly reduced in FLT3-ITD and ASXL1 mutations compared with their non-mutant types (P= 0.01 and 0.03 respectively). Both mutations were independent risk factors for overall survival (OS) and (RFS) in univariate and multivariate analysis in AML patients. CONCLUSION: FLT3-ITD and ASXL1 gene mutations or their coexistence can predict a poor prognosis in AML patients.",,"['Ebian, Huda F', 'Elshorbagy, Sherin', 'Mohamed, Haitham', 'Embaby, Ahmad', 'Khamis, Tarek', 'Sameh, Reham', 'Sabbah, Norhan A', 'Hussein, Samia']","['Ebian HF', 'Elshorbagy S', 'Mohamed H', 'Embaby A', 'Khamis T', 'Sameh R', 'Sabbah NA', 'Hussein S']",,"['Clinical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt.', 'Oncology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt.', 'Hematology Oncology Unit/Internal Medicine Department, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt.', 'Hematology Oncology Unit/Internal Medicine Department, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt.', 'Pharmacology Department, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt.', 'Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt.', 'Medical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt.', 'Medical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cancer Biomark,Cancer biomarkers : section A of Disease markers,101256509,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['ASXL1 mutation', 'Acute myeloid leukemia', 'FLT3-ITD mutation', 'overall survival', 'prognosis']",2021/09/07 06:00,2021/09/07 06:00,['2021/09/06 12:16'],"['2021/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/07 06:00 [medline]', '2021/09/06 12:16 [entrez]']","['CBM210024 [pii]', '10.3233/CBM-210024 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biomark. 2021;32(3):379-389. doi: 10.3233/CBM-210024.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As drug targets, many inhibitors are already in clinical practice. Unfortunately, the average overall survival rate for patients on medication suffering from AML is 5 years despite the huge efforts in this field. To perform docking simulation and ADMET studies on selected phytochemicals against FLT3 protein receptor for drug discovery against FLT3 induced AML, molecular docking simulation was performed using human FLT3 protein target (PDB ID: 6JQR) and 313 phytochemicals with standard anticancer drugs (Sorafenib and Gilteritinib in addition to other anticancer drugs). The crystal structure of the protein was downloaded from the protein data bank and prepared using Biovia Discovery Studio. The chemical structures of the phytochemicals were downloaded from the NCBI PubChem database and prepared using Open Babel and VConf softwares. Molecular docking was performed using PyRx on Autodock Vina. The ADMET properties of the best performing compounds were calculated using SwissADME and pkCMS web servers. The results obtained showed that glabridin, ellipticine and derivatives (elliptinium and 9-methoxyellipticine), mezerein, ursolic acid, formononetin, cycloartocarpesin, hypericin, silymarin, and indirubin are the best performing compounds better than sorafenib and gilteritinib based on their binding affinities. The top-performing compounds which had better binding and ADMET properties than sorafenib and gilteritinib could serve as scaffolds or leads for new drug discovery against FLT3 induced AML.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis including all pediatric hematologic/oncologic malignancies patients with CRBSIs treated in Dr. Behcet Uz Children Diseases and Surgery Training and Research Hospital between the period of 2009 and 2020. RESULTS: During the study period, 53 children with CRBSIs associated with Candida species were included. The most common malignancy was acute lymphoblastic leukemia (45.3%) and acute myeloid leukemia (15.1%). A total of 56 Candida isolates were present including non-albicans Candida species (80.4%) and Candida albicans (19.6%). The most common isolated Candida species was Candida parapsilosis (42.9%) and followed by C. albicans (19.6%). The ratio of azole prophylaxis was significantly higher in patients with the non-albicans Candida group (P=0.031). Candida-related endocarditis (vegetation) was present in 2 (3.8%) patients, and the overall rate of hepatosplenic candidiasis was 3.8%. Seven days Candida attributable mortality was 7.5% (4 patients) and 30 days Candida attributable mortality was 11.3% (6 patients). The Candida species responsible for the Candida-related deaths were as following: Candida tropicalis (n=3), C. parapsilosis (n=2), and C. lusitanae (n=1). CONCLUSION: In pediatric cancer patients with Candida-associated CRBSIs, evaluation of the patient for organ involvement including liver and spleen ultrasonography and cardiac involvement with echocardiography are essential regardless of the patients' clinical picture.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

This study investigated antifungal treatment and prophylaxis features according to leukemia risk groups and treatment phases in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients who received Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster-based protocols. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively examined ALL patients' data between the ages of 1 and 18 and treated them with Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster-ALL protocols between June 2013 and December 2016. RESULTS: A total of 446 febrile neutropenic attacks in 85 children were evaluated. Seventy-two patients received antifungals in 151 infection attacks, while 13 patients did not receive any antifungal treatment during chemotherapy. Empirical, preemptive, or proven treatments were given to 74.8%, 21.2%, and 4% of patients, respectively. The frequency of antifungal therapy increased linearly and significantly from the standard-risk group to the intermediate-risk (IR) group, high-risk (HR) group, and relapsed group. IR patients needed more antifungal therapy while receiving induction, whereas HR patients needed more throughout the induction and HR consolidation blocks than other phases. During induction, IR patients received antifungal therapy similar to HR patients' treatment in the induction and HR consolidation blocks. CONCLUSIONS: Antifungal therapy requirements increased as the severity and intensity of chemotherapy increased for all leukemia risk groups. The requirement of antifungal therapy for IR patients receiving induction was similar to that of HR patients; further studies are needed to evaluate the potential advantages of using primary antifungal prophylaxis in IR patients.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Patients receiving immunotherapy with a lower disease burden tend to have improved long-term outcomes and less toxicity. Thus, an induction protocol to achieve lower disease burden is required. Bortezomib added to a 4-drug induction was shown to lead to high rates of remission in R/R ALL patients. Inclusion of anthracyclines in this protocol may preclude most patients, having maximized the cumulative dose of anthracyclines. Thus, our goal was to evaluate anthracycline-free bortezomib-based induction for patients with R/R ALL. PROCEDURE: We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients treated with bortezomib-based protocols for R/R ALL between 2011 and 2019 at our center. Data regarding toxicity and response rate was collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Eighteen children with R/R ALL were treated with bortezomib-based induction, 13 of them without anthracyclines. Eleven patients did not complete the induction course: 6 due to toxicity, and 5 due to physician decision to proceed to immunotherapy early. Two events of treatment-related mortality occurred. There was no significant difference in toxicity between patients who treated with anthracycline and those who were not. Ten patients achieved complete remission, with 4 patients having polymerase-chain-reaction minimal residual disease below 10-4. Fifteen patients proceeded directly to immunotherapy: 11 patients received CD19 chimeric-antigen receptor-T-cells, 2 blinatumomab and 2 hematopoietic stem cell transplant. CONCLUSION: Anthracyclines can be safely omitted from bortezomib-based therapies in patients with R/R ALL, when planning to proceed to immunotherapy.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Using genome sequences from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer Project, we calculated telomere content across 1299 cancer cell lines. We find that telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) expression correlates with telomere content in lung, central nervous system, and leukemia cell lines. Using CRISPR/Cas9 screening data, we show that lower telomeric content is associated with dependency of CST telomere maintenance genes. Increased dependencies of shelterin members are associated with wild-type TP53 status. Investigating the epigenetic regulation of TERT, we find widespread allele-specific expression in promoter-wildtype contexts. TERT promoter-mutant cell lines exhibit hypomethylation at PRC2-repressed regions, suggesting a cooperative global epigenetic state in the reactivation of telomerase. By incorporating telomere content with genomic features across comprehensively characterized cell lines, we provide further insights into the role of telomere regulation in cancer immortality.","['(c) 2021, Hu et al.']","['Hu, Kevin', 'Ghandi, Mahmoud', 'Huang, Franklin W']","['Hu K', 'Ghandi M', 'Huang FW']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3631-8294', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1897-2265', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5447-0436']","['Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, United States.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine; Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute; Institute for Human Genetics; University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, United States.', 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, San Francisco, United States.', 'Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, United States.', 'Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, United States.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine; Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute; Institute for Human Genetics; University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, United States.', 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, San Francisco, United States.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Elife,eLife,101579614,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*CCLE', '*cancer', '*cancer biology', '*cell lines', '*computational biology', '*genetics', '*genomics', '*human', '*systems biology', '*telomeres']",2021/09/07 06:00,2021/12/01 06:00,['2021/09/06 08:55'],"['2021/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/01 06:00 [medline]', '2021/09/06 08:55 [entrez]']","['10.7554/eLife.66198 [doi]', '66198 [pii]']",epublish,Elife. 2021 Sep 6;10. pii: 66198. doi: 10.7554/eLife.66198.,20210906,20211130,['EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)'],"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/genetics', 'Telomerase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Telomere/*metabolism', '*Telomere Homeostasis']",PMC8530513,"['KH, FH No competing interests declared, MG MG is an employee and holds equity in', 'Monte Rosa Therapeutics and is a founding member at Cambridge Data Science LLC.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this review, we attempt to provide an overview on the overlapping and differential effects of ibrutinib and acalabrutinib on specific receptor signaling pathways in different immune cell subsets other than B cells, including T cells, NK cells, monocytes, macrophages, granulocytes, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, dendritic cells, osteoclasts, mast cells and platelets. The shared and distinct effects of ibrutinib versus acalabrutinib are mediated through BTK-dependent and BTK-independent mechanisms, respectively.

Even after surgical removal of the tumor, most patients are still at risk of metastasis. Therefore, screening for metastatic biomarkers can identify precise therapeutic intervention targets. In this study, we analyzed 96 pancreatic cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) without metastasis or with metastasis after R0 resection. We also retrieved data from metastatic pancreatic cancer cell lines from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), as well as collected sequencing data from our own cell lines, BxPC-3 and BxPC-3-M8. Finally, we analyzed the expression of metastasis-related genes in different datasets by the Limma and edgeR packages in R software, and enrichment analysis of differential gene expression was used to gain insight into the mechanism of pancreatic cancer metastasis. Our analysis identified six genes as risk factors for predicting metastatic status by LASSO regression, including zinc finger BED-Type Containing 2 (ZBED2), S100 calcium-binding protein A2 (S100A2), Jagged canonical Notch ligand 1 (JAG1), laminin subunit gamma 2 (LAMC2), transglutaminase 2 (TGM2), and the transcription factor hepatic leukemia factor (HLF). We used these six EMT-related genes to construct a risk-scoring model. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that the risk score could better predict the risk of metastasis. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed that the risk score was also an important predictor of pancreatic cancer. In conclusion, 6-mRNA expression is a potentially valuable method for predicting pancreatic cancer metastasis, assessing clinical outcomes, and facilitating future personalized treatment for patients with ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (PDAC).","['Copyright (c) 2021 Xue, Zheng, Qian, Chen, Gu, Hu, Zhang and Wan.']","['Xue, Ke', 'Zheng, Huilin', 'Qian, Xiaowen', 'Chen, Zheng', 'Gu, Yangjun', 'Hu, Zhenhua', 'Zhang, Lei', 'Wan, Jian']","['Xue K', 'Zheng H', 'Qian X', 'Chen Z', 'Gu Y', 'Hu Z', 'Zhang L', 'Wan J']",,"['Department of Information and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University of Science and Technology, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Biological and Chemical Engineering, Zhejiang University of Science and Technology, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Information and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University of Science and Technology, Hangzhou, China.', 'Division of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Fourth Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Yiwu, China.', 'Shulan Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang Shuren University Shulan International Medical College, Hangzhou, China.', 'Division of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Department of Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Key Laboratory of Combined Multi-Organ Transplantation, Ministry of Public Health Key Laboratory of Organ Transplantation, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Division of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Department of Surgery, Fourth Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Yiwu, China.', 'Division of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Yiwu Central Hospital, Yiwu, China.', 'Department of Biological and Chemical Engineering, Zhejiang University of Science and Technology, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Information and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University of Science and Technology, Hangzhou, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Bioeng Biotechnol,Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,101632513,,['NOTNLM'],"['EMT', 'bioinformatics', 'metastasis', 'pancreatic cancer', 'precision medicine']",2021/09/07 06:00,2021/09/07 06:01,['2021/09/06 06:07'],"['2021/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/06 06:07 [entrez]', '2021/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fbioe.2021.701039 [doi]', '701039 [pii]']",epublish,Front Bioeng Biotechnol. 2021 Aug 17;9:701039. doi: 10.3389/fbioe.2021.701039. eCollection 2021.,20210817,,,,PMC8415976,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cancer patients represent a subgroup that is vulnerable and is under high risk. It is, therefore, necessary to analyze factors that predict outcomes in these patients so that they can be triaged accordingly to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 on cancer management. To date, the impact of COVID-19 on cancer patients remain largely unknown. Methods Data of 291 cancer patients undergoing active treatment from March 23 to August 15, 2020 were retrospectively reviewed; the incidence, demographic and clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of cancer patients infected by COVID-19 were included in the analysis. Discussion During the index period (March 23-August 15, 2020), 4,494 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were admitted at our institute. In the department of medical oncology out of 578 patients presented to outpatient department, 291 patients were admitted for active treatment. Considering the cancer patients, infection rate was 7.9% (23/291) and mortality 13% (3/23). Median age was 40 years and the majority of patients were male (60%). The most common cancer type was acute lymphoblastic leukemia presented at various stages of treatment. Twenty patients (86.9%) were discharged after full clinical recovery and negative real-time polymerase chain reaction on a nasopharyngeal swab. Anticancer treatment was modified according to the type of cancer under intensive surveillance. Conclusion Although mortality rate in COVID-19 cancer patients is elevated, our results support the feasibility and safety of continuing anticancer treatment during pandemic by endorsing consistent preventive measures, but however should be modified based on the type and prognosis of cancer.","['MedIntel Services Pvt Ltd.

The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of low-dose decitabine on the prevention of adult ALL relapse after allo-HSCT. Methods: In this prospective study, we enrolled 34 patients with ALL who underwent allo-HSCT from August 2016 to April 2020 and received low-dose decitabine maintenance treatment after transplantation. The primary objectives were cumulative incidence of relapse rate (CIR), overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS). The secondary objectives were graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and safety. Results: Among the enrolled 34 patients, 6 patients relapsed and 6 patients died. The 2-year CIR, OS, and DFS were 20.2, 77.5, and 73.6%, respectively. Subgroup analysis revealed the 2-year CIR, OS, and DFS rates of 12 patients with T-ALL/lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) were 8.3, 90, and 81.5%, respectively. None of the seven patients with T-ALL relapsed. During maintenance treatment, only one patient (2.9%) developed grade IV acute GVHD and four (11.8%) patients had severe chronic GVHD. Thirty-two patients (94.1%) developed only grade I to II myelosuppression, and two patients (5.8%) developed grade III to IV granulocytopenia. Conclusions: Maintenance treatment with low-dose decitabine after allo-HSCT may be used as a therapeutic option to reduce relapse in patients with adult ALL, especially in patients with T-ALL. Our findings require confirmation in larger-scale controlled trials.

The prognosis and optimal therapy for these patients are controversial in clinical practice. Methods: In this study, we performed targeted region sequencing of 236 genes in 158 individuals with this genotype and constructed a nomogram model based on leukemia-free survival (LFS). Patients were randomly assigned to a training cohort (N =111) and a validation cohort (N =47) at a ratio of 7:3. Risk stratification was performed by the prognostic factors to investigate the risk-adapted post-remission therapy by Kaplan-Meier method. Results: At least 1 mutated gene other than CEBPA was identified in patients and mutation number was associated with LFS (61.6% vs. 39.0%, P =0.033), survival (85.6% vs. 62.9%, P =0.030) and cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) (38.4% vs. 59.5%, P =0.0496). White blood cell count, mutations in CFS3R, KMT2A and DNA methylation related genes were weighted to construct a nomogram model and differentiate two risk subgroups. Regarding LFS, low-risk patients were superior to the high-risk (89.3% vs. 33.8%, P <0.001 in training cohort; 87.5% vs. 18.2%, P =0.009 in validation cohort). Compared with chemotherapy, allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) improved 5-year LFS (89.6% vs. 32.6%, P <0.001), survival (96.9% vs. 63.6%, P =0.001) and CIR (7.2% vs. 65.8%, P <0.001) in high-risk patients but not low-risk patients (LFS, 77.4% vs. 88.9%, P =0.424; survival, 83.9% vs. 95.5%, P =0.173; CIR, 11.7% vs. 11.1%, P =0.901). Conclusions: Our study indicated that biCEBPA mutant-positive CN-AML patients could be further classified into two risk subgroups by four factors and allo-HSCT should be recommended for high-risk patients as post-remission therapy. These data will help physicians refine treatment decision-making in biCEBPA mutant-positive CN-AML patients.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wu, Jiang, Chang, Zhou, Wang, Wang, Cao, Li, Sun, Cao, Lou,', 'Zhou,

Two factors account for this detrimental clinical presentation: (i) the lack of early detection methods and (ii) the inherently aggressive nature of this malignancy. Currently, transcriptomic analyses have become important tools to identify new targets in different cancer types. In this study, by measuring expression levels in ovarian cancer samples and stem cell samples, we identified 24 tumor suppressor genes consistently associated with poor prognosis. Combined results further revealed a potential therapeutic candidate, BTG2, which belongs to the antiproliferative gene family. Our results showed that BTG2 expression regulated ovarian cancer cell proliferation via G1/S phase cell cycle arrest by regulating Cyclin D1, CDK4, p-AKT, and p-ERK expression. BTG2 also inhibited cell migration by modulating MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression. Furthermore, xenograft models confirmed a growth inhibitory effect of BTG2 in ovarian cancer in vivo. BTG2 was significantly associated with ovarian cancer FIGO stage and grade in the clinic. Our findings indicated that BTG2 exerts a suppressive impact on ovarian cancer and could be a potential biomarker.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wang, Li, Wang, Zhang, Li, Qiao, Zhang, Liu, Zhang, Gao and', 'Li.']","['Wang, Jia', 'Li, Haonan', 'Wang, Liang', 'Zhang, Jing', 'Li, Man', 'Qiao, Liang', 'Zhang, Jun', 'Liu, Likun', 'Zhang, Cuili', 'Gao, Jingchun', 'Li, Weiling']","['Wang J', 'Li H', 'Wang L', 'Zhang J', 'Li M', 'Qiao L', 'Zhang J', 'Liu L', 'Zhang C', 'Gao J', 'Li W']",,"['Department of Biotechnology, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Department of Biotechnology, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Laboratory Animal Center, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Department of Biotechnology, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science and the Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA, United States.', 'Laboratory Animal Center, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Department of Biotechnology, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Department of Biotechnology, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Department of Biotechnology, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Liaoning Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and Translational Medicine, Dalian, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['BTG2', 'cell cycle', 'migration', 'ovarian cancer', 'proliferation']",2021/09/07 06:00,2021/09/07 06:01,['2021/09/06 06:06'],"['2021/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/06 06:06 [entrez]', '2021/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.681250 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Aug 17;11:681250. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.681250. eCollection 2021.,20210817,,,,PMC8415965,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the relapsed setting, prognosis is very poor despite salvage treatment with chemotherapy. Evidence suggests that leukemic stem cells (LSCs) cause relapse. The cell surface receptor CD123 is highly expressed in blast cells and LSCs from AML patients and is a potential therapeutic target. CD123 cross-over dual-variable domain T-cell engager (CD123-CODV-TCE) is a bispecific antibody with an innovative format. One arm targets the CD3epsilondelta subunit of T-cell co-receptors on the surface of T cells, while the other targets CD123 on malignant cells, leading to cell-specific cytotoxic activity. Here, we describe the preclinical activity of CD123-CODV-TCE. CD123-CODV-TCE effectively binds to human and cynomolgus monkey CD3 and CD123 and is a highly potent T-cell engager. It mediates T-cell activation and T-cell-directed killing of AML cells in vitro. In vivo, CD123-CODV-TCE suppresses AML tumor growth in leukemia xenograft mouse models, where it achieves an effective half-life of 3.2 days, which is a significantly longer half-life compared to other bispecific antibodies with no associated Fc fragment. The in vitro safety profile is as expected for compounds with similar modes of action. These results suggest that CD123-CODV-TCE may be a promising therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory AML.","['(c) 2021 The Author(s).

To perform the toxicity test in repeated doses for 28 days, male and female Wistar rats were treated via orogastric for 28 days with PfrHEPA (35, 70 or 140 mg/kg) according to the guidelines established by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) number 407 (1995). For assessment, the impact of PfrHEPA on the reproductive output various parameters were measured, including maternal weight, no. of pregnant females, female fertility index (%), gestation lengthtime, implantation sites, litter size and placental index of test animals. The cytotoxicity of PfrHEPA was performed on the tumor lines NCI-H292 (human lung carcinoma), HL-60 (human promyelocytic leukemia) and HCT-116 (colorectal cancer). In the repeated dose toxicity test for 28 days, no mortality was observed in the male and female rats treated with PfrHEPA as well as morphological changes and biochemical and hematological parameters. In the reproductive toxicity test, no abnormalities were observed related to the toxicological parameters in both mothers and offspring. Regarding the cytotoxicity assay, the PfrHEPA fraction did not demonstrate significant cytotoxic effect on the cell lines analyzed. The present results suggest the use of PfrHEPA is safe and well tolerated in rats. Further studies are planned to identify and purify the active compounds for subsequent in vivo evaluation.","['(c) The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights', 'reserved.

The gene interaction networks are studied to determine pathways and regulatory mechanisms in model organisms. In this research, the enrichment study of bone cancer-causing genes is undertaken to identify several hub genes associated to the development of bone cancer. Materials and Methods: Data on bone cancer is obtained from mutated gene samples; highly mutated genes are selected for the enrichment analysis. Due to certain interactions with each other the interaction network model for the hub genes is developed and simulations are produced to determine the levels of expression. For the array analyses, a total of 100 tumor specimens are collected. Cell cultures are prepared, RNA is extracted, cDNA arrays probes are generated, and the expressions analysis of Hub genes is determined. Results: Out of cDNA array findings, only 7 genes: CDKN2A, AKT1, NRAS, PIK3CA, RB1, BRAF, and TP53 are differentially expressed and shown as significant in the development of bone tumors, approximately 15 pathways have been identified, including pathways for non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, chronic myeloid leukemia, and glioma, consisting of all the identified 7 genes. After clinical validations of tumor samples, the IDH1 and TP53 gene revealed significant number of mutations similar to other genes. Specimens analysis showed that RB1, P53, and NRAS are amplified in brain tumor, while BRAF, CDKN2A, and AKT1 are amplified in sarcoma. Maximum deletion mutations of the PIK3CA gene are observed in leukemia. CDKN2A gene amplifications have been observed in virtually all tumor specimens.

In this updated systematic review, meta-analysis, and network meta-analysis (NMA), we aimed to comprehensively explore the clinical benefits and safety of GO in various subtypes of AML. Methods: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Chinese databases were filtered to search randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and retrospective cohort studies that compared clinical efficiency and toxicity of GO with non-GO groups in AML. Random-effects models were used to calculate pooled effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Relative risk (RR) was used for estimating complete remission (CR), early death, and toxicity. Hazard risk (HR) was accomplished to evaluate survival. Results: Fifteen RCTs and 15 retrospective cohort studies were identified (GO: 4,768; Control: 6,466). GO tended to improve CR (RR 0.95, p = 0.084), followed by significantly improved survival (overall survival: HR 0.86, p = 0.003; event-free survival: HR 0.86, p = 0.015; relapse-free survival: HR 0.83, p = 0.001; cumulative incidence of relapse: HR 0.82, p < 0.001). GO benefits of CR and survival were evident in favorable- and intermediate-risk karyotypes (p </= 0.023). GO advantages were also associated with nucleophosmin 1 mutations (p </= 0.04), wild-type FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication gene (p </= 0.03), age of <70 years (p < 0.05), de novo AML (p </= 0.017), and CD33(+) (p </= 0.021). Both adding GO into induction therapy (p </= 0.011) and a lower (<6 mg/m(2)) dose of GO (p </= 0.03) enhanced survival. Prognosis of combined regimens with GO was heterogeneous in both meta-analysis and NMA, with several binding strategies showing improved prognosis. Additionally, GO was related to increased risk of early death at a higher dose (>/=6 mg/m(2)) (RR 2.01, p = 0.005), hepatic-related adverse effects (RR 1.29, p = 0.02), and a tendency of higher risk for hepatic veno-occlusive disease or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (RR 1.56, p = 0.072). Conclusions: These data indicated therapeutic benefits and safety of GO in AML, especially in some subtypes, for which further head-to-head RCTs are warranted.

Validation of driver mutations responsible for B cell neoplasms is complicated by the volume of mutations worthy of investigation and by the complex ways that multiple mutations arising from different stages of B cell development can cooperate. Forward and reverse genetic strategies in mice can provide complementary validation of human driver genes and in some cases comparative genomics of these models with human tumors has directed the identification of new drivers in human malignancies. We review a collection of forward genetic screens performed using insertional mutagenesis, chemical mutagenesis and exome sequencing and discuss how the high coverage of subclonal mutations in insertional mutagenesis screens can identify cooperating mutations at rates not possible using human tumor genomes. We also compare a set of independently conducted screens from Pax5 mutant mice that converge upon a common set of mutations observed in human acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We also discuss reverse genetic models and screens that use CRISPR-Cas, ORFs and shRNAs to provide high throughput in vivo proof of oncogenic function, with an emphasis on models using adoptive transfer of ex vivo cultured cells. Finally, we summarize mouse models that offer temporal regulation of candidate genes in an in vivo setting to demonstrate the potential of their encoded proteins as therapeutic targets.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Dawes and Uren.'],"['Dawes, Joanna C', 'Uren, Anthony G']","['Dawes JC', 'Uren AG']",,"['Medical Research Council, London Institute of Medical Sciences, London, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Clinical Sciences (ICS), Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Medical Research Council, London Institute of Medical Sciences, London, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Clinical Sciences (ICS), Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['MC_A652_5PZ20/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*B cell leukemia', '*B cell lymphoma', '*CRISPR-Cas', '*exome sequencing', '*insertional mutagenesis', '*mouse models', '*reverse genetics', '*shRNA']",2021/09/07 06:00,2021/10/21 06:00,['2021/09/06 05:55'],"['2021/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/06 05:55 [entrez]', '2021/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2021.670280 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2021 Aug 13;12:670280. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.670280. eCollection 2021.,20210813,20211018,,"['Animals', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional/methods']",PMC8414522,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aims to identify potential mycobacteria-specific antigen-induced cytokines associated with host responses to preventive treatment. Methods: Based on a randomized controlled trial on LTBI treatment among individuals with chest radiography abnormalities suggestive of prior tuberculosis (TB), the dynamically changed cytokine levels in QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT) supernatants were estimated during the treatment by bead-based multiplex assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: In total, 63 treated participants and 32 untreated controls were included in the study. The levels of 13 background-corrected mycobacteria-specific antigen-stimulated cytokines [basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF), growth-regulated oncogene (GRO)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-1ra, IL-12 (p70), stem cell factor (SCF), tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), IL-8, interferon (IFN)-alpha2, IL-5, IL-12 (p40), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and IL-17A] were found to be statistically different between before and after treatment in treated participants, while no statistically differences were observed in untreated controls. Among these 13 cytokines, the level of IL-8 was significantly lower in the QFT reversed group than that in the non-reversed group (p = 0.028) among treated participants, while such a difference was not found for untreated controls (p = 0.292). Conclusion: Our results suggested that the lower level of mycobacteria-specific antigen-induced IL-8 might be associated with the host's positive response to LTBI treatment.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Cao, Xin, Zhang, Liu, Pan, Du, Feng, Quan, Guan, Shen, Liu,', 'Wang, Zhang, Guan, Yan, Jin and Gao.']","['Cao, Xuefang', 'Xin, Henan', 'Zhang, Haoran', 'Liu, Jianmin', 'Pan, Shouguo', 'Du, Ying', 'Feng, Boxuan', 'Quan, Zhusheng', 'Guan, Ling', 'Shen, Fei', 'Liu, Zisen', 'Wang, Dakuan', 'Zhang, Bin', 'Guan, Xueling', 'Yan, Jiaoxia', 'Jin, Qi', 'Gao, Lei']","['Cao X', 'Xin H', 'Zhang H', 'Liu J', 'Pan S', 'Du Y', 'Feng B', 'Quan Z', 'Guan L', 'Shen F', 'Liu Z', 'Wang D', 'Zhang B', 'Guan X', 'Yan J', 'Jin Q', 'Gao L']",,"['NHC Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens, Center for Tuberculosis Research, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'NHC Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens, Center for Tuberculosis Research, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'NHC Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens, Center for Tuberculosis Research, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', ""The Sixth People's Hospital of Zhengzhou, Zhengzhou, China."", 'The Center for Disease Prevention and Control of Zhongmu County, Zhengzhou, China.', 'NHC Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens, Center for Tuberculosis Research, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'NHC Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens, Center for Tuberculosis Research, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'NHC Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens, Center for Tuberculosis Research, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', ""The Sixth People's Hospital of Zhengzhou, Zhengzhou, China."", ""The Sixth People's Hospital of Zhengzhou, Zhengzhou, China."", 'The Center for Disease Prevention and Control of Zhongmu County, Zhengzhou, China.', 'The Center for Disease Prevention and Control of Zhongmu County, Zhengzhou, China.', 'The Center for Disease Prevention and Control of Zhongmu County, Zhengzhou, China.', ""The Sixth People's Hospital of Zhengzhou, Zhengzhou, China."", 'The Center for Disease Prevention and Control of Zhongmu County, Zhengzhou, China.', 'NHC Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens, Center for Tuberculosis Research, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'NHC Key Laboratory of Systems Biology of Pathogens, Center for Tuberculosis Research, Institute of Pathogen Biology, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,,['NOTNLM'],"['IL-8', 'cytokines', 'latent tuberculosis infection', 'mycobacteria-specific', 'preventive treatment']",2021/09/07 06:00,2021/09/07 06:01,['2021/09/06 05:55'],"['2021/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/06 05:55 [entrez]', '2021/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2021.716900 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2021 Aug 13;12:716900. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2021.716900. eCollection 2021.,20210813,,,,PMC8415003,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, few direct clinical trials have been carried out to compare the efficacy and adverse events (AEs) between these two agents. The clinical choice between them is controversial. A systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed to compare the efficacy, safety, and survival of DAC and AZA in AML and HR-MDS patients. Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library through March 15, 2021. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on AML or HR-MDS patients comparing the efficacy and safety between DAC and AZA or comparing one of HMAs to conventional care regimens (CCR) were selected. Results: Eight RCTs (n = 2,184) were identified in the NMA. Four trials compared AZA to CCR, and four compared DAC to CCR. Direct comparisons indicated that, compared to CCR, both AZA and DAC were associated with higher overall response (OR) rate (AZA vs. CCR: relative risk (RR) = 1.48, 95% CI 1.05-2.1; DAC vs. CCR: RR = 2.14, 95% CI 1.21-3.79) and longer overall survival (OS) (AZA vs. CCR: HR = 0.64, 95% CI 0.50-0.82; DAC vs. CCR: HR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.72-0.98), and AZA showed higher rate of complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) (HR = 2.52, 95% CI 1.27-5). For the indirect method, DAC showed a higher complete remission (CR) rate than AZA in patients with both AML (RR = 2.28, 95% CI 1.12-4.65) and MDS (RR = 7.57, 95% CI 1.26-45.54). Additionally, DAC significantly increased the risk of 3/4 grade anemia (RR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.03-2.51), febrile neutropenia (RR = 4.03, 95% CI: 1.41-11.52), and leukopenia (RR = 3.43, 95% CI 1.64-7.16) compared with AZA. No statistical significance was found for the other studied outcomes. Conclusion: Compared to CCR, both AZA and DAC can promote outcomes in patients with AML and HR-MDS. DAC showed higher efficacy especially CR rate than AZA (low-certainty evidence), while AZA experienced lower frequent grade 3/4 cytopenia than patients receiving DAC treatment.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Ma and Ge.'],"['Ma, Jiale', 'Ge, Zheng']","['Ma J', 'Ge Z']",,"['Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Institute of Hematology Southeast University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xuzhou Central Hospital, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Institute of Hematology Southeast University, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'azacitidine', 'decitabine', 'higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome', 'network meta-analysis']",2021/09/07 06:00,2021/09/07 06:01,['2021/09/06 05:54'],"['2021/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/06 05:54 [entrez]', '2021/09/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fphar.2021.701690 [doi]', '701690 [pii]']",epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2021 Aug 17;12:701690. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2021.701690. eCollection 2021.,20210817,,,,PMC8416074,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Till now, few data are available regarding the clinical course, severity of the disease and the duration of infectivity of COVID-19 in patients received Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT). Objective: To evaluate the medical protocols and outcome of patients who underwent HSCT during the pandemic of COVID-19. Methods: A retrospective review of the medical files of patients who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation during the era of COVID-19. The following data were reviewed for all patients: age, gender, primary disease, viral screening protocols for donors and recipients, COVID-19 status and outcome. The European society for blood and marrow transplantation (EBMT) guidelines were applied strictly on all of our patients, donors and bone marrow transplant unit staff. Results: A total of 10 children were transplanted, 8 of them received allogenic transplant from matched donor and two patients received autologous transplant. Regarding allogenic transplants, all of our patients except two were transplanted as an emergency, 2 of them were Aplastic anemia, 2 patients were Fanconi anemia, one patient was Amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, and one patient was Acute myeloid leukemia. Only two patients were not an emergency as one of them had Thalassemia major and the other one was Sickle cell anemia. The autologous transplant was done for two patients with Neuroblastoma stage 4 as part of their treatment protocol. At a median follow up of 5.5 months (range, 2 month-7 months) two patients (20%) developed COVID-19, which was asymptomatic in both of them. One of our patients (10%) died due to cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia. No one of our patient was affected by the emergency regulations applied by the country and hospitals during the pandemic of COVID-19 virus. Conclusion: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can be performed safely for emergency cases, if we strictly follow the guidelines of EBMT.","['(c) 2021 Mousa Qatawneh, Mais Aljazazi, Moath Altarawneh, Hadeel Aljamaen, Maher', 'Mustafa, Alaa Alqasem, Amjad Abu Sharar.']","['Qatawneh, Mousa', 'Aljazazi, Mais', 'Altarawneh, Moath', 'Aljamaen, Hadeel', 'Mustafa, Maher', 'Alqasem, Alaa', 'Sharar, Amjad Abu']","['Qatawneh M', 'Aljazazi M', 'Altarawneh M', 'Aljamaen H', 'Mustafa M', 'Alqasem A', 'Sharar AA']",,"[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Medical Oncology, Queen Rania Children's Hospital.

Patients/Materials and Methods Duration of the study is from 2015 to 2019 in which 5 ALL cases were presented to this tertiary care center. The presenting symptoms varied from headache, fever, and distension of abdomen. These cases were either on therapy or post completion of chemotherapy. The diagnosis of CNS relapse followed after the examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Patients also underwent BM examination to rule out systemic relapse. Results Age of patients ranged from 7 months to 42 years. There were three female patients. Two patients had isolated CNS relapse 3.5 years after completing therapy and succumbed to their illness. Two patients had t(9;22) while one patient had t(1;14) cytogenetic abnormality at diagnosis. One patient was diagnosed as T-ALL. Treatment offered was German Multicentre ALL protocol for induction along with 10 cycles of maintenance. Conclusion The most common hematolymphoid malignancy in children namely ALL accounts for 75% of childhood leukemias. Complete remission rates reach up to 70 to 80%. CNS involvement is known to occur in these cases. CNS relapse may occur alone or with systemic relapse. Advances in therapeutic protocols along with CNS prophylaxis have drastically brought down the rates of CNS relapse. It is essential to maintain a high degree of suspicion so that these cases of isolated CNS relapse can be identified at the earliest and definitive therapy can be offered.","['The Indian Association of Laboratory Physicians.

Early recognition is crucial, and immediate treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO) can be life-saving. The goal of this study was to describe patients who first presented to neuro-ophthalmology and were subsequently diagnosed with APML. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients seen at a tertiary neuro-ophthalmology centre. Patients with an unknown diagnosis of APML at presentation who subsequently went on to receive this diagnosis were included. Clinical characteristics, neuro-ophthalmologic findings, and outcome were retrieved. RESULTS: A total of 3 patients (2 women and 1 men) with a mean age of 30.7 (range 24-33) years were included in the study. Neuro-ophthalmologic diagnoses at presentation were severe hemorrhagic papilledema related to dural venous sinus thrombosis, hemorrhagic bilateral optic disc edema, and left homonymous hemianopia related to an occipital lobe hemorrhage. At diagnosis, the average hemoglobin was 83.7g/L (range 78-104), and the platelet count was 39.3 x 109/L (range 15-77). All patients were treated with ATRA and ATO. One patient developed papilledema and sixth nerve palsies related to this treatment, which resolved with acetazolamide. Clinical follow-up ranged from 6 to 12 months, and all patients were in clinical remission about systemic APML.

Deconvolution of these signatures offers a glimpse into the evolutionary history of individual tumors. Recent work has shown that mutational signatures may also yield therapeutic and prognostic insights, including the identification of cell-intrinsic signatures as biomarkers of drug response and prognosis. For example, mutational signatures indicating homologous recombination deficiency are associated with poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor sensitivity, whereas APOBEC-associated signatures are associated with ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related kinase (ATR) inhibitor sensitivity. Furthermore, therapy-induced mutational signatures implicated in cancer progression have also been uncovered, including the identification of thiopurine-induced TP53 mutations in leukemia. In this review, we explore the various ways mutational signatures can reveal new therapeutic and prognostic insights, thus extending their traditional role in identifying disease etiology.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s).

This study aims to determine the impact of JAK2V617F mutation on clinical phenotype and outcome in Ph-negative MPNs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical correlates and long-term prognostic relevance of the JAK2V617F mutation were analyzed in 410Ph-negative MPNs-170 ET, 135 PV, 105 PMF- from two institutions and followed for a mean of 76.7 months (SD 62.1) (mean 87 months (SD 67.8), 70.4 months (SD 56.4), 68 months (SD 57.4), respectively for ET, PV and PMF). 228 patients were genotyped for JAK2V617F mutation using the JAK2 Ipsogen MutaScreen assay, which involves allele-specific polymerase chain reaction(PCR)and 182 patients were genotyped using Melting Curve analysis. RESULTS: In PV patients,JAK2V617F mutation was associated with higher rate in females, lower hemoglobin (Hgb) levels, higher leukocyte and platelet counts and higher prevalence of thrombosis(p=0.008; p=0.018; p=0.001; p=0.001 and p=0.035, respectively).In ET patients, JAK2V617F mutation was associated with higher Hgb and hematocrit (Hct) levels and lower platelet count(p=0.001; p=0.001 and p=0.001, respectively). JAK2V617F-negative ET patients showed a trend towards higher rate of leukemic transformation (p=0.061).JAK2V617F mutation positive PMF patients had higher leukocyte count, greater spleen size and showed a trend towards higher Hgb level(p=0.019; p=0.042 and p=0.056, respectively).Among PMF patients with JAK2V617F mutation, the rate of female patients was lower (p=0.001). Overall survival (OS) in Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS)-plus high risk PMF patients was shorter compared to the other risk groups (p=0.001). Leukemia-free survival (LFS) was shorter in DIPSS-plus high risk PMF patients than the other risk groups (p=0.005). In the entire cohort of Ph-negative MPN patients, JAK2V617F mutation was associated with higher leukocyte count, higher Hgb and Hct levels and lower platelet count, higher frequency of phlebotomies, a trend towards older age, a trend towards greater spleen size, a trend towards a higher prevalence of risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and thrombosis (p=0.001; p=0.005; p=0.001; p=0.003, p=0.004; p=0.052; p=0.056; p=0.052 and p=0.059, respectively) Conclusion: In our study population, it was demonstrated that the presence of JAK2V617F mutation in ET patients wasassociated with PV-like phenotype. Our study also showed that the presence of the JAK2V617F mutation was associated with increased risk of thrombotic complications. Our results suggest that JAK2V617F mutation is associated with a more pronounced myeloproliferative phenotype in PMF patients.

To promote self-renewal, transcriptional regulators maintain epigenetic information during multiple rounds of cell division. Mutations in such transcriptional regulators cause aberrant self-renewal, leading to leukemia. MOZ, a histone acetyltransferase, and MLL, a histone methyltransferase, are transcriptional regulators that promote the self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells. Gene rearrangements of MOZ and MLL generate chimeric genes encoding fusion proteins that function as constitutively active forms. These MOZ and MLL fusion proteins constitutively activate transcription of their target genes and cause aberrant self-renewal in committed hematopoietic progenitors, which normally do not self-renew. Recent progress in the field suggests that MOZ and MLL are part of a transcriptional activation system that activates the transcription of genes with nonmethylated CpG-rich promoters. The nonmethylated state of CpGs is normally maintained during cell divisions from the mother cell to the daughter cells. Thus, the MOZ/MLL-mediated transcriptional activation system replicates the expression profile of mother cells in daughter cells by activating the transcription of genes previously transcribed in the mother cell. This review summarizes the functions of the components of the MOZ/MLL-mediated transcriptional activation system and their roles in the promotion of self-renewal.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

We analyzed the whole-exome sequencing data of paired leukemia and skin biopsy samples from 391 adult patients from the Beat AML 1.0 consortium. Using the 2015 ACMG guidelines for variant interpretation, we curated 1,547 unique variants from 228 genes. The pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) germline variants were identified in 53 AML patients (13.6%) in 34 genes. 41% of variants were in DNA damage response genes, and the most frequently mutated genes were CHEK2 (8 patients) and DDX41 (7 patients). 44% of the pathogenic germline variants were in genes considered clinically actionable (tier 1). Pathogenic germline variants were also found in new candidate genes (DNAH5, DNAH9, DNMT3A, SUZ12). No strong correlation was found between the germline mutational rate and age of AML onset. Among 49 patients who have a reported history of at least one family member affected with hematological malignancies, six patients harbored known P/LP germline variants and the remaining patients had at least one variant of uncertain significance, suggesting a need for further functional validation studies. Using CHEK2 as an example, we show that three-dimensional protein modeling can be one of the effective methodologies to prioritize variants of unknown significance for functional studies. Further, we evaluated an in-silico approach that applies ACMG/AMP curation in an automated manner using the tool for assessment and prioritization in exome studies (TAPES), which can minimize manual curation time for variants.

Among post-transcriptional processes, alternative polyadenylation (APA) is globally dysregulated across cancer types. However, limited studies have focused on the prevalence and role of APA in myeloid leukemia. Furthermore, it is poorly understood how altered poly(A) site (PAS) usage of individual genes contributes to malignancy or whether targeting global APA patterns might alter oncogenic potential. In this study, we examined global APA dysregulation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients by performing 3' Region Extraction And Deep Sequencing (3'READS) on a subset of AML patient samples along with healthy hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and by analyzing publicly available data from a broad AML patient cohort. We show that patient cells exhibit global 3' untranslated region (UTR) shortening and coding sequence (CDS) lengthening due to differences in PAS usage. Among APA regulators, expression of FIP1L1, one of the core cleavage and polyadenylation factors, correlated with the degree of APA dysregulation in our 3'READS dataset. Targeting global APA by FIP1L1 knockdown reversed the global trends seen in patients. Importantly, FIP1L1 knockdown induced differentiation of t(8;21) cells by promoting 3'UTR lengthening and downregulation of the fusion oncoprotein AML1-ETO. In non-t(8;21) cells, FIP1L1 knockdown also promoted differentiation by attenuating mTORC1 signaling and reducing MYC protein levels. Our study provides mechanistic insights into the role of APA in AML pathogenesis and indicates that targeting global APA patterns can overcome the differentiation block of AML patients.",['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society of Hematology.'],"['Davis, Amanda G', 'Johnson, Daniel T', 'Zheng, Dinghai', 'Wang, Ruijia', 'Jayne, Nathan D', 'Liu, Mengdan', 'Shin, Jihae', 'Wang, Luyang', 'Stoner, Samuel A', 'Zhou, Jie-Hua', 'Ball, Edward D', 'Tian, Bin', 'Zhang, Dong-Er']","['Davis AG', 'Johnson DT', 'Zheng D', 'Wang R', 'Jayne ND', 'Liu M', 'Shin J', 'Wang L', 'Stoner SA', 'Zhou JH', 'Ball ED', 'Tian B', 'Zhang DE']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4356-7480', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4669-037X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4500-7666', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4211-5207', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4868-7182', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7825-0518', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8903-8256', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2541-6443']","['University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States.', 'University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States.', 'Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, Newark, New Jersey, United States.', 'University of Massachusetts Medical School Program in Molecular Medicine, United States.', 'University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States.', 'University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States.', 'The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.', 'The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.', 'University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States.', 'University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States.', 'UCSD, La Jolla, California, United States.', 'Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, United States.', 'University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States.']",['eng'],['P30 CA010815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,,2021/09/06 06:00,2021/09/06 06:00,['2021/09/05 20:58'],"['2021/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/04 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/05 20:58 [entrez]', '2021/09/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(21)01562-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2020005693 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Blood. 2021 Sep 5. pii: S0006-4971(21)01562-7. doi: 10.1182/blood.2020005693.,20210905,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite recent advances in targeted therapeutics, patients with Philadelphia-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like ALL), a high-risk malignancy, lack specific and effective targeted treatments. Cytokine receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2) is overexpressed in 50% of Ph-like ALL cases, conferring the survival of leukemia blasts through activation of the JAK/STAT signalling pathway. Targeting such a vital cell-surface protein could result in potent anti-leukaemic efficacy and reduce the likelihood of relapse associated with antigen loss. Herein, we developed a novel single-chain variable fragment (scFv) against CRLF2 based on a monoclonal antibody raised against the recombinant extracellular domain of human TSLPRalpha chain. The scFv fragment demonstrated excellent binding affinity with CRLF2 protein in the nanomolar range. Cellular association studies in vitro using an inducible CRLF2 knockdown cell line and ex vivo using patient-derived xenografts revealed the selective association of the scFv with CRLF2.

These studies have been aggregated in a series of pooled analyses, but it has been 10 years since the last such. METHODS: We present a pooled analysis combining individual-level data (24,994 cases, 30,769 controls) from four recent studies on MF and childhood leukemia. RESULTS: Unlike previous pooled analyses, we found no increased risk of leukemia among children exposed to greater MF: odds ratio (OR) = 1.01, for exposure >/=0.4 muT (muT) compared with exposures <0.1 muT. Similarly, no association was observed in the subset of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, birth homes, studies using calculated fields, or when geocoding accuracy was ignored. In these studies, there is a decline in risk over time, also evident when we compare three pooled analyses. A meta-analysis of the three pooled analyses overall presents an OR of 1.45 (95% CI: 0.95-2.20) for exposures >/=0.4 muT. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are not in line with previous pooled analysis and show a decrease in effect to no association between MF and childhood leukemia.

The karyotype abnormalities in AML-MRC have been well established; however, relatively little has been known about the role of gene mutation profiles by next generation sequencing. 177 AML patients (72 AML-MRC and 105 non-MRC AML) were analyzed by NGS panel covering 53 AML related genes. AML-MRC showed statistically significantly higher frequency of TP53 mutation, but lower frequencies of mutations in NPM1, FLT3-ITD(Low), FLT3-ITD(High), FLT3-TKD, NRAS, and PTPN11 than non-MRC AML. Supervised tree-based classification models including Decision tree, Random forest, and XGboost, and logistic regression were used to evaluate if the mutation profiles could be used to aid the diagnosis of AML-MRC. All methods showed good accuracy in differentiating AML-MRC from non-MRC AML with AUC (area under curve) of ROC ranging from 0.69 to 0.78. Additionally, logistic regression indicated 3 independent factors (age and mutations of TP53 and FLT3) could aid the diagnosis AML-MRC. Using weighted factors, a AML-MRC risk scoring equation was established for potential application in clinical setting: +1x(Age >/= 65) + 3 x (TP53 mutation) - 2 x (FLT3 mutation). Using a cutoff score of 0, the accuracy of the risk score was 0.76 with sensitivity of 0.77 and specificity of 0.75 for predicting the diagnosis of AML-MRC. Further studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to further evaluate the potential of using gene mutation profiles to aid the diagnosis of AML-MRC.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Thiopurine prodrugs are efficient UVA absorbers and singlet oxygen generators and the long-term treatment with these prodrugs correlates with a high incidence of sunlight-induced skin cancer in patients. In this contribution, we show that the electronic relaxation mechanisms and photochemical properties of azathioprine are remarkably different from those of 6-mercaptopurine upon absorption of UVA radiation. UVA excitation of 6-mercaptopurine results in nearly 100% triplet yield and up to 30% singlet oxygen generation, whereas excitation of azathioprine with UVA leads to triplet yields of 15-3% depending on pH of the aqueous solution and <1% singlet oxygen generation. While photoexcitation of 6-mercaptopurine and other thiopurine prodrugs can facilitate oxidatively generated cell damage, azathioprine's poor photosensitization ability reveals the use of interchromophoric charge-transfer interactions for the molecular design of photostable prodrugs exhibiting a remarkable reduction in photocytotoxic side effects before drug metabolization.",['(c) 2021 American Society for Photobiology.'],"['Ortiz-Rodriguez, Luis A', 'Ortiz-Zayas, Glesmarie', 'Pollum, Marvin', 'Hoehn, Sean J', 'Jockusch, Steffen', 'Crespo-Hernandez, Carlos E']","['Ortiz-Rodriguez LA', 'Ortiz-Zayas G', 'Pollum M', 'Hoehn SJ', 'Jockusch S', 'Crespo-Hernandez CE']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3594-0890'],"['Department of Chemistry, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['CHE-1800052/National Science Foundation', 'CHE-1255084/National Science Foundation', 'CHE-1539808/National Science Foundation']",['Journal Article'],United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,IM,,,2021/09/05 06:00,2021/09/05 06:00,['2021/09/04 12:14'],"['2021/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/05 06:00 [medline]', '2021/09/04 12:14 [entrez]']",['10.1111/php.13513 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Photochem Photobiol. 2021 Sep 4. doi: 10.1111/php.13513.,20210904,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study is to describe the outcome and its specific risk factors for children, adolescents and young adults after a first allogeneic HSCT for AML. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we compared the outcome of AML patients receiving a first allogeneic HSCT between 2005 and 2017 according to their age at transplantation's time: children (< 15 years, n = 564), adolescent and post-adolescent (APA) patients (15-25 years, n = 647) and young adults (26-40 years; n = 1434). RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 4.37 years (min-max 0.18-14.73 years), the probability of 2-year overall survival (OS) was 71.4% in children, 61.1% in APA patients and 62.9% in young adults (p = 0.0009 for intergroup difference). Both relapse and non-relapse mortality (NRM) Cumulative Incidence (CI) estimated at 2 years were different between the age groups (30.8% for children, 35.2% for APA patients and 29.4% for young adults-p = 0.0254, and 7.0% for children, 10.6% for APA patients and 14.2% for young adults, p < 0.0001; respectively). Whilst there was no difference between the three groups for grade I to IV acute GVHD CI at 3 months, the chronic GVHD CI at 2 years was higher in APA patients and young adults (31.4% and 36.4%, respectively) in comparison to the children (17.5%) (p < 0.0001). In multivariable analysis, factors associated with death were AML cytogenetics (HR1.73 [1.29-2.32] for intermediate risk 1, HR 1.50 [1.13-2.01] for intermediate risk 2, HR 2.22 [1.70-2.89] for high cytogenetics risk compared to low risk), use of TBI >/= 8 Grays (HR 1.33 [1.09-1.61]), disease status at transplant (HR 1.40 [1.10-1.78] for second Complete Remission (CR), HR 2.26 [1.02-4.98] for third CR and HR 3.07 [2.44-3.85] for active disease, compared to first CR), graft source (HR 1.26 [1.05-1.50] for Peripheral Blood Stem Cells compared to Bone Marrow) and donor age (HR 1.01 (1-1.02] by increase of 1 year). CONCLUSION: Age is an independent risk factor for NRM and extensive chronic GVHD. This study suggests that APA patients with AML could be beneficially treated with a chemotherapy-based MAC regimen and bone marrow as a stem cells source.",['(c) 2021.

Current treatment strategies in PV have not been shown to prolong survival or lessen the risk of leukemic or fibrotic progression and instead are directed at preventing thrombotic complications. In the latter regard, two risk categories are considered: high (age >60 years or thrombosis history) and low (absence of both risk factors). All patients require phlebotomy to keep hematocrit below 45% and once-daily low-dose aspirin, in the absence of contraindications. Cytoreductive therapy is recommended for high-risk or symptomatic low-risk disease; our first-line drug of choice in this regard is hydroxyurea but we consider pegylated interferon as an alternative in certain situations, including in young women of reproductive age, in patients manifesting intolerance or resistance to hydroxyurea therapy, and in situations where treatment is indicated for curbing phlebotomy requirement rather than preventing thrombosis. Additional treatment options include busulfan and ruxolitinib; the former is preferred in older patients and the latter in the presence of symptoms reminiscent of post-PV myelofibrosis or protracted pruritus. Our drug choices reflect our appreciation for long-term track record of safety, evidence for reduction of thrombosis risk, and broader suppression of myeloproliferation. Controlled studies are needed to clarify the added value of twice- vs once-daily aspirin dosing and direct oral anticoagulants. In this invited review, we discuss our current approach to diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment of PV in general, as well as during specific situations, including pregnancy and splanchnic vein thrombosis.",['(c) 2021.

JAK2 inhibitors provide clinical benefits, but compensatory activation of MAPK pathway signaling impedes efficacy. We hypothesized that dual targeting of JAK2 and ERK1/2 could enhance clone control and therapeutic efficacy. We employed genetic and pharmacologic targeting of ERK1/2 in Jak2V617F MPN mice, cells and patient clinical isolates. Competitive transplantations of Jak2V617F vs. wild-type bone marrow (BM) showed that ERK1/2 deficiency in hematopoiesis mitigated MPN features and reduced the Jak2V617F clone in blood and hematopoietic progenitor compartments. ERK1/2 ablation combined with JAK2 inhibition suppressed MAPK transcriptional programs, normalized cytoses and promoted clone control suggesting dual JAK2/ERK1/2 targeting as enhanced corrective approach. Combined pharmacologic JAK2/ERK1/2 inhibition with ruxolitinib and ERK inhibitors reduced proliferation of Jak2V617F cells and corrected erythrocytosis and splenomegaly of Jak2V617F MPN mice. Longer-term treatment was able to induce clone reductions. BM fibrosis was significantly decreased in MPLW515L-driven MPN to an extent not seen with JAK2 inhibitor monotherapy. Colony formation from JAK2V617F patients' CD34(+) blood and BM was dose-dependently inhibited by combined JAK2/ERK1/2 inhibition in PV, ET, and MF subsets. Overall, we observed that dual targeting of JAK2 and ERK1/2 was able to enhance therapeutic efficacy suggesting a novel treatment approach for MPN.",['(c) 2021.

European Research Initiative on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia promotes good practices and standardized approaches to this assay but often they are labor-intensive, technically complex, with limited in scalability. The use of next-generation sequencing in this analysis has been widely tested, showing comparable accuracy and distinct advantages. However, the adoption of the next generation sequencing requires a high sample number (run batching) to be economically convenient, which could lead to a longer turnaround time. Here we present data from nanopore sequencing for the somatic hypermutation evaluation compared to the standard method.

We explored patterns of care in this population and whether survival is associated with provider type. METHODS: Utilizing the California Cancer Registry, we examined a cohort of 9,993 AYAs diagnosed with cancer aged 15 to 24 years from 1999 to 2008. Provider type (adult/pediatric) was determined by individual physician identifiers. For provider type, multivariable logistic regression models were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, diagnosis, and stage. For observed survival, Cox proportional hazard models were additionally adjusted for provider type. ORs and HR with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were determined. RESULTS: Most patients saw adult providers (87.3% overall; 72.7% aged 15-19 years). Patients with acute leukemia, sarcoma, and central nervous system (CNS) malignancies more often saw pediatric providers [OR (95% CI) adult versus pediatric 0.48 (0.39-0.59), 0.74 (0.60-0.92), 0.76 (0.60-0.96), respectively]; those with germ cell tumors and other cancers, including carcinomas, more often saw adult providers [2.26 (1.72-2.98), 1.79 (1.41-2.27), respectively]. In aggregate and for most cancers individually, there was no survival difference by provider type [overall HR (95% CI) 1.00 (0.86-1.18)]. Higher survival was associated with pediatric providers for CNS malignancies [1.63 (1.12-2.37)] and rhabdomyosarcoma [2.22 (1.03-4.76)], and with adult providers for non-Hodgkin lymphoma [0.61 (0.39-0.96)]. CONCLUSIONS: Most AYAs 15 to 24 years old are treated by medical oncologists. In general, survival was not associated with provider type. IMPACT: Current patterns of care for this population support increased collaboration between medical and pediatric oncology, including joint clinical trials.",['(c)2021 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Collins, Chelsea L', 'Peng, Jiahao', 'Singh, Sharn', 'Hamilton, Ann S', 'Freyer, David R']","['Collins CL', 'Peng J', 'Singh S', 'Hamilton AS', 'Freyer DR']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4028-383X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5898-2308', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5280-990X']","['Department of Pediatrics, Loma Linda University School of Medicine, Loma Linda, California. clcollins@llu.edu.', 'Loma Linda University School of Public Health, Loma Linda, California.', 'Loma Linda University School of Public Health, Loma Linda, California.', 'Los Angeles Cancer Surveillance Program and Department of Preventive Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', 'Department of Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', ""Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California."", 'USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,IM,,,2021/09/05 06:00,2021/09/05 06:00,['2021/09/04 05:42'],"['2021/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/23 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/05 06:00 [medline]', '2021/09/04 05:42 [entrez]']","['1055-9965.EPI-21-0530 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-21-0530 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2021 Nov;30(11):2105-2113. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-21-0530.

A 23-year-old man with CML and on nilotinib was admitted to the intensive care unit due to respiratory failure. Three years prior, he developed pleural effusion from dasatinib therapy thus, his CML regimen was changed to nilotinib. Although the pleural effusion had once improved, the chest imaging revealed left-dominant bilateral pleural effusion. Endotracheal intubation and left thoracic drainage were performed. Nilotinib treatment was discontinued, and approximately 60 hours later, nilotinib concentrations of 927 and 2092 ng/mL were determined in his blood and pleural effusion, respectively. Severe pleural effusion may be induced in patients administering nilotinib, and nilotinib concentrations in blood and pleural effusion can be elevated in patients with nilotinib-related pleural effusion. Cross-occurrence of pleural effusions needs to be monitored precisely, especially in patients who are switched to other tyrosine kinase inhibitors after dasatinib treatment.","['(c) BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2021.

However, research on quality of life in patients under active surveillance versus in cancer-directed treatment has yielded mixed results. This study examined distress and quality of life in indolent NHL/CLL patients in active surveillance or cancer-directed treatment over the first-year post-diagnosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adult patients (>/=21 years) with newly diagnosed indolent NHL/CLL completed electronic self-report measure of distress and quality of life every 4 months over the course of a year for a total of 4 surveys. Fisher's exact test and t-tests were used to examine demographic and disease differences between patients receiving different treatments. Mixed-effect models were also used to compare overall differences between treatment status over time, accounting for missing values. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 64 patients with known baseline treatment status who did not change treatments over the course of the study. Total quality of life and physical, social and functional quality of life improved over time in patients receiving cancer-directed treatment and decreased over time in patients under active surveillance. Relative to patients in active treatment, overall, social, and functional quality of life in patients under surveillance changed more slowly over time. DISCUSSION: Active surveillance may have negative implications for patient quality of life, despite that a common goal of active surveillance is to delay the impact of treatment (e.g., appointments, toxicities) on quality of life.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

A variety of platforms exist for MRD detection, varying in their sensitivity and applicability to individual patients. MRD detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, multiparameter flow cytometry, or next-generation sequencing has prognostic implications in various subsets of AML and at various times throughout treatment. While it is overwhelmingly evident that minute levels of remnant disease confer increased risk of relapse and shortened survival, the therapeutic implications of MRD remain less clear. The use of MRD as a guide to selecting the most optimal post-remission therapy, including hematopoietic stem cell transplant or maintenance therapy with hypomethylating agents, small molecule inhibitors, or immunotherapy is an area of active investigation. In addition, whether there are sufficient data to use MRD negativity as a surrogate endpoint in clinical trial development is controversial. In this review, we will critically examine the methods used to detect MRD, its role as a prognostic biomarker, MRD-directed therapeutics, and its potential role as a study endpoint.",['(c) 2021.

In the USA, between 1975 and 2016, ALL rates (ALLRs) rose 93.51% from 1.91 to 3.70/100,000 < 20 years. ALL is more common in Caucasian-Americans than amongst minorities. The cause of both the rise and the ethnic differential is unclear, however, prenatal cannabis exposure was previously linked with elevated childhood leukaemia rates. We investigated epidemiologically if cannabis use impacted nationally on ALLRs, its ethnic effects, and if the relationship was causal. METHODS: State data on overall, and ethnic ALLR from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results databank of the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) and National Cancer Institute (NCI) were combined with drug (cigarettes, alcoholism, cannabis, analgesics, cocaine) use data from the National Survey of Drug Use and Health; 74.1% response rate. Income and ethnicity data was from the US Census bureau. Cannabinoid concentration was from the Drug Enforcement Agency Data. Data was analyzed in R by robust and spatiotemporal regression. RESULTS: In bivariate analyses a dose-response relationship was demonstrated between ALLR and Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), cocaine and cannabis exposure, with the effect of cannabis being strongest (beta-estimate = 3.33(95%C.I. 1.97, 4.68), P = 1.92 x 10(- 6)). A strong effect of cannabis use quintile on ALLR was noted (Chi.Sq. = 613.79, P = 3.04 x 10(- 70)). In inverse probability weighted robust regression adjusted for other substances, income and ethnicity, cannabis was independently significant (beta-estimate = 4.75(0.48, 9.02), P = 0.0389). In a spatiotemporal model adjusted for all drugs, income, and ethnicity, cannabigerol exposure was significant (beta-estimate = 0.26(0.01, 0.52), P = 0.0444), an effect increased by spatial lagging (THC: beta-estimate = 0.47(0.12, 0.82), P = 0.0083). After missing data imputation ethnic cannabis exposure was significant (beta-estimate = 0.64(0.55, 0.72), P = 3.1 x 10(- 40)). 33/35 minimum e-Values ranged from 1.25 to 3.94 x 10(36) indicative of a causal relationship. Relaxation of cannabis legal paradigms had higher ALLR (Chi.Squ.Trend = 775.12, P = 2.14 x 10(- 112)). Cannabis legal states had higher ALLR (2.395 +/- 0.039 v. 2.127 +/- 0.008 / 100,000, P = 5.05 x 10(- 10)). CONCLUSIONS: Data show that ALLR is associated with cannabis consumption across space-time, is associated with the cannabinoids, THC, cannabigerol, cannabinol, cannabichromene, and cannabidiol, contributes to ethnic differentials, demonstrates prominent quintile effects, satisfies criteria for causality and is exacerbated by cannabis legalization.",['(c) 2021.

However, many of these inhibitors are challenged by the secondary mutations on kinase domain, especially the point mutations at the activation loop (D835) and gatekeeper residue (F691). To overcome the resistance challenge, we identified a novel series of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-thiophene derivatives from a NIMA-related kinase 2 (NEK2) kinase inhibitor CMP3a, which retained inhibitory activities on FTL3-ITD(D835V) and FLT3-ITD(F691L). Through this study, we identified the imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-thiophene derivatives as type-I inhibitors of FLT3. Moreover, we observed compound 5o as an inhibitor displaying equal anti-proliferative activities against FLT3-ITD, FTL3-ITD(D835Y) and FLT3-ITD(F691L) driven acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines. Meanwhile, the apoptotic effects of compound supported its mechanism of anti-proliferative action. These results indicate that the imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-thiophene scaffold is promising for targeting acquired resistance caused by FLT3 secondary mutations and compound 5o is an interesting lead in this direction.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

Haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (haploHCT) is thus an attractive procedure for patients with high-risk hematologic malignancies. This study was conducted to assess the safety and feasibility of haploHCT in South Africa. We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of 134 patients with hematologic malignancies who received unmanipulated haploHCT with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide at 2 high-volume HCT centers between 2014 and 2019. We assessed overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), nonrelapse mortality (NRM), relapse incidence (RI), and incidence of acute GVHD. The median recipient age was 44 years (range, 15 to 73 years) and the median donor age was 36 years (range, 9 to 68 years). Acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were the most common indications for haploHCT (61.2%). The European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation risk score was >/=5 in 44 patients (32.8%). Seventy-seven patients (57.4%) received a myeloablative conditioning regimen. The majority of patients received a sex-matched transplant (57.4%) and had peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) as the stem cell source (70.9%). Sixteen patients (11.9%) had an incongruent cytomegalovirus serostatus at transplantation. The median duration of follow-up was 10.8 months (range, 0.36 to 70.8 months). OS was 56% (95% confidence interval [CI], 47% to 64%) at 1 year and 37% (95% CI, 28% to 47%) at 3 years. DFS was 47% (95% CI, 38% to 55%) at 1 year and 32% (95% CI, 24% to 41%) at 3 years. The 100-day and 3-year cumulative incidence of NRM was 18% (95% CI, 11% to 25%) and 41% (95% CI, 32% to 50%), respectively, and the 1- and 3-year cumulative RI was 16% (95% CI, 11% to 24%) and 21% (95% CI, 14% to 29%), respectively. The 1-year OS was 55% (95% CI, 40% to 67%) for the patients with AML/MDS versus 41% (95% CI, 21% to 60%) for those with ALL. Forty-five patients (41.7%) developed acute GVHD by day +100; of these, 80% had grade I-II disease. Fifty patients (37.5%) developed cytomegalovirus infection that required therapy. On multivariable analysis, older donor age was an independent risk factor for lower DFS. RI was higher for diagnoses other than acute leukemia/MDS (relative risk [RR], 2.62; 95% CI, 1.12 to 6.15; P = .027), decreased for PBSC versus bone marrow (RR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.95; P = .038) and decreased for offspring donors (RR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.67; P = .006). These data support the feasibility of haploHCT and suggest that unmanipulated haploHCT using a younger parent or offspring donor is a viable option for adults in sub-Saharan Africa with acute leukemia and MDS who lack a suitable related or unrelated donor.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

CD22 is a pan-B marker whose expression is maintained in both CD19(+) and CD19(-) relapses. CD22-CAR T cells have been clinically used in B-ALL patients, although relapse also occurs. T cells engineered with a tandem CAR (Tan-CAR) containing in a single construct both CD19 and CD22 scFvs may be advantageous in achieving higher remission rates and/or preventing antigen loss. We have generated and functionally validated using cutting-edge assays a 4-1BB-based CD22/CD19 Tan-CAR using in-house-developed novel CD19 and CD22 scFvs. Tan-CAR-expressing T cells showed similar in vitro expansion to CD19-CAR T cells with no increase in tonic signaling. CRISPR-Cas9-edited B-ALL cells confirmed the bispecificity of the Tan-CAR. Tan-CAR was as efficient as CD19-CAR in vitro and in vivo using B-ALL cell lines, patient samples, and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Strikingly, the robust antileukemic activity of the Tan-CAR was slightly more effective in controlling the disease in long-term follow-up PDX models. This Tan-CAR construct warrants a clinical appraisal to test whether simultaneous targeting of CD19 and CD22 enhances leukemia eradication and reduces/delays relapse rates and antigen loss.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors.

In multiple myeloma, MCL-1 has been described as a major gatekeeper of apoptosis. This discovery has led to the rapid establishment of clinical trials evaluating the impact of various MCL-1 inhibitors. However, our understanding about the clinical impact and optimal use of MCL-1 inhibitors is still limited. We therefore explored mechanisms of acquired MCL-1 inhibitor resistance and optimization strategies in myeloma. Our findings indicated heterogeneous paths to resistance involving baseline Bcl-2 family alterations of proapoptotic (BAK, BAX, and BIM) and antiapoptotic (Bcl-2 and MCL-1) proteins. These manifestations depend on the BH3 profile of parental cells that guide the enhanced formation of Bcl-2:BIM and/or the dynamic (ie, treatment-induced) formation of Bcl-xL:BIM and Bcl-xL:BAK complexes. Accordingly, an unbiased high-throughput drug-screening approach (n = 528) indicated alternative BH3 mimetics as top combination partners for MCL-1 inhibitors in sensitive and resistant cells (Bcl-xL>Bcl-2 inhibition), whereas established drug classes were mainly antagonistic (eg, antimitotic agents). We also revealed reduced activity of MCL-1 inhibitors in the presence of stromal support as a drug-class effect that was overcome by concurrent Bcl-xL or Bcl-2 inhibition. Finally, we demonstrated heterogeneous Bcl-2 family deregulation and MCL-1 inhibitor cross-resistance in carfilzomib-resistant cells, a phenomenon linked to the MDR1-driven drug efflux of MCL-1 inhibitors.

Patients with CLL resistant to their first targeted agent (TA) can be effectively treated with the alternative class. However, relapses are expected with second-line TA therapy, and the clinical challenge of double class-resistant disease is now emerging with increasing frequency. To define the characteristics and outcomes of patients with double class-resistant disease, we retrospectively analyzed 17 patients who developed progressive disease (PD) on both TA classes for CLL (venetoclax, then BTKi, n=12; BTKi, then venetoclax, n = 5). The cohort was heavily pretreated (median lines of prior therapy, 4) and enriched for adverse disease genetics (complex karyotype, 12 of 12 tested [100%]; del(17p)/TP53 mutations, 15 of 17 [88%]). The median time to progression on prior venetoclax was 24 months (range, 6-94 months) and was 25 months (range, 1-55 months) on prior BTKi. Progression on second-line TA was manifest as progressive CLL in 11 patients and as Richter transformation in 6. The median overall survival after progression on second-line TA was 3.6 months (95% confidence interval, 2-11 months). Patients with double class-resistant CLL have a dismal prognosis, representing a group of high unmet need.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

Antibiotics disrupt the gut microbiota, with adverse clinical consequences, such as Clostridioides difficile infection. A better understanding of NF pathogenesis could inform the development of novel therapeutics without deleterious effects on the microbiota. We hypothesized that metabolites absorbed from the gut to the bloodstream modulate pyrogenic and inflammatory pathways. Longitudinal profiling of the gut microbiota in 2 cohorts of patients with acute leukemia showed that Akkermansia expansion in the gut was associated with an increased risk for NF. As a prototype mucolytic genus, Akkermansia may influence the absorption of luminal metabolites; thus, its association with NF supported our metabolomics hypothesis. Longitudinal profiling of the serum metabolome identified a signature associated with gut Akkermansia and 1 with NF. Importantly, these 2 signatures overlapped in metabolites in the gamma-glutamyl cycle, suggesting oxidative stress as a mediator involved in Akkermansia-related NF. In addition, the level of gut microbial-derived indole compounds increased after Akkermansia expansion and decreased before NF, suggesting their role in mediating the anti-inflammatory effects of Akkermansia, as seen predominantly in healthy individuals. These results suggest that Akkermansia regulates microbiota-host metabolic cross talk by modulating the mucosal interface. The clinical context, including factors influencing microbiota composition, determines the type of metabolites absorbed through the gut barrier and their net effect on the host. Our findings identify novel aspects of NF pathogenesis that could be targets for precision therapeutics.

This study was designed to evaluate the effect of this agent on Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) cell lines, either as a monotherapy or in combination with Vincristine (VCR). METHODS AND RESULTS: To determine the anti-leukemic effects of Britannin on ALL-derived cell lines and suggest a mechanism of action for the agent, we used MTT assay, Annexin-V/PI staining, ROS assay, and real-time PCR analysis. Moreover, by using a combination index (CI), we evaluated the synergistic effect of Britannin on Vincristine. We found that unlike normal Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) and L929 cells, Britannin reduced the viability of NALM-6, REH, and JURKAT cells. Among tested cells, NALM-6 cells had the highest sensitivity to Britannin, and this agent was able to induce p21/p27-mediated G1 cell cycle arrest and Reactive Oxygen Specious (ROS)-mediated apoptotic cell death in this cell line. When NALM-6 cells were treated with Nacetyl-L-Cysteine (NAC), a scavenger of ROS, Britannin could induce neither apoptosis nor reduce the survival of the cells suggesting that the cytotoxic effect of Britannin is induced through ROS-dependent manner. Moreover, we found that a low dose of Britannin enhanced the effect of Vincristine in NALM-6 cells by inducing apoptotic cell death via altering the expression of apoptotic-related genes. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results proposed a mechanism for the cytotoxic effect of Britannin, either as a single agent or in combination with Vincristine, in NALM-6 cells.","['(c) 2021.

Japanese nationwide registry data for 6901 patients with AML and 2469 patients with ALL were analyzed. In this study, 2850 (41%), 937 (14%), 62 (1%), and 3052 (44%) AML patients and 1751 (71%), 265 (11%), 23 (1%), and 430 (17%) ALL patients underwent transplantation in first complete remission (CR1), second CR (CR2), third or subsequent CR (CR3 +), and non-CR, respectively. The probabilities of overall survival at 5 years for patients transplanted in CR1, CR2, CR3 + , and non-CR were 58%, 61%, 41%, and 26% for AML patients and 67%, 45%, 20%, and 21% for ALL patients, respectively. Multivariate analyses revealed that the risks of relapse and overall mortality were similar for AML patients transplanted in CR1 and CR2 (P = 0.672 and P = 0.703), whereas they were higher for ALL patients transplanted in CR2 than for those transplanted in CR1 (P < 0.001 for both). The risks of relapse and overall mortality for those transplanted in CR3 + and non-CR increased in a stepwise manner for both diseases, with the relevance being stronger for ALL than for AML patients. These results suggest a significant difference in the effect of disease status at HCT on post-transplant outcomes in AML and ALL.

Mucosal-Associated Invariant T cells (MAIT) constitute one of the largest subset of innate-like, cytotoxic T cell subsets in humans. Despite some papers suggesting a role for MAIT cells in cancer, their specific involvement remains unclear, especially in myeloid malignancies. This prospective monocentric study included 216 patients with a newly diagnosed AML. Circulating MAIT cells were quantified by flow cytometry at diagnosis and during intensive chemotherapy. We observed that circulating MAIT cells show a specific decline in AML patients at diagnosis compared to healthy donors. Post-induction monitored patients presented with a drastic drop in MAIT cell numbers, with recovery after one month. We also found correlation between decrease in MAIT cells number and adverse cytogenetic profile. FLT3-ITD and IDH (1/2) mutations were associated with higher MAIT cell numbers. Patients with high level of activated MAIT cells are under-represented within patients with a favorable cytogenetic profile, and over-represented among patients with IDH1 mutations or bi-allelic CEBPA mutations. We show for the first time that circulating MAIT cells are affected in newly diagnosed AML patients, suggesting a link between MAIT cells and AML progression. Our work fosters new studies to deepen our knowledge about the role of MAIT cells in cancer.","['(c) 2021.

Approximately 7% to 8% of the patients carry predisposing genetic germline variants that lead to driver mutations, which enhance JAK-STAT signaling. To identify additional predisposing genetic germline variants, we performed whole-exome sequencing in 5 families, each with parent-child or sibling pairs affected by MPNs and carrying the somatic JAK2 V617F mutation. In 4 families, we detected rare germline variants in known tumor predisposition genes of the DNA repair pathway, including the highly penetrant BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. The identification of an underlying hereditary tumor predisposition is of major relevance for the individual patients as well as for their families in the context of therapeutic options and preventive care. Two patients with essential thrombocythemia or polycythemia vera experienced progression to acute myeloid leukemia, which may suggest a high risk of leukemic transformation in these familial MPNs. Our study demonstrates the relevance of genetic germline diagnostics in elucidating the causes of MPNs and suggests novel therapeutic options (eg, PARP inhibitors) in MPNs.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are the mainstay of CML treatment; however, the high financial burden of TKIs can be problematic for both the patients and health care systems. After the emergence of generics, reimbursement policies of many countries have changed, and generics offered an alternative treatment option for CML patients. There are many papers published on the use of generics in CML patients with conflicting results regarding both efficacy and safety. In this paper, we systematically reviewed the current literature on generic imatinib use in CML, and 36 papers were evaluated. Both in vitro and in vivo studies of generic imatinib showed comparable results with branded imatinib in terms of bioequivalence and bioavailability. In most studies, generics were comparable with the original molecule in terms of efficacy and safety, both in newly diagnosed patients and after switching from Gleevec. Some generic studies showed contradictory findings regarding efficacy and toxicity, and these differences can be attributed to some factors including the use of different generics in different countries. Both in hypothetical models and in real life, introduction of generic imatinib caused significant reduction in health care costs.

We compared the ability of multiplex ligand-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect DeltaIKZF1 and to determine the impact on event-free survival of patients with precursor B-ALL aged 23 to 65 years recruited to the completed trial UKALL14 (ISRCTN 66541317). From 655 recruits with BCR-ABL1+ and BCR-ABL1- B-ALL, all available diagnostic DNA samples (76% of the recruited population) were screened by multiplex end point PCR covering 4 deletions: dominant-negative (DN) Delta4-7 or the loss of function Delta2-7, Delta4-8, and Delta2-8 (n = 498), MLPA (n = 436), or by both (n = 420). Although patients with BCR-ABL1- DeltaIKZF1 were more likely to have minimal residual disease at the end of induction, we did not find any impact of DeltaIKZF1 (including subgroup analysis for DN or loss-of-function lesions) or the IKZF1plus genotype on event-free, overall survival, or relapse risk by univariable or multivariable analyses. Consistent with the technical approach, MLPA not only detected a wider range of deletions than PCR but also failed to detect some PCR-detected lesions. The main difference between our study and others reporting an association between DeltaIKZF1 and outcome is the older age of participants in our population. The impact of DeltaIKZF1 in ALL may be less marked in an older population of patients. Our study underscores the need for analyses in large, harmonized data sets.

A catalytic reverse transcriptase protein (TERT) encoded by the TERT gene plays a critical role in the activation of telomerase. We performed a molecular and pathological analysis of the TERT against three different peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) subtypes: PTCL, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated TERT expression in 31% of AITL, 11% of PTCL-NOS, and 5% of ATLL. Among them, AITL frequently showed high TERT expression with statistical significance. TERT promoter mutation analysis and genomic copy number evaluation were performed. TERT promoter mutation was observed in two cases of PTCL-NOS (2/40) and not in other PTCLs. Genome copy number amplification was detected in 33% of PTCL-NOS, 33% of AITL, and 50% of ATLL cases. We evaluated the relationship between the analyzed TERT genomic abnormalities and protein expression; however, no apparent relationship was observed. Furthermore, immunostaining showed TERT expression in the PTCL cytoplasm, suggesting the existence of mechanisms other than the maintenance of telomere length. Statistical analysis of the effect of TERT expression on the prognosis in PTCL cases revealed that TERT expression tended to have a poor prognosis in PTCL-NOS. Since TERT expression was not an independent factor in multivariate analysis, further research will be needed to clarify the poor prognosis of PTCL-NOS in TERT expression.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

The interleukin-6 (IL-6) cytokines signal through the co-receptor glycoprotein130 (gp130) and are abundantly secreted within the bone microenvironment. Breast cancer cell expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) receptor (LIFR)/STAT3 signaling promotes tumor dormancy in the bone, but it is unclear which, if any of the cytokines that signal through LIFR, including LIF, oncostatin M (OSM), and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), promote tumor dormancy and which signaling pathways are induced. We first confirmed that LIF, OSM, and CNTF and their receptor components were expressed across a panel of breast cancer cell lines, although expression was lower in estrogen receptor-negative (ER(-) ) bone metastatic clones compared with parental cell lines. In estrogen receptor-positive (ER(+) ) cells, OSM robustly stimulated phosphorylation of known gp130 signaling targets STAT3, ERK, and AKT, while CNTF activated STAT3 signaling. In ER(-) breast cancer cells, OSM alone stimulated AKT and ERK signaling. Overexpression of OSM, but not CNTF, reduced dormancy gene expression and increased ER(+) breast cancer bone dissemination. Reverse-phase protein array revealed distinct and overlapping pathways stimulated by OSM, LIF, and CNTF with known roles in breast cancer progression and metastasis. In breast cancer patients, downregulation of the cytokines or receptors was associated with reduced relapse-free survival, but OSM was significantly elevated in patients with invasive disease and distant metastasis. Together these data indicate that the gp130 cytokines induce multiple signaling cascades in breast cancer cells, with a potential pro-tumorigenic role for OSM and pro-dormancy role for CNTF.

Here, we reported the clinical and pathological characteristics of CML patients, which were characterized by thrombocytosis and complex Philadelphia chromosome translocation. Moreover, we also introduced our therapeutic schedule for this patient as well as review relative literature. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 24-year-old female presented with night sweating, fatigue, and intermittent fever for 1 month. DIAGNOSIS: Fluorescence in situ hybridization results revealed that breakpoint cluster region (BCR)-Abelson (ABL) gene fusion in 62% of the cells and karyotyping showed a complex 3-way 46, XY, t(9;22;11) (q34;q11;q13) [19/20] translocation. This patient was diagnosed with CML complicated with thrombocytosis and complex Philadelphia chromosome translocation. INTERVENTIONS: The patients received continuously oral imatinib mesylate tablets (400 mg) once a day. OUTCOMES: After treatment with imatinib for 3 months, the BCR/ABLIS was less than 0.1% and achieved major molecular response. Moreover, the BCR/ABLIS of this patient achieved major molecular response. The BCR/ABLIS values at 6 months and 12 months were less than 0.01% and 0.0032%, respectively. And no BCR/ABL fusion was detected in the next 2 years follow-up period. LESSONS: Imatinib might represent a preferred therapeutic option for CML patients with rare thrombocytosis and complex chromosomal translocation.

Then, Lnc-MEG3 expression was determined by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. After 1 course of standard induction therapy of pediatric AML patients, complete remission (CR) was assessed. Furthermore, event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were determined according to follow-up data.Lnc-MEG3 was reduced in pediatric AML patients compared with controls. In pediatric AML patients, Lnc-MEG3 was correlated with French-American-Britain subtypes and lower Chinese Medical Association risk stratification, while it was not associated with cytogenetic features, FLT3-ITD mutation, CEBPA mutation, NPM1 mutation, WT1 mutation, or National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk stratification. After 1 course of treatment, Lnc-MEG3 exhibited an up-regulation trend. Furthermore, Lnc-MEG3 was of no difference before treatment between patients with and without CR, while elevated Lnc-MEG3 and change of Lnc-MEG3 after 1 course of treatment were associated with increased CR rate. Additionally, increased Lnc-MEG3 expression before treatment was associated with longer EFS but not OS, while enhanced Lnc-MEG3 expression after 1 course of treatment was correlated with both prolonged EFS and OS.Lnc-MEG3 may have clinical significance as a biomarker for assisting with disease management, treatment optimization, and prognosis improvement in pediatric AML patients.","['Copyright (c) 2021 the Author(s).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: TRIzol reagent was used to extract total RNA from AML tissues or cells. Cell viability was assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 and EdU staining assays. Cell apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Compared with normal hematopoietic stem cells, circular RNA hsa-circ_0003420 expression was considerably decreased in non-m3 AML stem cells. Furthermore, the lack of hsa-circ_0003420 is correlated with poor clinical results and impaired therapeutic effects in AML. Overexpression of hsa-circ_0003420 via transfection caused LSC death and inhibited the characteristics of leukemia tumor stem cells, including expression of Homeobox B4 (HOXB4), MYB, and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A1 (ALDH1A1) axis. Furthermore, hsa-circ_0003420 targets the mRNA of insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) and hsa-circ_0003420 expression markedly repressed IGF2BP1 levels in LSCs. Restoration of IGF2BP1 eliminated the effect of hsa-circ_0003420 on the replication, apoptosis, and LSC phenotype of KG-1a cells.

The purpose of this study was to elucidate the architecture of the immune microenvironment of high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSCs) with or without BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. METHODS: A cohort of highly annotated HGSC patients with known germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 status was selected, and pretreatment tumor tissue specimens were analyzed with a multiplexed staining technique aimed at detecting lymphocytes, macrophages, and fibroblasts in the whole tumor area and in specific regions including epithelium, stroma, and perivascular areas. RESULTS: BRCA1- or BRCA2-mutated tumors showed a more immunogenic microenvironment, characterized by a higher abundance of CD8(+) and PD-L1(+) cells, than did tumors with wild-type BRCA1 and BRCA2. High numbers of PD-L1(+) and PD-L1(+)CD8(+) cells were prognostic for event-free survival (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.41, 95% CI 0.21-0.79, p = 0.008 and HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.26-0.91, p = 0.025, respectively), as were high numbers of epithelial PD-L1(+) and FAP(+)PD-L1(+) cells (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.28-0.96, p = 0.037 and HR 0.27, 95% CI 0.08-0.87, p = 0.029) and CD8(+) cells (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.28-0.93, p = 0.027).

Pirarubicin (Pira) is one of the anticancer agents used for the treatment of leukemia. Although Pira is effective, drug resistance may develop in cancer cells exposed to this drug, whereas the combination of natural products with Pira may help to overcome this problem. The aim of the present study was to focus on the effect of gallic acid (GA) on the anticancer activity of Pira in K562 leukemia cells and K562/doxorubicin (Dox)resistant leukemia cells in order to investigate the possible underlying mechanisms. The cell viability, mitochondrial activity, mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) and ATP levels were assessed in living K562 and K562/Dox cancer cells following treatment with GA/Pira combination, GA alone or Pira alone. Pglycoproteinmediated efflux of Pira was determined in GAtreated K562/Dox cancer cells. The results demonstrated that GA/Pira combination decreased cell viability, mitochondrial activity, DeltaPsim and ATP levels in K562 and K562/Dox cancer cells in a GA concentrationdependent manner compared with nontreated or Piratreated cells. GA inhibited Pglycoproteinmediated efflux of Pira in GAtreated K562/Dox cancer cells. Therefore, GA enhanced the anticancer effect of Pira on K562 and K562/Dox cancer cells through cellular energy status impairment, and was able to reverse drug resistance in living K562/Dox cancer cells by inhibiting the function of Pglycoprotein.",,"['Aye, Khin Thenu', 'Wattanapongpitak, Sakornniya', 'Supawat, Benjamaporn', 'Kothan, Suchart', 'Udomtanakunchai, Chatchanok', 'Tima, Singkome', 'Pan, Jie', 'Tungjai, Montree']","['Aye KT', 'Wattanapongpitak S', 'Supawat B', 'Kothan S', 'Udomtanakunchai C', 'Tima S', 'Pan J', 'Tungjai M']",,"['Department of Radiologic Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.', 'Department of Radiologic Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.', 'Department of Radiologic Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.', 'Department of Radiologic Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.', 'Department of Radiologic Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.', 'Department of Medical Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.', 'Center of Radiation Research and Medical Imaging, Department of Radiologic Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.', 'Department of Radiologic Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Pglycoprotein', 'cancer', 'gallic acid', 'multidrug resistance', 'pirarubicin']",2021/09/04 06:00,2021/12/22 06:00,['2021/09/03 06:59'],"['2020/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/03 06:59 [entrez]', '2021/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3892/or.2021.8178 [doi]', '227 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2021 Oct;46(4). pii: 227. doi: 10.3892/or.2021.8178.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) have increasingly been reported to be associated with AML progression; however, the mechanisms of action of miR93 in AML with the involvement of disabled 2 (DAB2) are currently unknown. In the present study, miR93 expression was assessed in patients with AML and in AML cell lines. The association between miR93 expression and the pathological characteristics of patients with AML was analyzed. AML cells were then transfected to knockdown or overexpress miR93 in order to elucidate its function in AML progression. The target gene of miR93 was assessed using a dualluciferase reporter gene assay. The expression levels of miR93, DAB2 and phosphatidylinositol 3kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) pathwayrelated proteins were measured and in vivo experiments were conducted to confirm the results. It was observed that miR93 was highly expressed in patients with AML and in AML cells. The knockdown of miR93 in HL60 cells inhibited AML cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis, while the overexpression of miR93 in THP1 cells led to contrasting results. Moreover, miR93 targeted DAB2 to inactivate the PI3K/AKT pathway, and the overexpression of DAB2 reversed the effects of miR93 on THP1 cell growth. Tumor volume, tumor weight, and the positive expression of Ki67, survivin and p53 were increased in THP1 cells overexpressing miR93. On the whole, the present study demonstrates that miR93 is highly expressed in AML cells, and that the suppression of miR93 inhibits AML cell growth by targeting DAB2 and inhibiting the PI3K/AKT pathway.",,"['Huang, Jiwei', 'Xiao, Ruozhi', 'Wang, Xiaozhen', 'Khadka, Bijay', 'Fang, Zhigang', 'Yu, Mingxue', 'Zhang, Ling', 'Wu, Jieying', 'Liu, Jiajun']","['Huang J', 'Xiao R', 'Wang X', 'Khadka B', 'Fang Z', 'Yu M', 'Zhang L', 'Wu J', 'Liu J']",,"['Department of Pharmacology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510630, P.R.

Conventional chemotherapeutic drug screening is a time-consuming process because of the natural resistance of cell membranes to drugs, and there are still great challenges related to using technologies that change membrane permeability such as sonoporation in high-throughput and precise single-cell drug screening with minimal damage. In this study, we proposed an acoustic streaming-based non-invasive single-cell drug screening acceleration method, using high-frequency acoustic waves (>10 MHz) in a concentration gradient microfluidic device. High-frequency acoustics leads to increased difficulties in inducing cavitation and generates acoustic streaming around each single cell. Therefore, single-cell membrane permeability is non-invasively increased by the acoustic pressure and acoustic streaming-induced shear force, which significantly improves the drug uptake process. In the experiment, single human myeloid leukemia mononuclear (THP-1) cells were trapped by triangle cell traps in concentration gradient chips with different cytarabine (Ara-C) drug concentrations. Due to this dual acoustic effect, the drugs affect cell viability in less than 30 min, which is faster than traditional methods (usually more than 24 h). This dual acoustic effect-based drug delivery strategy has the potential to save time and reduce the cost of drug screening, when combined with microfluidic technology for multi-concentration drug screening.

There appear to be no studies at a system level. Herein, we integrate metalloproteomics through a newly developed organoarsenic probe, As-AC (C20H17AsN4O3S2) with quantitative proteomics, allowing 37 arsenic binding and 250 arsenic regulated proteins to be identified in NB4, a human APL cell line. Bioinformatics analysis reveals that ATO disrupts multiple physiological processes, in particular, chaperone-related protein folding and cellular response to stress. Furthermore, we discover heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60) as a vital target of ATO. Through biophysical and cell-based assays, we demonstrate that ATO binds to Hsp60, leading to abolishment of Hsp60 refolding capability. Significantly, the binding of ATO to Hsp60 disrupts the formation of Hsp60-p53 and Hsp60-survivin complexes, resulting in degradation of p53 and survivin. This study provides significant insights into the mechanism of action of ATO at a systemic perspective, and serves as guidance for the rational design of metal-based anticancer drugs.",['This journal is (c) The Royal Society of Chemistry.'],"['Hu, Xuqiao', 'Li, Hongyan', 'Ip, Tiffany Ka-Yan', 'Cheung, Yam Fung', 'Koohi-Moghadam, Mohamad', 'Wang, Haibo', 'Yang, Xinming', 'Tritton, Daniel N', 'Wang, Yuchuan', 'Wang, Yi', 'Wang, Runming', 'Ng, Kwan-Ming', 'Naranmandura, Hua', 'Tse, Eric Wai-Choi', 'Sun, Hongzhe']","['Hu X', 'Li H', 'Ip TK', 'Cheung YF', 'Koohi-Moghadam M', 'Wang H', 'Yang X', 'Tritton DN', 'Wang Y', 'Wang Y', 'Wang R', 'Ng KM', 'Naranmandura H', 'Tse EW', 'Sun H']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0797-5209', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4353-9658', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0799-2340', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8351-4722', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6697-6899']","['Department of Chemistry and CAS-HKU Joint Laboratory of Metallomics on Health and Environment, The University of Hong Kong Hong Kong SAR P.

It implements its function by inhibiting the duplication of tumor cells by destroying the DNA. However, like all other drugs, its administration is not without any side effects. The most important of these are being the neurotoxic side effects. This study evaluated the degree of neurotoxicity induced by vincristine in children who underwent chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and Wilms tumor. Methods: A quasi experimental study was conducted at Children Hospital & the Institute of Child Health, Multan from January 2020 to October 2020 after taking informed written consent. In this study, 150 children of age group 1 - 12 years with pathological confirmation of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and Wilms tumor who had undergone a chemotherapy protocol including at least four consecutive weekly Vincristine injections were included, using probability consecutive sampling technique. Neurological examination was conducted on them on weekly basis. Results: There were 150 patients,90(60%) males and 60(40%) females with mean age of (5.5+/-2.2). Diminished patellar and Achilles tendon reflexes were seen in 48% and 52% of patients. Muscular weakness was seen in 60% of patients. Other side effects like hoarseness, jaw pain, constipation and petosis were observed in 10%, 8%,40% and 10% of patients respectively. Frequency of side effects was equally observed in both sexes and it was more among age group older than five years (p= 0.01).

With the nature of wild carnivore sampling, four (4) wild Sunda leopard cats were captured in Aborlan, Palawan, Philippines for a period of nine (9) months. Of these, three (3) were considered for blood and fecal examination due to the poor condition of one animal. Rapid diagnostic kits were used to detect the presence of selected pathogens in blood samples while fecal samples were examined for parasite fauna and diet contents. Nine (9) parasite species were identified namely: Toxoplasma gondii, Ancylostoma sp., Capillaria hepatica, Echinostoma sp., Hymenolepis nana, Isospora felis, Physaloptera sp., Trichostrongylus sp., and a fasciolid. Chlamydophila felis, a bacterial pathogen was also detected in the blood. No individuals were found to be positive for feline immunodeficiency virus, feline infectious peritonitis virus, and feline leukemia virus antibodies. Six (6) small mammal prey species were identified from the feces of Sunda leopard cats namely: Palawan spiny rat (Maxomys panglima), Asian house rat (Rattus tanezumi), Polynesian rat (Rattus exulans), house mouse (Mus musculus), Southern Palawan tree squirrel (Sundasciurus steerii), and Palawan treeshrew (Tupaia palawanensis). Sunda leopard cats in Aborlan, Palawan, may be highly infected by parasites primarily due to their diet of small mammals such as rodents.

However, optimal schedule and monitoring methods are not well defined. We report the intensive bone marrow monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) using flow cytometry (FC) and nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) whenever a fusion transcript allowed it and chimerism by PCR at 11 timepoints in the first 2 years after transplant. Seventy-one transplants were performed in 59 consecutive children, for acute myeloid (n = 38), lymphoid (n = 31), or mixed-phenotype (n = 2) leukemia. MRD was monitored in 62 cases using FC (n = 58) and/or RT-PCR (n = 35). Sixty-seven percent of leukemia recurrences were detected before overt relapse, with a detection rate of 89% by RT-PCR and 40% by FC alone. Increased mixed chimerism was never the first evidence of recurrence. Two patients monitored by RT-PCR relapsed without previous MRD detection, one after missed scheduled evaluation and the other 4.7 years post transplant. Among the 22 cases with MRD detection without overt relapse, 19 received therapeutic interventions. Eight (42%) never relapsed. In conclusion, intensive marrow monitoring by RT-PCR effectively allows for early detection of posttransplant leukemia recurrence.","['(c) 2021.

However, it is unclear whether resistance to venetoclax induces cross-resistance to other drugs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Venetoclax-resistant HL60/VEN cells were newly established through continuous exposure of human acute promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells to venetoclax, and drug sensitivity, apoptotic activity, and mRNA expression were compared between HL60 and HL60/VEN cells. RESULTS: HL60/VEN cells displayed approximately 3-fold resistance to venetoclax, maintained their ability to synthesize DNA and had low apoptotic activity. HL60/VEN cells also exhibited diverse sensitivity to cytotoxic drugs, especially resistance to ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) substrates, and up-regulation of ABCB1 mRNA. However, the sensitivity of HL60/VEN cells to venetoclax was not restored by ABCB1 inhibitor. ABCB1-overexpressing cells did not show resistance to venetoclax. CONCLUSION: HL60/VEN cells exhibited up-regulation of ABCB1 in addition to an alteration in apoptotic activity, and cross-resistance to ABCB1 substrates was clarified. However, sensitivity to venetoclax was hardly affected by ABCB1.","['Copyright (c) 2021 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['Nakayama, Yuko', 'Takara, Kohji', 'Minegaki, Tetsuya', 'Yamamoto, Kazuhiro', 'Omura, Tomohiro', 'Yano, Ikuko']","['Nakayama Y', 'Takara K', 'Minegaki T', 'Yamamoto K', 'Omura T', 'Yano I']",,"['Department of Pharmaceutics, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Himeji Dokkyo University, Himeji, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Himeji Dokkyo University, Himeji, Japan; ko-takara@huhs.ac.jp.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics and Pharmaceutical Technology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hyogo University of Health Sciences, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Kyoto Pharmaceutical University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Kobe University Hospital, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Kobe University Hospital, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Kobe University Hospital, Kobe, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['ABC transporter', 'BCL2', 'HL60 cells', 'Venetoclax', 'resistance']",2021/09/04 06:00,2021/09/14 06:00,['2021/09/03 05:57'],"['2021/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/24 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/03 05:57 [entrez]', '2021/09/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/14 06:00 [medline]']","['41/9/4239 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.15228 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2021 Sep;41(9):4239-4248. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.15228.

The main objectives of this study include updating the prevalence of endoparasitism in client-owned cats, status of retroviral infections and determining the association between feline hookworm infection and possible risk factors. A total of 509 fecal samples were collected from client-owned cats in 2014-2015 and examined by a wet fecal mount technique. If additional sample remained, a PBS-ethyl acetate sedimentation was done (n = 229), and ZnSO4 centrifugal flotation was also performed if there was sufficient remaining sample (n = 105). At least one parasite was observed in 32.0% (163/509) of cats, with Ancylostoma being the most common intestinal parasite detected in 21.6% (110/509) of cats. Other parasitic infections detected by fecal examinations included Toxocara (6.9%; 35/509), Platynosomum (3.7%; 19/509), Cystoisospora (3.5%; 18/509), Taenia (2.9%; 15/509), Spirometra (1.6%; 8/509), Dipylidium (0.4%; 2/509), and Opisthorchis-like trematode (0.2%; 1/509). Examination for Giardia infection was conducted with the SNAP(R) Giardia Test, a coproantigen test, on a subset of the fecal samples (233/509) and revealed a positive result on 3.9% (9/233) of samples. Plasma samples were analyzed using the SNAP(R) Triple Test detecting antigens of Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV) and Dirofilaria immitis while also detecting antibodies to Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV). Antigens of FeLV and antibodies to FIV were found in 7.1% (19/269) and 5.2% (14/269) of cats, respectively. None of the cats were found to have circulating antigen of Dirofilaria immitis using this test. No association between retroviral and endoparasitic infections was found. From multivariable logistic regression examining associated factors, the ability of cats to access the outdoors (adjusted OR = 3.22, 95% CI; 1.42-7.87) and having tapeworm segments or adult helminths in feces (adjusted OR = 3.31, 95% CI; 1.34-8.21) were significantly associated with the finding of hookworm eggs in feces. This work presents the most up-to-date data on enteric feline parasite prevalence in the metropolitan Bangkok area from which fecal samples were directly collected from cats. Consequently, this study emphasizes that diagnosis of parasitic infections and the routine use of antiparasitic medications should be encouraged by veterinarians and to owners in order to reduce the reservoir of potentially zoonotic parasites.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Windsor Regional Hospital treats 15-20 new patients a year with acute leukemia. These patients are at increased risk of neutropenic fevers and admission to the ICU following induction chemotherapy. METHODS: Retrospective review examined the correlation between acute leukemia patient vitals and ICU admission. The analysis included 37 patients: 7 ICU versus 30 controls. Changes were compared to baseline over 24 hours prior to ICU admission or 5 days after the initiation of induction chemotherapy in the following vital signs: heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), temperature (T), respiratory rate (RR), and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) required to maintain a stable oxygen saturation. RESULTS: RR and FiO2 demonstrated significant change over baseline leading up to ICU admission within the ICU group. T, HR and MAP did not demonstrate significant changes over time in either group. RR, FiO2 and HR were significantly higher in the ICU group at time zero compared with the control group. RR was recorded least frequently in the 24 hours leading up to ICU admission. DISCUSSION: Changes in RR and FiO2 predicted clinical deterioration requiring ICU admission in acute leukemia patients. This is consistent with the predominant reason for ICU admission which was respiratory failure.

Central venous catheters (CVCs) further increase the VTE risk. This systematic literature review elucidates the VTE incidence in pediatric cancer patients with CVC. MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched in August 2020 without time limits. We included studies reporting original data on patients </=18 years with any CVC type and any cancer type, who were examined for VTE with >/=7 days follow-up. In total, 682 unique records were identified, whereof 189 studies were assessed in full text. Altogether, 25 studies were included, containing 2,318 pediatric cancer patients with CVC, of which 17% suffered VTE. Fifteen studies (n = 1,551) described CVC-related VTE and reported 11% CVC-related VTE. Concerning cancer type, 991 children suffered from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 616 from solid tumors. Meta-analysis revealed VTE incidence (95% confidence interval) of 21% (8-37) for ALL and 7% (0.1-17) for solid tumors. Additionally, 20% of children with tunneled or nontunneled CVC and 12% of children with implantable ports suffered VTE. In conclusion, pediatric cancer patients with CVC have substantial VTE risk. Children with ALL and CVC have higher VTE incidence than children with solid tumors and CVC. Implantable port catheter should be preferred over tunneled or nontunneled CVC to reduce VTE risk. Thrombophilia investigation does not seem relevant in pediatric cancer patients with CVC and VTE. To prevent VTE, intensified catheter care is recommended, especially in children with ALL.",['Thieme.

Also, treatment goals are moving towards achieving undetectable minimal residual disease with little toxicity. RECENT FINDINGS: We performed a thorough review of the history of treatment approvals by both the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). This review especially focuses on therapies that are currently approved by both agencies. The indications and particular characteristics of each drug are examined. SUMMARY: Currently available treatment approaches for CLL offer the opportunity to individualize therapy for every single patient with CLL. Inhibitors of B-cell receptor (BCR) signalling pathways and antiapoptotic proteins are nowadays the treatment of choice for most CLL patients, but CIT can be an option for younger and fit patients with low-risk disease [mutated IGHV, no del(11q) or del(17p)/TP53 mutations].","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Although significant progress has been made in the discovery of the mechanisms underlying the molecular pathogenesis of the disease, more than 50% of AML patients still die, mostly from relapsed disease. Currently, the only potential curative option for patients with R/R AML remains allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in second complete remission, which is far being easy to achieve, mainly for patients with primary induction failure or older than 65 years. The purpose of this review is to discuss recent advances in the management of patients with R/R AML, with particular emphasis to new therapeutic options that are replacing conventional salvage chemotherapy. RECENT FINDINGS: The development of new agents selectively targeting molecular abnormalities offer more effective and less toxic alternative to chemotherapy, potentially useful as a bridge to allogeneic stem cell transplantation in second complete remission. SUMMARY: The recent approval of new drugs for R/R is transforming the paradigm of care we have relied on for the past 50 years. Ongoing clinical trials will tell us how bright is the future for R/R AML patients.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

PD-1 inhibitors are being investigated as treatment for AML in combination with hypomethylating agents and cytotoxic chemotherapy with encouraging findings. Although allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) remains the most established curative treatment for patients with relapsed and refractory AML in complete remission, there are limited data on the clinical outcomes and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) prior to alloSCT in AML. In the present study, we compared clinical outcomes of 9 patients with AML receiving high-dose cytarabine followed by pembrolizumab in a phase II clinical trial (NCT02768792) prior to alloSCT versus a historical control group of 18 AML patients who underwent alloSCT without prior ICI exposure. The nonparametric Jonckheere-Terpstra test was used to test for a difference in the ordered severity categories of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) within 100 days of transplantation. Time-to-event estimates for overall survival and relapse-free survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using a log-rank test. One-year survival was not significantly different between the treatment groups (67% versus 78%; P = .34). 100-day mortality was 0% in the ICI group versus 17% in the control group, and there was no increase in grade III-IV acute GVHD in patients treated with pembrolizumab prior to alloSCT. No chronic GVHD was seen in patients treated with pembrolizumab prior to alloSCT and who received post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) as part of their conditioning regimen. These findings reinforce the safety and feasibility of ICI therapy prior to alloSCT in patients with AML, and suggest that PTCy may abrogate GVHD risk and severity in patients who receive ICI prior to undergoing alloSCT for AML.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

A few RNA-modifying enzymes can install the same modification in multiple RNA species. However, whether DIMT1 can work on RNA species other than 18S rRNA is unclear. Here, we describe that DIMT1 generates m2(6,6)A not only in 18S rRNA but also in small RNAs. In addition, m2(6,6)A in small RNAs were significantly decreased in cells expressing catalytically inactive DIMT1 variants (E85A or NLPY variants) compared with cells expressing wildtype DIMT1. Both E85A and NLPY DIMT1 variant cells present decreased protein synthesis and cell viability. Furthermore, we observed that DIMT1 is highly expressed in human cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia. Our data suggest that downregulation of DIMT1 in acute myeloid leukemia cells leads to a decreased m2(6,6)A level in small RNAs. Together, these data suggest that DIMT1 not only installs m2(6,6)A in 18S rRNA but also generates m2(6,6)A-containing small RNAs, both of which potentially contribute to the impact of DIMT1 on cell viability and gene expression.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

Hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) with biallelic frameshift and R525H mutations undergo cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, causing bone marrow failure in mice. Mechanistically, DDX41 is essential for small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) processing, ribosome assembly, and protein synthesis. Although monoallelic DDX41 mutations do not affect hematopoiesis in young mice, a subset of aged mice develops features of MDS. Biallelic mutations in DDX41 are observed at a low frequency in non-dominant hematopoietic stem cell clones in bone marrow (BM) from individuals with MDS. Mice chimeric for monoallelic DDX41 mutant BM cells and a minor population of biallelic mutant BM cells develop hematopoietic defects at a younger age, suggesting that biallelic DDX41 mutant cells are disease modifying in the context of monoallelic DDX41 mutant BM.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Epidemiological studies proved high levels of circulating S1P in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Studies in literature suggest that high levels of S1P support carcinogenesis but the exact mechanism is still elusive. The aim of this study was to understand the mechanism/s underlying S1P-mediated lung tumor cell proliferation. METHODS: We used human samples of NSCLC, a mouse model of first-hand smoking and of Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP)-induced tumor-bearing mice and A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells. RESULTS: We found that the expression of S1PR3 was also into the nucleus of lung cells in vitro, data that were confirmed in lung tissues of NSCLC patients, smoking and tumor bearing BaP-exposed mice. The intranuclear, but not the membrane, localization of S1PR3 was associated to S1P-mediated proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma cells. Indeed, the inhibition of the membrane S1PR3 did not alter tumor cell proliferation after Toll Like Receptor (TLR) 9 activation. Instead, according to the nuclear localization of sphingosine kinase (SPHK) II, the inhibition of the kinase completely blocked the endogenous S1P-induced tumor cell proliferation. CONCLUSION: These results prove that the nuclear S1PR3/SPHK II axis is involved in lung tumor cell proliferation, highlighting a novel molecular mechanism which could provide differential therapeutic approaches especially in non-responsive lung cancer patients.",['(c) Copyright by the Author(s).

We examined demographic data reporting and enrollment diversity for ALL and AML trials in the United States from 2002 to 2017, as well as changes in reporting and diversity after reporting requirements were instituted. Of 223 AML trials and 97 ALL trials with results on ClinicalTrials.gov, 68 (30.5%) and 51 (52.6%) reported enrollment by both race and ethnicity. Among trials that reported race and ethnicity (AML, n = 6554; ALL, n = 4149), non-Hispanic (NH)-Black, NH-Native American, NH-Asian, and Hispanic patients had significantly lower enrollment compared with NH-White patients after adjusting for race-ethnic disease incidence (AML odds ratio, 0.68, 0.31, 0.75, and 0.83, respectively; ALL odds ratio, 0.74, 0.27, 0.67, and 0.64; all, P </= .01). The proportion of trials reporting race increased significantly after implementation of the reporting requirements (44.2% to 60.2%; P = .02), but race-ethnicity reporting did not (34.8% to 38.6%; P = .57). Reporting proportions according to number of patients enrolled increased significantly after the reporting requirements were instituted (race, 51.7% to 72.7%; race-ethnicity, 39.5% to 45.4%; both, P < .001), and relative enrollment of NH-Black and Hispanic patients decreased (AML odds ratio, 0.79 and 0.77; ALL odds ratio, 0.35 and 0.25; both P </= .01). These data suggest that demographic enrollment reporting for acute leukemia trials is suboptimal, changes in diversity after the reporting requirements may be due to additional enrollment disparities that were previously unreported, and enrollment diversification strategies specific to acute leukemia care delivery are needed.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

It has been postulated that, in some cases, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) harboring mutations are selected for by cytotoxic exposures and transform. Here, we evaluate this model in the context of deficiency of CUX1, a transcription factor encoded on chromosome 7q and deleted in half of t-MN cases. We report that CUX1 has a critical early role in the DNA repair process in HSPCs. Mechanistically, CUX1 recruits the histone methyltransferase EHMT2 to DNA breaks to promote downstream H3K9 and H3K27 methylation, phosphorylated ATM retention, subsequent gammaH2AX focus formation and propagation, and, ultimately, 53BP1 recruitment. Despite significant unrepaired DNA damage sustained in CUX1-deficient murine HSPCs after cytotoxic exposures, they continue to proliferate and expand, mimicking clonal hematopoiesis in patients postchemotherapy. As a consequence, preexisting CUX1 deficiency predisposes mice to highly penetrant and rapidly fatal therapy-related erythroleukemias.

In spring and autumn 2017, virus-like symptoms were observed on greenhouse grown tomato plants in the east of Akkar plain (south of coastal region, Tartous governorate, Syria). These symptoms were: mild to severe mosaic on the apical leaves, brown necrosis on sepals, receptacle and flower's cluster carrier, and severe symptoms of brown rugose and discoloration on fruit. During next growing seasons, disease spread was observed in most of Syrian coastal region with disease incidence ranged from 40% to 70% by 2020. Tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) was suspected as a main causal agent of the disease, especially since its first report in Jordan, a neighboring country (Salem et al. 2016), Palestine (Alkowni et al. 2019), Turkey (Fidan et al. 2019), Germany (Menzel et al. 2019), Italy (Panno et al. 2019), America (Camacho-Beltran et al. 2019), Egypt (Amer and Mahmoud, 2020), and recently in Spain (Alfaro-Fernandez et al. 2021). In November and December 2020, seventy-one leaf samples from symptomatic plants (59 from Tartous and 12 from Lattakia governorates) and seven from asymptomatic ones (5 from Tartous and 2 from Lattakia) were collected and tested for the presence of ToBRFV by double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA), using ToBRFV-commercial kit (LOEWE(R) Biochemia, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. Results showed, forty-three of symptomatic samples reacted positively (38 in Tartous and 5 in Lattakia) and none of asymptomatic ones. On the other hand, sap mechanical inoculation of 10 tomato cv. Mandaloun F1 (Enza Zaden, the Netherlands) plants using a positive tomato isolate gave systemic mosaic symptoms in all plants identical to those observed in the original plants in the field, after 13 days of inoculation, and necrotic local lesions on 10 plants of Nicotiana tabacum after 5 days, indicating the presence of a tobamovirus in general. ToBRFV infection was confirmed in all mechanically-inoculated plants by DAS-ELISA. Further tests were necessary to investigate ToBRFV presence, because of its serological relationships with another tobamoviruses. Six representative symptomatic samples (ELISA-positive) and two asymptomatic (ELISA-negative) samples were subjected to total RNA extraction using the SV-Total RNA Extraction kit (Promega, U.S.A.) following the manufacturer's instructions. The samples were tested by two-step reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using species-specific primers and protocols for most common tomato-infecting viruses, including: tomato chlorosis virus and tomato infectious chlorosis virus (Dovas et al. 2002), pepino mosaic virus (PepMV) and tomato torrado virus (Wieczorek et al. 2013), alfalfa mosaic virus (Parrella et al. 2000), tomato spotted wilt virus (Salem et al. 2012) and a pair of primers: ToBRFV-F2 (5'-CATATCTCTCGACACCAGTAAAAGGACCCG-3') and ToBRFV-R2 (5'-TCCGAGTATAGGAAGACTCTGGTTGGTC-3') targeting a region of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), of the ToBRFV genome (KT383474; Salem et al. 2016). First-strand cDNA synthesis was carried out using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (M-MLV RT; Promega) and random primer according to the manufacturer's protocol, then followed by PCR with the seven species-specific primers. Only ToBRFV was detected among all tested viruses in symptomatic samples (ELISA-positive), and none of the tested viruses was detected in the asymptomatic plants. To confirm the presence of ToBRFV, two selected RdRp-specific PCR amplicons (872 bp) were purified and ligated into pGEM T-Easy Vector (Promega), and three clones were sequenced (GenBank accession nos. MZ447794 to 96). BLASTn analysis showed that the nucleotide sequences are 99.77-100% identical and shared around 99% identity to RdRp of ToBRFV isolate (MT118666) from Turkey available in the GenBank. Accordingly, the presence of ToBRFV was confirmed by bioassays on indicator plants, DAS-ELISA, RT-PCR, and further sequencing. To our knowledge, this is the first report of ToBRFV infecting tomato in Syria, and this requires special emphasis for further investigations because of the virus severity, easy transmission ability and absent of commercial resistance varieties till now.",,"['Hasan, Ziad M', 'Salem, Nida Mohammed', 'Ismail, Imad D', 'Akel, Insaf', 'Ahmad, Ahmad Y']","['Hasan ZM', 'Salem NM', 'Ismail ID', 'Akel I', 'Ahmad AY']",,"['Tishreen University Faculty of Agriculture, 368594, Department of Plant Protection, Lattakia, Lattakia Governorate, Syrian Arab Republic; ziadmh1981@gmail.com.', 'University of Jordan, Department of Plant Protection, Faculty of Agriculture, Amman, Jordan; n.salem@ju.edu.jo.', 'Tishreen University Faculty of Agriculture, 368594, Lattakia, Lattakia Governorate, Syrian Arab Republic; Imad.ismail@tishreen.edu.sy.', 'General commission for scientific Agricultural Research, Plant Protection, Latakia, Syrian Arab Republic; ensafakel5n4a@gmail.com.', 'General Commission for Scientific Agricultural Research (GCSAR), Syria, Tartous, Syrian Arab Republic; auahmad008@gmail.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Plant Dis,Plant disease,9882809,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Coastal region', 'Syria', 'ToBRFV', 'tomato']",2021/09/03 06:00,2021/09/03 06:00,['2021/09/02 12:14'],"['2021/09/02 12:14 [entrez]', '2021/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1094/PDIS-07-21-1356-PDN [doi]'],aheadofprint,Plant Dis. 2021 Sep 2. doi: 10.1094/PDIS-07-21-1356-PDN.,20210902,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent reports suggested that preBLL and classical BL could be distinguished by the differences in IG-MYC translocation architecture and an additional mutated genes profile. The characteristics of classical BL are IG-MYC by aberrant somatic hypermutation or class switch recombination, and BL-specific gene mutations such as MYC, ID3, and CCND3. Meanwhile, preBLL is characterized by IG-MYC due to aberrant VDJ recombination and mutations in NRAS and KRAS. However, it is not clear whether all preBLL cases can be differentiated. This report investigated the molecular characteristics of an infant preBLL case, with a more advanced stage of maturity than typical preBLL. CASE: The patient showed BL-like morphology with IGH-MYC rearrangement. In the immunophenotyping, CD20 and surface immunoglobulin were negative, whereas other markers were consistent with BL. To evaluate the genetic contribution, we performed whole-exome sequencing. The breakpoint analysis revealed the IG-MYC occurred due to an aberrant VDJ recombination. Meanwhile, additional somatic mutations were detected in FBXO11, one of the mutant genes specific to BL. In the analysis of the specimen in complete remission, mutation in KRAS, frequently mutated in preBLL, was detected with low frequency, suggesting somatic mosaicism. CONCLUSION: The present case showed the characteristics of both typical preBLL and classical BL. Because preBLL includes atypical cases such as the present case, further studies are required to elucidate preBLL features.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

OBJECTIVE: To compare outcomes for four (21.6 g/m(2) cytarabine) versus five (45.6 g/m(2) cytarabine) chemotherapy courses for LR-AML using data from Children's Oncology Group (COG) AAML0531 and AAML1031. METHODS: We compared relapse risk (RR), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS), and the differential impact in LR subgroups for patients receiving four versus five chemotherapy courses. Cox (OS and DFS) and risk (RR) regressions were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) to compare outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 923 LR-AML patients were included; 21% received five courses. Overall, LR-AML patients who received four courses had higher RR (40.9% vs. 31.4%; HR = 1.40, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06-1.85), and worse DFS (56.0% vs. 67.0%; HR = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.10-1.91). There was a similar decrement in OS though it was not statistically significant (77.0% vs. 83.5%; HR = 1.45, 95% CI: 0.97-2.17). Stratified analyses revealed the detrimental effects of cytarabine dose de-escalation to be most pronounced in the LR-AML subgroup with uninformative cytogenetic/molecular features who were minimal residual disease (MRD) negative after the first induction course (EOI1). The absolute decrease in DFS with four courses for patients with favorable cytogenetic/molecular features and positive MRD was similar to that observed for patients with uninformative cytogenetic/molecular features and negative MRD at EOI1, though not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support de-escalation of cytarabine exposure through the elimination of a fifth chemotherapy course only for LR-AML patients who have both favorable cytogenetic/molecular features and negative MRD after the first induction cycle.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Getz, Kelly D', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Sung, Lillian', 'Meshinchi, Soheil', 'Gerbing, Robert B', 'Raimondi, Susana', 'Hirsch, Betsy', 'Loken, Michael', 'Brodersen, Lisa Eidenschink', 'Kahwash, Samir', 'Choi, John', 'Kolb, E Anders', 'Gamis, Alan', 'Aplenc, Richard']","['Getz KD', 'Alonzo TA', 'Sung L', 'Meshinchi S', 'Gerbing RB', 'Raimondi S', 'Hirsch B', 'Loken M', 'Brodersen LE', 'Kahwash S', 'Choi J', 'Kolb EA', 'Gamis A', 'Aplenc R']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2020-5153'],"[""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Division of Oncology, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."", 'Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA.', 'The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.', ""Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, California, USA."", ""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", 'University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Hematologics Inc, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Hematologics Inc, Seattle, Washington, USA.', ""Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio, USA."", ""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", 'Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, Wilmington, Delaware, USA.', ""Children's Mercy Hospital and Clinics, Kansas City, Missouri, USA."", ""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Division of Oncology, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."", 'Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],"['U10 CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K01 HL143153/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*chemotherapy', '*cytarabine', '*de-escalation', '*pediatric acute myeloid leukemia']",2021/09/03 06:00,2021/09/03 06:00,['2021/09/02 07:19'],"['2021/08/09 00:00 [revised]', '2021/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/03 06:00 [medline]', '2021/09/02 07:19 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.29313 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2022 Jan;69(1):e29313. doi: 10.1002/pbc.29313.

In this study, we report on homozygous BCMA (TNFRSF17) gene deletion after BCMA-targeting T cell-redirecting bispecific antibody therapy in a heavily pretreated MM patient. Loss of BCMA protein expression persisted over subsequent relapses, with no response to treatment with anti-BCMA antibody drug conjugate. In light of the multiple alternative targets that are emerging in addition to BCMA, we extended our analyses to delineate a more complete picture of genetic alterations that may have an impact on immunotherapy targets in MM. We performed whole-genome sequencing and RNA sequencing in 100 MM patients (50 were newly diagnosed; 50 were relapsed/refractory) and identified a significant proportion of patients with aberrations in genes encoding immunotherapy targets; GPRC5D ranked first with 15% heterozygous deletions, followed by CD38 (10%), SDC1 (5%), and TNFRSF17 (4%). Notably, these heterozygous deletions did not lower the expression levels of respective genes, but they may represent a first hit that drives the acquisition of homozygous deletions and subsequent antigen-loss relapse upon targeted immunotherapy.

This combination treatment has an accelerated approval by the Food and Drug Administration for newly diagnosed AML adults who are 75 years of age or older or who have comorbidities and are not eligible to receive intensive induction chemotherapy. AML is the most common form of acute leukaemia in adults, with a median age at diagnosis of 68 years. Consequently, most of the patients included in the studies are elderly. Traditionally, young patients achieve higher remission rates compared with the elderly AML population. Although venetoclax combination therapy could become a treatment option for treating young patients with relapsed/refractory AML, this regimen has not been systematically tested in this setting. In this study, we summarize the currently available evidence on the treatment of venetoclax in combination with hypomethylating agents for the treatment of young relapsed/refractory AML patients, in addition to our experience in clinical practice with two case reports. Venetoclax, combined with hypomethylating agents, seems to be an effective option for young relapsed/refractory AML patients. However, due to the poor quality of the evidence, additional well-designed studies with greater numbers of patients are needed to confirm the effectiveness and safety of venetoclax combination regimens for this population.","['(c) The Author(s), 2021.']","['Baez-Gutierrez, Nerea', 'Rodriguez-Ramallo, Hector', 'Moreno, Maria Antonia-Perez', 'Arboli, Eduardo-Rodriguez', 'Abdel-Kader Martin, Laila']","['Baez-Gutierrez N', 'Rodriguez-Ramallo H', 'Moreno MA', 'Arboli ER', 'Abdel-Kader Martin L']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9419-7742'],"['Hospital Pharmacy Department, Virgen del Rocio University Hospital, Seville, Spain.', 'Hospital Pharmacy Department, Virgen del Rocio University Hospital, Avda.

Timely and accurate diagnosis of the cancer is an important premise for effective treatment to improve survival rate. Since the image of leukemic B-lymphoblast cells (cancer cells) under the microscope is very similar in morphology to that of normal B-lymphoid precursors (normal cells), it is difficult to distinguish between cancer cells and normal cells. Therefore, we propose the ViT-CNN ensemble model to classify cancer cells images and normal cells images to assist in the diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The ViT-CNN ensemble model is an ensemble model that combines the vision transformer model and convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The vision transformer model is an image classification model based entirely on the transformer structure, which has completely different feature extraction method from the CNN model. The ViT-CNN ensemble model can extract the features of cells images in two completely different ways to achieve better classification results. In addition, the data set used in this article is an unbalanced data set and has a certain amount of noise, and we propose a difference enhancement-random sampling (DERS) data enhancement method, create a new balanced data set, and use the symmetric cross-entropy loss function to reduce the impact of noise in the data set. The classification accuracy of the ViT-CNN ensemble model on the test set has reached 99.03%, and it is proved through experimental comparison that the effect is better than other models. The proposed method can accurately distinguish between cancer cells and normal cells and can be used as an effective method for computer-aided diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Zhencun Jiang et al.'],"['Jiang, Zhencun', 'Dong, Zhengxin', 'Wang, Lingyang', 'Jiang, Wenping']","['Jiang Z', 'Dong Z', 'Wang L', 'Jiang W']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6066-4875', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3548-0994']","['School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Institute of Technology, 100 Haiquan Road, Shanghai, China.', 'School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 800 Dongchuan Road, Shanghai, China.', 'School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Institute of Technology, 100 Haiquan Road, Shanghai, China.', 'School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Institute of Technology, 100 Haiquan Road, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Comput Intell Neurosci,Computational intelligence and neuroscience,101279357,IM,,,2021/09/03 06:00,2021/09/04 06:00,['2021/09/02 06:54'],"['2021/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/02 06:54 [entrez]', '2021/09/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2021/7529893 [doi]'],epublish,Comput Intell Neurosci. 2021 Aug 21;2021:7529893. doi: 10.1155/2021/7529893. eCollection 2021.,20210821,20210903,,"['Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted', 'Humans', '*Neural Networks, Computer', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis']",PMC8405335,['The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The presence of immunoglobulin (Ig) and T cell receptor (TCR) gene recombinations in leukaemic clones allows widespread use of patient-specific, DNA-based MRD assays. In contrast, paediatric solid tumour MRD remains experimental and has focussed on generic assays targeting tumour-specific messenger RNA, methylated DNA or microRNA. METHODS: We examined the feasibility of using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data to design tumour-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based MRD tests (WGS-MRD) in 18 children with high-risk relapsed cancer, including ALL, high-risk neuroblastoma (HR-NB) and Ewing sarcoma (EWS) (n = 6 each). RESULTS: Sensitive WGS-MRD assays were generated for each patient and allowed quantitation of 1 tumour cell per 10(-4) (0.01%)-10(-5) (0.001%) mononuclear cells. In ALL, WGS-MRD and Ig/TCR-MRD were highly concordant. WGS-MRD assays also showed good concordance between quantitative PCR and droplet digital PCR formats. In serial clinical samples, WGS-MRD correlated with disease course. In solid tumours, WGS-MRD assays were more sensitive than RNA-MRD assays. CONCLUSIONS: WGS facilitated the development of patient-specific MRD tests in ALL, HR-NB and EWS with potential clinical utility in monitoring treatment response. WGS data could be used to design patient-specific MRD assays in a broad range of tumours.",['(c) 2021.

Two patients had acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and five patients developed chronic GVHD. The maximum tolerated dose was 10 mg, after dose-limiting toxicities were seen in the 15 mg group. Two dose-limiting toxicities were seen from development of acute GVHD and grade III diarrhea.

Although the cytogenetic features of patients with MDS and CDI are not clear, CDI in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is associated with chromosome 7 and/or 3 anomalies. CASE PRESENTATION: In this report, we describe two patients with MDS and concurrent CDI, and in one of them, CDI was the first manifestation. One patient had monosomy 7 on metaphase cytogenetics (MC). Monosomy 7 and numerous cytogenetic abnormalities were found in the other patient using single-nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A) karyotyping, while the MC did not uncover monosomy 7. In this manuscript we also reviewed reported cases of MDS with diabetes insipidus (DI-MDS) to summarize the relationship between DI-MDS and karyotype, and explore the best treatment strategy for DI-MDS. CONCLUSIONS: DI-MDS is closely related to monosomy 7. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may be the only effective treatment for DI-MDS. The SNP-A-based karyotyping is helpful to reveal subtle cytogenetic abnormalities and unveil their roles in the clinical features of MDS.",['(c) 2021.

This study investigated the eradication of Microsporum canis, the widespread cause of zoonotic dermatophytosis in shelters, even in immunosuppressed feline leukaemia virus or feline immunodeficiency virus positive cats. RESULTS: Our study showed the increased effectiveness of an alternative topical therapy for affected animals using the mycoparasitic fungus Pythium oligandrum, which is gentler and cheaper than the standard systemic treatment with itraconazole, and which can also be easily used as a preventative treatment. A decrease in the number of M. canis colonies was observed in cats treated with a preparation containing P. oligandrum 2 weeks after the start of therapy (2 cats with P-1 score, 2 cats with P-2 score, 5 cats with P-3 score) compared with the beginning of the study (9 cats with P-3 score = massive infection). The alternative topical therapy with a preparation containing P. oligandrum was significantly more effective compared with the commonly used systemic treatment using itraconazole 5 mg/kg in a 6-week pulse. After 16 weeks of application of the alternative topical therapy, the clinical signs of dermatophytosis were eliminated throughout the whole shelter. CONCLUSION: The complete elimination of the clinical signs of dermatophytosis in all cats indicates that this therapy will be useful for the management and prevention of zoonotic dermatophytosis in animal shelters.",['(c) 2021.

The use of innovative immunotherapeutic approaches such as anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T cells does not ensure durable remissions, because leukemia-propagating cells (LPCs) that lack expression of CD19 can cause relapse, which signifies the need to identify new markers of ALL. Here we investigated expression of CD58, CD97, and CD200, which were previously shown to be overexpressed in B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL) in CD34+/CD19+, CD34+/CD19-, CD34-/CD19+, and CD34-/CD19- LPCs, to assess their potential as therapeutic targets. Whole-genome microarray and flow cytometric analyses showed significant overexpression of these molecules compared with normal controls. CD58 and CD97 were mainly co-expressed with CD19 and were not a prerequisite for leukemia engraftment in immune deficient mice. In contrast, expression of CD200 was essential for engraftment and serial transplantation of cells in measurable residual disease (MRD) low-risk patients. Moreover, these CD200+ LPCs could be targeted by using the monoclonal antibody TTI-CD200 in vitro and in vivo. Treating mice with established disease significantly reduced disease burden and extended survival. These findings demonstrate that CD200 could be an attractive target for treating low-risk ALL, with minimal off-tumor effects that beset current immunotherapeutic approaches.",['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Diamanti, Paraskevi', 'Cox, Charlotte V', 'Ede, Benjamin C', 'Uger, Robert A', 'Moppett, John P', 'Blair, Allison']","['Diamanti P', 'Cox CV', 'Ede BC', 'Uger RA', 'Moppett JP', 'Blair A']",,"['Bristol Institute for Transfusion Sciences, National Health Service Blood and Transplant Filton, Bristol, United Kingdom.', 'School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom.', 'Bristol Institute for Transfusion Sciences, National Health Service Blood and Transplant Filton, Bristol, United Kingdom.', 'School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom.', 'Trillium Therapeutics Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada; and.', 'Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, Bristol, United Kingdom.', 'Bristol Institute for Transfusion Sciences, National Health Service Blood and Transplant Filton, Bristol, United Kingdom.', 'School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,,,2021/09/02 06:00,2021/11/03 06:00,['2021/09/01 20:16'],"['2020/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/03 06:00 [medline]', '2021/09/01 20:16 [entrez]']","['S2473-9529(21)00474-2 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020003534 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2021 Sep 28;5(18):3694-3708. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020003534.,,20211101,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)']","['Animals', 'Antigens, CD19', 'Child', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm, Residual', '*Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Disease heterogeneity is well documented, and patient stratification determines treatment decisions. Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) from risk-stratified AML are crucial for studying AML biology and testing novel therapeutics. Despite recent advances in PDX modeling of AML, reproducible engraftment of human AML is primarily limited to high-risk (HR) cases, with inconsistent or very protracted engraftment observed for favorable-risk (FR) and intermediate-risk (IR) patients. We used NSGS mice to characterize the engraftment robustness/kinetics of 28 AML patient samples grouped according to molecular/cytogenetic classification and assessed whether the orthotopic coadministration of patient-matched bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM MSCs) improves AML engraftment. PDX event-free survival correlated well with the predictable prognosis of risk-stratified AML patients. The majority (85-94%) of the mice were engrafted in bone marrow (BM) independently of the risk group, although HR AML patients showed engraftment levels that were significantly superior to those of FR or IR AML patients. Importantly, the engraftment levels observed in NSGS mice by week 6 remained stable over time. Serial transplantation and long-term culture-initiating cell (LTC-IC) assays revealed long-term engraftment limited to HR AML patients, fitter leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) in HR AML samples, and the presence of AML LICs in the CD34- leukemic fraction, regardless of the risk group. Finally, orthotopic coadministration of patient-matched BM MSCs and AML cells was dispensable for BM engraftment levels but favored peripheralization of engrafted AML cells. This comprehensive characterization of human AML engraftment in NSGS mice offers a valuable platform for in vivo testing of targeted therapies in risk-stratified AML patient samples.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

Despite overlap between genetic risk loci for ALL and hematologic traits, the etiological relevance of dysregulated blood-cell homeostasis remains unclear. We investigated this question in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of childhood ALL (2,666 affected individuals, 60,272 control individuals) and a multi-trait GWAS of nine blood-cell indices in the UK Biobank. We identified 3,000 blood-cell-trait-associated (p < 5.0 x 10(-8)) variants, explaining 4.0% to 23.9% of trait variation and including 115 loci associated with blood-cell ratios (LMR, lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio; NLR, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio; PLR, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio). ALL susceptibility was genetically correlated with lymphocyte counts (rg = 0.088, p = 4.0 x 10(-4)) and PLR (rg = -0.072, p = 0.0017). In Mendelian randomization analyses, genetically predicted increase in lymphocyte counts was associated with increased ALL risk (odds ratio [OR] = 1.16, p = 0.031) and strengthened after accounting for other cell types (OR = 1.43, p = 8.8 x 10(-4)). We observed positive associations with increasing LMR (OR = 1.22, p = 0.0017) and inverse effects for NLR (OR = 0.67, p = 3.1 x 10(-4)) and PLR (OR = 0.80, p = 0.002). Our study shows that a genetically induced shift toward higher lymphocyte counts, overall and in relation to monocytes, neutrophils, and platelets, confers an increased susceptibility to childhood ALL.","['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society of Human Genetics.

As BCL2 is an important determinant of survival of both myeloid progenitor and B cells, we investigated whether clinical and molecular abnormalities arise in the myeloid compartment during long-term continuous venetoclax treatment for CLL in 89 patients (87 with relapsed/refractory CLL). Over a median follow-up of 75 (range 21-98) months, persistent cytopenias ((3) 1 of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia) lasting (3)4 months and unrelated to CLL occurred in 25 patients (28%). Of these patients, 20 (80%) displayed clonal hematopoiesis, including 10 with therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (tMNs). tMNs occurred exclusively in patients previously exposed to fludarabine-alkylator combination therapy with a cumulative 5-year incidence of 10.4% after venetoclax initiation, consistent with rates reported for patients exposed to fludarabine-alkylator combination therapy without venetoclax. To determine whether the altered myelopoiesis reflected acquisition of mutations, we analyzed samples from patients with no or minimal bone marrow CLL burden (n = 41). Mutations in the apoptosis effector BAX were identified in 32% (13/41). In cellular assays, C-terminal BAX mutants abrogated outer mitochondrial membrane localization of BAX and engendered resistance to venetoclax killing. BAX-mutated clonal hematopoiesis occurred independently of prior fludarabine-alkylator combination therapy exposure and was not associated with tMNs. Single cell sequencing revealed clonal co-occurrence of mutations in BAX with DNMT3A or ASXL1. We also observed simultaneous BCL2 mutations within CLL cells and BAX mutations in the myeloid compartment of the same patients, indicating lineage-specific adaptation to venetoclax therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society of Hematology.'],"['Blombery, Piers', 'Lew, Thomas E', 'Dengler, Michael A', 'Thompson, Ella R', 'Lin, Victor S', 'Chen, Xiangting', 'Nguyen, Tamia', 'Panigrahi, Ashish', 'Handunnetti, Sasanka Mithila', 'Carney, Dennis', 'Westerman, David A', 'Tam, Constantine S', 'Adams, Jerry M', 'Wei, Andrew H', 'Huang, David Ching Siang', 'Seymour, John F', 'Roberts, Andrew', 'Anderson, Mary Ann']","['Blombery P', 'Lew TE', 'Dengler MA', 'Thompson ER', 'Lin VS', 'Chen X', 'Nguyen T', 'Panigrahi A', 'Handunnetti SM', 'Carney D', 'Westerman DA', 'Tam CS', 'Adams JM', 'Wei AH', 'Huang DCS', 'Seymour JF', 'Roberts A', 'Anderson MA']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6804-2432', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1693-1761', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3432-0785', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8790-4675', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3239-6065', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9759-5017', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3101-4873', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2188-6835']","['University of Melbourne, Australia.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Australia.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Australia.', 'University of Melbourne, Australia.', 'Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre and Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre & Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Australia.', 'University of Melbourne, Australia.', 'University of Melbourne, Australia.', 'University of Melbourne, Australia.', 'University of Melbourne, Australia.', 'The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.', 'University of Melbourne, Australia.', 'University of Melbourne, Australia.', 'University of Melbourne, Australia.', 'Peter MacCallum Cancer Center, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,,2021/09/02 06:00,2021/09/02 06:00,['2021/09/01 17:24'],"['2021/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/26 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/01 17:24 [entrez]', '2021/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(21)01541-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2021012775 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Blood. 2021 Sep 1. pii: S0006-4971(21)01541-X. doi: 10.1182/blood.2021012775.,20210901,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the unique features associated with ulcerated melanoma that contribute to a poor prognosis in affected patients remain poorly defined. microRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs that function to inhibit expression of specific gene targets, therefore altering the functions of cells in which they are expressed. miR-1469 is a novel miR with significantly decreased expression in ulcerated melanoma tissue relative to non-ulcerated tumors. We hypothesized that loss of miR-1469 expression in melanoma contributes to altered tumor cell functions mediating disease progression. Transfection of a miR-1469 mimic resulted in a significant reduction in the migratory and invasive capacity of the CHL1 and MEL39 melanoma cell lines (>58.1% reduction, p < 0.0332), as well as the invasive capacity of the A375 melanoma cell line (>50% reduction, p < 0.0021). Expression of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL1), a miR-1469 target gene, was reduced in the A375 and MEL39 cell lines by immunoblot. No significant differences in viability, resistance to apoptotic stimuli, or proliferation were observed following transfection. These findings together demonstrate how migration and invasion are specific functions through which miR-1469 expression in melanoma cells can contribute to the differences in disease progression associated with tumor ulceration.",,"['DiVincenzo, Mallory J', 'Barricklow, Zoe', 'Schwarz, Emily', 'Moufawad, Maribelle', 'Howard, J Harrison', 'Yu, Lianbo', 'Chung, Catherine', 'Gru, Alejandro A', 'Carson, William E 3rd']","['DiVincenzo MJ', 'Barricklow Z', 'Schwarz E', 'Moufawad M', 'Howard JH', 'Yu L', 'Chung C', 'Gru AA', 'Carson WE 3rd']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6041-8164', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2383-1555', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7024-7533']","['Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States of America.', 'The Arthur G.

However, drug-drug interactions, non-adherence, and host-related factors may influence plasma concentrations. Therefore, therapeutic drug monitoring may be necessary for patients presenting inadequate treatment responses or adverse events. Herein, the authors aimed to develop a more sensitive and high-throughput method than those previously reported to simultaneously quantify five TKIs (imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib) and two active metabolites (N-desmethyl imatinib and N-desmethyl ponatinib) using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. METHODS: Plasma samples were prepared according to a solid-phase extraction protocol using an Oasis MCX microElution plate. The assay fulfilled the requirements of the US Food and Drug Administration for assay validation, with a lower limit of quantification of 0.2 ng/mL for dasatinib, 0.3 ng/mL for N-desmethyl ponatinib, 0.5 ng/mL for N-desmethyl imatinib, bosutinib and ponatinib, and 2.5 ng/mL for imatinib and nilotinib. RESULTS: Within-batch and batch-to-batch precision at the lower limit of quantification and quality control levels were within 14.3% and 10.9%, respectively. Within-batch and batch-to-batch accuracies ranged from -15.5% to 13.0% and -5.70% to 7.03%, respectively. A positive electrospray ionization mode was employed with a run time of 6.0 min. The assay applicability was verified by the successful measurement of 78 clinical samples from patients undergoing CML therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The method allows assessment of trough concentrations of TKIs and active metabolites in patients with CML, and hence can be used to assess blood samples in routine clinical settings.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

METHODS: Survivors of childhood cancer treated at St. Jude Children's Hospital (n = 2022; 48.3% female; median age, 31.5 years; median time since diagnosis, 23.6 years) completed neurocognitive testing and questionnaires. The presence, severity, resolution, and treatment history of seizures were abstracted from medical records. Adjusting for the age at diagnosis, sex, and prior cancer therapy, multivariable models examined the impact of seizures on neurocognitive and HRQOL outcomes. Mediation analyses were conducted for social outcomes. RESULTS: Seizures were identified in 232 survivors (11.5%; 29.9% of survivors with central nervous system [CNS] tumors and 9.0% of those without CNS tumors). In CNS tumor survivors, seizures were associated with poorer executive function and processing speed (P < .02); in non-CNS tumor survivors, seizures were associated with worse function in every domain (P < .05). Among non-CNS survivors, seizure severity was associated with worse processing speed (P = .023), and resolution was associated with better executive function (P = .028) and attention (P = .044). In CNS survivors, seizure resolution was associated with improved attention (P = .047) and memory (P < .02). Mediation analysis revealed that the impact of seizures on social outcomes was mediated by neurocognitive function. CONCLUSIONS: Seizures in cancer survivors adversely affect long-term functional and psychosocial outcomes independently of cancer therapy. The resolution of seizure occurrence is associated with better outcomes. Seizure severity is associated with poorer outcomes and should be a focus of clinical management and patient education.",['(c) 2021 American Cancer Society.'],"['Phillips, Nicholas S', 'Khan, Raja B', 'Li, Chenghong', 'Mirzaei Salehabadi, Sedigheh', 'Brinkman, Tara M', 'Srivastava, Deokumar', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Krull, Kevin R', 'Sadighi, Zsila S']","['Phillips NS', 'Khan RB', 'Li C', 'Mirzaei Salehabadi S', 'Brinkman TM', 'Srivastava D', 'Robison LL', 'Hudson MM', 'Krull KR', 'Sadighi ZS']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2021-4036', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4250-6160', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0476-7001']","[""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Division of Neurology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Psychology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Psychology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Division of Neurology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee.""]",['eng'],"['T32 CA225590/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA195547/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['brain tumor', 'cancer survivors', 'leukemia', 'neurocognitive', 'seizure']",2021/09/02 06:00,2021/09/02 06:00,['2021/09/01 12:40'],"['2021/08/04 00:00 [revised]', '2021/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2021/09/01 12:40 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.33879 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2022 Jan 1;128(1):180-191. doi: 10.1002/cncr.33879.

METHODS: Rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) and acute monocytic leukemia (THP-1)-derived M2 macrophages were used. Human whole blood-derived neutrophils and basophils were employed. Flow cytometry was used for studying key signalling proteins. Platelet activation factor (PAF)-induced asthma model in guinea pigs was used for in vivo studies. RESULTS: The chemical structure of FNF-12 was confirmed with proton-nuclear mass resonance (NMR) and mass spectroscopy. FNF-12 controlled degranulation in RBL-2H3 cells with an IC50 value of 123.7 nM and inhibited TNF-alpha release from these cells in a dose-responsive way. The compound effectively controlled the migration and elastase release in activated neutrophils. IC50 value in the FcepsilonRI-basophil activation assay was found to be 205 nM. FNF-12 controlled the release of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced interleukin-10, I-309/CCL1 and MDC/CCL22 in THP-1 derived M2 macrophages. The compound suppressed LPS-induced mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)-p-p38 and nuclear factor kappa B(NF-kB)-p-p65 expression in these cells. A dose-dependent decrease in the accumulation of total leucocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils and macrophages was observed in PAF-induced animal models. CONCLUSION: FNF-12 was able to control the inflammatory responses in in vitro and in vivo asthma models, which may be driven by controlling M2-related Th2 cytokines via MAPK and NF-kB signaling.",['(c) 2021.

However, nErA has a short in vivo half-life requiring frequent dosing schedules in patients. In this study, nErA was covalently conjugated to PEG molecules with the aim of extending its half-life in vivo. METHODS: Firstly, efficacy of this novel product PEG-nErA was investigated on human ALL cell lines (Jurkat, CCRF-CEM and CCRF-HSB2), in vitro. Secondly, its pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) characteristics were determined, in vivo (12 rats in each group). Results. It was found that the specific activity (U/mg of enzyme) and the kinetic constant (KM) of nErA remained unaltered post PEGylation. PEG-nErA was shown to have similar cytotoxicity to nErA (IC50: 0.06-0.17 U/mL) on human ALL cell lines, in vitro. Further, when compared to nErA, PEG-nErA showed a significantly improved half-life in vivo, which meant that L-Asparagine (Asn) levels in plasma remained depleted for up to 25 days with a four-fold lower dose (100 U/kg) compared with 72 h for nErA at 400 U/kg dose. CONCLUSION: Overall, this next generation product PEG-nErA (with improved PK and PD characteristics compared to nErA) would bring a significant advantage to the therapeutic needs of ALL patients and should be further explored in clinical trials.",['(c) 2021.

In this work, we identified that anisomycin is a potential selective anti-AML candidate, particularly for those with FLT3-ITD mutation. We found that anisomycin potently inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in multiple AML cell lines. Anisomycin was effective in targeting progenitor cells isolated from all tested pediatric AML patients, while sparing normal counterparts. Using AML xenograft mouse models, anisomycin exhibited inhibitory effect on tumor growth throughout the whole duration without causing toxicity in mice. The combination of anisomycin with standard of care drugs is synergistic and selective in AML cell culture system and mouse model. In addition, FLT3-ITD cells were more sensitive to anisomycin than FLT3 WT cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that anisomycin acted on AML in a p38-independent manner. We found that anisomycin decreased mitochondrial respiration by disrupting complex I activity, leading to intracellular oxidative stress. AML rho(0) cells that lack of mitochondrial respiration exhibited resistance to anisomycin. Finally, we showed that mitochondrial biogenesis contributes to differential sensitivity of FLT3-ITD and FLT3 WT cells to anisomycin. Our work is the first to systematically demonstrate that anisomycin is a useful addition to the treatment armamentarium for AML. Our findings highlight the therapeutic value of mitochondrial respiration inhibition in AML patients harboring FLT3-ITD mutation.","['(c) 2021.

These proteins deaminate cytidines in negative-strand DNA during reverse transcription, leading to G-to-A changes in coding strands. Uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG) is a host enzyme that excises uracils in genomic DNA, which the base excision repair machinery then repairs. Whether UNG removes uracils found in retroviral DNA after APOBEC3-mediated mutation is not clear, and whether this occurs in vivo has not been demonstrated. To determine if UNG plays a role in the repair of retroviral DNA, we used APOBEC3G (A3G) transgenic mice which we showed previously had extensive deamination of murine leukemia virus (MLV) proviruses. The A3G transgene was crossed onto an Ung and mouse Apobec3 knockout background (UNG-/-APO-/-), and the mice were infected with MLV. We found that virus infection levels were decreased in A3G UNG-/-APO-/- compared with A3G APO-/- mice. Deep sequencing of the proviruses showed that there were significantly higher levels of G-to-A mutations in proviral DNA from A3G transgenic UNG-/-APO-/- than A3G transgenic APO-/- mice, suggesting that UNG plays a role in the repair of uracil-containing proviruses. In in vitro studies, we found that cytoplasmic viral DNA deaminated by APOBEC3G was uracilated. In the absence of UNG, the uracil-containing proviruses integrated at higher levels into the genome than those made in the presence of UNG. Thus, UNG also functions in the nucleus prior to integration by nicking uracil-containing viral DNA, thereby blocking integration. These data show that UNG plays a critical role in the repair of the damage inflicted by APOBEC3 deamination of reverse-transcribed DNA. IMPORTANCE While APOBEC3-mediated mutation of retroviruses is well-established, what role the host base excision repair enzymes play in correcting these mutations is not clear. This question is especially difficult to address in vivo. Here, we use a transgenic mouse developed by our lab that expresses human APOBEC3G and also lacks the endogenous uracil DNA glycosylase (Ung) gene and show that UNG removes uracils introduced by this cytidine deaminase in MLV reverse transcripts, thereby reducing G-to-A mutations in proviruses. Furthermore, our data suggest that UNG removes uracils at two stages in infection-first, in unintegrated nuclear viral reverse-transcribed DNA, resulting in its degradation; and second, in integrated proviruses, resulting in their repair. These data suggest that retroviruses damaged by host cytidine deaminases take advantage of the host DNA repair system to overcome this damage.",,"['Salas-Briceno, Karen', 'Ross, Susan R']","['Salas-Briceno K', 'Ross SR']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2166-0035', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3094-3769']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 AI085015/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR002003/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI 085015/HHS | NIH | National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases', '(NIAID)']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*APOBEC3', '*base-excision repair', '*murine retrovirus', '*uracil DNA glycosylase']",2021/09/02 06:00,2021/12/25 06:00,['2021/09/01 12:16'],"['2022/04/27 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/25 06:00 [medline]', '2021/09/01 12:16 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.01244-21 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2021 Oct 27;95(22):e0124421. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01244-21.

We and others, previously reported that the activation of CLL cells by signals that mimic microenvironment stimuli favors the upregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins from B cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) family that are not targeted by venetoclax, reducing malignant cell sensitivity to the drug. We here studied venetoclax-resistant CLL cells generated in vitro by autologous activated T lymphocytes, and found that they showed an aggressive phenotype characterized by increased expression of activation and proliferation markers. Moreover, surviving cells expressed high levels of B cell lymphoma-extra-large (BCL-XL) and/or myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1), and a sustained resistance to a second treatment with the drug.

Also, they considered as vital players in initiating and preserving spermatogenesis. The fate decisions of SSCs are mediated by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, among which microRNAs (miRNAs) are one of the most essential factors in spermatogenesis among endogenous regulators. However, the mechanisms by which individual miRNAs regulate self-renewal and differentiation of SSCs are unclear. The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of miRNA-30 mimic on fate determinations of SSCs. Materials and Methods: The obtained SSCs from neonatal mice (3-6 days old) were purified by MACS and flow cytometry with a promyelocytic leukemia zinc-finger marker. Then, the cultured cells were transfected with miRNA- 30 mimic, and finally, the changes in expressing ID4 and c-kit proteins were assessed by western blot analysis. Results: According to flow cytometry findings, the percentage of SSC purity was about 98.32. The expression of ID4 protein and colonization increased significantly through the transfection of miRNA-30 mimic (P<0.05). Conclusion: The miRNA-30 controls spermatogonial stem cell self-renewal and differentiation, which may have significant implications for treating male infertility.","['Copyright(c) 2020, Galen Medical Journal.']","['Khanehzad, Maryam', 'Abolhasani, Farid', 'Hassanzadeh, Gholamreza', 'Nourashrafeddin, Seyed Mehdi', 'Hedayatpour, Azim']","['Khanehzad M', 'Abolhasani F', 'Hassanzadeh G', 'Nourashrafeddin SM', 'Hedayatpour A']",,"['Department of Anatomy, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Anatomy, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Anatomy, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, USA.', 'School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Anatomy, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Iran,Galen Med J,Galen medical journal,101625418,,['NOTNLM'],"['Adult Germline Stem Cell', 'Cell Differentiation', 'MicroRNA', 'Self-renewal']",2021/09/02 06:00,2021/09/02 06:01,['2021/09/01 07:26'],"['2020/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/17 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/01 07:26 [entrez]', '2021/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.31661/gmj.v9i0.1829 [doi]'],epublish,Galen Med J. 2020 Aug 19;9:e1829. doi: 10.31661/gmj.v9i0.1829. eCollection 2020.,20200819,,,,PMC8344142,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Different studies have demonstrated that B-cell translocation gene 3 (BTG3) plays a suppressive role in the progress of different cancers. Genistein is considered a natural and biocompatible compound and a new anti-cancer agent. In this study, we evaluate the effect of genistein on BTG3 expression and proliferation of ALL cancer cells. Materials and Methods: ALL cell lines (MOLT4, MOLT17, and JURKAT) were cultured in standard conditions. Cytotoxicity of genistein was detected using MTT assay. The cells were treated with different concentrations of genistein (10, 25, 40, and 55muM) for 24, 48, and 72 hours, and then cell viability and growth rate were measured. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was applied to investigate the effect of genistein on BTG3 expression. Results: The percentage of vital cells treated with genistein significantly decreased compared to the non-treated cells, showed an inverse relationship with an increasing genistein concentration. The present study suggests a dose of 40muM for genistein as a potent anticancer effect. Genistein could elevate BTG3 for 1.7 folds in MOLT4 and JURKAT and 2.7 folds in MOLT17 cell lines at transcription level conveged with 60 to 90% reduction in the proliferation rate of cancer cells. Conclusion: Up-regulation of BTG3 as a tumor suppressor gene can be induced by genistein. It seems that BTG3 reactivation can be introduced as another mechanism of anti-proliferative effect of genistein and could be considered as a retardant agent candidate against hematopoietic malignancy.","['Copyright(c) 2019, Galen Medical Journal.']","['Abedi Nejad, Masoumeh', 'Nikbakht, Mohsen', 'Afsa, Masoomeh', 'Malekzadeh, Kianoosh']","['Abedi Nejad M', 'Nikbakht M', 'Afsa M', 'Malekzadeh K']",,"['Department of Biology, Jahrom Branch, Islamic Azad University, Jahrom, Iran.', 'Molecular Medicine Research Center, Hormozgan Health Institute, Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences, Bandar Abbas, Iran.', 'Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Molecular Medicine Research Center, Hormozgan Health Institute, Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences, Bandar Abbas, Iran.', 'Molecular Medicine Research Center, Hormozgan Health Institute, Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences, Bandar Abbas, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences, Bandar Abbas, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Iran,Galen Med J,Galen medical journal,101625418,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia', 'Anti-Proliferation', 'B-cell Translocation Gene-3', 'Genistein']",2019/03/26 00:00,2019/03/26 00:01,['2021/09/01 07:26'],"['2018/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/23 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/01 07:26 [entrez]', '2019/03/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/26 00:01 [medline]']",['10.31661/gmj.v8i0.1229 [doi]'],epublish,Galen Med J. 2019 Mar 26;8:e1229. doi: 10.31661/gmj.v8i0.1229. eCollection 2019.,20190326,,,,PMC8343482,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apigenin, a flavonoid with thechemical formula C15H10O5 , is abundantly present in vegetables. Vegetarian foods containing flavonoids are rich sources of bioactive compounds. Flavonoids have been utilized in herbal treatment. Nanogels are drug delivery systems based on polymers and are used in tissue engineering and for drug delivery. This study was conducted to compare the effects of apigenin and a nanodrug on the viability of the K562 cell line of chronic myeloid leukemia at different durations under laboratory conditions. Materials and Methods: Chitosan was first dissolved in 1% acetic acid, and ethylene dichloride EDC and NHS were added to the solution. Then, the nanodrug was prepared by loading apigenin into stearate-chitosan nanogel (scs nanogel), and its physical and morphological characteristics were evaluated by TEM, DLS, and FTIR. Trypan blue staining, MTT assay, and flow cytometry were used to analyze the effects of various concentrations of apigenin and apigenin-loaded chitosan-stearate nanogel (APG-SCS) at 24, 48, and 72 h after they were applied to the K562 cell line. Results: The diameter of the nanodrug particles was measured using DLS and confirmed by TEM. The K562 cells treated with APG-SCS and with apigenin exhibited significant differences compared with the control (P < 0.05). Apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. Conclusion: This study showed that the toxic effects of apigenin and the nanodrug improved with increasing concentrations and exposure durations compared to those in the control.The toxic effect of apigenin loaded into the stearate-chitosan nanogel was greater than apigenin, and the toxic effects of both materials were greater compared to the control under laboratory conditions.","['Copyright(c) 2018, Galen Medical Journal.']","['Samadian, Nooshin', 'Hashemi, Mehrdad']","['Samadian N', 'Hashemi M']",,"['Department of Molecular and Cellular Sciences, Islamic Azad University ,Tehran medical sciences branch, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of medical biotechnology, Islamic Azad University ,Tehran medical sciences branch, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Iran,Galen Med J,Galen medical journal,101625418,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apigenin', 'Chitosan', 'Flavonoid', 'Nanogel']",2018/05/19 00:00,2018/05/19 00:01,['2021/09/01 07:26'],"['2017/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/29 00:00 [revised]', '2017/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/01 07:26 [entrez]', '2018/05/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/19 00:01 [medline]']",['10.22086/gmj.v0i0.1008 [doi]'],epublish,Galen Med J. 2018 May 19;7:e1008. doi: 10.22086/gmj.v0i0.1008. eCollection 2018.,20180519,,,,PMC8344127,['Authors have no conflict of interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Curcumin is a hydrophobic polyphenol and the main compound of turmeric, which has been used in daily diets for many years. It is also a safe drug. Nanogels and nanobiotechnology have important roles in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases and drug delivery. Materials and Methods: To prepare the nanodrug, chitosan nanogels were prepared in 1% acetic acid and cross-linked with stearate by 1- ethyl- 3 (3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS). Subsequently, curcumin was loaded in the chitosan-stearate nanogel. Physical and morphological characteristics of the nanodrug were determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Different nanodrug concentrations were prepared and evaluated on the K562 CML cell line. The apoptotic activities of curcumin and nanodrug on the cells were detected by flow cytometry, MTT assay, and trypan blue staining. Results: DLS revealed that the size of the nanodrug was 150 nm, which was confirmed by TEM. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of curcumin and nanodrug were 50 and 25 mug/ ml, respectively P < 0.05). Apoptosis of the K562 cell line occurred at 48 h post-treatment with 25 mug/ml curcumin and 12.5 mug/ml nanodrug. Conclusion: The increase in the cytotoxicity of curcumin and nanodrug was directly related to the drug concentration and time. The nanodrug exhibited more cytotoxic effects on the vital capacity of the cells and stimulated more apoptosis compared with curcumin alone.","['Copyright(c) 2018, Galen Medical Journal.']","['Khatamsaz, Sepideh', 'Hashemi, Mehrdad']","['Khatamsaz S', 'Hashemi M']",,"['Department of Molecular and Cellular Sciences, Faculty of Advanced Sciences & Technology, Pharmaceutical Sciences Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran -Iran (IAUPS).', 'Department of Genetics, Tehran medical sciences branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Iran,Galen Med J,Galen medical journal,101625418,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chitosan', 'Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia', 'Curcumin', 'Nanogel', 'Stearate']",2018/02/23 00:00,2018/02/23 00:01,['2021/09/01 07:26'],"['2017/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/08 00:00 [revised]', '2017/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/01 07:26 [entrez]', '2018/02/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/23 00:01 [medline]']",['10.22086/gmj.v0i0.921 [doi]'],epublish,Galen Med J. 2018 Feb 23;7:e921. doi: 10.22086/gmj.v0i0.921. eCollection 2018.,20180223,,,,PMC8343872,['The authors report no conflict of interests in this article.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Resistance to imatinib is interfering with patients' responses and their survivals. Materials and Methods: We designed a systematic search to find relevant studies by applying appropriate keywords in PubMed, Web of science, Scopus, Ovid, ProQuest, Science direct and Google scholar for English studies. We also investigated the aforementioned terms' correspondence in Magiran, Scientific information database (SID) and Google scholar for Persian articles. Results: 25 studies were selected for final analysis. Reported hematologic responses from adult studies ranged 86-99% and major molecular responses were estimated in 38.84% of our patients within 12 months of treatment. The most frequent reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were edema (n=5 studies, 100%) and fatigue and nausea (n=4 studies, 80%); ADR per capita ratio was 1.46. Only one study informed ADRs in pediatrics demonstrating 93% of patients experienced ADRs after receiving imatinib. Most of the Studies (n=4, 67% from 7 studies) considered BCR/ABL point mutation as main reason of imatinib resistance. Drug-binding site and P-loop regions were two common sites for BCR/ABL point mutation. Conclusion: Imatinib as the first line treatment for CML has been associated with proper and durable responses in Iranian adults and children CML patients.

Twenty- four hours after the consolidation chemotherapy, patient were randomized to receive either daily short-acting G-CSF (PD-Grastim) (300 microg/kg) or single-dose long-acting G-CSF (PD-Lasta) (6 mg). Results: The median time to recovery of neutrophils was 11.00 and 13.00 days for short-acting G-CSF (PD-Grastim) (n=22) and long-acting G-CSF (PD-Lasta) (n=29) groups, respectively (U=186.5, P>0.05 two-tailed). Incidence of adverse effects was similar in both short-acting G-CSF (PD-Grastim) and long-acting G-CSF (PD-Lasta) groups. Conclusion: Overall, data show that Iranian long-acting G-CSF (PD-Lasta) was not significantly different with Iranian short-acting G-CSF (PD-Grastim).",['Copyright (c) 2021 Tehran University of Medical Sciences.'],"['Esfandbod, Mohsen', 'Agha Bararzadeh, Fatemeh', 'Faraz, Mona', 'Zarrabi, Fariba', 'Toogeh, Gholamreza']","['Esfandbod M', 'Agha Bararzadeh F', 'Faraz M', 'Zarrabi F', 'Toogeh G']",,"['Thrombosis Hemostasis Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Thrombosis Hemostasis Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Thrombosis Hemostasis Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Thrombosis Hemostasis Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Thrombosis Hemostasis Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Iran,Int J Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Res,International journal of hematology-oncology and stem cell research,101511150,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)', 'Neutropenia']",2021/09/02 06:00,2021/09/02 06:01,['2021/09/01 07:23'],"['2020/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/01 07:23 [entrez]', '2021/09/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18502/ijhoscr.v15i2.6040 [doi]', 'IJHOSCR-15-96 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Res. 2021 Apr 1;15(2):96-102. doi: 10.18502/ijhoscr.v15i2.6040.,,,,,PMC8381103,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, the main causes of AML considered all over the world are genetic variations in cancerous cells. The RUNX1 and FLT3 genes are necessary for the normal hematopoiesis and differentiation process of hematopoietic stem cells into mature blood cells, therefore they are the most common targets for point mutations resulting in AML. Methods: We screened 32 CN-AML patients for FLT3-ITD (by Allele-specific PCR) and RUNX1 mutations (by Sanger sequencing). The FLT3 mRNA expression was assessed in all AML patients and its subgroups. Results: Eight patients (25%) carried RUNX1 mutation (K83E) while three patients (9.37%) were found to have internal tandem duplications in FLT3 gene. The RUNX1 mutation data were correlated with clinical parameters and FLT3 gene expression profile. The RUNX1 mutations were observed to be significantly prevalent in older males. Moreover, RUNX1 and FLT3-mutated patients had lower complete remission rate, event-free survival rate, and lower overall survival rate than patients with wild-type RUNX1 and FLT3 gene. The RUNX1 and FLT3 mutant patients with up-regulated FLT3 gene expression showed even worse prognosis. Bradford Assay showed that protein concentration was down-regulated in RUNX1 and FLT3 mutants in comparison to RUNX1 and FLT3 wild-type groups. Conclusion: This study constitutes the first report from Pakistan reporting significant molecular mutation analysis of RUNX1 and FLT3 genes including FLT3 expression evaluation with follow-up. This provides an insight that aforementioned mutations are markers of poor prognosis but the study with a large AML cohort will be useful to further investigate their role in disease biology of AML.",['(c) 2021 The Author(s).'],"['Rehman, Atia', 'Akram, Afia Muhammad', 'Chaudhary, Asma', 'Sheikh, Nadeem', 'Hussain, Zawar', 'Alsanie, Walaa F', 'Rehman, Rahat Abdul', 'Hameed, Naila', 'Saleem, Tayyaba', 'Zafar, Amjad', 'Absar, Muhammad', 'Iqbal, Zafar', 'Alhazmi, Alaa', 'Baeshen, Hosam Ali', 'Mohammedsaleh, Zuhair M', 'Qamer, Samina', 'Sayed, Samy', 'Gaber, Ahmed']","['Rehman A', 'Akram AM', 'Chaudhary A', 'Sheikh N', 'Hussain Z', 'Alsanie WF', 'Rehman RA', 'Hameed N', 'Saleem T', 'Zafar A', 'Absar M', 'Iqbal Z', 'Alhazmi A', 'Baeshen HA', 'Mohammedsaleh ZM', 'Qamer S', 'Sayed S', 'Gaber A']",,"['Cell and Molecular Biology Lab (CMBL), Department of Zoology, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan.', 'Molecular Biology Lab, University of Education, Township Campus, College Road, Lahore, Pakistan.', 'Molecular Biology Lab, University of Education, Township Campus, College Road, Lahore, Pakistan.', 'Molecular Biology Lab, University of Education, Township Campus, College Road, Lahore, Pakistan.', 'Cell and Molecular Biology Lab (CMBL), Department of Zoology, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan.', 'Molecular Biology Lab, University of Education, Township Campus, College Road, Lahore, Pakistan.', 'Center of Biomedical Sciences Research (CBSR), Taif University, P.O.

Despite the fact that the majority of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) achieve complete remission after chemotherapy, a large proportion of them relapse as a result of residual malignant cells. These persistent clones have a competitive advantage and can re-establish disease. Therefore, targeting strategies that specifically diminish cell competition of malignant cells while leaving normal cells unaffected are clearly warranted. Recently, our group identified YBX1 as a mediator of disease persistence in JAK2-mutated myeloproliferative neoplasms. The role of YBX1 in AML, however, remained so far elusive. Here, inactivation of YBX1 confirms its role as an essential driver of leukemia development and maintenance. We identify its ability to amplify the translation of oncogenic transcripts, including MYC, by recruitment to polysomal chains. Genetic inactivation of YBX1 disrupts this regulatory circuit and displaces oncogenic drivers from polysomes, with subsequent depletion of protein levels. As a consequence, leukemia cells show reduced proliferation and are out-competed in vitro and in vivo, while normal cells remain largely unaffected. Collectively, these data establish YBX1 as a specific dependency and therapeutic target in AML that is essential for oncogenic protein expression.",['(c) 2021.

We report that USP15 mRNA and protein are overexpressed in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as compared to normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. This high expression of USP15 in AML correlates with KEAP1 protein and suppression of NRF2. Knockdown or deletion of USP15 in human and mouse AML models significantly impairs leukemic progenitor function and viability and de-represses an antioxidant response through the KEAP1-NRF2 axis. Inhibition of USP15 and subsequent activation of NRF2 leads to redox perturbations in AML cells, coincident with impaired leukemic cell function. In contrast, USP15 is dispensable for human and mouse normal hematopoietic cells in vitro and in vivo. A preclinical small-molecule inhibitor of USP15 induced the KEAP1-NRF2 axis and impaired AML cell function, suggesting that targeting USP15 catalytic function can suppress AML. Based on these findings, we report that USP15 drives AML cell function, in part, by suppressing a critical oxidative stress sensor mechanism and permitting an aberrant redox state. Furthermore, we postulate that inhibition of USP15 activity with small molecule inhibitors will selectively impair leukemic progenitor cells by re-engaging homeostatic redox responses while sparing normal hematopoiesis.",['(c) 2021.

As an important epigenetic regulator, PHF6 mutations frequently coexist with JAK3 mutations in T-ALL patients. However, the role(s) of PHF6 mutations in JAK3-driven leukemia remain unclear. Here, the cooperation between JAK3 activation and PHF6 inactivation is examined in leukemia patients and in mice models. We found that the average survival time is shorter in patients with JAK/STAT and PHF6 comutation than that in other patients, suggesting a potential role of PHF6 in leukemia progression. We subsequently found that Phf6 deficiency promotes JAK3(M511I)-induced T-ALL progression in mice by inhibiting the Bai1-Mdm2-P53 signaling pathway, which is independent of the JAK3/STAT5 signaling pathway.

A hallmark of PBL represents its plasmacytic differentiation with loss of B-cell markers and, in 60% of cases, its association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Roughly 50% of PBLs harbor a MYC translocation. Here, we provide a comprehensive integrated genomic analysis using whole exome sequencing (WES) and genome-wide copy number determination in a large cohort of 96 primary PBL samples. We identify alterations activating the RAS-RAF, JAK-STAT, and NOTCH pathways as well as frequent high-level amplifications in MCL1 and IRF4. The functional impact of these alterations is assessed using an unbiased shRNA screen in a PBL model.

The hyper-cyclophosphamide, vincristine, Adriamycin, and dexamethasone plus rituximab (CVAD-R) regimen includes systemic and intrathecal CNS-directed therapy to treat and prevent CNS disease. We report here the long-term safety and efficacy of the hyper-CVAD-R regimen in adults with BL and HGBL, focusing on its efficacy to prevent CNS relapse. Among 79 adults (54 BL, 25 HGBL), the median age was 44 years (25% >/=60 years old), 73% had bone marrow (BM) involvement, and 28% had CNS involvement. The complete response rate was 91% (BL 96%; HGBCL 79%; P = .16). The 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 58% and 52%, respectively. The cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was 21% (BL 14%; HGBCL 37%, P = .06) and was associated with baseline BM (27% vs 0%; P = .02) and CNS (42% vs 12%; P < .01) involvement. In multivariate analyses, age and CNS involvement were independent predictors for OS and RFS. The 5-year CNS CIR was 6% (BL 4%; HGBL 11%; P = .31); 16% with baseline CNS involvement (P = .03).

Although some patients have only a single identifiable oncogenic mutation, others have 1 or more additional alterations. Such secondary mutations, as a group, are associated with an increased risk of relapse after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or transformation to acute myeloid leukemia. These clinical observations suggest a cooperative effect between initiating and secondary mutations. However, the roles of specific genes in the prognosis or clinical presentation of JMML have not been described. In this study, we investigate the impact of secondary SH2B3 mutations in JMML. We find that patients with SH2B3 mutations have adverse outcomes, as well as higher white blood cell counts and hemoglobin F levels in the peripheral blood. We further demonstrate this interaction in genetically engineered mice. Deletion of Sh2b3 cooperates with conditional Nf1 deletion in a dose-dependent fashion. These studies illustrate that haploinsufficiency for Sh2b3 contributes to the severity of myeloproliferative disease and provide an experimental system for testing treatments for a high-risk cohort of JMML patients.",['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Morales, Carolina E', 'Stieglitz, Elliot', 'Kogan, Scott C', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Braun, Benjamin S']","['Morales CE', 'Stieglitz E', 'Kogan SC', 'Loh ML', 'Braun BS']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7032-4623', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2395-8479', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4099-4700', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7363-9185']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Benioff Children's Hospital."", 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, and.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Benioff Children's Hospital."", 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, and.', 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, and.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Benioff Children's Hospital."", 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, and.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Benioff Children's Hospital."", 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, and.']",['eng'],"['K08 HL135434/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA082103/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA196519/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,,,2021/09/01 06:00,2021/11/03 06:00,['2021/08/31 20:24'],"['2020/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/03 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/31 20:24 [entrez]']","['S2473-9529(21)00466-3 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020003754 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2021 Sep 28;5(18):3587-3591. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020003754.,,20211101,,"['Animals', 'Child, Preschool', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/genetics/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Signal Transduction']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Homeostasis is critical for HSC potential and lifelong hematopoiesis, and HSC homeostasis is tightly governed by both intrinsic molecular networks and microenvironmental signals. The evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine protein kinase B (PKB, also referred to as Akt)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is universal to nearly all multicellular organisms and plays an integral role in most cellular processes. Emerging evidence has revealed a central role of the Akt-mTOR network in HSC homeostasis, because it responds to multiple intracellular and extracellular signals and regulates various downstream targets, eventually affecting several cellular processes, including the cell cycle, mitochondrial metabolism, and protein synthesis. Dysregulated Akt-mTOR signaling greatly affects HSC self-renewal, maintenance, differentiation, survival, autophagy, and aging, as well as transformation of HSCs to leukemia stem cells.

However, a low mortality rate has been reported in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Preclinical evidence suggests that tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) may have a protective role against severe COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 564 consecutive patients with CML who were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibodies at their first outpatient visit between May and early November 2020 in five hematologic centers representative of three Italian regions. RESULTS: The estimated serological prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with CML after the first pandemic wave was similar to that in the general population (about 2%), both at national and regional levels. CML patients with positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology were more frequently male (p = 0.027) and active workers (p = 0.012), while there was no significant association with TKI treatment type. Only 3 out of 11 IgG-positive patients had previously received a molecular diagnosis of COVID-19, while the remainders were asymptomatic or with mild symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm that the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with CML is generally mild and reassure about the safety of continuing TKIs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, we suggest that patients with CML succeed to mount an antibody response after exposure to SARS-CoV-2, similar to the general population.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

We developed a novel second-generation CD19-CAR (CAT19-41BB-Z) with a fast off rate, designed for more physiologic T-cell activation to reduce toxicity and improve engraftment. We describe the multicenter phase I ALLCAR19 (NCT02935257) study of autologous CAT19-41BB-Z CAR T cells (AUTO1) in relapsed or refractory (r/r) adult B-ALL. METHODS: Patients age >/= 16 years with r/r B-ALL were eligible. Primary outcomes were toxicity and manufacturing feasibility. Secondary outcomes were depth of response at 1 and 3 months, persistence of CAR-T, incidence and duration of hypogammaglobulinemia and B-cell aplasia, and event-free survival and overall survival at 1 and 2 years. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were leukapheresed, 24 products were manufactured, and 20 patients were infused with AUTO1. The median age was 41.5 years; 25% had prior blinatumomab, 50% prior inotuzumab ozogamicin, and 65% prior allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. At the time of preconditioning, 45% had >/= 50% bone marrow blasts. No patients experienced >/= grade 3 cytokine release syndrome; 3 of 20 (15%) experienced grade 3 neurotoxicity that resolved to </= grade 1 within 72 hours with steroids. Seventeen of 20 (85%) achieved minimal residual disease-negative complete response at month 1, and 3 of 17 underwent allogeneic stem-cell transplantation while in remission. The event-free survival at 6 and 12 months was 68.3% (42.4%-84.4%) and 48.3% (23.1%-69.7%), respectively. High-level expansion (Cmax 127,152 copies/microg genomic DNA) and durable CAR-T persistence were observed with B-cell aplasia ongoing in 15 of 20 patients at last follow-up. CONCLUSION: AUTO1 demonstrates a tolerable safety profile, high remission rates, and excellent persistence in r/r adult B-ALL. Preliminary data support further development of AUTO1 as a stand-alone treatment for r/r adult B-ALL.",,"['Roddie, Claire', 'Dias, Juliana', ""O'Reilly, Maeve A"", 'Abbasian, Mahnaz', 'Cadinanos-Garai, Amaia', 'Vispute, Ketki', 'Bosshard-Carter, Leticia', 'Mitsikakou, Marina', 'Mehra, Vedika', 'Roddy, Harriet', 'Hartley, John A', 'Spanswick, Victoria', 'Lowe, Helen', 'Popova, Bilyana', 'Clifton-Hadley, Laura', 'Wheeler, Graham', 'Olejnik, Joanna', 'Bloor, Adrian', 'Irvine, David', 'Wood, Leigh', 'Marzolini, Maria A V', 'Domning, Sabine', 'Farzaneh, Farzin', 'Lowdell, Mark W', 'Linch, David C', 'Pule, Martin A', 'Peggs, Karl S']","['Roddie C', 'Dias J', ""O'Reilly MA"", 'Abbasian M', 'Cadinanos-Garai A', 'Vispute K', 'Bosshard-Carter L', 'Mitsikakou M', 'Mehra V', 'Roddy H', 'Hartley JA', 'Spanswick V', 'Lowe H', 'Popova B', 'Clifton-Hadley L', 'Wheeler G', 'Olejnik J', 'Bloor A', 'Irvine D', 'Wood L', 'Marzolini MAV', 'Domning S', 'Farzaneh F', 'Lowdell MW', 'Linch DC', 'Pule MA', 'Peggs KS']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4901-5858', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6768-410X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8630-378X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3254-5991', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4550-220X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8928-9386', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9275-2415', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8347-9867']","['Cancer Institute, University College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, UCLH, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Institute, University College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Royal Free Hospital London, NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, UCLH, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Institute, University College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Institute, University College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Institute, University College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Institute, University College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Institute, University College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Institute, University College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Institute, University College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Institute, University College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'UCL Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre Good Clinical Laboratory Practice Facility, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Institute, University College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'UCL Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre Good Clinical Laboratory Practice Facility, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Institute, University College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'UCL Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre Good Clinical Laboratory Practice Facility, London, United Kingdom.', 'CRUK UCL Cancer Trials Centre, London, United Kingdom.', 'CRUK UCL Cancer Trials Centre, London, United Kingdom.', 'CRUK UCL Cancer Trials Centre, London, United Kingdom.', 'Current address: Imperial Clinical Trials Unit, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'CRUK UCL Cancer Trials Centre, London, United Kingdom.', 'The Christie Hospital, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow, Scotland.', 'Department of Haematology, UCLH, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, UCLH, London, United Kingdom.', ""King's College London, Cell and Gene Therapy - King's (CGTK), School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, The Rayne Institute, London, United Kingdom."", ""King's College London, Cell and Gene Therapy - King's (CGTK), School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, The Rayne Institute, London, United Kingdom."", 'Cancer Institute, University College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Royal Free Hospital London, NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Institute, University College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Institute, University College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Autolus Ltd, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Institute, University College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, UCLH, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['II-C3-0714-20005/DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom', 'CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']","['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,,,2021/09/01 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/08/31 17:12'],"['2021/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/31 17:12 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.21.00917 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2021 Oct 20;39(30):3352-3363. doi: 10.1200/JCO.21.00917.

It increases the risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) and bleeding and there are concerns about heart failure (HF) and central nervous system ischemic events. The magnitude of these risks remains poorly quantified. METHODS: Using linked administrative databases, we conducted a population-based cohort study of Ontario patients who were treated for CLL diagnosed between 2007 and 2019. We matched ibrutinib-treated patients with controls treated with chemotherapy but unexposed to ibrutinib on prior AF, age >/= 66 years, anticoagulant exposure, and propensity for receiving ibrutinib. Study outcomes were AF-related health care contact, hospital-diagnosed bleeding, new diagnoses of HF, and hospitalizations for stroke and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The cumulative incidence function was used to estimate absolute risks. We used cause-specific regression to study the association of ibrutinib with bleeding rates, while adjusting for anticoagulation as a time-varying covariate. RESULTS: We matched 778 pairs of ibrutinib-treated and unexposed patients with CLL (N = 1,556). The 3-year incidence of AF-related health care contact was 22.7% (95% CI, 19.0 to 26.6) in ibrutinib-treated patients and 11.7% (95% CI, 9.0 to 14.8) in controls. The 3-year risk of hospital-diagnosed bleeding was 8.8% (95% CI, 6.5 to 11.7) in ibrutinib-treated patients and 3.1% (95% CI, 1.9 to 4.6) in controls. Ibrutinib-treated patients were more likely to start anticoagulation after the index date. After adjusting for anticoagulation as a time-varying covariate, ibrutinib remained positively associated with bleeding (HR, 2.58; 95% CI, 1.76 to 3.78). The 3-year risk of HF was 7.7% (95% CI, 5.4 to 10.6%) in ibrutinib-treated patients and 3.6% (95% CI, 2.2 to 5.4) in controls. There was no significant difference in the risk of ischemic stroke or AMI.

However, several studies showed that blinatumomab has a short plasma half-life due to its low molecular weight, and thus its clinical use is limited. Furthermore, multiple trials have shown that approximately 30% of blinatumomab-relapsed cases are characterized by CD19 negative leukemic cells. Here, we design and characterize two novel antibodies, A-319 and A-2019. Blinatumomab and A-319 are CD3/CD19 bispecific antibodies with different molecular sizes and structures, and A-2019 is a novel CD3/CD19/CD20 trispecific antibody with an additional anti-CD20 function. Our in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo experiments demonstrated that A-319 and A-2019 are potent antitumor agents and capable of recruiting CD3 positive T cells, enhancing T-cell function, mediating B-cell depletion, and eventually inhibiting tumor growth in Raji xenograft models. The two molecules are complementary in terms of efficacy and specificity profile. The activity of A-319 demonstrated superior to that of A-2019, whereas A-2019 has an additional capability to target CD20 in cells missing CD19, suggesting its potential function against CD19 weak or negative CD20 positive leukemic cells.",['(c) 2021.

Professor Waclaw Szybalski was the first one to perform a stable gene transfer in eukaryotic cells. To do so, he used his own designed system consisting of HPRT-deficient cells and HAT selective medium. Moreover, the first-ever hybridoma cells were also constructed by Waclaw Szybalski's team. These spectacular achievements made him not only a forerunner of gene therapy, but also became a foundation for immunotherapy, as hybridoma and their selection by the HPRT-HAT system turned into a crucial technical step during production of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Herein, we present a story of anti-CD20 mAbs, one of the most successful lines of anticancer drugs. When looking back into history, the prototypic mAb rituximab was considered the biggest step forward in the therapy of B-cell malignancies.

The proposed mechanism of AZA and DAC relies on active DNA replication and therefore patient responses are only observed after multiple cycles of treatment. Although extended dosing may provide the optimal scheduling, the reliance of injectable formulation of the drug limits it to intermittent treatment. Recently, an oral formulation of AZA demonstrated significantly improved patient relapse free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) when used as maintenance after chemotherapy for AML. In addition, both DAC and AZA were found to be highly effective to improve survival in elderly patients with AML through combination with other drugs.

Current prognostic tools only partially address this clinical heterogeneity. Limited data compiling both molecular and cytogenetic information have been used in risk prognostication in WM. To investigate the clinical impact of genetic alterations in WM, we evaluated cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities by chromosome banding analyses, FISH and targeted NGS in a retrospective cohort of 239 WM patients, including 187 patients treated by first-line chemotherapy or immunochemotherapy. Most frequent mutations were identified in MYD88 (93%), CXCR4 (29%), MLL2 (11%), ARID1A (8%), TP53 (8%), CD79A/B (6%), TBL1XR1 (4%) and SPI1 (4%). The median number of cytogenetic abnormalities was two (range, 0-22). Main cytogenetic abnormalities were 6q deletion (del6q) (27%), trisomy 4 (tri4) (12%), tri18 (11%), del13q (11%), tri12 (7.5%) and del17p (7%). Complex karyotype (CK) was observed in 15% (n = 31) of cases, including 5% (n = 12) of highly CK (high-CK). TP53 abnormalities (TP53abn) were present in 15% of evaluable patients. TP53abn and del6q were associated with CK/high-CK (p < .05). Fifty-three percent of patients with hyperviscosity harbored CXCR4 mutations. Cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities did not significantly impact time to first treatment and response to therapy. Prognostic factors associated with shorter PFS were del6q (p = .01), TP53abn (p = .002) and high-CK (p = .01).

Because the patient population is heterogenous and advanced in age, choosing the optimal therapy can be challenging. There is strong evidence supporting antileukemic therapy, including standard intensive induction chemotherapy (IC) and non-intensive chemotherapy (NIC), for older patients with AML, and guidelines recommend treatment selection based on a patient's individual and disease characteristics as opposed to age alone. Nonetheless, historic evidence indicates that a high proportion of patients who may be candidates for NIC receive no active antileukemic treatment (NAAT), instead receiving only best supportive care (BSC). We conducted a focused literature review to assess current real-world patterns of undertreatment in AML. From a total of 25 identified studies reporting the proportion of patients with AML receiving NAAT, the proportion of patients treated with NAAT varied widely, ranging from 10 to 61.4% in the US and 24.1 to 35% in Europe. Characteristics associated with receipt of NAAT included clinical factors such as age, poor performance status, comorbidities, and uncontrolled concomitant conditions, as well as sociodemographic factors such as female sex, unmarried status, and lower income. Survival was diminished among patients receiving NAAT, with reported median overall survival values ranging from 1.2 to 4.8 months compared to 5 to 14.4 months with NIC. These findings suggest a proportion of patients who are candidates for NIC receive NAAT, potentially forfeiting the survival benefit of active antileukemic treatment.",['(c) 2021.

We conducted a Japanese nationwide, retrospective study to investigate this issue. This study included 914 ATL patients who underwent allo-HCT between 1995 and 2015. In patients aged 55 years or younger, there was no statistically significant difference between reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens and myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimens regarding risk of relapse (vs. RIC group: MAC group, hazard ratio (HR) 0.76, P = 0.071), non-relapse mortality (vs. RIC group: MAC group, HR 1.38, P = 0.115), or overall mortality (vs. RIC group: MAC group, HR 1.17, P = 0.255). Among RIC regimens, fludarabine plus melphalan-based (Flu/Mel) regimens were associated with a lower risk of relapse (Flu/Mel140 group, HR 0.59, P < 0.001; Flu/Mel80 group, HR 0.79, P = 0.021) than the Flu plus busulfan-based regimen (Flu/Bu2 group). Meanwhile, Flu/Mel140 group had a significantly higher risk of non-relapse mortality (vs. Flu/Bu2 group: HR 1.53, P = 0.025). In conclusion, it is acceptable to select a RIC regimen for younger patients. Moreover, it might be beneficial to select a Flu/Mel-based regimen for patients at high risk of relapse.","['(c) 2021.

However, in recent studies, they have begun to emerge as crucial regulators of cell homeostasis. They are at the crossroads of catabolic and anabolic pathways and are intricately involved in cellular trafficking, nutrient signaling, energy metabolism, and immune regulation. Their involvement in such essential cellular functions has renewed clinical interest in targeting the lysosome as a novel way to treat disease, particularly cancer. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive blood cancer with a low survival probability, particularly in older patients. The genomic landscape of AML has been extensively characterized but few targeted therapies (with the exception of differentiation therapy) can achieve a long-term cure. Therefore, there is an unmet need for less intensive and more tolerable therapeutic interventions. In this review, we will give an overview on the myriad of functions performed by lysosomes and their importance in malignant disease. Furthermore, we will discuss their relevance in hematopoietic cells and different ways to potentially target them in AML.",['(c) 2021.

Here, we report that the epigenetic factor, Ten-Eleven Translocation 3 (TET3) dioxygenase is overexpressed in AML patients and functionally validated human leukemic stem cells (LSCs), is required for leukemic growth by virtue of its regulation of glucose metabolism in AML cells. In human AML cells, TET3 maintains 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) epigenetic marks and expression of early myeloid progenitor program, critical glucose metabolism and STAT5A signaling pathway genes, which also positively correlate with TET3 expression in AML patients. Consequently, TET3 depletion impedes hexokinase activity and L-Lactate production in AML cells. Conversely, overexpression of TET3 in healthy human hematopoietic stem progenitors (HSPCs) upregulates the expression of glucose metabolism, STAT5A signaling and AML associated genes, and impairs normal HSPC lineage differentiation in vitro. Finally, TET3 depletion renders AML cells highly sensitive to blockage of the TET3 downstream pathways glycolysis and STAT5 signaling via the combination of 2-Deoxy-D-glucose and STAT5 inhibitor which preferentially targets AML cells but spares healthy CD34(+) HSPCs.","['(c) 2021.

Methods: A Korean nationwide cohort of 3,809 adults with acute leukemia treated with alloSCT between January 2002 and December 2018 was analyzed as the development cohort. A retrospective cohort comprising 313 consecutive adults with acute leukemia who underwent alloSCT between January 2019 and April 2020 was analyzed as the validation cohort. Results: In the development cohort, advanced age, male sex, and comorbidities such as previous non-hematologic malignancy, hypertension, and coronary or cerebral vascular disease were significantly related to poor OS. Subsequently, a new comorbidity scoring system was developed, and risk groups were created, which included the low-risk (score </=0.17), intermediate-risk (0.17< score </=0.4), high-risk (0.4< score </=0.55), and very high-risk (score 0.55) groups. The 1-year OS rates were discriminatively estimated at 73.5%, 66.2%, 61.9%, and 50.9% in the low-risk, intermediate-risk, high-risk, and very high-risk groups in the development cohort, respectively (P <0.001). The developed scoring system yielded discriminatively different 1-year OS rates and 1-year incidence of non-relapse mortality according to the risk group (P =0.085 and P=0.018, respectively). Furthermore, the developed model showed an acceptable performance for predicting 1-year non-relapse mortality with an area under the curve of 0.715. Conclusion: The newly developed predictive scoring system could be a simple and reliable tool helping clinicians to assess risk of alloSCT in adults with acute leukemia.",,"['Park, Sung-Soo', 'Kim, Hee-Je', 'Kim, Tong Yoon', 'Lee, Joon Yeop', 'Lee, Jong Hyuk', 'Min, Gi June', 'Park, Silvia', 'Yoon, Jae-Ho', 'Lee, Sung-Eun', 'Cho, Byung-Sik', 'Eom, Ki-Seong', 'Kim, Yoo-Jin', 'Lee, Seok', 'Kim, Dong-Wook']","['Park SS', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim TY', 'Lee JY', 'Lee JH', 'Min GJ', 'Park S', 'Yoon JH', 'Lee SE', 'Cho BS', 'Eom KS', 'Kim YJ', 'Lee S', 'Kim DW']",,"[""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Korea (South),Blood Res,Blood research,101605247,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'Allogeneic', 'Comorbidity', 'Score', 'Stem cell', 'Transplantation']",2021/09/01 06:00,2021/09/01 06:01,['2021/08/31 05:57'],"['2021/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/14 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/01 06:01 [medline]', '2021/08/31 05:57 [entrez]']","['br.2021.2021107 [pii]', '10.5045/br.2021.2021107 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Res. 2021 Sep 30;56(3):184-196. doi: 10.5045/br.2021.2021107.,,,,,PMC8478627,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, whether this monitoring can replace conventional risk factors in determining whether patients need allogeneic stem cell transplantation is still unclear. This study aimed to determine the impact of BCR-ABL1 monitoring on the outcome of patients with BCR-ABL1-positive ALL after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the survival outcome of patients with BCR-ABL1-positive ALL based on the quantification of BCR-ABL1 at 3 timepoints: the end of induction (timepoint 1), post-consolidation week 16 (timepoint 2), and the end of treatment for patients who were either transplant-eligible or non-transplant eligible (timepoint 3). Results: From 2006 to 2018, a total of 96 patients newly diagnosed with BCR-ABL1-positive ALL were treated with chemotherapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Thirty-eight (41.3%) patients achieved complete remission, and 33 patients underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Our data showed that pre-transplant MRD monitoring by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction had the highest correlation with survival in patients with BCR-ABL1-positive ALL, especially for those who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

RESULTS: Compared with dn-APL, s-APL werecharacterized by older median age, and a higher early mortality rate. Multivariate Cox model showed s-APL, older age, earlier year of diagnosis, and male gender were independently associated with worse survival. Notably, s-APL had a significantly inferior survival regardless of gender, race, marital status, and year of diagnosis. However, the difference between the 2 cohorts was only evident in younger patients (</= 65 years) but was lost in older patients (> 65 years). Additionally, the majority of index cancer type was breast and prostate in female and male s-APL, respectively.

Here, we report our experience of patients with CML treated at a single center who did not achieve a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) at 24 months. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 305 patients who were diagnosed with CML at the University of Michigan between 2001 and 2014 and were treated with TKIs. We assessed rates of CCyR at 24 months correlated to clinical outcomes. RESULTS: The majority of patients (79%) achieved CCyR at 24 months and were classified as responders. At a median follow-up of 8.1 years from TKI initiation, overall survival among responders was significantly greater than nonresponders (93% vs. 85%, P < .001). Progression to blast phase was more common in nonresponders (1.9% vs. 10.4%, P = .004). However, 34% of nonresponders (at 24 months) went on to achieve CCyR with continued TKI therapy. CONCLUSION: Here, we re-demonstrate the importance of early CCyR in predicting survival and prevention of progression to blast phase. In addition, late CCyR appears to have prognostic implications, and continued TKI therapy with the goal of achieving a later CCyR may be a reasonable strategy in patients with limited alternate treatment options.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

Recurrent somatic BCOR mutations have been identified in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). However, the clinical impact of BCOR mutations on MDS prognosis is controversial and the response of hypomethylating agents in MDS with BCOR mutations (BCOR(MUT)) remains unknown. RESULTS: Among 676 MDS patients, 43 patients (6.4%) harbored BCOR mutations. A higher frequency of BCOR mutations (8.7%) was investigated in patients with normal chromosome, compared to 4.2% in patients with abnormal karyotype (p = 0.040). Compared to the BCOR(WT) patients, the BCOR(MUT) patients showed a higher ratio of refractory anemia with excess blasts subset (p = 0.008). The most common comutations with BCOR genes were ASXL1 (p = 0.002), DNMT3A (p = 0.114) and TET2 (p = 0.148). When the hierarchy of somatic mutations was analyzed, BCOR mutations were below the known initial mutations (ASXL1 or TET2) but were above U2AF1 mutations. Transformation-free survival was significantly shorter in BCOR(MUT) patients than that in BCOR(WT) patients (16 vs. 35 months; p = 0.035). RNA-sequencing was performed in bone marrow mononuclear cells from BCOR(MUT) and BCOR(WT) patients and revealed 2030 upregulated and 772 downregulated genes. Importantly, HOXA6, HOXB7, and HOXB9 were significantly over-expressed in BCOR(MUT) patients, compared to BCOR(WT) patients. Eight of 14 BCOR(MUT) patients (57.1%) achieved complete remission (CR) with decitabine treatment, which was much higher than that in BCOR(WT) patients (28.7%, p = 0.036). Paired sequencing results (before and after decitabine) showed three of 6 CR patients lost the mutated BCOR. The median survival of CR patients with a BCOR(MUT) was 40 months, which was significantly longer than that in patients with BCOR(WT) (20 months, p = 0.036). Notably, prolonged survival was observed in three BCOR(MUT) CR patients even without any subsequent therapies. CONCLUSIONS: BCOR mutations occur more frequently in CN MDS patients, predicting higher risk of leukemia transformation. BCOR(MUT) patients showed a better response to decitabine and achieved longer post-CR survival.",['(c) 2021.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prompted us to explore our real-life data on a retrospective cohort of 45 older APL patients (>/= 70 years) consecutively diagnosed at eight different hematologic institutions in Latium, Italy, from July 1991 to May 2019. RESULTS: Two patients (4.4%) died from early hemorrhagic complications before treatment could begin. Twenty-two patients (51.1%) (Group A) were enrolled or treated according to standard clinical protocols, while 21 (48.8%) (Group B) received an ATRA-based personalized approach due to poor performance status. Morphologic complete remission (CR) after induction therapy was achieved in 33 patients (76.7%) with 100% of patients in Group A and 52.3% in Group B (p < 0.001). Molecular CR was documented in 30 patients (69.7%) [20/22 (90.9%) in Group A and 10/21 (47.6%) in Group B (p = 0.002)]. Ten patients (23.2%) died during induction therapy, all in Group B. Five-year overall survival (OS) of the entire cohort was 46.1% (95% CI 28.2-64.0), with 72.6% (95% CI 42.9-100) in Group A vs. 27.2% (95% CI 7.5-46.9) in the Group B (p = 0.001).

The addition of rituximab to intensive chemotherapy in CD20+ ALL has led to improved outcomes in several studies. However, there is no clear evidence regarding the optimal number of doses and its benefit without an allogeneic stem cell transplant. Achieving measurable residual disease (MRD)-negative status postinduction would reduce the requirement for a transplant. Novel approaches are needed to induce a higher proportion of MRD-negative complete remission in patients with high-risk ALL. Given bortezomib's activity in relapsed ALL and its synergism with rituximab in B-cell lymphomas, the addition of bortezomib to rituximab and chemotherapy may provide an incremental benefit in CD20+ precursor B-ALL. We conducted a phase 2 study to test the activity of bortezomib and rituximab in combination with a pediatric-inspired regimen during induction therapy in newly diagnosed adolescents and adults (aged >14 years) with CD20+, Philadelphia-negative precursor B-ALL; bone marrow MRD negativity at the end of induction was the primary end point. From December 2017 through August 2019, a total of 35 patients were enrolled. End-of-induction MRD-negative status was achieved in 70.9% of patients, as opposed to 51.7% in the historical cohort treated with chemotherapy alone. MRD-negative rates improved to 87.5% post-consolidation. At a median follow-up of 21 months, event-free survival and overall survival rates were 78.8% (95% confidence interval, 66-94) and 78.7% (95% confidence interval, 65.8-94), respectively. There was no significant increase in toxicity with bortezomib and rituximab compared with the historical cohort. The incidence of neuropathy was 26% (all less than grade 3). The combination of bortezomib, rituximab, and a pediatric-inspired ALL regimen was active and well tolerated in de novo CD20+ Philadelphia-negative precursor B-ALL.

Most reports comparing haplo-HSCT with posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) and other donor sources have focused on outcomes in older adults treated with reduced intensity conditioning. Therefore, in the current study, we evaluated outcomes in patients with hematological malignancy treated with myeloablative conditioning prior to haplo- (n = 375) or umbilical cord blood (UCB; n = 333) HSCT. All haplo recipients received a 4 of 8 HLA-matched graft, whereas recipients of UCB were matched at 6-8/8 (n = 145) or </=5/8 (n = 188) HLA antigens. Recipients of 6-8/8 UCB transplants were younger (14 years vs 21 and 29 years) and more likely to have lower comorbidity scores compared with recipients of </=5/8 UCB and haplo-HSCT (81% vs 69% and 63%, respectively). UCB recipients were more likely to have acute lymphoblastic leukemia and transplanted in second complete remission (CR), whereas haplo-HSCT recipients were more likely to have acute myeloid leukemia in the first CR. Other characteristics, including cytogenetic risk, were similar. Survival at 3 years was similar for the donor sources (66% haplo- and 61% after </=5/8 and 58% after 6-8/8 UCB). Notably, relapse at 3 years was lower in recipients of </=5/8 UCB (21%, P = .03) compared with haplo- (36%) and 6-8/8 UCB (30%). However, nonrelapse mortality was higher in </=5/8 UCB (21%) compared with other groups (P < .0001).

Dynamic changes to the epigenome are essential regulators of B-cell differentiation. Therefore, we reasoned that these distinct cancers may be driven by shared mechanisms of disruption in transcriptional circuitry. METHODS: We compared purified malignant B-cells from 52 patients with normal B-cell subsets (germinal center centrocytes and centroblasts, naive and memory B-cells) from 36 donor tonsils using >325 high-resolution molecular profiling assays for histone modifications, open chromatin (ChIP-, FAIRE-seq), transcriptome (RNA-seq), transcription factor (TF) binding, and genome copy number (microarrays). FINDINGS: From the resulting data, we identified gains in active chromatin in enhancers/super-enhancers that likely promote unchecked B-cell receptor signaling, including one we validated near the immunoglobulin superfamily receptors FCMR and PIGR. More striking and pervasive was the profound loss of key B-cell identity TFs, tumor suppressors and their super-enhancers, including EBF1, OCT2(POU2F2), and RUNX3. Using a novel approach to identify transcriptional feedback, we showed that these core transcriptional circuitries are self-regulating. Their selective gain and loss form a complex, iterative, and interactive process that likely curbs B-cell maturation and spurs proliferation. INTERPRETATION: Our study is the first to map the transcriptional circuitry of the most common blood cancers. We demonstrate that a critical subset of B-cell TFs and their cognate enhancers form self-regulatory transcriptional feedback loops whose disruption is a shared mechanism underlying these diverse subtypes of B-cell lymphoma.

Commercial enzymes (EcASNase2) cause adverse reactions during treatment, such as immunogenicity. A human enzyme could be a non-immunogenic substitute. However, no candidate was found showing efficient kinetic properties. HASNase1 is an l-asparaginase that comes from the N-terminal domain of a protein called 60 kDa-lysophospholipase and its 3D structure has not been resolved. HASNase1 is homologous to EcASNase1 and gpASNase1, and this last one has shown efficient kinetic properties. Homology modeling was used to find the 3D structure of hASNase1, so one could submit it to Molecular Dynamics (MD), in order to understand structural differences that lead to different catalytic efficiency compared to EcASNase2 and gpASNase1. The interaction potential between L-Asn and active site residues showed that the substrate can rotate in the site when Region1 is open. Region1 residues sequence favors deformations and movements as shown in MD. Region2-A is linear in gpASNase1, and it features a helix portion in hASNase1, which leaves the Tyr308 position projected to the active site ratifying its role in catalytic efficiency. Analysis of Lys188 orientation and movement showed the effect of positive cooperativity in hASNase1.

OBJECTIVE: This narrative review discusses complications associated with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy for emergency clinicians. DISCUSSION: Novel immune-based cancer therapies including CAR T-cell therapy have improved the care of patients with malignancy, primarily lymphoma and leukemia. However, severe complications may arise, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). CRS is associated with excessive cytokine release that results in severe end organ injury. Patients present with fever and a range of symptoms based on the affected organs. Grading is determined by the need for cardiopulmonary intervention, while management focuses on resuscitation, evaluation for other concomitant conditions, and treatment with tocilizumab or steroids. ICANS is also associated with cytokine release, causing patients to present with a variety of neurologic features. A grading system is available for ICANS based on feature severity. Management is supportive with steroids. Other complications of CAR T-cell therapy include infusion reactions, hypogammaglobulinemia, tumor lysis syndrome, cytopenias, cardiac toxicity, and graft-versus-host disease. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of this novel cancer therapy class and the potential complications can improve the care of these patients in the emergency department setting.",['Published by Elsevier Inc.'],"['Long, Brit', 'Yoo, Michael J', 'Brady, William J', 'Holian, Angela', 'Sudhir, Amita', 'Gottlieb, Michael']","['Long B', 'Yoo MJ', 'Brady WJ', 'Holian A', 'Sudhir A', 'Gottlieb M']",,"['Department of Emergency Medicine, Brooke Army Medical Center, TX, United States of America.

We evaluated the potential of ponatinib and PI3K/mTOR dual-inhibitor VS-5584 combination (PoVS) therapy to increase the anti-leukemic effects of ponatinib and investigated the underlying mechanisms at the molecular level. We measured the cytotoxicities of ponatinib, VS-5584, and PoVS (CCK-8 assay), and used the median-effect equation for combination analyses. We investigated the effects of inhibitory concentrations on apoptosis, cell viability and cell-cycle regulation (flow cytometry), protein levels (ELISA, Western blot), transcriptional activities (dual-luciferase reporter assay), gene expressions (qRT-PCR). VS-5584 exerted selective cytotoxic effects against CML and LSC cell lines. VS-5584 inhibited the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, resulting in reduced cell viability, slightly induced caspase-independent apoptosis, prominent G0/G1 cell-cycle blockade that is not a consequence of quiescence. Normal hematopoietic stem cell line was the least affected. Moreover, ponatinib and VS-5584 mediated synergistic anti-leukemic effects on leukemic cells. VS-5584 reduced the ponatinib dose required to target leukemic cells. PoVS treatment inhibited PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway more consistently than either of the two agents alone through reducing p-Akt, p-mTOR, p-S6K, p-PRAS40, p-S6. The subsequent downstream effects were an increase in C/EBP transcriptional activity and decreases in activities of E2F/DP1, Myc/Max, CREB, STAT3, NFkappaB, AP-1, Elk-1/SRF. Transcriptional regulation resulted in alterations in the expression levels of target mRNAs. Our results highlight PoVS can be a promising treatment strategy for eliminating CML cells and LSCs selectively, with the reduced ponatinib doses.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Coping has been shown to mediate palliative care interventions in advanced cancer; the mechanisms by which improvements occur among patients with AML remain unexplained. METHODS: The authors conducted a secondary analysis of data from a multisite randomized trial of integrated palliative and oncology care (IPC; n = 86) versus usual care (n = 74) for hospitalized patients with AML undergoing intensive chemotherapy. IPC patients met with palliative care at least twice weekly during their initial and subsequent hospitalizations. Patients completed the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Leukemia, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced Inventory to assess QOL, mood, and coping at the baseline and at weeks 2, 4, 12, and 24. Linear regression models were used to assess the effect of IPC on coping. Causal mediation regression models were used to examine whether changes in coping mediated intervention effects on patient-reported outcomes at week 2. RESULTS: One hundred sixty eligible patients (68.1%) were enrolled. Those randomized to IPC reported improvements in approach-oriented coping (P < .01) and reductions in avoidant coping (P < .05). These changes in coping mediated the intervention effects on QOL (95% CI, 2.14-13.63), depression (95% CI, -2.05 to -0.27), and anxiety symptoms (95% CI, -1.25 to -0.04). Changes in approach-oriented and avoidant coping accounted for 78% of the total palliative care intervention effect on QOL, for 66% of the effect on depression, and for 35% of the effect on anxiety symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Palliative care integrated during intensive chemotherapy for patients with AML facilitates coping strategy use. Improvement in coping skills accounts for a substantial proportion of the effect from a palliative care intervention on patient-reported outcomes.",['(c) 2021 American Cancer Society.'],"['Nelson, Ashley M', 'Amonoo, Hermioni L', 'Kavanaugh, Alison R', 'Webb, Jason A', 'Jackson, Vicki A', 'Rice, Julia', 'Lavoie, Mitchell W', 'Fathi, Amir T', 'Brunner, Andrew M', 'Greer, Joseph A', 'Temel, Jennifer S', 'El-Jawahri, Areej', 'LeBlanc, Thomas W']","['Nelson AM', 'Amonoo HL', 'Kavanaugh AR', 'Webb JA', 'Jackson VA', 'Rice J', 'Lavoie MW', 'Fathi AT', 'Brunner AM', 'Greer JA', 'Temel JS', 'El-Jawahri A', 'LeBlanc TW']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1742-3280', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9136-9644', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4048-9499', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4907-6447', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2169-4115', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0979-4076', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7268-5921', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3556-1495', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0546-7895']","['Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina.', 'Oregon Health and Sciences University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina.']",['eng'],"['T32 CA092203/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA092203/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'coping', 'distress', 'palliative care intervention', 'quality of life']",2021/08/31 06:00,2021/08/31 06:00,['2021/08/30 17:23'],"['2021/08/06 00:00 [revised]', '2021/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/12/15 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/31 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/30 17:23 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.33886 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2021 Dec 15;127(24):4702-4710. doi: 10.1002/cncr.33886.

In more than 60% of cases of this heterogeneous disease, a genetic marker is identified via cytogenetic or molecular analyses. TCF3 gene fusions occur in 5%-11% of ALL patients. In < 1%, the TCF3 alteration in ALL leads to a TCF3-HLF fusion gene. Even though this is a very rare event, the detection of a TCF3-HLF fusion gene is associated with a very poor prognosis with incurable relapses in almost all patients. The frequent TCF3-PBX1 fusion gene, which is detectable in 5%-10% of childhood B-cell precursor ALLs and ~3.8% of adult B-cell precursor ALLs, is associated with a rather good prognosis, that is, an observed event-free 5-year survival of approximately 85%. Thus, the distinction of the different partner genes fused to TCF3 is essential for risk assessment. To verify RNA sequencing as a tool for detection of known and unknown fusion genes, we screened 200 cases of pediatric B-cell precursor ALL with ""targeted"" RNA sequencing in a pilot project in comparison to classical cytogenetic analyses (chromosome R-banding analysis), fluorescence in situ hybridization, and PCR. We observed a TCF3 fusion gene in 6.5% (13/200) of the patients. Ten (5%) patients displayed a TCF3-PBX1 fusion gene, two (1%) patients a TCF3-FLI1 fusion gene, and one (0.5%) patient a TCF3-HLF fusion gene. For the TCF3 fusions, we obtained discrepant results with the different methods, which are described in the article.

Despite the relevance for leukemogenesis and as a potential therapeutic target, the prognostic role is controversial. To investigate the prognostic impact of PTPN11 mutations, we analyzed 1529 adult AML patients using next-generation sequencing. PTPN11 mutations were detected in 106 of 1529 (6.93%) patients (median VAF: 24%) in dominant (36%) and subclonal (64%) configuration. Patients with PTPN11 mutations were associated with concomitant mutations in NPM1 (63%), DNMT3A (37%), and NRAS (21%) and had a higher rate of European LeukemiaNet (ELN) favorable cytogenetics (57.8% vs 39.1%; P < .001) and higher white blood cell counts (P = .007) compared with PTPN11 wild-type patients. In a multivariable analysis, PTPN11 mutations were independently associated with poor overall survival (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.75; P < .001), relapse-free survival (HR: 1.52; P = .013), and a lower rate of complete remission (odds ratio: 0.46; P = .008). Importantly, the deleterious effect of PTPN11 mutations was confined predominantly to the ELN favorable-risk group and patients with subclonal PTPN11 mutations (HR: 2.28; P < .001) but not found with dominant PTPN11 mutations (HR: 1.07; P = .775), presumably because of significant differences within the rate and spectrum of associated comutations. In conclusion, our data suggest an overall poor prognostic impact of PTPN11 mutations in AML, which is significantly modified by the underlying cytogenetics and the clonal context in which they occur.",['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Stasik, Sebastian', 'Eckardt, Jan-Niklas', 'Kramer, Michael', 'Rollig, Christoph', 'Kramer, Alwin', 'Scholl, Sebastian', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Crysandt, Martina', 'Brummendorf, Tim H', 'Naumann, Ralph', 'Steffen, Bjorn', 'Kunzmann, Volker', 'Einsele, Hermann', 'Schaich, Markus', 'Burchert, Andreas', 'Neubauer, Andreas', 'Schafer-Eckart, Kerstin', 'Schliemann, Christoph', 'Krause, Stefan', 'Herbst, Regina', 'Hanel, Mathias', 'Frickhofen, Norbert', 'Noppeney, Richard', 'Kaiser, Ulrich', 'Baldus, Claudia D', 'Kaufmann, Martin', 'Racil, Zdenek', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Mayer, Jiri', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Schetelig, Johannes', 'Middeke, Jan M', 'Thiede, Christian']","['Stasik S', 'Eckardt JN', 'Kramer M', 'Rollig C', 'Kramer A', 'Scholl S', 'Hochhaus A', 'Crysandt M', 'Brummendorf TH', 'Naumann R', 'Steffen B', 'Kunzmann V', 'Einsele H', 'Schaich M', 'Burchert A', 'Neubauer A', 'Schafer-Eckart K', 'Schliemann C', 'Krause S', 'Herbst R', 'Hanel M', 'Frickhofen N', 'Noppeney R', 'Kaiser U', 'Baldus CD', 'Kaufmann M', 'Racil Z', 'Platzbecker U', 'Berdel WE', 'Mayer J', 'Serve H', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Ehninger G', 'Bornhauser M', 'Schetelig J', 'Middeke JM', 'Thiede C']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0271-4894', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3649-2823', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3791-0548', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7606-8760', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5259-4651', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3030-6567', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8472-5516']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik V, Universitatsklinikum Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie, Hamostasiologie und Stammzelltransplantation , Uniklinik RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie, Hamostasiologie und Stammzelltransplantation , Uniklinik RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik III, St. Marien-Krankenhaus Siegen, Siegen, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik II, Universitatsklinikum Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik II, Universitatsklinikum Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik II, Universitatsklinikum Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie und Palliativmedizin, Rems-Murr-Klinikum Winnenden, Winnenden, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie, Immunologie, Philipps Universitat Marburg, Marburg, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie, Immunologie, Philipps Universitat Marburg, Marburg, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin V, Paracelsus Medizinische Privatuniversitat, Klinikum Nurnberg Nord, Nurnberg, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik A, Universitatsklinikum Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik V, Paracelsus Medizinische Privatuniversitat, Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik III, Klinikum Chemnitz, Chemnitz, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik III, Klinikum Chemnitz, Chemnitz, Germany.', 'Innere Medizin III, HSK Wiesbaden, Wiesbaden, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Hamatologie, Universitatsklinikum Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik II, St. Bernward Krankenhaus, Hildesheim, Germany.', 'Hamatologie und Onkologie, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Abteilung fur Hamatologie, Onkologie und Palliativmedizin, Robert-Bosch-Krankenhaus, Stuttgart, Germany.', 'Masaryk University and University Hospital, Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Hamatologie und Zelltherapie, Universitatsklinikum Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik A, Universitatsklinikum Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Masaryk University and University Hospital, Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Medizinische Klinik II, Universitatsklinikum Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik V, Universitatsklinikum Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany.', 'National Center for Tumor Diseases, Dresden, Germany;

Therefore, immunotherapies aimed at reprogramming the immune system have largely spread in the past years. We employed gene transfer into hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to selectively express anti-tumoral cytokines in tumor-infiltrating monocytes/macrophages. We show that interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) reduced tumor progression in mouse models of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and colorectal carcinoma (MC38). Its activity depended on the immune system's capacity to respond to IFN-gamma and drove the counter-selection of leukemia cells expressing surrogate antigens. Gene-based IFN-gamma delivery induced antigen presentation in the myeloid compartment and on leukemia cells, leading to a wave of T cell recruitment and activation, with enhanced clonal expansion of cytotoxic CD8(+) T lymphocytes. The activity of IFN-gamma was further enhanced by either co-delivery of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) or by drugs blocking immunosuppressive escape pathways, with the potential to obtain durable responses.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

However, the clinical implications of this subtype remain unknown. We describe a 63-year-old patient belonging to this distinct AML subtype, who presented similar features of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) including nuclear morphology, negative for CD34 and HLA-DR, and abnormal coagulation. He had no response to both arsenic trioxide and CAG regimen (cytarabine, aclarubicin, and G-CSF). Given that the patient carried the FLT3-ITD mutation, we switched to a pilot treatment of FLT3 inhibitor sorafenib combined with low-dose cytarabine (LDAC). To date, the patient achieved durable complete remission over 58 months. These findings suggest that AML with cup-like blasts and FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations mimic APL, and the prognosis of this subtype may be improved by sorafenib combined with LDAC.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s).

MiRs are a class of short noncoding RNAs. Dysregulation in the expression of miRs plays a crucial role in different types of cancers. Vincristine is an antineoplastic drug with a broad spectrum of activity against different hematologic malignancies and is the first-line treatment for B-ALL. Previous studies have proposed miR-17 and miR-181/b as oncomirs and miR-34/a as a tumor suppressor in Nalm6 cells, thus in the current study, we investigated the effects of vincristine treatment on the expression of miR-17, miR-34/a and miR-181/b expression levels. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay was conducted to estimate the optimal concentration of vincristine in the Nalm-6 cell line. Expression of miRs was calculated using real-time PCR. Our results showed significant downregulation of miR-17 (FC = 0.226; P < 0.0004) in Nalm6 cells after vincristine treatment. Conversely, miR-34/a (FC = 4.823; P < 0.0001) was significantly upregulated. Also, the expression of miR-181/b (FC = 0.156; P < 0.3465) was not significantly different between the vincristine treated group and the control group. In conclusion, it is proposed that one of the mechanisms by which vincristine improves B-ALL is by modulating the expression of specific miRs. These specific miRs will serve as good diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The expressions of miR-143-3p and KAT6A in AML samples and cell lines were detected by RT-qPCR assay. CCK-8 and flow cytometry were performed to evaluate the role of KAT6A in viability of AML cells. EdU assay was performed to determine the effects of KAT6A on proliferation of AML cells. Western blot analysis was utilized to assess the impacts of KAT6A on proliferation-related protein expressions of AML cells. ELISA assay was adopted to illustrate the influence of KAT6A on inflammatory responses of AML cells. In addition, the relationship between KAT6A and miR-143-3p was predicted by ENCORI and miRWalk, and confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Moreover, the effects of KAT6A on the proliferation of AML cells mediated with miR-143-3p were carried out by rescue experiment. The expression of KAT6A was significantly upregulated, while miR-134-4p was downregulated both in the AML tissues and in AML cell lines. In addition, the silence of KAT6A significantly inhibited the viability of AML cells. Besides, KAT6A silencing notably suppressed the proliferation of AML cells and reduced the protein expressions of Ki-67 and PCNA. Knockdown of KAT6A notably decreased the expression levels of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and IL-6, and increased the expression levels of TGF-beta and IL-10. Moreover, overexpression of miR-143-3p repressed viability and proliferation of AML cells and overexpression of KAT6A partially reversed the inhibitory effects of miR-143-3p mimic on viability and proliferation of AML cells. miR-143-3p/KAT6A played an essential role in the viability and proliferation of AML cells.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s).

But MBNL1 plays a promoting role in cervical cancer, is contradictory in colorectal cancer, It promotes colorectal cancer cell proliferation, On the other hand, it inhibits its metastasis, so it is an important physiological marker in many cancers. When we integrated the role of MBNL1 protein in various tumors, we found that its antisense RNA, MBNL1-AS1, had a good inhibitory effect in several colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and gastric cancer. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the expression of MBNL1 and MBNL1-AS1 in various tumors, and to search for their physiological markers. METHODS: It was searched by the PUMUB system and summarized its expression in various cancers. RESULTS: MBNL1 was down-regulated, leukemia, breast cancer, glioblastoma, gastric cancer, overall survival rate, recurrence, metastasis increased. While the metastasis of colon cancer decreased, proliferation was promoted, and the effect of both was promoted for cervical cancer.MBNL1-AS1 was down-regulated, and the overall survival rate, recurrence, and metastasis of lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and bladder cancer increased. CONCLUSION: MBNL1 may be an important regulator of cancer, and MBNL1-AS1 is a better tumor suppressor.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Zhang, Qi', 'Wu, Yinxin', 'Chen, Jinlan', 'Cai, Yuxuan', 'Wang, Bei', 'Tan, Fangshun', 'Mou, Jie', 'Yuan, Chengfu']","['Zhang Q', 'Wu Y', 'Chen J', 'Cai Y', 'Wang B', 'Tan F', 'Mou J', 'Yuan C']",,"['College of Medical Science, China Three Gorges University, Yichang 443002.

Autophagy is a housekeeping pathway that maintains cell homeostasis against stress by recycling macromolecules and organelles and plays an important role in cell differentiation. In the present study, an experimental model was established to investigate the involvement of autophagy in the megakaryocyte differentiation of human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells induced by diosgenin [also known as (25R)Spirosten5en3bol]. It was demonstrated that Atg7 expression was upregulated from day 1 of diosgenininduced differentiation and was accompanied by a significant elevation in the conversion of light chain 3 A/B (LC3A/B)I to LC3A/BII. Autophagy was modulated before or after the induction of megakaryocyte differentiation using 3methyladenine (3MA, autophagy inhibitor) and metformin (Met, autophagy initiation activator). 3MA induced a significant accumulation of the LC3 A/BII form at day 8 of differentiation. It was revealed that 3MA had a significant repressive effect on the nuclear (polyploidization) and membrane glycoprotein V [(GpV) expression] maturation. On the other hand, autophagy activation increased GpV genomic expression, but did not change the nuclear maturation profile after HEL cells treatment with Met. It was concluded that autophagy inhibition had a more prominent effect on the diosgenindifferentiated cells than autophagy activation.",,"['Diab, Dima', 'Pinon, Aline', 'Ouk, Catherine', 'Hage-Sleiman, Rouba', 'Diab-Assaf, Mona', 'Liagre, Bertrand', 'Leger, David Yannick']","['Diab D', 'Pinon A', 'Ouk C', 'Hage-Sleiman R', 'Diab-Assaf M', 'Liagre B', 'Leger DY']",,"['PEIRENE Laboratory EA 7500, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Limoges, 87025 Limoges, France.', 'PEIRENE Laboratory EA 7500, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Limoges, 87025 Limoges, France.', 'BISCEm Flow Cytometry/Microscopy Unit, University of Limoges, 87025 Limoges, France.', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Lebanese University, Hadath El Jebbeh, Beyrouth 21219, Lebanon.', 'Doctoral School of Sciences and Technology, Lebanese University, Hadath El Jebbeh, Beyrouth 21219, Lebanon.', 'PEIRENE Laboratory EA 7500, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Limoges, 87025 Limoges, France.', 'PEIRENE Laboratory EA 7500, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Limoges, 87025 Limoges, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Greece,Mol Med Rep,Molecular medicine reports,101475259,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*3methyladenine', '*autophagy', '*diosgenin', '*human erythroleukemia cells', '*megakaryocyte differentiation']",2021/08/31 06:00,2022/01/07 06:00,['2021/08/30 06:13'],"['2021/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/30 06:13 [entrez]', '2021/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3892/mmr.2021.12386 [doi]', '746 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Med Rep. 2021 Nov;24(5). pii: 746. doi: 10.3892/mmr.2021.12386.

Here, we identify the RBP RBMX and its retrogene RBMXL1 to be required for murine and human myeloid leukemogenesis. RBMX/L1 are overexpressed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) primary patients compared to healthy individuals, and RBMX/L1 loss delayed leukemia development. RBMX/L1 loss lead to significant changes in chromatin accessibility, as well as chromosomal breaks and gaps. We found that RBMX/L1 directly bind to mRNAs, affect transcription of multiple loci, including CBX5 (HP1alpha), and control the nascent transcription of the CBX5 locus. Forced CBX5 expression rescued the RBMX/L1 depletion effects on cell growth and apoptosis. Overall, we determine that RBMX/L1 control leukemia cell survival by regulating chromatin state through their downstream target CBX5.

The cPF4PD peptide recapitulates the helical structure of the PF4 domain and maintains activity against intracellular malaria parasites via a selective membrane-active mechanism. We hypothesized that cPF4PD and PF4-derived peptide analogues would enter cancer cells and have utility as scaffolds for delivering a peptide dual inhibitor (pDI) sequence with ability to inhibit p53:MDM2/X interactions and reactivate the p53 pathway. Here we designed and produced PF4 peptide and PF4 peptide-pDI grafted analogues with low micromolar activity toward melanoma and leukemia. Two grafted analogues achieved a stable helical structure and inhibited interaction with MDM2 and MDMX. These peptides reached the cytoplasm of cells but were unable to reactivate the p53 pathway. Instead, the cytotoxic mechanism was attributed to peptide binding to mitochondrial membranes that perturbed function within two hours of treatment.

The management includes rehabilitation as any other spinal cord injury. If very severe, a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program will be required. Presentation: We explain a case in which a 43-year-old male patient, known to have chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), on Imatinib (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor), started complaining of back pain at the level of the 10th rib. Different tests were made including a PET-CT (Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography) which showed hypermetabolic bony lytic lesion in the left mandible at the level of temporomandibular joint, destruction of the 10th rib, and no evidence of spinal cord compression. Other etiologies were excluded, making transverse myelitis due to radiation for the patient's CML on top of the differential diagnosis.

As an important DNA hydroxymethylase and a tumor suppressor gene, the expression regulating mechanism of Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2) remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to explore whether hypoxia and hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) regulate TET2 gene expression and its demethylation function in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The human AML cell line KG-1 was used in the present study. The results demonstrated that hypoxia could increase proliferation, enhance metabolism and inhibit apoptosis in KG-1 cells, as detected by the cell counting kit-8 assay, lactate dehydrogenase assay and Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide staining, respectively. Hypoxia reduced the genome methylation status in KG-1 cells detected using 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine detection kits. In addition, HIF-1alpha overexpression increased TET2 expression, 5-hmC level and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B [p15(INK4B)] gene demethylation compared with the HIF-1alpha non-overexpression group in KG-1 cells detected by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, western blotting, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine detection kits and methylation-specific PCR, respectively. The inhibition of HIF-1alpha by inhibitor YC-1 reduced demethylation in KG-1 cells by decreasing TET2 expression. It was also revealed that HIF-1alpha could enhance TET2 transcriptional activity by binding to the hypoxia response element of the TET2 gene promoter region using chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter gene assays. TET2 may be a potential target gene regulated by HIF-1alpha. Hypoxia was demonstrated to regulate the expression of TET2 by HIF-1alpha, which in turn affected the methylation and expression of downstream target genes and served a role in the occurrence and progression of leukemia. In the present study, the association between hypoxia metabolism and epigenetic regulation in AML was investigated and the findings provided a new idea and experimental basis for the diagnosis and treatment of hematologic malignancies.",['Copyright: (c) He et al.'],"['He, Ping', 'Lei, Jian', 'Zou, Li-Xin', 'Zhou, Gui-Zhen', 'Peng, Lang', 'Deng, Qian', 'Liu, Xiao-Liu']","['He P', 'Lei J', 'Zou LX', 'Zhou GZ', 'Peng L', 'Deng Q', 'Liu XL']",,"['Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Changsha Hospital, Hunan Normal University, Changsha, Hunan 410006, P.R.

The results showed that the incorporation of the imatinib on the surface of the graphene quantum dots did not change the nanoparticles' morphology and properties. The GQDs@imatinb could be efficiently internalized and kill cancer cells via the induction of apoptosis. The data indicated that the prepared GQDs@imatinb might be a great drug nano-platform for cancer, particularly leukemia treatments.",,"['Mendes Felix, Daniele', 'Rebelo Alencar, Luciana Magalhaes', 'de Menezes, Frederico Duarte', 'do Valle Pereira Midlej, Victor', 'Aguiar, Lorayne', 'Piperni, Sara Gemini', 'Zhang, Jian', 'Liu, Yin', 'Ricci-Junior, Eduardo', 'Alexis, Frank', 'Alves Junior, Severino', 'Zhu, Lin', 'Santos-Oliveira, Ralph']","['Mendes Felix D', 'Rebelo Alencar LM', 'de Menezes FD', 'do Valle Pereira Midlej V', 'Aguiar L', 'Piperni SG', 'Zhang J', 'Liu Y', 'Ricci-Junior E', 'Alexis F', 'Alves Junior S', 'Zhu L', 'Santos-Oliveira R']",,"['Brazilian Nuclear Energy Commission, Nuclear Engineering Institute, Laboratory of Nanoradiopharmaceuticals and Synthesis of Novel Radiopharmaceuticals, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Federal University of Maranhao, Department of Physics, Maranhao, Brazil.', 'Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil.', 'Fiocruz, Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Laboratory of Cellular Ultrastructure, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Unigranrio, Laboratory of Multidisciplinary Studies, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Unigranrio, Laboratory of Multidisciplinary Studies, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Irma Lerma Rangel College of Pharmacy, Texas A&M University, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Irma Lerma Rangel College of Pharmacy, Texas A&M University, USA.', 'Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, College of Pharmacy, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'School of Biological Sciences and Engineering, Yachay Tech University, Urcuqui, Imbabura, Ecuador.', 'Laboratorio de Terras Raras, Departamento de Quimica, Centro de Ciencias Exatas e da Natureza (CCEN), Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Recife, PE, 50740-560, Brazil.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Irma Lerma Rangel College of Pharmacy, Texas A&M University, USA.', 'Brazilian Nuclear Energy Commission, Nuclear Engineering Institute, Laboratory of Nanoradiopharmaceuticals and Synthesis of Novel Radiopharmaceuticals, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Zona Oeste State University, Laboratory of Radiopharmacy and Nanoradiopharmaceuticals, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']",['eng'],['R15 CA213103/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],France,J Drug Deliv Sci Technol,Journal of drug delivery science and technology,101214432,,['NOTNLM'],"['Biomedical device', 'Drug delivery', 'Graphene quantum dot', 'Nanoparticle', 'Smart material']",2021/08/31 06:00,2021/08/31 06:01,['2021/08/30 05:51'],"['2021/08/30 05:51 [entrez]', '2021/08/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/31 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1016/j.jddst.2020.102117 [doi]'],ppublish,J Drug Deliv Sci Technol. 2021 Feb;61. doi: 10.1016/j.jddst.2020.102117.

A case-control study.,,S0022-3468(21)00537-6 [pii] 10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2021.08.003 [doi],"PURPOSE: We sought to identify clinical features associated with difficult subcutaneous port removals in children. METHODS: Ports placed between April 2014 and September 2017 at our institution were prospectively tracked for difficult removals. A case-control analysis was performed. Patients with ports that were difficult to remove (stuck; cases) were compared to biological sex and age-matched controls in a ratio of 1:3. Logistic regression determined the association between case/control status and clinical features adjusting for biological sex and age as covariates. A multivariable analysis was performed to identify independent associations. RESULTS: 57 stuck ports (28 extreme [10 endovascular intervention] and 29 moderate) and 171 controls were analyzed. Stuck ports were associated with a diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (86% cases versus 22.2% controls; p < 0.001) and a longer placement duration (median 2.6 years [interquartile range (IQR) 2.5-2.6] versus 0.8 years [IQR 0.5-1.4]; p < 0.001). On univariate analysis, procedural and device features associated with stuck ports included subclavian access (71.9% cases versus 48.5% controls; p = 0.0126), a polyurethane versus silicone catheter (96.5% cases versus 79.9% controls; p = 0.001), and a rough catheter appearance at removal (92.6% cases versus 9.4% controls; p < 0.0001). A diagnosis of ALL and duration of line placement were associated with having a stuck port on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Polyurethane central venous catheters placed for the two-year treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia may become difficult to remove. This constellation of factors warrants more extensive preoperative discussion of risk, endovascular backup availability, and scheduling for longer operating room time.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

Methods: The clinical data of 8 patients with CLL carrying t (14;18) (q32;q21) seen in Jiangsu Province Hospital from November 2009 to November 2019 were collected and analyzed. Results: Among the 8 cases, 7 were male and 1 was female. The median age at diagnosis was 70 years old. The immunophenotype score was 5 in 3 patients. 4 patients were scored 4 and the remaining one scored 3. The bone marrow histopathology showed the typical manifestation of CLL. Karyotype analysis showed that all the cases carried t (14;18) (q32;q21) in the stemline. The t (14;18) (q32;q21) showed as the sole abnormality in 3 cases, with +12 in 4, and with 13q- in 1 case. 13q- was found in another 3 patients by FISH. Immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IGHV) mutation status was detected in 6 cases and all of them were mutated. None of them used IGHV3-21. Only 1 case harbored TP53 mutation and no TP53, SF3B1, NOTCH1, or MYD88 mutations were found in the remaining cases who underwent the relevant tests. At a median follow-up of 30.9 months, 1 case died. The remaining 7 cases survived and 3 of them have not reached the treatment indication. 4 patients who received chemotherapy or immunotherapy were stable. Conclusions: The t (14;18) (q32;q21) is rare in CLL and often accompanied by +12 and mutated IGHV.

The deep lesions presented abdominal pain, abdominal distension, suffocation and local pain, and burning of the tumor. The deep lesions were enlarged or accompanied by local edema. The local exudative lesions were found in the abdominal cavity and pleural cavity. 4 in circle Peak proportion of CD19 CAR-T cells in ORR group was higher than that of in SD+PD group[16.8% (5.3%-48.2%) vs 2.9% (1.5%-5.7%) , z=-4.297, P<0.001]. The peak proportion of CD19 CAR-T cells in ORR group with local reactions was higher than that of in patients without local reactions [22.2% (10.5%-48.2%) vs 12.6% (5.3%-21.6%) , z=-3.213, P=0.001]. The peak proportion of CD19 CAR-T cells in multiple lesion group was higher than that of in single lesion group [35.8% (1.5%-48.2%) vs 16.8% (10.5%-18.5%) , z=-2.023, P=0.040]. Occurrence of local reactions and tumor shrinkage time were both delayed compared with systemic side effects. In the ORR group, the OS of patients with tumor local reactions was longer than that of patients without tumor local reactions, but there was no difference in the two groups (75% vs 34.6%, P=0.169) . Conclusions: CD19 CAR-T cell therapy in R/R NHL patients with >7.5 cm lesions might cause tumor local reactions later than systemic side effects.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a multicenter retrospective study of children with oncologic diagnoses treated from 2013 to 2016 at hospitals participating in the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study-III. Transfusion practices were evaluated by diagnosis codes and pre-transfusion laboratory values. RESULTS: A total of 4766 inpatient encounters of oncology and HSCT patients were evaluated, with 39.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 37.9%-40.7%) involving a transfusion. Red blood cells (RBCs) were the most commonly transfused component (32.4%; 95% CI: 31.1%-33.8%), followed by platelets (22.7%; 95% CI: 21.5%-23.9%). Patients in the 1 to <6 years of range were most likely to be transfused and HSCT, acute myeloid leukemia, and aplastic anemia were the diagnoses most often associated with transfusion. The median hemoglobin (Hb) prior to RBC transfusion was 7.5 g/dl (10-90th percentile: 6.4-8.8 g/dl), with 45.7% of transfusions being given at 7 to <8 g/dl. The median platelet count prior to platelet transfusion was 20 x 10(9) /L (10-90th percentile: 8-51 x 10(9) /L), and 37.9% of transfusions were given at platelet count of >20-50 x 10(9) /L. The median international normalized ratio (INR) prior to plasma transfusion was 1.7 (10-90th percentile: 1.3-2.7), and 36.3% of plasma transfusions were given at an INR between 1.4 and 1.7. DISCUSSION: Transfusion of blood components is common in hospitalized pediatric oncology/HSCT patients. Relatively high pre-transfusion Hb and platelet values and relatively low INR values prior to transfusion across the studied diagnoses highlight the need for additional studies in this population.",['(c) 2021 AABB.'],"['Goel, Ruchika', 'Nellis, Marianne E', 'Karam, Oliver', 'Hanson, Sheila J', 'Tormey, Christopher A', 'Patel, Ravi M', 'Birch, Rebecca', 'Sachais, Bruce S', 'Sola-Visner, Martha C', 'Hauser, Ronald G', 'Luban, Naomi L C', 'Gottschall, Jerome', 'Josephson, Cassandra D', 'Hendrickson, Jeanne E', 'Karafin, Matthew S']","['Goel R', 'Nellis ME', 'Karam O', 'Hanson SJ', 'Tormey CA', 'Patel RM', 'Birch R', 'Sachais BS', 'Sola-Visner MC', 'Hauser RG', 'Luban NLC', 'Gottschall J', 'Josephson CD', 'Hendrickson JE', 'Karafin MS']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9653-9905', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2697-6314', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1785-2245', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7444-5550', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7928-3132', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7533-6842']","['Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.', 'Departments of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Division of Hematology Oncology, Simmons Cancer Institute at SIU School of Medicine and ImpactLife (Mississippi Valley Regional Blood Center), Springfield, Illinois, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, USA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Critical Care, Children's Hospital of Richmond at VCU, Richmond, Virginia, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Critical Care, Medical College of Wisconsin and Children's Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA."", 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.', 'Public Health and Epidemiology Practice, Westat, Rockville, Maryland, USA.', 'New York Blood Center, New York, New York, USA.', ""Division of Newborn Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."", 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine Service, Veterans Affairs, Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven, CT.', ""Children's Research Institute, Children's National Health System, Washington, District of Columbia, USA."", 'Medical Sciences Institute, Versiti, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Yale University, New Haven, CT.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*cancer', '*hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*plasma', '*platelets', '*red blood cells', '*transfusion']",2021/08/30 06:00,2021/11/09 06:00,['2021/08/29 21:10'],"['2021/06/26 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/09 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/29 21:10 [entrez]']",['10.1111/trf.16626 [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2021 Sep;61(9):2589-2600. doi: 10.1111/trf.16626.

It has been recently approved for the effective treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Novel charge transfer complex (CTC) between DUV, as electron donor, with chloranilic acid (CLA), as pi electron acceptor has been synthesized and characterized using different spectroscopic and thermogravimetric techniques. UV-visible spectroscopy ascertained the formation of the CTC in different solvents of varying polarity indexes and dielectric constants via formation of new broad absorption band with maximum absorption peak (lambdamax) in the range of 488-532 nm. The molar absorptivity of the CTC was dependent on the polarity index and dielectric constant of the solvent; the correlation coefficients were 0.9955 and 0.9749, respectively. The stoichiometric ratio of DUV:CLA was 1:1. Electronic spectral analysis was conducted for characterization of the complex in terms of its electronic constants. Computational calculation for atomic charges of energy minimized DUV was conducted and the site of interaction on DUV molecule was assigned. The solid-state CTC of DUV:CLA (1:1) was synthesized, and its structure was characterized by UV-visible, mass, FT-IR, and (1)H NMR spectroscopic techniques. Both FT-IR and (1)H NMR confirmed that both CT and hydrogen bonding contributed to the molecular composition of the complex. The reaction was adopted as a basis for developing a novel 96-microwell spectrophotometric assay (MW-SPA) for DUV. The assay limits of detection and quantitation were 0.57 and 1.72 microg/well, respectively. The assay was validated and all validation parameters were acceptable. The method was implemented successfully with great precision and accuracy to the analysis of the DUV in its bulk and capsules.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Lenalidomide is approved for the treatment of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) caused by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), although the precise mechanisms responsible for its effectiveness have not been fully elucidated. Here, we used HTLV-1-infected cell lines to investigate how IMiDs exert anti-ATL effects. In three of four tested HTLV-1-infected cell lines, the cells treated with lenalidomide or pomalidomide exhibited mild growth suppression without apoptosis, which was associated with decreased IRF4, c-Myc, and phosphorylated STAT3 levels as well as enhanced SOCS3 expression. Additionally, the levels of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and trimethyl histone 3 Lys27 (H3K27me3) were decreased following IMiD treatment in all three susceptible cell lines. An IMiD-mediated reduction of EZH2 and H3K27me3 levels was also observed in a multiple myeloma cell line. Furthermore, treatment with an EZH2-inhibitor reproduced the IMiD-mediated effects in HTLV-1-infected cells and multiple myeloma cells. These findings strongly suggest that a reduction of EZH2 expression is involved in the mechanism underlying the antitumor effects of IMiD.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors.

The disease arises due to abnormal proliferation and development of white blood cells and their precursors in the blood and bone marrow. Chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL) is a subtype of blood cancers, with the origin of B lymphocytes and the involvement of bone marrow, blood and lymph nodes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs with pivotal roles in cellular and molecular processes related to different malignancies, including CLL. In this way, we aimed to evaluate the expression of miR-32-5p, miR-98-5p, and miR-374b-5p in CLL patients. We also investigated the signaling pathways regulated by the studied miRs and also frequently disturbed miRs in CLL. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 32 CLL patients from Kermanshah province, Iran and 34 age and sex-matched healthy individuals. RNA was extracted from PBMCs and then was subjected to cDNA synthesis. Using specifically designed primers and Real-Time PCR method the expression of miRNAs was detected and was statistically analyzed. Using mirPath v.3, systematic pathway enrichment analysis was performed for the three studied miRNAs here along with the frequently disturbed miRNAs in CLL. RESULTS: The experiments indicated a significant reduction in the expression of all three miRs (p-value<0.0001) in CLL patients compared with healthy individuals. ROC analysis suggested that the three studied miRs can serve as potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of CLL. The in silico analysis suggested proteoglycans in cancer as a pathway regulated by the studied miRs and frequently dysregulated miRs in CLL. CONCLUSION: The observed reduction in expression of miR-32-5p, miR-98-5p, and miR-374b-5p in treatment naive CLL patients here might be suggestive of their modulatory protective role in CLL progression. Moreover, the candidate peripheral miRNAs could potentially serve as diagnostic biomarkers which warrant further investigation in a larger sample size.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

We herein aimed to compare the expression patterns of a histone modifiers panel consisted of SUV39H1, PRDM16, UHRF2, KDM2B, and KDM3C between acute myeloid leukemia(AML) cells and normal cells and to assess the correlation of these genes with the expression of vital tumor suppressor genes, including p16(INK4A) and p53. Bone marrow or peripheral blood samples of 50 AML patients at diagnosis and also 18 subjects with a normal hematopoietic system as a control group were obtained after informed consent. Then, qRT-PCR was performed to determine the expression levels of the aforementioned genes. We found a broad alteration in the expression signature of five out of seven studied genes in AML patients as compared with the control group. UHRF2 and p53 were remarkably downregulated in AML patients (P<0.001), while SUV39H1, PRDM16, and KDM3C were significantly overexpressed (P<0.01). Based on the Spearman rank correlation, SUV39H1 and KDM2B negatively regulated both p16(INK4A) and p53 expression. Taken together, our findings provided preliminary evidence regarding the pervasive mRNA perturbation of histone modifiers and their plausible influences on critical tumor suppressor genes. Future studies in this area would be required to assist in establishing these results in the clinical practice of AML patients.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In recent years, some DUBs, such as USP7, USP9X and USP10, have been identified as promising therapeutic targets in hematological malignancies. Importantly, some potent inhibitors targeting the oncogenic DUBs have been developed, showing promising inhibitory efficacy in preclinical models, and some have even undergone clinical trials. Different DUBs perform distinct function in diverse hematological malignancies, such as oncogenic, tumor suppressor or context-dependent effects. Therefore, exploring the biological roles of DUBs and their downstream effectors will provide new insights and therapeutic targets for the occurrence and development of hematological malignancies. We summarize the DUBs involved in different categories of hematological malignancies including leukemia, multiple myeloma and lymphoma. We also present the recent development of DUB inhibitors and their applications in hematological malignancies.

In the pivotal QUAZAR AML-001 trial, oral azacitidine maintenance therapy significantly prolonged overall survival by 9.9 months (P < 0.001) and relapse-free survival by 5.3 months (P < 0.001) compared with placebo in patients with AML in first remission after IC who were not candidates for transplant. Currently, the QUAZAR AML-001 trial provides the most comprehensive safety information associated with oral azacitidine maintenance therapy. Reviewed here are common adverse events (AEs) during oral azacitidine treatment in QUAZAR AML-001, and practical recommendations for AE management based on guidance from international cancer consortiums, regulatory authorities, and the authors' clinical experience treating patients in the trial. METHODS: QUAZAR AML-001 is an international, placebo-controlled randomized phase 3 study. Patients aged >/= 55 years with AML and intermediate- or poor-risk cytogenetics at diagnosis, who had attained first complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) within 4 months before study entry, were randomized 1:1 to receive oral azacitidine 300 mg or placebo once-daily for 14 days in repeated 28-day cycles. Safety was assessed in all patients who received >/= 1 dose of study drug. RESULTS: A total of 469 patients received oral azacitidine (n = 236) or placebo (n = 233). Median age was 68 years. Patients received a median of 12 (range 1-80) oral azacitidine treatment cycles or 6 (1-73) placebo cycles. Gastrointestinal AEs were common and typically low-grade. The most frequent grade 3-4 AEs during oral azacitidine therapy were hematologic events. AEs infrequently required permanent discontinuation of oral azacitidine (13%), suggesting they were effectively managed with use of concomitant medications and oral azacitidine dosing modifications. CONCLUSION: Oral azacitidine maintenance had a generally favorable safety profile. Prophylaxis with antiemetic agents, and blood count monitoring every other week, are recommended for at least the first 2 oral azacitidine treatment cycles, and as needed thereafter. Awareness of the type, onset, and duration of common AEs, and implementation of effective AE management, may maximize treatment adherence and optimize the survival benefits of oral azacitidine AML remission maintenance therapy.

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of commensal yeast organisms in cats' external ear canals, evaluate their predisposing lifestyle factors, and test the susceptibility of Malassezia pachydermatis to antifungal agents. RESULTS: A total of 53 cats (33 male and 20 female) seronegative for feline leukemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus were enrolled in this study. Their mean age (+/- standard deviation) was 6.04 (+/- 3.49) years. Fungal cultures and polymerase chain reaction tests were performed to identify the yeast species derived from the external ear canal. The association between lifestyle factors and the presence of M. pachydermatis was evaluated using Fisher's exact test. The susceptibility of M. pachydermatis to antifungal agents was also analyzed. M. pachydermatis was the most frequently recovered yeast species, with a prevalence of 50.94 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 36.84-64.94 %). There was an association between hair length and a positive culture for M. pachydermatis (p = 0.0001). The odds of a negative culture for M. pachydermatis among short-haired cats was 11.67 (95 % CI, 3.22-42.24) times higher than that among long-haired cats (p = 0.0002). There was also an association between the frequency of ear cleaning and the presence of M. pachydermatis (p = 0.007). The odds of a negative culture for M. pachydermatis in cats that were receiving ear cleaning at intervals of </= 2 weeks was 5.78 (95 % CI, 1.67-19.94) times greater than that of cats receiving ear cleaning at intervals greater than 2 weeks or never (p = 0.0055). Ranges of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum fungicidal concentrations for itraconazole, ketoconazole, miconazole, and terbinafine against M. pachydermatis were </= 0.063-4 and </= 0.063->/=32, </= 0.063-8 and 0.125->/=32, </= 0.063->/=32 and 0.5->/=32, and </= 0.016-1 and 0.125-8 microg/ml, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: M. pachydermatis was the most commonly identified yeast organism in the external ear canal of healthy cats. Hair length and the frequency of ear cleaning played a role in the colonization of M. pachydermatis. The M. pachydermatis isolates had various MIC levels for common fungicides.",['(c) 2021.

We assessed what proportion of CD19 and B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) CART trials report the number of patients not receiving CART after being enrolled by performing meta-analysis of the mITT and intention-to-treat (iTT) overall response rate (ORR). METHODS: PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were searched. All prospective clinical trials of CD19 and BCMA-targeting CART enrolling two or greater patients from 1st January 2013 to 1st November 2020 were included. RESULTS: A total of 28 BCMA CART and 74 CD19 CART trials were identified. These included 10 BCMA CART (35.7%) and 52 (70.2%) CD19 CART trials reporting total number of patients enrolled and number of patients treated with CART. For this cohort of trials, the mITT ORR for BCMA CART was 78.0% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 67.0-89.0%), and the iTT ORR was 70.0% (95% CI = 59.0-80.0%). For CD19 leukaemia CART, the mITT ORR was 87.2% (95% CI = 83.1-91.2), and the iTT ORR was 74.9 (95% CI = 64.8-85.0). For CD19 lymphoma CART, the mITT ORR was 70.7% (95% CI = 63.9-77.5), and the iTT ORR was 58.7% (95% CI = 49.7-67.7). CONCLUSION: Across BCMA and CD19 CART trials, there is a difference of up to 8-12% in the ORR between modified and iTT analyses and a paucity of information regarding reasons why patients did not receive the intended study treatment.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

PCR is typically included in library preparations, but a PCR-free method could serve as a high-throughput alternative. To evaluate a PCR-free method for research and diagnostics, archival peripheral blood or bone marrow plasma samples, collected in EDTA- or lithium-heparin-containing tubes, were collected from patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (n = 10 longitudinal samples; 4 patients), B-cell lymphoma (n = 31), and acute myeloid leukemia (n = 15), or from healthy donors (n = 14). sWGS was performed on PCR-free and PCR library preparations, and the mapping quality, percentage of unique reads, genome coverage, fragment lengths, and copy number profiles were compared. The percentage of unique reads was significantly higher for PCR-free method compared with PCR method, independent of the type of collection tube: EDTA PCR-free method, 96.4% (n = 35); EDTA PCR method, 85.1% (n = 32); heparin PCR-free method, 94.5% (n = 25); and heparin PCR method, 89.4% (n = 10). All other evaluated metrics were highly comparable for PCR-free and PCR library preparations. These results demonstrate the feasibility of somatic copy number alteration detection by PCR-free sWGS using cfDNA from plasma collected in EDTA- or lithium-heparin-containing tubes and pave the way for an automated cfDNA analysis workflow for samples from cancer patients.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Association for Molecular Pathology and American Society for', 'Investigative Pathology.

The dynamics and outcomes of EBV-DNAemia are not well described in this population. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed the kinetics of EBV-DNAemia after ATG conditioning of HCT recipients. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess EBV-DNAemia to predict EBV-PTLD in this group. RESULTS: A total of 174/405 (43%) consecutive HCT recipients from two centers met inclusion criteria of ATG conditioned, non-B-cell lymphoma patients. Of these with EBV-DNA measured using standardized IU/ml, 78.6% (92/117) developed EBV-DNAemia: 62% spontaneously resolved; 19% cleared after preemptive rituximab, and 13% developed EBV-PTLD. ROC curve analysis using maximum pre-EBV-PTLD EBV-DNAemia, demonstrated an AUC of 0.912 with EBV-DNAemia of 9782 IU/ml, associated with 82.6% sensitivity and 94.4% specificity for development of EBV-PTLD. Median time for EBV-DNAemia to increase from initial detection to >1000 IU/ml was 7 days; to >10 000 IU/ml, 12 days; and to >100 000 IU/ml, 18 days. Median EBV-DNAemia level prior to administration of rituximab was significantly lower in patients with successful preemptive treatment, compared with those who developed EBV-PTLD (3.41 log10 IU/ml [3.30-3.67] vs. 4.34 log10 IU/ml [3.85-5.13], p = .002; i.e., 2628 IU/ml vs. 21 965 IU/ml, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: EBV-DNAemia >10 000 IU/ml was the strongest predictor of the development of EBV-PTLD, and progression to this level was rapid in ATG-conditioned HCT recipients. This information may guide EBV-PTLD management strategies in these high-risk patients.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Lindsay, Julian', 'Othman, Jad', 'Yong, Michelle K', 'Ritchie, David',

Molecular aberrations and abnormalities play a significant prognostic role in AML patients. Our aim of the study was to investigate the prognostic role of TNFRSF4 gene expression in AML patients and its potential effect on treatment protocols. METHODS: Bone marrow mononuclear cells were analyzed for TNFRSF4 expression by real-time quantitative PCR as well as of FLT3/ITD and NPM1 mutations in 80 newly diagnosed AML patients and 80 control subjects. RESULTS: TNFRSF4 was significantly overexpressed in the AML patients (p < 0.001). TNFRSF4 expression was associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes including treatment response, relapse free survival, and overall survival. On multivariate testing, TNFRSF4 high expression proved to be an independent prognostic marker for clinical remission and relapse free survival but not overall survival. CONCLUSION: TNFRSF4 expression was revealed as an unfavorable prognostic marker and might be a target for immunotherapy in the future.","['(c) 2021.

The photosensitizing compound selectively accumulates in the target cells. A superficial treatment of a blood sample was performed at different ratios of oxygen saturation ([Formula: see text]) under the concentration ([Formula: see text] = 30 microM) effect of merocyanine 540 (MC540) in the blood irradiation. This was done under the application of visible light of wavelength ~ [Formula: see text] at an exposure time ~ 60 s. The dose of photodynamic therapy (PDT) was evaluated for the biological damage, leading to necrosis and blood damage during the treatment. In addition, the effect of PDT treatment response in the blood is related to hemoglobin oxygen saturation, resulting in an excellent relationship between the changes caused by the treatment in the blood at a peculiar oxygen saturation rate (for the highest response: [Formula: see text] 50%) and a light dose (LD) of 3.83 [Formula: see text] above the minimal toxicity of normal tissues. The photodynamic dose is related to the depth of necrosis and the time of treatment for the achievement of the LD delivery at the PDT of blood.","['(c) 2021.

However, resistance to imatinib may develop with time and in some cases, patients may not respond at all to imatinib. Progressive resistance to imatinib therapy is often due to mutations in the BCR/ABL region. Within the scope of our study 124 patients were evaluated via pyrosequencing between 2015 and 2020. In this regard, 32 patients who have a partial response and have no response to imatinib therapy were included in the study. In addition, next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis was performed on 15 patients who were resistant to imatinib treatment according to the molecular follow-up reports. With pyrosequencing, 5 cases out of a total of 124 were found to be positive. This means that approximately 4.03% of the proportion is positive. But when we examined only 32 patients who have a partial response and have no response to imatinib therapy this rate is rising 15.6%. NGS analysis was performed with 15 patients who have no mutation with pyrosequencing of 32 patients and VUS (Variant of Uncertain Significance) mutation was detected in one. In this study, our aim was to determine the mutations of the BCR/ABL and to evaluate the mutations by NGS and pyrosequencing. Our study is important in terms of comparing the pyrosequencing with NGS mutation rates, drawing attention to the clinical importance of log reduction.","['(c) 2021.

Although the significance of urinary N(1),N(12)-diacetylspermine (DiAcSpm) as a tumor marker (TM) has been reported in many types of adult cancers, its usefulness in pediatric cancers has not been reported. This may be due to urinary DiAcSpm level variations with age. This study aims to measure the normal levels of urinary DiAcSpm in healthy individuals and investigate its usefulness as a TM in childhood cancer. METHODS: Urinary samples were collected from pediatric patients with and without cancer. The urinary DiAcSpm levels were measured, and the values were compared. RESULTS: A total of 32 patients with cancer and 405 controls were enrolled in the study. Of the 32 patients, 13 had neuroblastoma, 9 had malignant lymphoma (ML), and 10 had leukemia. In the control group, the urinary DiAcSpm values markedly fluctuated among those with young age, especially infants; meanwhile, the values converged among those aged roughly 10 years and above.

This study aimed to develop and externally validate a multicentric, population PK (PopPK) model for intravenous Bu in pediatric patients before HSCT to first study the influence of glutathione-s-transferase A1 (GSTA1) polymorphisms on Bu's PK in a large multicentric pediatric population while accounting for fludarabine (Flu) coadministration and, second, to establish an individualized, model-based, first-dose recommendation for intravenous Bu that can be widely used in pediatric patients. The model was built using data from 302 patients from five transplantation centers who received a Bu-based conditioning regimen. External model validation used data from 100 patients. The relationship between body weight and Bu clearance (CL) was best described by an age-dependent allometric scaling of a body weight model. A stepwise covariate analysis identified Day 1 of Bu conditioning, GSTA1 metabolic groups based on GSTA1 polymorphisms, and Flu coadministration as significant covariates influencing Bu CL. The final model adequately predicted Bu first-dose CL in the external cohort, with 81% of predicted area under the curves within the therapeutic window. The final model showed minimal bias (mean prediction error, -0.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -3.1% to 2.0%) and acceptable precision (mean absolute prediction error percentage, 18.7%; 95% CI, 17.0%-20.5%) in Bu CL prediction for dosing. This multicentric PopPK study confirmed the influence of GSTA1 polymorphisms and Flu coadministration on Bu CL. The developed model accurately predicted Bu CL and first doses in an external cohort of pediatric patients.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Infected animals can be classified into high or low proviral load (HPL or LPL respectively), regarding the number of proviral copies infected lymphocytes they carry. After infection, there is an overexpression of several cytokines, particularly TNF-alpha, which has a delicate regulation mediated by receptors TNFRI and TNFRII; the first one involved with apoptosis, while the other stimulates cell proliferation. The study aimed to quantify TNF-alpha and its receptors mRNA expression, and in which extent in vitro proliferation was affected, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from BLV-infected animals with different proviral loads, after the addition or not of synthetic TNF-alpha (rTNF-alpha) for 48 h. PBMC from BLV-infected animals showed spontaneous proliferation after 48 h in culture but did not show changes in proliferation rates after 48 h incubation in the presence of the rTNF-alpha. TNF-alpha mRNA expression after 48 h culture without exogenous stimulation was significantly lower, regardless of the proviral load of the donor, compared to non-infected animals. In the LPL animals, the expression of TNF-alpha mRNA was significantly lower with respect to the control group while the expression of TNFRI mRNA was significantly increased. The HPL animals showed a significant decrease in the expression of TNF-alpha and TNFRII mRNA respect to the control group. After 48 h incubation with rTNF-alpha, PBMC from infected animals had different responses: TNF-alpha and TNFRI mRNA expression was reduced in PBMC from the LPL group compared to the BLV negative group, but no differences were observed in PBMC from the HPL group. TNFRII mRNA expression showed no differences between HPL, LPL, and BLV negative groups, though HPL animals expressed 10.35 times more TNFRI mRNA than LPL. These results support the hypothesis that LPL animals, when faced with viral reactivation, present a pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative state. However, complementary studies are needed to explain the influence of TNFRII on the development of the HLP profile. On the other hand, exogenous stimulation studies reinforce the hypothesis that BLV infection compromises the immune response of the animals.","['(c) 2021.

In this study, we investigated the roles played by EVs that transport miR-548ac from AML cells in normal hematopoiesis. Bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that miR-548ac was highly expressed in AML-derived EVs. The expression of miR-548ac and TRIM28 and the targeting relationship were identified, and the results demonstrated that the expression of miR-548ac was upregulated in AML cell lines and AML cell-secreted EVs compared with CD34(+) HSCs. AML-derived EVs targeted CD34(+) HSCs to induce decreased expression of TRIM28 and downstream activation of STAT3. Exosomal miR-548ac was transferred into CD34(+) HSCs to target TRIM28. Through gain- and loss-of-function assays, it was observed that the abrogated expression of miR-548ac or STAT3 promoted colony-forming units (CFU), whereas overexpressed miR-548ac repressed CFU, which was rescued by overexpression of TRIM28. Taken together, these results indicated that miR-548ac delivered by AML cell-derived EVs inhibits hematopoiesis via TRIM28-dependent STAT3 activation.","['(c) 2021.

With these potential risks and increasing numbers of treatment options for newly diagnosed patients, communication and shared decision making are essential to supporting patients throughout the cancer care continuum. We aimed to gather perspectives of HL survivors about their actual role in treatment decision making and their understanding of LEs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After initial pilot testing at a cancer survivor conference, we disseminated a 23-question survey in a single-wave e-mail through the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society's national listserv. We focused on 4 constructs: (1) patient's understanding of HL at diagnosis; (2) initial discussions with an oncologist; (3) factors in decision making of treatment, and (4) current health status. RESULTS: A total of 135 participants responded to the survey. While 73% of survey respondents perceived some involvement in decision making, one-half of respondents felt the treatment plan was a shared decision with their provider. Among patient-level factors, side effects/LEs were most frequently endorsed as important to treatment decisions. Eighty-four percent of respondents had been educated about risk for potential LEs. Thirty-six percent had been diagnosed with a LE at the time of survey completion with 3% reporting a second cancer diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Survey respondents described their role in treatment decision making for newly diagnosed HL. Nearly half of patients did not endorse participating in shared decision making. A substantial number had experienced LEs. Future work should focus on improving patient-provider communication in decision processes for newly diagnosed HL.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, we present a case of nilotinib-associated vasospastic angina confirmed by an acetylcholine spasm provocation test. CASE PRESENTATION: A 62-year-old CML patient treated with 300 mg nilotinib twice daily complained of several episodes of rest angina and was hospitalized at our institution. Coronary angiography revealed no severe organic stenosis, and the acetylcholine spasm provocation test confirmed the diagnosis of vasospastic angina. Although treatment with a calcium channel blocker and nicorandil reduced the frequency of chest pain, angina symptoms continued to occur. At 10 months post discharge, the patient complained of increased frequency of angina; therefore, the nilotinib dosage was reduced to 150 mg twice daily.

The basis is a germline mutation of TP53 gene which encodes tumor suppressor protein resulting in early onset of tumors, most often breast cancer, soft tissue sarcomas, brain tumors, adrenocortical carcinomas, and leukemia. CASE REPORT: We present a case of a young woman with a positive family history for cancer diagnosed with malignant solitary fibrous tumor and luminal B-like invasive breast cancer. Breast cancer and sarcomas account for the majority of tumors associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, yet solitary fibrous tumor is a rare clinical entity with no established guidelines for treatment. Even though both primary tumors were successfully resected, the sarcoma relapsed in the form of lung metastases. The NGS analysis revealed single nucleotide variant (c.1101-1G>A) in TP53 gene, affecting the acceptor splice site at intron 10. Until now, only one case of this genetic variant has been documented with conflicting interpretations of pathogenicity. CONCLUSIONS: The knowledge of TP53 mutation status is essential since the management of these patients requires different approach to avoid excessive toxicity due to the risk of developing secondary malignancy. Using the clinical criteria to screen for affected individuals facilitates appropriate early genetic counseling of patients and their families. Following the American College of Medical Genetics criteria, we believe that the reported single nucleotide variant (c.1101-1G>A) in TP53 gene should be considered pathogenic.",['(c) 2021.

Polymorphisms in TPMT gene encode diminished activity enzyme, enhancing accumulation of active metabolites, and partially explaining the inter-individual differences in patients' clinical response. AREAS COVERED: This review gives an overview on TPMT gene and function, and discusses the pharmacogenomic implications of TPMT variants in the prevention of severe thiopurine-induced hematological toxicities and the less known implication on TG-induced sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. Additional genetic and non-genetic factors impairing TPMT activity are considered. Literature search was done in PubMed for English articles published since1990, and on PharmGKB. EXPERT OPINION: To titrate thiopurines safely and effectively, achieve the right degree of lymphotoxic effect and avoid excessive myelosuppression, the optimal management will combine a preemptive TPMT genotyping to establish a safe initial dose with a close phenotypic monitoring of TPMT activity and/or of active metabolites during long-term treatment. Compared to current ALL protocols, replacement of TG by MP during reinduction phase in TPMT heterozygotes and novel individualized TG regimens in maintenance for TPMT wild-type subjects could be investigated to improve outcomes while avoiding risk of severe hepatotoxicity.",,"['Franca, R', 'Braidotti, S', 'Stocco, G', 'Decorti, G']","['Franca R', 'Braidotti S', 'Stocco G', 'Decorti G']",,"['Department of Medical, Surgical and Health Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.', 'Department of Medical, Surgical and Health Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.', 'Department of Life Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.', 'Department of Medical, Surgical and Health Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.', 'Institute for Maternal & Child Health (I.r.c.c.s) Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol,Expert opinion on drug metabolism & toxicology,101228422,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'TPMT', 'genetic polymorphisms', 'myelosuppression', 'sinusoidal obstruction syndrome', 'thiopurines']",2021/08/29 06:00,2021/11/05 06:00,['2021/08/28 05:18'],"['2021/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/05 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/28 05:18 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17425255.2021.1974398 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol. 2021 Oct;17(10):1187-1198. doi: 10.1080/17425255.2021.1974398.

High viral loads are associated with progressive infection and the death of the host, due to FeLV-associated disease. In contrast, low viral loads, an effective immune response, and a better clinical outcome can be observed in cats with regressive infection. We hypothesize that by lowering viral loads in progressively infected cats, using CRISPR/SaCas9-assisted gene therapy, the cat's immune system may be permitted to direct the infection towards a regressive outcome. In a step towards this goal, the present study evaluates different adeno-associated vectors (AAVs) for their competence in delivering a gene editing system into feline cells, followed by investigations of the CRISPR/SaCas9 targeting efficiency for different sites within the FeLV provirus. Nine natural AAV serotypes, two AAV hybrid strains, and Anc80L65, an in silico predicted AAV ancestor, were tested for their potential to infect different feline cell lines and feline primary cells. AAV-DJ revealed superior infection efficiency and was thus employed in subsequent transduction experiments. The introduction of double-strand breaks, using the CRISPR/SaCas9 system targeting 12 selected FeLV provirus sites, was confirmed by T7 endonuclease 1 (T7E1), as well as Tracking of Indels by Decomposition (TIDE) analysis. The highest percentage (up to 80%) of nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) was found in the highly conserved gag and pol regions. Subsequent transduction experiments, using AAV-DJ, confirmed indel formation and showed a significant reduction in FeLV p27 antigen for some targets. The targeting of the FeLV provirus was efficient when using the CRISPR/SaCas9 approach in vitro. Whether the observed extent of provirus targeting will be sufficient to provide progressively FeLV-infected cats with the means to overcome the infection needs to be further investigated in vivo.",,"['Helfer-Hungerbuehler, A Katrin', 'Shah, Jimit', 'Meili, Theres', 'Boenzli, Eva', 'Li, Pengfei', 'Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina']","['Helfer-Hungerbuehler AK', 'Shah J', 'Meili T', 'Boenzli E', 'Li P', 'Hofmann-Lehmann R']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9750-4296'],"['Clinical Laboratory, Center for Clinical Studies, Department of Clinical Diagnostics and Services, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, 8057 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Clinical Laboratory, Center for Clinical Studies, Department of Clinical Diagnostics and Services, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, 8057 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Clinical Laboratory, Center for Clinical Studies, Department of Clinical Diagnostics and Services, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, 8057 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Clinical Laboratory, Center for Clinical Studies, Department of Clinical Diagnostics and Services, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, 8057 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Clinical Laboratory, Center for Clinical Studies, Department of Clinical Diagnostics and Services, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, 8057 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Clinical Laboratory, Center for Clinical Studies, Department of Clinical Diagnostics and Services, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, 8057 Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*AAV', '*CRISPR', '*FeLV', '*SaCas9', '*cat', '*feline leukemia virus', '*gene editing', '*provirus']",2021/08/29 06:00,2021/08/29 06:00,['2021/08/28 01:06'],"['2021/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/12 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/28 01:06 [entrez]', '2021/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/29 06:00 [medline]']","['v13081636 [pii]', '10.3390/v13081636 [doi]']",epublish,Viruses. 2021 Aug 18;13(8). pii: v13081636. doi: 10.3390/v13081636.,20210818,,,,PMC8402633,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hematoablative treatment aims at wiping out tumor cells as completely as possible to avoid leukemia/lymphoma relapse. This treatment inevitably co-depletes cells of hematopoietic cell lineages, including differentiated cells that constitute the immune system. HCT reconstitutes hematopoiesis and thus, eventually, also antiviral effector cells. In cases of an unrelated donor, that is, in allogeneic HCT, HLA-matching is performed to minimize the risk of graft-versus-host reaction and disease (GvHR/D), but a mismatch in minor histocompatibility antigens (minor HAg) is unavoidable. The transient immunodeficiency in the period between hematoablative treatment and reconstitution by HCT gives latent cytomegalovirus (CMV) the chance to reactivate from latently infected donor HC or from latently infected organs of the recipient, or from both. Clinical experience shows that HLA and/or minor-HAg mismatches increase the risk of complications from CMV. Recent results challenge the widespread, though never proven, view of a mechanistic link between GvHR/D and CMV. Instead, new evidence suggests that histoincompatibility promotes CMV disease by inducing non-cognate transplantation tolerance that inhibits an efficient reconstitution of high-avidity CD8(+) T cells capable of recognizing and resolving cytopathogenic tissue infection.",,"['Reddehase, Matthias J', 'Holtappels, Rafaela', 'Lemmermann, Niels A W']","['Reddehase MJ', 'Holtappels R', 'Lemmermann NAW']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5767-5111', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9190-6497']","['Institute for Virology and Research Center for Immunotherapy (FZI), University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg-University Mainz, 55131 Mainz, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology and Research Center for Immunotherapy (FZI), University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg-University Mainz, 55131 Mainz, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology and Research Center for Immunotherapy (FZI), University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg-University Mainz, 55131 Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD8 T cells', '*antigen presentation', '*avidity', '*cytomegalovirus', '*cytomegalovirus disease', '*graft-versus-host disease (GvHD)', '*hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)', '*hematopoietic reconstitution']",2021/08/29 06:00,2021/08/29 06:00,['2021/08/28 01:06'],"['2021/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/23 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/28 01:06 [entrez]', '2021/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/29 06:00 [medline]']","['v13081530 [pii]', '10.3390/v13081530 [doi]']",epublish,Viruses. 2021 Aug 3;13(8). pii: v13081530. doi: 10.3390/v13081530.,20210803,,,,PMC8402734,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using internal domains from murine leukemia viruses (MLV), chimeric GALV-Env proteins such as GALV-C4070A were derived, which allow pseudotyping of lentiviral vectors. In order to improve expression efficiency and vector titers, we developed a codon-optimized (co) variant of GALV-C4070A (coGALV-Env). We found that coGALV-Env mediated efficient pseudotyping not only of gamma-retroviral and lentiviral vectors, but also alpha-retroviral vectors. The obtained titers on HEK293T cells were equal to those with the classical GALV-Env, whereas the required plasmid amounts for transient vector production were significantly lower, namely, 20 ng coGALV-Env plasmid per 10(6) 293T producer cells. Importantly, coGALV-Env-pseudotyped gamma- and alpha-retroviral, as well as lentiviral vectors, mediated efficient transduction of primary human T cells. We propose that the novel chimeric coGALV-Env gene will be very useful for the efficient production of high-titer vector preparations, e.g., to equip human T cells with novel specificities using transgenic TCRs or CARs. The considerably lower amount of plasmid needed might also result in a significant cost advantage for good manufacturing practice (GMP) vector production based on transient transfection.",,"['Mirow, Manuela', 'Schwarze, Lea Isabell', 'Fehse, Boris', 'Riecken, Kristoffer']","['Mirow M', 'Schwarze LI', 'Fehse B', 'Riecken K']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9780-7211', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9050-6766']","['Research Department Cell and Gene Therapy, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE), 20246 Hamburg, Germany.', 'Research Department Cell and Gene Therapy, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE), 20246 Hamburg, Germany.', 'German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), Partner Site Hamburg-Lubeck-Borstel-Riems, 20246 Hamburg, Germany.', 'Research Department Cell and Gene Therapy, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE), 20246 Hamburg, Germany.', 'German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), Partner Site Hamburg-Lubeck-Borstel-Riems, 20246 Hamburg, Germany.', 'Research Department Cell and Gene Therapy, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE), 20246 Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*GMP', '*T-cell receptor (TCR)', '*adoptive immunotherapy', '*chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)', '*gene therapy', '*pseudotyping', '*retroviral vectors']",2021/08/29 06:00,2021/08/29 06:00,['2021/08/28 01:06'],"['2021/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/21 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/28 01:06 [entrez]', '2021/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/29 06:00 [medline]']","['v13081471 [pii]', '10.3390/v13081471 [doi]']",epublish,Viruses. 2021 Jul 27;13(8). pii: v13081471. doi: 10.3390/v13081471.,20210727,,,,PMC8402753,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the plausible role of APH-2 regulating HIV-1 replication.

APH-2 overexpression also inhibited the ability of HIV-1 Tat to transactivate the HIV-1 LTR-driven expression of luciferase. Furthermore, the introduction of mutations in the IXXLL motif at the N-terminal domain of APH-2 reverted the inhibitory effect on HIV-1 Tat-mediated transcription, suggesting the possible role of this motif towards the downregulation of Tat-mediated transactivation. Overall, these findings indicate that the HTLV-2 APH-2 may affect the HIV-1 replication at multiple levels by (a) inhibiting the Tat-mediated transactivation and (b) hampering the virus release by affecting the cellular gag expression.",,"['Londhe, Rajkumar', 'Kulkarni, Smita']","['Londhe R', 'Kulkarni S']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1184-7667'],"['Division of Virology, ICMR-National AIDS Research Institute, Pune 411026, Maharashtra, India.', 'Savitribai Phule Pune University, Pune 411007, Maharashtra, India.', 'Division of Virology, ICMR-National AIDS Research Institute, Pune 411026, Maharashtra, India.', 'Savitribai Phule Pune University, Pune 411007, Maharashtra, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*APH-2', '*HIV-1', '*HTLV-2', '*replication', '*transcription', '*virus release']",2021/08/29 06:00,2021/08/29 06:00,['2021/08/28 01:06'],"['2021/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/12 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/28 01:06 [entrez]', '2021/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/29 06:00 [medline]']","['v13081432 [pii]', '10.3390/v13081432 [doi]']",epublish,Viruses. 2021 Jul 23;13(8). pii: v13081432. doi: 10.3390/v13081432.,20210723,,,,PMC8402832,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The adverse effects of l-asparaginase formulations are associated with its glutaminase activity and bacterial origin; therefore, it is important to find new sources of l-asparaginase-producing eukaryotic microorganisms with low glutaminase activity. This work evaluated the biotechnological potential of filamentous fungi isolated from Brazilian Savanna soil and plants for l-asparaginase production. Thirty-nine isolates were screened for enzyme production using the plate assay, followed by measuring enzymatic activity in cells after submerged fermentation. The variables influencing l-asparaginase production were evaluated using Plackett-Burman design. Cell disruption methods were evaluated for l-asparaginase release. Penicillium sizovae 2DSST1 and Fusarium proliferatum DCFS10 showed the highest l-asparaginase activity levels and the lowest glutaminase activity levels. Penicillium sizovae&nbsp;l-asparaginase was repressed by carbon sources, whereas higher carbon concentrations enhanced l-asparaginase by F. proliferatum. Maximum enzyme productivity, specific enzyme yield and the biomass conversion factor in the enzyme increased after Plackett-Burman design. Freeze-grinding released 5-fold more l-asparaginase from cells than sonication.

A methylthiazoletetrazolium assay was performed to assess the CSP cytotoxicity on chronic (K562) and acute (HL60) myeloid leukemia cell lines and on normal Vero cell line. CSP toxicity was also evaluated in vivo using the OECD 423 acute toxicity model on Swiss albino mice. The results demonstrated a remarkable antitumoral activity against K562 and HL60 cell lines (IC50 = 16.86 microM and 11.75 microM, respectively) although no cytotoxicity was observed for the Vero cells or mice. A silico study was performed on the following receptors that are highly implicated in the development of leukemia: ABL kinase, ABL1, BCL2, and FLT3. The molecular docking demonstrated a high affinity interaction between the principal CSP components and the receptors.

The dataset utilized was from a BLV intervention field trial on three Midwestern dairy herds. Our analysis showed ELISA false negatives were more likely to occur in cattle with low PVL and normal LC. On average, negligible changes in LC were observed during six-month intervals. Periods of lymphocytosis, defined as >10,000 lymphocytes per uL of blood, were observed in 31.5% (68/216) of BLV test-positive cattle. In BLV test-positive cows, an average increase of 2900 to 3100 proviral copies per 100,000 cells was observed during each subsequent six-month sampling interval. The difference between the minimum and maximum PVL observed for an ELISA-positive cow with 3 or more observations ranged from 0 to 115,600 copies per 100,000 cells (median: 12,900; mean: 19,200). Therefore, following the identification of ELISA-positive cattle and the assessment of PVL and LC, subsequent semiannual tests to assess disease progression may not be needed. Further work is needed to determine how available diagnostic tests can be optimized to design cost-effective testing schemes for BLV control programs.",,"['Hutchinson, Holden C', 'Ruggiero, Vickie J', 'Norby, Bo', 'Sporer, Kelly R B', 'Bartlett, Paul C']","['Hutchinson HC', 'Ruggiero VJ', 'Norby B', 'Sporer KRB', 'Bartlett PC']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5464-1722', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3600-2027']","['Agricultural Research Services Research Participation Program, Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, Oak Ridge, TN 37830, USA.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA.', 'CentralStar Cooperative, East Lansing, MI 48910, USA.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA.']",['eng'],"['2014-68004-21881/U.S. Department of Agriculture', '2014-67015-21632/U.S. Department of Agriculture']",['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Pathogens,"Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",101596317,,['NOTNLM'],"['bovine leukemia virus', 'epidemiology', 'progression']",2021/08/29 06:00,2021/08/29 06:01,['2021/08/28 01:03'],"['2021/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/02 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/28 01:03 [entrez]', '2021/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/29 06:01 [medline]']","['pathogens10080987 [pii]', '10.3390/pathogens10080987 [doi]']",epublish,Pathogens. 2021 Aug 5;10(8). pii: pathogens10080987. doi: 10.3390/pathogens10080987.,20210805,,,,PMC8398158,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When we directly apply the raw data for classification or clustering purposes, sometimes we observe that the learning algorithms do not perform well. One possible reason for this is the presence of redundant, noisy, and non-informative features or attributes in the datasets. Hence, feature selection methods are used to identify the subset of relevant features that can maximize the model performance. Moreover, due to reduction in feature dimension, both training time and storage required by the model can be reduced as well. In this paper, we present a tri-stage wrapper-filter-based feature selection framework for the purpose of medical report-based disease detection. In the first stage, an ensemble was formed by four filter methods-Mutual Information, ReliefF, Chi Square, and Xvariance-and then each feature from the union set was assessed by three classification algorithms-support vector machine, naive Bayes, and k-nearest neighbors-and an average accuracy was calculated. The features with higher accuracy were selected to obtain a preliminary subset of optimal features. In the second stage, Pearson correlation was used to discard highly correlated features. In these two stages, XGBoost classification algorithm was applied to obtain the most contributing features that, in turn, provide the best optimal subset. Then, in the final stage, we fed the obtained feature subset to a meta-heuristic algorithm, called whale optimization algorithm, in order to further reduce the feature set and to achieve higher accuracy. We evaluated the proposed feature selection framework on four publicly available disease datasets taken from the UCI machine learning repository, namely, arrhythmia, leukemia, DLBCL, and prostate cancer. Our obtained results confirm that the proposed method can perform better than many state-of-the-art methods and can detect important features as well. Less features ensure less medical tests for correct diagnosis, thus saving both time and cost.",,"['Mandal, Moumita', 'Singh, Pawan Kumar', 'Ijaz, Muhammad Fazal', 'Shafi, Jana', 'Sarkar, Ram']","['Mandal M', 'Singh PK', 'Ijaz MF', 'Shafi J', 'Sarkar R']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5487-1261', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9598-7981', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5206-272X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8813-4086']","['Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata 700032, India.', 'Department of Information Technology, Jadavpur University, Kolkata 700106, India.', 'Department of Intelligent Mechatronics Engineering, Sejong University, Seoul 05006, Korea.', 'Department of Computer Science, College of Arts and Science, Prince Sattam bin Abdul Aziz University, Wadi Ad-Dwasir 11991, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata 700032, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Sensors (Basel),"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",101204366,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['arrhythmia', 'cancer dataset', 'disease classification', 'feature selection', 'filter method', 'whale optimization algorithm', 'wrapper method']",2021/08/29 06:00,2021/09/01 06:00,['2021/08/28 01:02'],"['2021/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/10 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/28 01:02 [entrez]', '2021/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['s21165571 [pii]', '10.3390/s21165571 [doi]']",epublish,Sensors (Basel). 2021 Aug 18;21(16). pii: s21165571. doi: 10.3390/s21165571.,20210818,20210831,,"['*Algorithms', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Humans', 'Machine Learning', 'Male', '*Support Vector Machine']",PMC8402295,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite recent success in treatments that partially improve symptomatic relief, they have failed in most clinical trials. Re-holding AD for accurate diagnosis and treatment is widely known as a challenging task. Lack of knowledge of basic molecular pathogenesis might be a possible reason for ineffective AD treatment. Historically, a majority of therapy-based studies have investigated the role of amyloid-beta (Abeta peptide) in the central nervous system (CNS), whereas less is known about Abeta peptide in the periphery in AD. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of the current understanding of Abeta peptide metabolism (anabolism and catabolism) in the brain and periphery. We show that the abnormal metabolism of Abeta peptide is significantly linked with central-brain and peripheral abnormalities; the interaction between peripheral Abeta peptide metabolism and peripheral abnormalities affects central-brain Abeta peptide metabolism, suggesting the existence of significant communication between these two pathways of Abeta peptide metabolism. This close interaction between the central brain and periphery in abnormal Abeta peptide metabolism plays a key role in the development and progression of AD. In conclusion, we need to obtain a full understanding of the dynamic roles of Abeta peptide at the molecular level in both the brain and periphery in relation to the pathology of AD. This will not only provide new information regarding the complex disease pathology, but also offer potential new clues to improve therapeutic strategies and diagnostic biomarkers for the successful treatment of AD.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors.

Although the ubiquitous pollutant benzene is an established leukemogen, its potential to cause non-Hodgkin lymphoma has been widely debated. We aimed to examine the potential link between benzene exposure and risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in humans by evaluating a wide array of cohort and case-control studies using electronic systematic review. METHODS: We did a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of all qualified human epidemiological studies that assessed the relationship between benzene exposure and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. We queried the PubMed and Embase databases for relevant articles published before June 5, 2019, and applied the SysRev platform for study selection. All peer-reviewed human cohort and case-control studies that reported non-Hodgkin lymphoma risk estimates specifically for benzene exposure were eligible for inclusion. Studies that calculated relative risks (RRs) for industries or job types without identifying those specifically exposed to benzene, that combined non-Hodgkin lymphoma with other cancer types, or that reported many different solvent exposures together were excluded. From each study, two investigators independently extracted information on the study design, location, years, sample size, participation rates, age, sex, sources of cases and controls, diagnosis, histological verification, exposure assessment, results, adjustment, and statistical analysis, and subsequently assessed study quality. We calculated the meta-analysis relative risk (meta-RR) and CIs using the fixed effect and random effect models, as well as assessing publication bias. FINDINGS: Our search yielded 2481 articles. After screening and removal of duplicates, 20 case-control studies and eight cohort studies were included in our meta-analysis, which included a total of 9587 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. We reported an increased meta-relative risk (meta-RR) of 33% in highly exposed groups, when data were available (meta-RR 1.33 [95% CI 1.13-1.57], n=28). The meta-RR rose to 1.51 (1.22-1.87, n=18) in the studies that provided results specifically for highly exposed individuals. In particular, we reported a doubling of this risk for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a major non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtype (1.67 [1.01-2.77]). We also detected increased risks for follicular lymphoma (1.47 [0.95-2.27]) and hairy cell leukaemia (1.77 [0.99-3.16]), though they were not statistically significant. Funnel plot, Egger's test (p=0.77) and Begg's test (p=0.98) did not show evidence of publication bias. We evaluated the major aspects of causal inference and found evidence to support all the Hill considerations for assigning causation. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest a causal link between benzene exposure and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, especially for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

The International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership (ICBP) showed variation in cancer survival for adults. We aimed to assess and compare trends over time in cancer mortality between children, adolescents and young adults (AYAs) and adults in the six countries involved in the ICBP: United Kingdom, Denmark, Australia, Canada, Norway and Sweden. Trends in mortality between 2001 and 2015 in the six original ICBP countries were examined. Age standardised mortality rates (ASR per million) were calculated for all cancers, leukaemia, malignant and benign central nervous system (CNS) tumours, and non-CNS solid tumours. ASRs were reported for children (age 0-14 years), AYAs aged 15 to 39 years and adults aged 40 years and above. Average annual percentage change (AAPC) in mortality rates per country were estimated using Joinpoint regression. For all cancers combined, significant temporal reductions were observed in all countries and all age groups. However, the overall AAPC was greater for children (-2.9; 95% confidence interval = -4.0 to -1.7) compared to AYAs (-1.8; -2.1 to -1.5) and adults aged >40 years (-1.5; -1.6 to -1.4). This pattern was mirrored for leukaemia, CNS tumours and non-CNS solid tumours, with the difference being most pronounced for leukaemia: AAPC for children -4.6 (-6.1 to -3.1) vs AYAs -3.2 (-4.2 to -2.1) and over 40s -1.1 (-1.3 to -0.8). AAPCs varied between countries in children for all cancers except leukaemia, and in adults over 40 for all cancers combined, but not in subgroups. Improvements in cancer mortality rates in ICBP countries have been most marked among children aged 0 to 14 in comparison to 15 to 39 and over 40 year olds. This may reflect better care, including centralised service provision, treatment protocols and higher trial recruitment rates in children compared to older patients.",['(c) 2021 UICC.'],"['Smith, Lesley', 'Stiller, Charles A', 'Aitken, Joanne F', 'Hjalgrim, Lisa L', 'Johannesen, Tom', 'Lahteenmaki, Paivi', 'McCabe, Martin G', 'Phillips, Robert', 'Pritchard-Jones, Kathy', 'Steliarova-Foucher, Eva', 'Winther, Jeanette F', 'Woods, Ryan R', 'Glaser, Adam W', 'Feltbower, Richard G']","['Smith L', 'Stiller CA', 'Aitken JF', 'Hjalgrim LL', 'Johannesen T', 'Lahteenmaki P', 'McCabe MG', 'Phillips R', 'Pritchard-Jones K', 'Steliarova-Foucher E', 'Winther JF', 'Woods RR', 'Glaser AW', 'Feltbower RG']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4280-6323', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5138-0707', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1728-9408']","['Leeds Institute for Data Analytics, School of Medicine, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK.', 'National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service, Public Health England, London, UK.', 'School of Public Health, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Cancer Council Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Hospital of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Registry Department, Norwegian Cancer Registry, Oslo, Norway.', 'Swedish Childhood Cancer Registry, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Pediatric and Adolecent Medicine, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.', 'Division of Cancer Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, University of York, York, UK.', 'UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London, London, UK.', 'Cancer Surveillance Branch, International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France.', 'Childhood Cancer Research Group, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health, Aarhus University and University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'BC Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Faculty of Heath Sciences, Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Leeds Institute for Data Analytics, School of Medicine, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK.', ""Leeds Institute of Medical Research at St James's, School of Medicine, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK."", 'Leeds Institute for Data Analytics, School of Medicine, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*childhood cancer', '*epidemiology', '*mortality trends']",2021/08/28 06:00,2021/12/21 06:00,['2021/08/27 17:40'],"['2021/07/14 00:00 [revised]', '2021/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/21 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/27 17:40 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.33774 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2022 Jan 1;150(1):28-37. doi: 10.1002/ijc.33774.

The objective of this study was to determine the disease burden and factors influencing the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and health status of CML patients in Klang Valley, Malaysia. CML patients were recruited from haematological outpatient clinics in health centres in Klang Valley, Malaysia. A semi-guided self-administered questionnaire was used. HRQoL was measured by EQ-5D utility value and health status was by visual analogue score (VAS). Logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the factors influencing HRQoL and health status. A total of 221 respondents participated, where more than half were Malay (56.6%), male (53.4%), and an Imatinib user (68.8%). Majority were diagnosed at the chronic phase (89.5%). The mean age of diagnosis was 41 years old. Significant determinant associated with HRQoL was age of diagnosis.

However, the cellular localization of endogenous DOCK proteins is poorly understood. In this paper, to gain a better understanding of the role of the DOCK-D proteins, we studied their distribution between cytosol and nucleoplasm in 11 cell lines. DOCK-D proteins were distributed with variable cytosolic or nuclear predominance, although the latter was common for DOCK9 and DOCK11. These results suggest that the DOCK-D proteins may perform new nuclear functions, which remain to be discovered.

We also found evidence for an induction of the cytosolic levels of DOCK10 by IL-4 in CLL.

To gain more insight into the characteristics of patients with AML carrying SF mutations, we studied their association with clinical features, cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities, and clinical outcome in a large cohort of 1447 patients with AML and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. SF mutations were identified in 22% of patients and were associated with multiple unfavorable clinical features, such as older age, antecedent myeloid disorders, and adverse risk factors (mutations in RUNX1 and ASXL1). Furthermore, they had significantly shorter event-free and overall survival. Notably, in European LeukemiaNet (ELN) 2017 favorable- and intermediate-risk groups, SF3B1 mutations were indicative of relatively poor prognosis. In addition, patients carrying concomitant SF mutations and RUNX1 mutations had a particularly adverse prognosis. In patients without any of the 4 most common SF mutations, RUNX1 mutations were associated with relatively good outcome, which was comparable to that of intermediate-risk patients. In this study, we propose that SF mutations be considered for incorporation into prognostic classification systems.

A subtype of AML, acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), is mainly driven by a specific oncogenic fusion event of promyelocytic leukemia-RA receptor fusion oncoprotein (PML-RARalpha). PML-RARalpha was reported as a transcription repressor through the interaction with nuclear receptor corepressor and histone deacetylase complexes leading to the mis-suppression of its target genes and differentiation blockage. Although previous studies were mainly focused on the connection of histone acetylation, it is still largely unknown whether alternative epigenetics mechanisms are involved in APL progression. KDM5A is a demethylase of histone H3 lysine 4 di- and tri-methylations (H3K4me2/3) and a transcription corepressor. Here, we found that the loss of KDM5A led to APL NB4 cell differentiation and retarded growth. Mechanistically, through epigenomics and transcriptomics analyses, KDM5A binding was detected in 1889 genes, with the majority of the binding events at promoter regions. KDM5A suppressed the expression of 621 genes, including 42 PML-RARalpha target genes, primarily by controlling the H3K4me2 in the promoters and 5' end intragenic regions. In addition, a recently reported pan-KDM5 inhibitor, CPI-455, on its own could phenocopy the differentiation effects as KDM5A loss in NB4 cells. CPI-455 treatment or KDM5A knockout could greatly sensitize NB4 cells to all-trans retinoic acid-induced differentiation. Our findings indicate that KDM5A contributed to the differentiation blockage in the APL cell line NB4, and inhibition of KDM5A could greatly potentiate NB4 differentiation.",['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Xu, Siyuan', 'Wang, Siqing', 'Xing, Shenghui', 'Yu, Dingdang', 'Rong, Bowen', 'Gao, Hai', 'Sheng, Mengyao', 'Tan, Yun', 'Sun, Xiaojian', 'Wang, Kankan', 'Xue, Kai', 'Shi, Zhennan', 'Lan, Fei']","['Xu S', 'Wang S', 'Xing S', 'Yu D', 'Rong B', 'Gao H', 'Sheng M', 'Tan Y', 'Sun X', 'Wang K', 'Xue K', 'Shi Z', 'Lan F']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9515-6208', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8826-4614']","['Shanghai Key Laboratory of Medical Epigenetics, International Co-laboratory of Medical Epigenetics and Metabolism, Ministry of Science and Technology, Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, and Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Cancer Invasion, Ministry of Education, Liver Cancer Institute, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China;

Double-mutated CEBPA (CEBPAdm) is associated with a favorable prognosis; however, single-mutated CEBPA (CEBPAsm) does not seem to improve prognosis. We investigated CEBPAmu for prognosis in 1028 patients with AML, registered in the Multi-center Collaborative Program for Gene Sequencing of Japanese AML. It was found that CEBPAmu in the basic leucine zipper domain (bZIP) was strongly associated with a favorable prognosis, but CEBPAmu out of the bZIP domain was not. The presence of CEBPAmu in bZIP was a strong indicator of a higher chance of achieving complete remission (P < .001), better overall survival (OS; P < .001) and a lower risk of relapse (P < .001). The prognostic significance of CEBPAmu in bZIP was also observed in the subgroup with CEBPAsm (all patients: OS, P = .008; the cumulative incidence of relapse, P = .063; patients aged </=70 years and with intermediate-risk karyotype: OS, P = .008; cumulative incidence of relapse, P = .026). Multivariate analysis of 744 patients aged </=70 years showed that CEBPAmu in bZIP was the most potent predictor of OS (hazard ratio, 0.3287; P < .001). CEBPAdm was validated as a cofounding factor, which was overlapping with CEBPAmu in bZIP. In summary, these findings indicate that CEBPAmu in bZIP is a potent marker for AML prognosis. It holds potential in the refinement of treatment stratification and the development of targeted therapeutic approaches in CEBPA-mutated AML.","['(c) 2022 by The American Society of Hematology.

Proto-oncogene serine/threonine-protein kinase Pim1 (PIM1) is involved in cell survival and proliferation, with great relevance for oncogenesis. PIM1 plays a major role in the progression of various common complex human cancers, including prostate cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and other hematopoietic malignancies. The overexpression of PIM1 leads to cancer progression, and thus it is considered as a potential target for drug design and development purposes. Here, we report original in silico findings by employing structure-based virtual screening to discover potential phytoconstituents from the medicinal plants-based compounds, which could inhibit the PIM1 activity, using the IMPPAT (a curated database of Indian Medicinal Plants, Phytochemistry And Therapeutics) database. The initial hits were selected based on their binding affinity toward PIM1 calculated through the molecular docking approach. Subsequently, interaction analyses and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for 100 ns was carried out to study the conformational dynamics and complex stability of PIM1 with the identified compounds. Importantly, we found that PIM1 forms stable protein-ligand complexes with the phytoconstituents Dehydrotectol and Nordracorubin in particular. Our findings suggest that identified phytoconstituents Dehydrotectol and Nordracorubin bind to PIM1 in ATP-competitive binding mode. These findings and the compounds reported herein warrant further exploration as promising scaffolds for anticancer drug design, discovery, and development.",,"['Anjum, Farah', 'Mohammad, Taj', 'Almalki, Abdulraheem Ali', 'Akhtar, Omar', 'Abdullaev, Bekhzod', 'Hassan, Md Imtaiyaz']","['Anjum F', 'Mohammad T', 'Almalki AA', 'Akhtar O', 'Abdullaev B', 'Hassan MI']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0399-4835', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3663-4940']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Taif University, Taif, Saudi Arabia.', 'Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Basic Sciences, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Taif University, Taif, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Medicine, Tbilisi State Medical University, Tbilisi, Georgia.', 'Scientific Department, Akfa University, Tashkent, Uzbekistan.', 'Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Basic Sciences, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,OMICS,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,101131135,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*PIM1 kinase', '*cancer', '*drug discovery', '*natural products', '*small molecule inhibitors', '*virtual screening']",2021/08/28 06:00,2022/01/14 06:00,['2021/08/27 12:15'],"['2021/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/14 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/27 12:15 [entrez]']",['10.1089/omi.2021.0107 [doi]'],ppublish,OMICS. 2021 Sep;25(9):580-590. doi: 10.1089/omi.2021.0107.

Materials and Methods: A total of 136 patients (mean age +/- standard deviation: 64.6+/-10.3 years, 66.9% males) who had received at least one dose of ibrutinib were included in this retrospective multicenter, noninterventional hospital-registry study conducted at 33 centers across Turkey. Data on patient demographics, baseline characteristics, laboratory findings, and leukemia-cell cytogenetics were retrieved. Treatment response, survival outcome including overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), and safety data were analyzed. Results: Overall, 36.7% of patients were categorized as Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) class 2-3, while 44.9% were in Rai stage 4. Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed the presence of del(17p) in 39.8% of the patients. Patients received a median of 2.0 (range: 0-7) lines of pre-ibrutinib therapy. Median duration of therapy was 8.8 months (range: 0.4-58.0 months). The 1-year PFS and OS rates were 82.2% and 84.6%, respectively, while median PFS time was 30.0 (standard error, 95% confidence interval: 5.1, 20.0-40.0) months and median OS time was 37.9 (3.2, 31.5-44.2) months. Treatment response (complete or partial response), PFS time, and OS time were better with 0-2 lines versus 3-7 lines of prior therapy (p<0.001, p=0.001, and p<0.001, respectively), with ECOG class 0-1 versus class 2-3 (p=0.006, p=0.011, and p=0.001, respectively), and with Rai stage 0-2 versus 3-4 (p=0.002, p=0.001, and p=0.002, respectively). No significant difference was noted in treatment response rates or survival outcome with respect to the presence of comorbidity, bulky disease, or del(17p). While 176 adverse events (AEs) were reported in 74 (54.4%) patients, 46 of those 176 AEs were grade 3-4, including pneumonia (n=12), neutropenia (n=11), anemia (n=5), thrombocytopenia (n=5), and fever (n=5). Conclusion: This real-life analysis confirms the favorable efficacy and safety profile of long-term ibrutinib treatment while emphasizing the potential adverse impacts of poorer ECOG performance status, heavy treatment prior to ibrutinib, and advanced Rai stage on patient compliance, treatment response, and survival outcomes.",,"['Tombak, Anil', 'Pepedil Tanrikulu, Funda', 'Durusoy, Salih

We aimed to compare the outcomes of different treatment patterns in elderly AML patients and to propose a prognostic scoring system that could predict survival and aid therapeutic decisions. METHODS: Patients aged >/= 60 years who had been diagnosed with AML at 7 hospitals in China were enrolled (n = 228). Treatment patterns included standard chemotherapy, low intensity therapy, and best supportive care (BSC). RESULTS: The early mortality rates were 31%, 6.8%, and 6.3% for the BSC, low intensity therapy, and standard chemotherapy groups, respectively. The complete remission rate of the standard chemotherapy group was higher than that of the low intensity therapy group. The median overall survival (OS) was 561 days and 222 days for the standard chemotherapy and low intensity therapy groups, respectively, and were both longer than that of the BSC group (86 days). Based on multivariate analyses, we defined a prognostic scoring system that enabled classification of patients into 3 risk groups, in an attempt to predict the OS of patients receiving chemotherapies and low intensity therapies. Low and intermediate risk patients benefited more from standard chemotherapies than from low intensity therapies. However, the median OS was comparable between standard chemotherapies and low intensity therapies in high risk patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our prognostic scoring system could predict survival and help select appropriate therapies for elderly AML patients. Standard chemotherapy is important for elderly AML patients, particularly for those categorized into low and intermediate risk groups.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Cancer Biology & Medicine.'],"['Zhang, Chunli', 'Wan, Wei', 'Zhang, Shuai', 'Wang, Jingwen', 'Feng, Ru', 'Li, Jiangtao', 'Chai, Junyue', 'Zhou, Hebing', 'Wang, Liru', 'Zhong, Yuping', 'Mo, Xiaodong', 'Shen, Mengzhu', 'Jing, Hongmei', 'Liu, Hui']","['Zhang C', 'Wan W', 'Zhang S', 'Wang J', 'Feng R', 'Li J', 'Chai J', 'Zhou H', 'Wang L', 'Zhong Y', 'Mo X', 'Shen M', 'Jing H', 'Liu H']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8166-0216', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4958-2489']","['Department of Hematology, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100730, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing 100191, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100730, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100730, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100730, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100730, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Beijing No. 6 Hospital, Beijing 100007, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Beijing Luhe Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 101100, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Fuxing Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100038, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100043, China.', ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing 100191, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100730, China.']",['eng'],"['Z181100001718162/Beijing Committee of Science and Technology', '3332020071/Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities', '2018-I2M-1-002/CAMS Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences', ""2018-4-4089/Capital's Funds for Health Improvement and Research"", '7182178/Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation']",['Journal Article'],China,Cancer Biol Med,Cancer biology & medicine,101588850,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'chemotherapy', 'comorbidity', 'elderly', 'geriatric assessment']",2021/08/28 06:00,2021/08/28 06:00,['2021/08/27 08:46'],"['2021/08/27 08:46 [entrez]', '2021/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/28 06:00 [medline]']","['j.issn.2095-3941.2020.0474 [pii]', '10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2020.0474 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Cancer Biol Med. 2021 Aug 27. pii: j.issn.2095-3941.2020.0474. doi: 10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2020.0474.,20210827,,,,,['No potential conflicts of interest are disclosed.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior research has demonstrated that the presence of MTHFR SNPs (rs1801131 and rs1801133) in survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) corresponds to impairments in attention and executive functioning. The current study examines the associations between rs1801131 and/or rs1801133 SNPs and cognitive performance in long-term survivors of medulloblastoma. Procedure: Eighteen pediatric medulloblastoma survivors, on average 12.42 years post-diagnosis, completed the Digit Span Forward, Digit Span Backward, California Verbal Learning Test Trial 1, and Auditory Consonant Trigrams tests. MTHFR SNPs were detected using whole genome sequencing data and custom scripts within R software. Results: Survivors with a rs1801131 SNP performed significantly worse on Digit Span Backward than survivors without this SNP exhibiting a large effect (p = 0.049; d = 0.95). Survivors with a rs1801131 SNP performed worse on Digit Span Forward (d = 0.478) and the CVLT Trial 1 (d = 0.417) with medium effect sizes. In contrast to rs1801131, relationships were not identified between a rs1801133 SNP and these performance measures. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate the potential links between MTHFR SNPs and cognitive outcomes following treatment in brain tumor survivors. The current findings establish a novel relationship between rs1801131 and working memory in medulloblastoma. Increases in homocysteine levels and oxidative damage from radiation may lead to adverse long-term outcomes. This establishes the need to look beyond leukemia and methotrexate treatment to consider the risk of MTHFR SNPs for medulloblastoma survivors.",,"['Kautiainen, Rella J', 'Keeler, Courtney', 'Dwivedi, Bhakti', 'MacDonald, Tobey J', 'King, Tricia Z']","['Kautiainen RJ', 'Keeler C', 'Dwivedi B', 'MacDonald TJ', 'King TZ']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1363-9914'],"['Department of Psychology, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Department of Psychology, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.', ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta GA, USA."", 'Emory University Medical School, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Department of Psychology, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Neuroscience Institute, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Child Neuropsychol,Child neuropsychology : a journal on normal and abnormal development in childhood and adolescence,9512515,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Cognition', 'genomics', 'medulloblastoma', 'precision medicine', 'treatment-related toxicity', 'working memory']",2021/08/28 06:00,2021/08/28 06:00,['2021/08/27 08:38'],"['2021/08/27 08:38 [entrez]', '2021/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/09297049.2021.1970736 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Child Neuropsychol. 2021 Aug 27:1-15. doi: 10.1080/09297049.2021.1970736.,20210827,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we evaluate GEP analysis outside clinical trials, aiming to improve clinical risk assessment of multiple myeloma (MM) patients. METHODS: A total of 155 bone marrow samples from MM patients were collected from which RNA was analyzed by microarray. Sixteen previously developed GEP-based markers were evaluated, combined with survival data, and studied using Cox proportional hazard regression. RESULTS: Gene expression profiling-based markers SKY92 and the PR-cluster were shown to be independent prognostic factors for survival, with hazard ratios and 95% confidence interval of 3.6 [2.0-6.8] (P < .001) and 5.8 [2.7-12.7] (P < .01) for overall survival (OS). A multivariate model proved only SKY92 and the PR-cluster to be independent prognostic factors compared to cytogenetic high-risk patients, the International Staging System (ISS), and revised ISS. A substantial number of high-risk individuals could be further identified when SKY92 was added to the cytogenetic, ISS, or R-ISS. In the cytogenetic standard-risk group, ISS I/II, and R-ISS I/II, 13%, 23%, and 23% of patients with adverse survivals were identified. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, this study confirmed the prognostic value of GEP markers outside clinical trials. Conventional prognostic models to define high-risk MM are improved by the incorporation of GEP markers.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

METHOD: A retrospective review of cancer patients other than allogeneic HCT who had CMV DNAemia and/or disease from July 2013 till May 2020 at a quaternary cancer center was performed. RESULTS: Of 11,485 cancer patients who underwent treatment during this period, 953 patients had CMV DNA testing performed and 238 of them had CMV DNAemia. After excluding patients with allogeneic HCT, 62 patients with CMV DNAemia were identified of which 10 had concurrent CMV disease. The most frequent underlying malignancies were B-cell lymphoproliferative disease (LPD) (31%, 19/62), T-cell LPD (21%, 13/62), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (11%, 7/62), and multiple myeloma (10%, 6/62). Most patients had lymphopenia (77%, 48/62), multiple cancer therapies (63%, 39/62 received >/=2 previous therapies), co-infection (56%, 35/62 had >/=1 co-infection) and corticosteroid therapy (48%, 30/62) within one month before CMV diagnosis. CMV DNAemia and disease were observed in patients receiving novel immunotherapies including bispecific antibody therapy, chimeric-antigen receptor T-cell therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors. CONCLUSION: Patients with haematological malignancy, particularly B-cell LPD, T-cell LPD, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma were frequently identified to have CMV DNAemia and disease. Lymphopenia, multiple cancer therapies, co-infection, and recent receipt of systemic corticosteroids were also commonly observed. Future studies are necessary to determine optimal identification and management of CMV in these patients. This article is protected by copyright.

Although chemotherapy remains the mainstay therapy for cancer, it is not always effective and has detrimental side effects. Here, we present piperidone compounds P3, P4, and P5 that selectively target cancer cells via protein- and stress-mediated mechanisms. METHODS: We assessed typical apoptotic markers including phosphatidylserine externalization, caspase-3 activation, and DNA fragmentation through flow cytometry. Then, specific markers of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis including the depolarization of the mitochondria and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were investigated. Finally, we utilized western blot techniques, RT-qPCR, and observed the cell cycle profile after compound treatment to evaluate the possible behavior of these compounds as proteasome inhibitors. For statistical analyses, we employed the one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc test. RESULTS: P3, P4, and P5 induce cytotoxic effects towards tumorigenic cells, as opposed to non-cancerous cells, at the low micromolar range. Compound treatment leads to the activation of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. The accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins and the pro-apoptotic protein Noxa, both typically observed after proteasome inhibition, occurs after P3, P4, and P5 treatment. The stress-related genes PMAIP1, ATF3, CHAC1, MYC, and HMOX-1 were differentially regulated to contribute to the cytotoxic activity of P3-P5. Finally, compound P5 causes cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. CONCLUSION: Taken together, compounds P3, P4, and P5 exhibit strong potential as anticancer drug candidates as shown by strong cytotoxic potential, activation of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, and show typical proteasome inhibitor characteristics.",['(c) 2021.

In the bone marrow (BM), these MSCs are critical for the regulation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) that are responsible for daily blood production and functional immunity throughout an entire organism's lifespan. Alongside other stromal cells, MSCs form a specialized microenvironment BM tissue called ""niche"" that tightly controls HSC self-renewal and differentiation. In addition, MSCs are crucial players in maintaining bone integrity and supply of hormonal nutrients due to their capacity to differentiate into osteoblasts and adipocytes which also contribute to cellular composition of the BM niche. However, MSCs are known to encompass a large heterogenous cell population that remains elusive and poorly defined. In this review, we focus on deciphering the BM-MSC biology through recent advances in single-cell identification of hierarchical subsets with distinct functionalities and transcriptional profiles. We also discuss the contribution of MSCs and their osteo-adipo progeny in modulating the complex direct cell-to-cell or indirect soluble factors-mediated interactions of the BM HSC niche during homeostasis, aging and myeloid malignancies.

Under normal circumstances, autophagy may suppress tumorigenesis, however under the stressful conditions of late stage tumor growth autophagy actually protects tumor cells, so inhibiting autophagy in these cases also inhibits tumor growth and promotes tumor cell death. Methods: AML gene expression profile data and corresponding clinical data were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases, from which prognostic-related genes were screened to construct a risk score model through LASSO and univariate and multivariate Cox analyses. Then the model was verified in the TCGA cohort and GEO cohorts. In addition, we also analyzed the relationship between autophagy genes and immune infiltrating cells and therapeutic drugs. Results: We built a model containing 10 autophagy-related genes to predict the survival of AML patients by dividing them into high- or low-risk subgroups. The high-risk subgroup was prone to a poorer prognosis in both the training TCGA-LAML cohort and the validation GSE37642 cohort. Univariate and multivariate Cox analysis revealed that the risk score of the autophagy model can be used as an independent prognostic factor. The high-risk subgroup had not only higher fractions of CD4 naive T cell, NK cell activated, and resting mast cells but also higher expression of immune checkpoint genes CTLA4 and CD274. Last, we screened drug sensitivity between high- and low-risk subgroups. Conclusion: The risk score model based on 10 autophagy-related genes can serve as an effective prognostic predictor for AML patients and may guide for patient stratification for immunotherapies and drugs.",['(c)2021 Huang et al.'],"['Huang, Li', 'Lin, Lier', 'Fu, Xiangjun', 'Meng, Can']","['Huang L', 'Lin L', 'Fu X', 'Meng C']",,"['Department of Hematology, Hainan General Hospital (Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University), Haikou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Hainan General Hospital (Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University), Haikou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Hainan General Hospital (Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University), Haikou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Hainan General Hospital (Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University), Haikou, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,PeerJ,PeerJ,101603425,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Autophagy', 'GEO', 'Risk model', 'TCGA']",2021/08/28 06:00,2021/08/28 06:01,['2021/08/27 06:56'],"['2021/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/27 06:56 [entrez]', '2021/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7717/peerj.11968 [doi]', '11968 [pii]']",epublish,PeerJ. 2021 Aug 12;9:e11968. doi: 10.7717/peerj.11968. eCollection 2021.,20210812,,,,PMC8364747,['The authors declare there are no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS), this method enables both rapid de novo discovery and affinity maturation of known peptide binders with high selectivity. The BLI-assisted AS-MS technology also features real-time monitoring of the peptide binding during the library selection process, a feature unattainable by current selection approaches. We show the utility of the BLI AS-MS platform toward rapid identification of novel nanomolar (dissociation constant, K D < 50 nM) non-canonical binders to the leukemia-associated oncogenic protein menin.

Hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha) plays a key role in the Warburg effect. microRNAs (miRs) targeting HIF-1alpha have potential of regulating such aberrant metabolic process. The present study demonstrated that miR-18a-5p was expressed at a low level in K562/ADM cells via reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). The results of the luciferase reporter assay indicated that miR-18a-5p could specifically bind the 3'-untranslated region of HIF-1alpha. Through RT-qPCR and western blotting, it was revealed that miR-18a-5p downregulated the expression of HIF-1alpha. By inhibiting HIF-1alpha, miR-18a-5p suppressed aerobic glycolysis in K562/ADM cells, according to the results produced by glucose uptake, lactate production, pyruvate level and ATP synthesis measurement, along with the results obtained from extracellular acidification rate and oxygen consumption rate assays. These results provided new evidence that miR-18a-5p may suppress the Warburg effect by targeting HIF-1alpha. Furthermore, via CCK-8 and flow cytometry assays, cells transfected with miR-18a-5p mimics were more sensitive to Adriamycin (AMD) compared with AMD group.

To confirm the findings of the previous study and expand the investigation, additional CML patients with t(9;22) as the sole chromosomal anomaly were recruited and copy number variants (CNVs) were searched for. Methods: Karyotyping tests were performed on 106 CML patients during January 2010-September 2019 in our Genetics Laboratory. Eighty-four (79.2%) patients had the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome as the sole chromosomal anomaly. Only 49(58.3%) of these 84 patients had sufficient marrow or leukemia blood materials to additionally be included in the array-CGH analysis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was carried out to confirm the genes covered by the deleted or duplicated regions of the CNVs. Results: 11(22.4%) out of the 49 patients were found to have one to three somatic segmental somatic segmental (CNVs), including fourteen deletions and three duplications. The common region associated with deletions was on 9q33.3-34.12. Identified in five (45.5%) of the 11 positive patients with segmental CNVs, the deletions ranged from 106 kb to 4.1 Mb in size. Two (18.2%) cases had a deletion in the ABL1-BCR fusion gene on der (9), while three (27.3%) cases had a deletion in the ASS1 gene. The remaining CNVs were randomly distributed on different autosomes. Conclusion: Subtle genomic CNVs are relatively common in CML patients without cytogenetically visible additional chromosomal aberrations (ACAs). Long-term studies investigating the potential impact on patient prognosis and treatment outcome is underway.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Zhang, Liu, Wang, Ren, Kim, Wang, Lu, Pang, Liu, Gu, Sun, Shi,', 'Zhang, Zhang, Zhang, Li and Zhang.']","['Zhang, Heyang', 'Liu, Meng', 'Wang, Xiaoxue', 'Ren, Yuan', 'Kim, Young Mi', 'Wang, Xianfu', 'Lu, Xianglan', 'Pang, Hui', 'Liu, Guangming', 'Gu, Yue', 'Sun, Mingran', 'Shi, Yunpeng', 'Zhang, Chuan', 'Zhang, Yaowen', 'Zhang, Jianqin', 'Li, Shibo', 'Zhang, Lijun']","['Zhang H', 'Liu M', 'Wang X', 'Ren Y', 'Kim YM', 'Wang X', 'Lu X', 'Pang H', 'Liu G', 'Gu Y', 'Sun M', 'Shi Y', 'Zhang C', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhang J', 'Li S', 'Zhang L']",,"['Department of Hematology, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, United States.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, United States.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, United States.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, United States.', 'Department of Respiratory and Intensive Care Medicine, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, United States.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Anshan Hospital of First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, Anshan, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, United States.', 'Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, United States.', 'Gansu Province Medical Genetics Center, Gansu Provincial Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital, Lanzhou, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, United States.', 'Department of Neurology, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, United States.', ""Department of Pediatric Respiratory, Dalian Children's Hospital, Dalian, China."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, United States.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,,['NOTNLM'],"['ASS1 gene', 'additional chromosomal aberrations', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'copy number variations', 'del(9q)']",2021/08/28 06:00,2021/08/28 06:01,['2021/08/27 06:54'],"['2021/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/27 06:54 [entrez]', '2021/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fgene.2021.697009 [doi]'],epublish,Front Genet. 2021 Aug 10;12:697009. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2021.697009. eCollection 2021.,20210810,,,,PMC8383316,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Improving the prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia patients depends on advances in molecular biology for the detection of new therapeutic targets and the production of effective drugs. The CRISPR/Cas9 technology allows gene insertions and deletions and it is the first step in investigating the function of their encoded proteins. Thus, new experimental models have been developed and progress has been made in understanding protein metabolism, antitumor activity, leukemic cell maintenance, differentiation, growth, apoptosis, and self-renewal, the combined pathogenetic mechanisms involved in leukemogenesis. The CRISPR/Cas9 system is used to understand drug resistance and find solutions to overcome it. The therapeutic progress achieved using the CRISPR/Cas9 system is remarkable. FST gene removal inhibited acute myeloid leukemia cell growth. Lysine acetyltransferase gene deletion contributed to decreased proliferation rate, increased apoptosis, and favored differentiation of acute myelid leukemia cells carrying MLL-X gene fusions. The removal of CD38 gene from NK cells decreased NK fratricidal cells contributing to increased efficacy of new CD38 CAR-NK cells to target leukemic blasts. BCL2 knockout has synergistic effects with FLT3 inhibitors. Exportin 1 knockout is synergistic with midostaurin treatment in acute myeloid leukemia with FLT3-ITD mutation.

While multiple studies have identified the effects of chemotherapeutics and radiation therapy on musculoskeletal outcomes, few have investigated their associations with genetic factors. METHODS: Here we analyzed musculoskeletal complications in relation to common and rare genetic variants derived through whole-exome sequencing of the PETALE cohort. Top-ranking associations were further assessed through stratified and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: DUOX2 variant was associated with skeletal muscle function deficit, as defined by peak muscle power Z score </= -2 SD (P = 4.5 x 10(-5) for genotyping model). Upon risk stratification analysis, common variants in the APOL3, COL12A1, and LY75 genes were associated with Z score </= -2 SD at the cross-sectional area (CSA) at 4% radial length and lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) in high-risk patients (P </= 0.01). The modulation of the effect by risk group was driven by the interaction of the genotype with cumulative glucocorticoid dose. Identified variants remained significant throughout multivariate analyses incorporating non-genetic factors of the studied cohort. CONCLUSION: This exploratory study identified novel genetic variants associated with long-term musculoskeletal impairments in childhood ALL survivors. Replication in an independent cohort is needed to confirm the association found in this study.","['(c) 2021.

Inhibitors selectively targeting FLT3 kinase have shown promising clinical activity; their success in the clinic, however, has been limited due to the emergence of acquired resistance. METHODS: CCT245718 was identified and characterised as a dual Aurora A/FLT3 inhibitor through cell-based and biochemical assays. The ability of CCT245718 to overcome TKD-mediated resistance was evaluated in a cell line-based model of drug resistance to FLT3 inhibitors. RESULTS: CCT245718 exhibits potent antiproliferative activity towards FLT3-ITD + AML cell lines and strongly binds to FLT3-ITD and TKD (D835Y) mutants in vitro. Activities of both FLT3-ITD and Aurora A are also inhibited in cells. Inhibition of FLT3 results in reduced phosphorylation of STAT5, downregulation of survivin and induction of apoptotic cell death. Moreover, CCT245718 overcomes TKD-mediated resistance in a MOLM-13-derived cell line containing FLT3 with both ITD and D835Y mutations. It also inhibits FLT3 signalling in both parental and resistant cell lines compared to FLT3-specific inhibitor MLN518, which is only active in the parental cell line. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that CCT245718 is a potent dual FLT3/Aurora A inhibitor that can overcome TKD-mediated acquired resistance.","['(c) 2021.

Interventions for physical deconditioning, in concert with routine hematology care are limited. The feasibility of accrual, retention, and demand for an exercise intervention among a high-risk HM population was piloted. METHODS: Older adults with HM, on active treatment, with functional impairment were recruited prospectively to participate in a 6-month Otago Exercise Programme (OEP). Measures of motivation, self-efficacy, patient identified barriers to exercise, barriers to clinical trial enrollment, study satisfaction, and serious adverse events were captured. RESULTS: 63 patients were approached, 18 declined trial enrollment, 45 consented, 30 patients enrolled in the exercise program. The main barrier for trial enrollment was transportation/travel concerns (n = 15). Of the 45 consented participants, 8 (12.7%) dropped out due to clinical deterioration, 5 (7.9%) withdrew, and 2 (3.2%) were ineligible prior to exercise-intervention intiation. The median age was 75.5 years (range 62-83) with plasma cell dyscrasia (63%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (20%) and leukemia (17%). Retention of the physical therapist (PT) led-OEP was 76.6% of patients (n = 23/30), and end-of-study retention was 66.7% (n = 20/30). Of the evaluable patients, 23/29 completed the PE-led OEP yielding a completion rate of 79%. Participants were extremely motivated (72.4%) and strongly intended (89.7%) to engage in regular physical activity. Exercising when tired increased from a median score of 50 at Visit 1 to 70 at Visit 2, but dropped significantly to 45 at Visit 3 (p < 0.001). Participants reported significantly lower self-efficacy to exercise over the next 6 months from Visit 1 to Visit 3 (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Older patients with HM had higher completion of in-person, PT-led exercise compared to at-home, independent exercise. Older adults were motivated and found the program acceptable, yet the ability to sustain a structured exercise program was challenging due to changes in health status.

These manifestations are often associated with ocular lesions and sometimes with neurological disorders. The association of xeroderma pigmentosum with internal neoplasms such as acute myeloblastic leukemia is not reported with great frequency, which confirms the rarity of this occurrence. CASE REPORT: A 26-year-old Moroccan women, xeroderma pigmentosum patient, was diagnosed with acute myeloblastic leukemia with a complex karyotype. Due to the adverse risk of the xeroderma pigmentosum association with acute myeloblastic leukemia and the profile of acute myeloblastic leukemia with complex karyotype and monosomy 7, which constitute factors of poor prognosis, as well as the absence of studies conceding the tolerance of the chemotherapy by patients suffering from xeroderma pigmentosum, our patient was put under low-dose cytarabine protocol with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Unfortunately, she died on the tenth day of chemotherapy by acute pulmonary edema of cardiogenic pace complicated by tamponade. CONCLUSION: According to reports, it is the second case showing association of xeroderma pigmentosum with acute myeloblastic leukemia. The management of these patients remains a challenge. Studies focusing on xeroderma pigmentosum patients developing hematological malignancies are necessary to better understand the most appropriate strategies and precautions for this specific case.",['(c) 2021.

There are no obvious explanations about how each of the mentioned diseases develops in the AC carriers. Finding the discriminative molecular factors and pathways may clarify the destiny of the infection. METHODS: To shed light on the involved molecular players and activated pathways in each state, differentially co-expressed modules (DiffCoEx) algorithm was employed to identify the highly correlated genes which were co-expressed differently between normal and ACs, ACs and ATLL, as well as ACs and HAM/TSP samples. Through differential pathway analysis, the dysregulated pathways and the specific disease-genes-pathways were figured out. Moreover, the common genes between the member of DiffCoEx and differentially expressed genes were found and the specific genes in ATLL and HAM/TSP were introduced as possible biomarkers. RESULTS: The dysregulated genes in the ATLL were mostly enriched in immune and cancer-related pathways while the ones in the HAM/TSP were enriched in immune, inflammation, and neurological pathways. The differential pathway analysis clarified the differences between the gene players in the common activated pathways. Eventually, the final analysis revealed the involvement of specific dysregulated genes including KIRREL2, RAB36, and KANK1 in HAM/TSP as well as LTB4R2, HCN4, FZD9, GRIK5, CREB3L4, TACR2, FRMD1, LHB, FGF3, TEAD3, GRIN2D, GNRH2, PRLH, GPR156, and CRHR2 in ATLL. CONCLUSION: The identified potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets are proposed as the most important platers in developing ATLL or HAM/TSP. Moreover, the proposed signaling network clarifies the differences between the functional players in the activated pathways in ACs, ATLL, and HAM/TSP.",['(c) 2021.

Methods: Twenty two m(6)A RNA methylation regulators were firstly analyzed using the data from Therapeutically Applicable Research To Generate Effective Treatments(TARGET) database and The Genotype-Tissue Expression(GTEx) database, Wilcoxon rank test was performed to analyze the differentially expression of m(6)A RNA methylation regulators between the AML and normal tissue, 296 AML children were divided into training cohort and validation cohort by simple random sampling method, Lasso regression was used to screen out the risk factors and the multivariate Cox regression was applied for establishing prognosis predicting model in training cohort. Kaplan-Meier survival curve, time-dependent ROC curve and multivariate Cox regression were used to estimate the efficiency of risk score calculated by predictive model in validation cohort. Results: Twenty one m(6)A genes were up regulated in AML compared to Normal patients. Five m(6)A RNA methylation regulators(ZC3H13, YTHDC2, HNRNPA2B1, METTL3, METTL5) were included in final predicting model.

In this study, we established a parthenogenetic epiblast-like stem cell line through culturing parthenogenetic diploid blastocysts in a chemically defined medium containing activin A and bFGF named paAFSCs. The paAFSCs expressed pluripotent marker genes and germ-layer-related genes, as well as being alkaline-phosphatase-positive, which is similar to epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs).

Here, we converted paAFSCs to ASCs by replacing bFGF with bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), CHIR99021, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in a culture medium, and we obtained parthenogenetic advanced stem cells (paASCs). The paASCs showed similar morphology with ESCs and also displayed a stronger developmental potential than paAFSCs in vivo by producing chimaeras. Our study demonstrates that maternal genes could support parthenogenetic EpiSCs derived from blastocysts and also have the potential to convert primed state paAFSCs to naive state paASCs.",,"['Wei, Mengyi', 'Zhang, Jindun', 'Liu, Jia', 'Zhao, Chaoyue', 'Cao, Shuo', 'Yan, Xiaojie', 'Wu, Baojiang', 'Bao, Siqin']","['Wei M', 'Zhang J', 'Liu J', 'Zhao C', 'Cao S', 'Yan X', 'Wu B', 'Bao S']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9582-3194'],"['State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Regulation and Breeding of Grassland Livestock, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010020, China.', 'Institute for Animal Genetic Research of Mongolia Plateau, College of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Regulation and Breeding of Grassland Livestock, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010020, China.', 'Institute for Animal Genetic Research of Mongolia Plateau, College of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Regulation and Breeding of Grassland Livestock, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010020, China.', 'Institute for Animal Genetic Research of Mongolia Plateau, College of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Regulation and Breeding of Grassland Livestock, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010020, China.', 'Institute for Animal Genetic Research of Mongolia Plateau, College of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Regulation and Breeding of Grassland Livestock, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010020, China.', 'Institute for Animal Genetic Research of Mongolia Plateau, College of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Regulation and Breeding of Grassland Livestock, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010020, China.', 'Institute for Animal Genetic Research of Mongolia Plateau, College of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Regulation and Breeding of Grassland Livestock, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010020, China.', 'Institute for Animal Genetic Research of Mongolia Plateau, College of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Regulation and Breeding of Grassland Livestock, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010020, China.', 'Institute for Animal Genetic Research of Mongolia Plateau, College of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010020, China.']",['eng'],"['[201400-5143903]; [30103-133601]; [201400-5203903/001]/the Ministry of Science', 'and Technology project of Inner Mongolia']",['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['epiblast stem cells', 'parthenogenetic diploid stem cells', 'parthenogenetic embryos', 'pluripotency']",2021/08/28 06:00,2021/09/18 06:00,['2021/08/27 01:25'],"['2021/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/08 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/27 01:25 [entrez]', '2021/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/18 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms22168976 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms22168976 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Aug 20;22(16). pii: ijms22168976. doi: 10.3390/ijms22168976.,20210820,20210916,"['0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (activin A)', '104625-48-1 (Activins)', '62031-54-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factors)']","['Activins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Blastocyst/metabolism', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4/pharmacology', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Embryo Culture Techniques/methods', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Germ Layers/metabolism/physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, 129 Strain', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Parthenogenesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology']",PMC8396573,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, we reported that clinical samples from CD and RA patients associated with PTPN2:rs478582 or PTPN22:rs2476601 genotypes were linked to overactive immune response and exacerbation of inflammation. Here, we investigated in vitro the effects of these SNPs in Jurkat T-cells using CRISPR-Cas9. All cells were evaluated for PTPN22/22 loss of function and effects on cell response. We measured gene expression via RT-qPCR and cytokines by ELISA. We also measured cell proliferation using a BrdU labeling proliferation ELISA, and T-cell activation using CD-25 fluorescent immunostaining. In PTPN2 SNP-edited cells, PTPN2 expression decreased by 3.2-fold, and proliferation increased by 10.2-fold compared to control. Likewise, expression of PTPN22 decreased by 2.4-fold and proliferation increased by 8.4-fold in PTPN22 SNP-edited cells. IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha secretions increased in both edited cell lines. CD25 expression (cell activation) was 80.32% in PTPN2 SNP-edited cells and 85.82% in PTPN22 SNP-edited cells compared to 70.48% in unedited Jurkat T-cells. Treatment of PTPN2 and PTPN22-edited cells with a maximum 20 muM spermidine restored PTPN2/22 expression and cell response including cell proliferation, activation, and cytokines secretion. Most importantly, the effect of spermidine on edited cells restored normal expression and secretion of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. The data clearly demonstrated that edited SNPs in PTPN2 or PTPN22 were associated with reduced gene expression, which resulted in an increase in cell proliferation and activation and overactive immune response. The data validated our earlier observations in CD and RA clinical samples. Surprisingly, spermidine restored PTPN2/22 expression in edited Jurkat T-cells and the consequent beneficial effect on cell response and inflammation. The study supports the use of polyamines dietary supplements for management of CD and in RA patients.",,"['Shaw, Ameera M', 'Qasem, Ahmad', 'Naser, Saleh A']","['Shaw AM', 'Qasem A', 'Naser SA']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3740-6963', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9222-4527']","['Division of Molecular Microbiology, Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences, College of Medicine, University of Central Florida, 4110 Libra Drive, Orlando, FL 32816, USA.', 'Division of Molecular Microbiology, Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences, College of Medicine, University of Central Florida, 4110 Libra Drive, Orlando, FL 32816, USA.', 'Division of Molecular Microbiology, Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences, College of Medicine, University of Central Florida, 4110 Libra Drive, Orlando, FL 32816, USA.']",['eng'],['2014-2020/Florida Legislative Grant'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,['NOTNLM'],"[""Crohn's Disease"", 'PTPN2', 'PTPN22', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'polyamines', 'spermidine']",2021/08/28 06:00,2021/09/21 06:00,['2021/08/27 01:24'],"['2021/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/12 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/27 01:24 [entrez]', '2021/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms22168883 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms22168883 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Aug 18;22(16). pii: ijms22168883. doi: 10.3390/ijms22168883.,20210818,20210920,"['EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN22 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 2)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 22)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)']","['Arthritis, Rheumatoid/genetics', '*CRISPR-Cas Systems', 'Crohn Disease/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 2/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 22/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Spermidine/*pharmacology']",PMC8396355,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mitochondria have also been documented among cellular targets for the TAM action. In the present study we have demonstrated a synergistic cytotoxic effect of TAM and CBD against T-ALL cells. By measuring the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim), mitochondrial calcium ([Ca(2+)]m) and protein-ligand docking analysis we determined that TAM targets cyclophilin D (CypD) to inhibit mPTP formation. This results in a sustained [Ca(2+)]m overload upon the consequent CBD administration.

HSCs display a distinct metabolic profile from that of their differentiated progeny, while metabolic rewiring from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) has been shown to be crucial for effective hematopoietic differentiation. Autophagy-mediated regulation of metabolism modulates the distinct characteristics of quiescent and differentiating hematopoietic cells. In particular, mitophagy determines the cellular mitochondrial content, thus modifying the level of OXPHOS at the different differentiation stages of hematopoietic cells, while, at the same time, it ensures the building blocks and energy for differentiation.

The most promising compounds, 3BrQuin-SAHA and 3ClQuin-SAHA, showed strong inhibition of tumor cell growth at one-digit micromolar concentrations with IC50 values similar to or lower than those of clinically established reference compounds SAHA and gefitinib. Target-specific EGFR and HDAC inhibition was demonstrated in cell-free kinase assays and Western blot analyses, while unspecific cytotoxic effects could not be observed in LDH release measurements. Proapoptotic formation of reactive oxygen species and caspase-3 activity induction in PCa and HCC cell lines DU145 and Hep-G2 seem to be further aspects of the modes of action. Antiangiogenic potency was recognized after applying the chimeric inhibitors on strongly vascularized chorioallantoic membranes of fertilized chicken eggs (CAM assay).

In the present study, the anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, and skin-protective effects of saponarin were investigated to evaluate its usefulness as a functional ingredient in cosmetics. In lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW264.7 (murine macrophage) cells, saponarin (80 muM) significantly inhibited cytokine expression, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2. Saponarin (80 muM) also inhibited the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway in RAW264.7 cells. Saponarin (40 muM) significantly inhibited beta-hexosaminidase degranulation as well as the phosphorylation of signaling effectors (Syk, phospholipase Cgamma1, ERK, JNK, and p38) and the expression of inflammatory mediators (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-13, COX-2, and FcepsilonRIalpha/gamma) in DNP-IgE- and DNP-BSA-stimulated RBL-2H3 (rat basophilic leukemia) cells. In addition, saponarin (100 muM) significantly inhibited the expression of macrophage-derived chemokine, thymus and activation-regulated chemokine, IL-33, thymic stromal lymphopoietin, and the phosphorylation of signaling molecules (ERK, p38 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 [STAT1]) in TNF-alpha- and interferon (IFN)-gamma-stimulated HaCaT (human immortalized keratinocyte) cells. Saponarin (100 muM) also significantly induced the expression of hyaluronan synthase-3, aquaporin 3, and cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (LL-37) in HaCaT cells, which play an important role as skin barriers. Saponarin remarkably inhibited the essential factors involved in the inflammatory and allergic responses of RAW264.7, RBL-2H3, and HaCaT cells, and induced the expression of factors that function as physical and chemical skin barriers in HaCaT cells. Therefore, saponarin could potentially be used to prevent and relieve immune-related skin diseases, including atopic dermatitis.",,"['Min, Seon-Young', 'Park, Che-Hwon', 'Yu, Hye-Won', 'Park, Young-Jin']","['Min SY', 'Park CH', 'Yu HW', 'Park YJ']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6133-1127', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8392-4772']","['Department of Medicinal Biosciences, Research Institute for Biomedical & Health Science, College of Biomedical and Health Science, Konkuk University, 268 Chungwon-daero, Chungju-si 27478, Korea.', 'Department of Medicinal Biosciences, Research Institute for Biomedical & Health Science, College of Biomedical and Health Science, Konkuk University, 268 Chungwon-daero, Chungju-si 27478, Korea.', 'Department of Medicinal Biosciences, Research Institute for Biomedical & Health Science, College of Biomedical and Health Science, Konkuk University, 268 Chungwon-daero, Chungju-si 27478, Korea.', 'Department of Medicinal Biosciences, Research Institute for Biomedical & Health Science, College of Biomedical and Health Science, Konkuk University, 268 Chungwon-daero, Chungju-si 27478, Korea.']",['eng'],"['P0002201/Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy']",['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['HaCaT', 'RAW264.7', 'RBL-2H3', 'anti-allergy', 'anti-inflammation', 'atopic dermatitis', 'flavone', 'saponarin']",2021/08/28 06:00,2021/09/16 06:00,['2021/08/27 01:23'],"['2021/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/02 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/27 01:23 [entrez]', '2021/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms22168431 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms22168431 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Aug 5;22(16). pii: ijms22168431. doi: 10.3390/ijms22168431.,20210805,20210915,"['0 (Anti-Allergic Agents)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Glucosides)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '3081Z76OX9 (saponarin)', '7V515PI7F6 (Apigenin)']","['Animals', 'Anti-Allergic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apigenin/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Dermatitis, Atopic/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Glucosides/*pharmacology', 'HaCaT Cells', 'Humans', 'Inflammation Mediators/metabolism', 'Keratinocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'RAW 264.7 Cells', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Skin/drug effects/metabolism']",PMC8395081,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To confirm this, many extensive studies recognized the therapeutic effects of garlic bulbs. More recently, black garlic (BG), made by heat-ageing white garlic bulbs, has increased its popularity in cuisine and traditional medicine around the world, but there is still limited information on its composition and potential beneficial effects. In this study, the metabolite profile of methanol extract of BG (BGE) was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry in high-resolution mode. Results allowed to establish that BGE major components were sulfur derivatives, saccharides, peptides, organic acids, a phenylpropanoid derivative, saponins, and compounds typical of glycerophospholipid metabolism. Characterization of the BGE action in cancer cells revealed that antioxidant, metabolic, and hepatoprotective effects occur upon treatment as well as induction of maturation of acute myeloid leukemia cells. These results are interesting from the impact point of view of BG consumption as a functional food for potential prevention of metabolic and tumor diseases.",,"['Bontempo, Paola', 'Stiuso, Paola', 'Lama, Stefania', 'Napolitano, Assunta', 'Piacente, Sonia', 'Altucci, Lucia', 'Molinari, Anna Maria', 'De Masi, Luigi', 'Rigano, Daniela']","['Bontempo P', 'Stiuso P', 'Lama S', 'Napolitano A', 'Piacente S', 'Altucci L', 'Molinari AM', 'De Masi L', 'Rigano D']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7312-5387'],"['Department of Precision Medicine, University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Via L.

To date, human infections caused by C. haemolyticum have been reported in three patients with malignant underlying diseases. We present herein the case of a 30-year-old obese woman with no significant past medical history who developed bacteremia caused by C. haemolyticum with massive intravascular hemolysis associated with bone marrow necrosis and acute renal failure. Because of subculture failure, the diagnosis was made on the basis of 16S rDNA sequencing and next-generation sequencing. The patient, who had been afebrile for 20 days after a 17-day-course of antibiotics, experienced a second bacteremic episode caused by C. haemolyticum. After having been successfully treated for 42 days with clindamycin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, the patient developed acute myeloid leukemia as a result of bone marrow regeneration. Although uncommon in humans, infections caused by C. haemolyticum are severe and should be considered in a febrile patient who has severe hemolytic anemia.

Chloroquine is a well-known antimalarial agent that inhibits late-stage autophagy. We evaluated the effects of chloroquine on cell viability and proliferation of acute myeloid leukemia acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells derived from 81 AML patients. Our results show that chloroquine decreased AML cell viability and proliferation for the majority of patients. Furthermore, a subgroup of AML patients showed a greater susceptibility to chloroquine, and using hierarchical cluster analysis, we identified 99 genes upregulated in this patient subgroup, including several genes related to leukemogenesis. The combination of chloroquine with low-dose cytarabine had an additive inhibitory effect on AML cell proliferation. Finally, a minority of patients showed increased extracellular constitutive mediator release in the presence of chloroquine, which was associated with strong antiproliferative effects of chloroquine as well as cytarabine.

Currently, there are no standardized hematology cancer screening tests that are recommended for the general population. CD24 is a mucin-like cell surface molecule and P-selectin ligand, which plays a significant role in the maturation of B-lymphocytes and was found to be overexpressed in a number of hematological malignancies. Our primary aim was to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the CD24/CD11b-based blood test for the detection of hematological malignancies. Our cohort included 488 subjects with positive hematological cancer diagnosis (n = 122) and healthy subjects (n = 366). CD24/CD11b expression in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) obtained from blood samples of participants was analyzed by flow cytometry. Our results demonstrated that the average levels of CD24/CD11b in healthy patients (21.7 +/- 9.0) were statistically significantly lower compared to levels of CD24/CD11b in cancer patients (29.5 +/- 18.7, p < 0.001). The highest levels of CD24/CD11b were found in multiple myeloma (39.1 +/- 23.6), followed by chronic myeloid leukemia (33.0 +/- 13.7) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (32.3 +/- 13.3). The test had an overall sensitivity for hematologic cancers of 78.5% (95% CI, 70.7-86.3%) and specificity of 80.2% (95% CI, 76.1-84.3%).

In Philadelphia positive ALL, the introduction of TKIs into frontline treatment regimens has already transformed patient outcomes. In B-ALL, agents targeting surface receptors CD19, CD20 and CD22, including monoclonal antibodies, bispecific T cell engagers, antibody drug conjugates and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, have shown significant activity but come with unique toxicities and have implications for how treatment is sequenced.

Nearly all molecular relapses occur during the first 6 months after TKI withdrawal and do not progress to clinical relapse. The mechanisms that are responsible for CML relapses remain unexplained. It is suggested that maintaining TFR is not directly related to the total disposing of the gene transcript BCR-ABL1, but it might be a result of the restoration of the immune surveillance in CML. The importance of the involvement of immunocompetent cells in the period of TKI withdrawal is also emphasized by the presence of specific symptoms in some patients with ""withdrawal syndrome"". The goal of this review is to analyze data from studies regarding TFRs in order to characterize the elements of the immune system of patients that might prevent CML molecular relapse.

Studies in glioma and leukemia have helped promote the theory that IDH1 mutations are an oncogenic event that drives tumorigenesis in general. Through bioinformatic analysis of more than 45,000 human pan-cancer samples from three independent datasets, we show here that IDH1 mutations are rare events in human cancer but are exclusively prevalent in WHO grade II and grade III (lower-grade) glioma. Interestingly, alterations in the tumor-suppressor gene TP53 (tumor protein p53) co-occur significantly with IDH1 mutations and show a tendency of exclusivity to IDH2 mutations. The co-occurrence of IDH1 mutation and TP53 alteration is widespread in glioma, particularly in those harboring IDH1(R132H), IDH1(R132G), and IDH1(R132S), whereas co-occurrence of IDH1(R132C) and TP53 alteration can be found sporadically in other cancer types. In keeping with the importance of p53 in tumor suppression, TP53 status is an independent predictor of overall survival irrespective of histological and molecular subgroups in lower-grade glioma. Together, these results indicate tissue specificity of IDH1 hotspot mutation and TP53 alteration and the importance of TP53 status as a predictor of patient outcome in lower-grade glioma.",,"['Murnyak, Balazs', 'Huang, L Eric']","['Murnyak B', 'Huang LE']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8500-7951', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6444-1708']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Clinical Neurosciences Center, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84132, USA.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Clinical Neurosciences Center, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84132, USA.', 'Department of Oncological Sciences, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.']",['eng'],['R21NS108065/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*IDH', '*TP53', '*glioma', '*isocitrate dehydrogenase', '*pan-cancer', '*patient outcome', '*survival', '*tissue specificity', '*tumor suppressor']",2021/08/28 06:00,2021/11/30 06:00,['2021/08/27 01:08'],"['2021/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/14 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/27 01:08 [entrez]', '2021/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/30 06:00 [medline]']","['cells10082116 [pii]', '10.3390/cells10082116 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2021 Aug 17;10(8). pii: cells10082116. doi: 10.3390/cells10082116.,20210817,20211129,"['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

CTX1 increased cytoplasmic Ca(2+) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, leading to the death of U937 cells. It was found that Ca(2+)-induced NOX4 upregulation promoted ROS-mediated p38 MAPK phosphorylation, which consequently induced c-Jun and ATF-2 phosphorylation. Using siRNA knockdown, activated c-Jun and ATF-2 were demonstrated to regulate the expression of Fas and FasL, respectively. Suppression of Ca(2+)-mediated NOX4 expression or ROS-mediated p38 MAPK activation increased the survival of U937 cells exposed to CTX1. FADD depletion abolished CTX1-induced cell death, caspase-8 activation, and t-Bid production, supporting the correlation between the Fas death pathway and CTX1-mediated cytotoxicity. Among the tested N. atra CTX isotoxins, only CTX1 induced Fas and FasL expression. Chemical modification studies revealed that intact Met residues were essential for the activity of CTX1 to upregulate Fas and FasL expression. Taken together, the data in this study indicate that CTX1 induces c-Jun-mediated Fas and ATF-2-mediated FasL transcription by the Ca(2+)/NOX4/ROS/p38 MAPK axis, thereby activating the Fas death pathway in U937 cells. Furthermore, CTX1 activates Fas/FasL death signaling in the leukemia cell line HL-60.",,"['Chiou, Jing-Ting', 'Wang, Liang-Jun', 'Lee, Yuan-Chin', 'Chang, Long-Sen']","['Chiou JT', 'Wang LJ', 'Lee YC', 'Chang LS']",,"['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['MOST108-2320-B-110-001-MY2/Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan', 'MOST110-2320-B-110-006/Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Fas', '*FasL', '*c-Jun/ATF-2', '*cardiotoxin', '*p38 MAPK']",2021/08/28 06:00,2021/11/12 06:00,['2021/08/27 01:08'],"['2021/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/06 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/27 01:08 [entrez]', '2021/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/12 06:00 [medline]']","['cells10082073 [pii]', '10.3390/cells10082073 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2021 Aug 12;10(8). pii: cells10082073. doi: 10.3390/cells10082073.,20210812,20211111,"['0 (ATF2 protein, human)', '0 (Activating Transcription Factor 2)', '0 (Cardiotoxins)', '0 (FADD protein, human)', '0 (FAS protein, human)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidase 4)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NOX4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']","['Activating Transcription Factor 2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cardiotoxins/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fas Ligand Protein/*metabolism', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'NADPH Oxidase 4/metabolism', 'Naja naja/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",PMC8394927,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All these mutations lead to a constitutive activation of the JAK-STAT signaling, which represents a target for therapy. Beyond driver ones, most patients, especially with myelofibrosis, harbor mutations in an array of ""myeloid neoplasm-associated"" genes that encode for proteins involved in chromatin modification and DNA methylation, RNA splicing, transcription regulation, and oncogenes. These additional mutations often arise in the context of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). The extensive characterization of the pathologic genome associated with MPN highlighted selected driver and non-driver mutations for their clinical informativeness. First, driver mutations are enlisted in the WHO classification as major diagnostic criteria and may be used for monitoring of residual disease after transplantation and response to treatment. Second, mutation profile can be used, eventually in combination with cytogenetic, histopathologic, hematologic, and clinical variables, to risk stratify patients regarding thrombosis, overall survival, and rate of transformation to secondary leukemia.

MLL2 contains a characteristic C-terminal SET domain responsible for methyltransferase activity and forms a protein complex with WRAD (WDR5, RbBP5, ASH2L and DPY30), host cell factors 1/2 (HCF 1/2) and Menin. The MLL2 complex is responsible for H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) on specific gene promoters and nearby cis-regulatory sites, regulating bivalent developmental genes as well as stem cell and germinal cell differentiation gene sets. Moreover, MLL2 plays a critical role in development and germ line deletions of Mll2 have been associated with early growth retardation, neural tube defects and apoptosis that leads to embryonic death. It has also been involved in the control of voluntary movement and the pathogenesis of early stage childhood dystonia. Additionally, tumor-promoting functions of MLL2 have been detected in several cancer types, including colorectal, hepatocellular, follicular cancer and gliomas.

For this reason, elevated expression of telomerase has been identified in virtually all cancers, including leukemias; however, it should be noted that expression of telomerase is sometimes observed later in malignant development. This time point of activation is highly dependent on the type of leukemia and its causative factors. Many recent studies in this field have contributed to the elucidation of the mechanisms by which the various forms of leukemias increase telomerase activity. These include the dysregulation of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) at various levels which include transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational stages. The pathways and biological molecules involved in these processes are also being deciphered with the advent of enabling technologies such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNA-Seq), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS/MS), and many others. It has also been established that TERT possess diagnostic value as most adult cells do not express high levels of telomerase. Indeed, studies have shown that prognosis is not favorable in patients who have leukemias expressing high levels of telomerase. Recent research has indicated that targeting of this gene is able to control the survival of malignant cells and therefore offers a potential treatment for TERT-dependent leukemias. Here we review the mechanisms of hTERT regulation and deliberate their association in malignant states of leukemic cells.

Non-coding elements that modulate Runx1 expression have been investigated over several decades, but how and when these REs function remains poorly understood. Here we used bioinformatic methods and functional data to characterise the regulatory landscape of vertebrate Runx1. We identified REs that are conserved between human and mouse, many of which produce enhancer RNAs in diverse tissues. Genome-wide association studies detected single nucleotide polymorphisms in REs, some of which correlate with gene expression quantitative trait loci in tissues in which the RE is active.

MDS are driven by a complex combination of genetic mutations that results in heterogeneous clinical phenotype and outcome. Genetic studies have enabled the identification of a set of recurrently mutated genes which are central to the pathogenesis of MDS and can be organized into a limited number of cellular pathways, including RNA splicing (SF3B1, SRSF2, ZRSR2, U2AF1 genes), DNA methylation (TET2, DNMT3A, IDH1/2), transcription regulation (RUNX1), signal transduction (CBL, RAS), DNA repair (TP53), chromatin modification (ASXL1, EZH2), and cohesin complex (STAG2). Few genes are consistently mutated in >10% of patients, whereas a long tail of 40-50 genes are mutated in <5% of cases. At diagnosis, the majority of MDS patients have 2-4 driver mutations and hundreds of background mutations. Reliable genotype/phenotype relationships were described in MDS: SF3B1 mutations are associated with the presence of ring sideroblasts and more recent studies indicate that other splicing mutations (SRSF2, U2AF1) may identify distinct disease categories with specific hematological features. Moreover, gene mutations have been shown to influence the probability of survival and risk of disease progression and mutational status may add significant information to currently available prognostic tools. For instance, SF3B1 mutations are predictors of favourable prognosis, while driver mutations of other genes (such as ASXL1, SRSF2, RUNX1, TP53) are associated with a reduced probability of survival and increased risk of disease progression.

They account for 10-15% of pediatric and about 25% of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases. It is a widely heterogeneous disease that is caused by the co-occurrence of multiple genetic abnormalities, which are acquired over time, and once accumulated, lead to full-blown leukemia. Recurrently affected genes deregulate pivotal cell processes, such as cycling (CDKN1B, RB1, TP53), signaling transduction (RAS pathway, IL7R/JAK/STAT, PI3K/AKT), epigenetics (PRC2 members, PHF6), and protein translation (RPL10, CNOT3). A remarkable role is played by NOTCH1 and CDKN2A, as they are altered in more than half of the cases. The activation of the NOTCH1 signaling affects thymocyte specification and development, while CDKN2A haploinsufficiency/inactivation, promotes cell cycle progression. Among recurrently involved oncogenes, a major role is exerted by T-cell-specific transcription factors, whose deregulated expression interferes with normal thymocyte development and causes a stage-specific differentiation arrest. Hence, TAL and/or LMO deregulation is typical of T-ALL with a mature phenotype (sCD3 positive) that of TLX1, NKX2-1, or TLX3, of cortical T-ALL (CD1a positive); HOXA and MEF2C are instead over-expressed in subsets of Early T-cell Precursor (ETP; immature phenotype) and early T-ALL. Among immature T-ALL, genomic alterations, that cause BCL11B transcriptional deregulation, identify a specific genetic subgroup. Although comprehensive cytogenetic and molecular studies have shed light on the genetic background of T-ALL, biomarkers are not currently adopted in the diagnostic workup of T-ALL, and only a limited number of studies have assessed their clinical implications. In this review, we will focus on recurrent T-ALL abnormalities that define specific leukemogenic pathways and on oncogenes/oncosuppressors that can serve as diagnostic biomarkers. Moreover, we will discuss how the complex genomic profile of T-ALL can be used to address and test innovative/targeted therapeutic options.",,"['Bardelli, Valentina', 'Arniani, Silvia', 'Pierini, Valentina', 'Di Giacomo, Danika', 'Pierini, Tiziana', 'Gorello, Paolo', 'Mecucci, Cristina', 'La Starza, Roberta']","['Bardelli V', 'Arniani S', 'Pierini V', 'Di Giacomo D', 'Pierini T', 'Gorello P', 'Mecucci C', 'La Starza R']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5558-7967', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5847-057X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5854-9846']","['Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Laboratory of Molecular Medicine (CREO), Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Perugia, 06132 Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Laboratory of Molecular Medicine (CREO), Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Perugia, 06132 Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Laboratory of Molecular Medicine (CREO), Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Perugia, 06132 Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Laboratory of Molecular Medicine (CREO), Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Perugia, 06132 Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Laboratory of Molecular Medicine (CREO), Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Perugia, 06132 Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Laboratory of Molecular Medicine (CREO), Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Perugia, 06132 Perugia, Italy.', 'Department of Chemistry, Biology and Biotechnology, University of Perugia, 06132 Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Laboratory of Molecular Medicine (CREO), Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Perugia, 06132 Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Laboratory of Molecular Medicine (CREO), Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Perugia, 06132 Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Genes (Basel),Genes,101551097,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*T-ALL', '*genomic profile', '*molecular-cytogenetic markers']",2021/08/28 06:00,2021/08/28 06:00,['2021/08/27 01:06'],"['2021/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/17 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/27 01:06 [entrez]', '2021/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/28 06:00 [medline]']","['genes12081118 [pii]', '10.3390/genes12081118 [doi]']",epublish,Genes (Basel). 2021 Jul 23;12(8). pii: genes12081118. doi: 10.3390/genes12081118.,20210723,,,,PMC8394887,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A foremost risk factor for HCC is obesity/metabolic syndrome-related non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is prompted by remarkable changes in transcription patterns of genes enriching metabolic, immune/inflammatory, and circadian pathways. Epigenetic mechanisms play a role in NAFLD-associated HCC, and macroH2A1, a variant of histone H2A, is involved in the pathogenesis modulating the expression of oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes and interacting with SIRT1, which crucially impacts the circadian clock circuitry. Hence, we aimed to appraise if and how macroH2A1 regulated the expression patterns of circadian genes in the setting of NAFLD-associated HCC. We took advantage of an in vitro model of liver cancer represented by HepG2 (human hepatocarcinoma) cells stably knocked down for macroH2A1 and conducted whole transcriptome profiling and deep phenotyping analysis. We found up-regulation of PER1 along with several deregulated circadian genes, enriching several important pathways and functions related to cancer onset and progression, such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, cell cycle deregulation, and DNA damage. PER1 silencing partially mitigated the malignant phenotype induced by the loss of macroH2A1 in HCC cells.

This is particularly due to the heterogeneity of AML and the need for personalized approaches. Due to the crucial role of the deregulated JAK-STAT signaling in AML, selective targeting of the JAK-STAT pathway, particularly constitutively activated STAT3 and STAT5 and their associated upstream JAKs, is of great interest. This strategy has shown promising results in vitro and in vivo with several compounds having reached clinical trials.

Proteolysis of OPN by thrombin, matrix metalloproteases, caspase 8/3, cathepsin D, plasmin, and enterokinase generates various cleaved OPNs with a variety of bioactivities by binding to different target cells. Moreover, OPN is susceptible to gradual proteolysis. During inflammation, one of the cleaved fragments, N-terminal thrombin-cleaved OPN (trOPN or OPN-Arg(168) [OPN-R]), induces dendritic cell (DC) adhesion. Further cleavage by carboxypeptidase B2 or carboxypeptidase N removes Arg(168) from OPN-R to OPN-Leu(167) (OPN-L). Consequently, OPN-L decreases DC adhesion. In particular, the differences in plasma level over time are observed between FL-OPN and its cleaved OPNs during inflammation. We found that the undefined OPN levels (mixture of FL-OPN and cleaved OPN) were elevated in plasma and reflected the pathology of TB and COVID-19 rather than FL-OPN. These infections are associated with elevated levels of various proteases. Inhibition of the cleavage or the activities of cleaved products may improve the outcome of the therapy.

It is therefore important to identify new agents with sensitivity and selectivity towards leukemic cells, while having less systemic toxicity. Peptide-based therapeutics has gained a great deal of attention during the last few years. Here, we used an integrative workflow combining mass spectrometric peptide library construction, in silico anticancer peptide screening, and in vitro leukemic cell studies to discover a novel anti-leukemic peptide having 3+ charges and an alpha helical structure, namely HMP-S7, from human breast milk. HMP-S7 showed cytotoxic activity against four distinct leukemic cell lines in a dose-dependent manner but had no effect on solid malignancies or representative normal cells. HMP-S7 induced leukemic cell death by penetrating the plasma membrane to enter the cytoplasm and cause the leakage of lactate dehydrogenase, thus acting in a membranolytic manner. Importantly, HMP-S7 exhibited anti-leukemic effects against patient-derived leukemic cells ex vivo.

However, even if most patients obtain morphological complete remission after induction, approximately 30% of cases eventually relapse. While well-established clinical features and concomitant cytogenetic/molecular lesions have been recognized to be relevant to predict prognosis at disease onset, the independent prognostic impact of measurable residual disease (MRD) monitoring by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), mainly in predicting relapse, actually supersedes other prognostic factors. Although the ELN Working Party recently indicated that patients affected with CBFB-MYH11 AML should have MRD assessment at informative clinical timepoints, at least after two cycles of intensive chemotherapy and after the end of treatment, several controversies could be raised, especially on the frequency of subsequent serial monitoring, the most significant MRD thresholds (most commonly 0.1%) and on the best source to be analyzed, namely, bone marrow or peripheral blood samples. Moreover, persisting low-level MRD positivity at the end of treatment is relatively common and not predictive of relapse, provided that transcript levels remain stably below specific thresholds. Rising MRD levels suggestive of molecular relapse/progression should thus be confirmed in subsequent samples. Further prospective studies would be required to optimize post-remission monitoring and to define effective MRD-based therapeutic strategies.",,"['Talami, Annalisa', 'Bettelli, Francesca', 'Pioli,

KMT2A is rearranged with a big variety of partner genes and in multiple breakpoint locations. Detection of all types of KMT2A rearrangements is an essential part of acute leukemia initial diagnostics and follow-up, as it has a strong impact on the patients' outcome. Due to their high heterogeneity, KMT2A rearrangements are most effectively uncovered by next-generation sequencing (NGS), which, however, requires a thorough prescreening by cytogenetics.

We used hASCs from human lipoaspirates to induce neuronal-like cells through three protocols (Neu1, 2, and 3), determined the degree of neuronal differentiation using specific biomarkers in culture cells and neurospheres, and analyzed epigenetic changes of genes involved in this differentiation. Furthermore, we selected the Hoxa-5 gene to determine its potential to improve neuronal differentiation. Our results showed that an excellent hASC neuronal differentiation process using Neu1 which efficiently modulated NES, CHAT, SNAP25, or SCN9A neuronal marker expression. In addition, epigenetic studies showed relevant changes in Hoxa-5, GRM4, FGFR1, RTEL1, METRN, and PAX9 genes.

Disordered regions are linked to posttranslational modifications, conformational switching, extra/intracellular trafficking, and allosteric control, among other phenomena. Disorder provides proteins with enhanced plasticity, resulting in a dynamic protein conformational/functional landscape, with well-structured and disordered regions displaying reciprocal, interdependent features. Although lacking well-defined conformation, disordered regions may affect the intrinsic stability and functional properties of ordered regions. MeCP2, methyl-CpG binding protein 2, is a multifunctional transcriptional regulator associated with neuronal development and maturation. MeCP2 multidomain structure makes it a prototype for multidomain, multifunctional, intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP). The methyl-binding domain (MBD) is one of the key domains in MeCP2, responsible for DNA recognition. It has been reported previously that the two disordered domains flanking MBD, the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the intervening domain (ID), increase the intrinsic stability of MBD against thermal denaturation. In order to prove unequivocally this stabilization effect, ruling out any artifactual result from monitoring the unfolding MBD with a local fluorescence probe (the single tryptophan in MBD) or from driving the protein unfolding by temperature, we have studied the MBD stability by differential scanning calorimetry (reporting on the global unfolding process) and chemical denaturation (altering intramolecular interactions by a different mechanism compared to thermal denaturation).",,"['Ortega-Alarcon, David', 'Claveria-Gimeno, Rafael', 'Vega, Sonia', 'Jorge-Torres, Olga C', 'Esteller, Manel', 'Abian, Olga', 'Velazquez-Campoy, Adrian']","['Ortega-Alarcon D', 'Claveria-Gimeno R', 'Vega S', 'Jorge-Torres OC', 'Esteller M', 'Abian O', 'Velazquez-Campoy A']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1885-4365', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5664-1729', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5702-4538']","['Institute of Biocomputation and Physics of Complex Systems (BIFI), Joint Units IQFR-CSIC-BIFI, and GBsC-CSIC-BIFI, Universidad de Zaragoza, 50018 Zaragoza, Spain.', 'Institute of Biocomputation and Physics of Complex Systems (BIFI), Joint Units IQFR-CSIC-BIFI, and GBsC-CSIC-BIFI, Universidad de Zaragoza, 50018 Zaragoza, Spain.', 'Instituto Aragones de Ciencias de la Salud (IACS), 50009 Zaragoza, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria de Aragon (IIS Aragon), 50009 Zaragoza, Spain.', 'Institute of Biocomputation and Physics of Complex Systems (BIFI), Joint Units IQFR-CSIC-BIFI, and GBsC-CSIC-BIFI, Universidad de Zaragoza, 50018 Zaragoza, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), 08916 Badalona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), 08916 Badalona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Cancer (CIBERONC), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), 08010 Barcelona, Spain.', ""Physiological Sciences Department, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Barcelona (UB), l'Hospitalet de Llobregat, 08907 Barcelona, Spain."", 'Institute of Biocomputation and Physics of Complex Systems (BIFI), Joint Units IQFR-CSIC-BIFI, and GBsC-CSIC-BIFI, Universidad de Zaragoza, 50018 Zaragoza, Spain.', 'Instituto Aragones de Ciencias de la Salud (IACS), 50009 Zaragoza, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria de Aragon (IIS Aragon), 50009 Zaragoza, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red en el Area Tematica de Enfermedades Hepaticas y Digestivas (CIBERehd), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular y Celular, Universidad de Zaragoza, 50009 Zaragoza, Spain.', 'Institute of Biocomputation and Physics of Complex Systems (BIFI), Joint Units IQFR-CSIC-BIFI, and GBsC-CSIC-BIFI, Universidad de Zaragoza, 50018 Zaragoza, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria de Aragon (IIS Aragon), 50009 Zaragoza, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red en el Area Tematica de Enfermedades Hepaticas y Digestivas (CIBERehd), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular y Celular, Universidad de Zaragoza, 50009 Zaragoza, Spain.', 'Fundacion ARAID, Gobierno de Aragon, 50009 Zaragoza, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Biomolecules,Biomolecules,101596414,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*MeCP2', '*differential scanning calorimetry', '*intrinsically disordered proteins', '*structural stability', '*thermal and chemical denaturation']",2021/08/28 06:00,2021/09/29 06:00,['2021/08/27 01:05'],"['2021/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/04 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/27 01:05 [entrez]', '2021/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['biom11081216 [pii]', '10.3390/biom11081216 [doi]']",epublish,Biomolecules. 2021 Aug 16;11(8). pii: biom11081216. doi: 10.3390/biom11081216.,20210816,20210928,"['0 (MECP2 protein, human)', '0 (Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']","['Binding Sites', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Domains', 'Protein Unfolding']",PMC8391517,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, there are very few treatments for the disease and those that exist work only for the recessively inherited forms. To better understand the pathogenesis of RP, multiple mouse models have been generated bearing mutations found in human patients including the human Q344X rhodopsin knock-in mouse. In recent years, the immune system was shown to play an increasingly important role in RP degeneration. By way of electroretinography, optical coherence tomography, funduscopy, fluorescein angiography, and fluorescent immunohistochemistry, we show degenerative and vascular phenotypes, microglial activation, photoreceptor phagocytosis, and upregulation of proinflammatory pathway proteins in the retinas of the human Q344X rhodopsin knock-in mouse. We also show that an FDA-approved pharmacological agent indicated for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is able to halt activation of pro-inflammatory signaling in cultured retinal cells, setting the stage for pre-clinical trials using these mice to inhibit proinflammatory signaling in an attempt to preserve vision. We conclude from this work that pro- and autoinflammatory upregulation likely act to enhance the progression of the degenerative phenotype of rhodopsin Q344X-mediated RP and that inhibition of these pathways may lead to longer-lasting vision in not only the Q344X rhodopsin knock-in mice, but humans as well.",,"['Hollingsworth, T J', 'Hubbard, Meredith G', 'Levi, Hailey J', 'White, William', 'Wang, Xiangdi', 'Simpson, Raven', 'Jablonski, Monica M', 'Gross, Alecia K']","['Hollingsworth TJ', 'Hubbard MG', 'Levi HJ', 'White W', 'Wang X', 'Simpson R', 'Jablonski MM', 'Gross AK']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4021-3559', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1857-6633']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Hamilton Eye Institute, College of Medicine, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38163, USA.', 'Department of Neurobiology, Evelyn F.

However, very little is known about sCD200's prognostic significance. sCD200 was tested at diagnosis in 272 patients with CLL and in 78 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects using a specific human CD200 (OX-2 membrane glycoprotein) ELISA kit. A significantly higher concentration of sCD200 was found in CLL patients compared to controls. In our cohort, sCD200 was significantly higher in patients who were older than 66 years, with Binet stage C, unmutated IgVH and unfavorable (del11q or del17p) FISH. Time-to-first treatment and overall survival were significantly shorter in patients with higher sCD200 concentration, using as a cut-off 1281 pg/mL, the median value for sCD200 concentration in the whole CLL cohort. However, the prognostic impact of sCD200 was not confirmed in multivariate analysis. Baseline sCD200 values appeared to have an impact on the response to chemotherapy or chemo-immunotherapy, but not to targeted agents. Collectively, our data show that sCD200 serum levels correlate with more aggressive clinical and biological features and are able to predict a worse prognosis.

Remarkable efficacy of anti-HH therapeutics led to the approval of HH inhibitors targeting the key pathway effector smoothened (SMO) in basal cell carcinoma and acute myeloid leukemia. However, frequent development of drug resistance and severe adverse effects of SMO inhibitors pose major challenges that require alternative treatment strategies targeting HH-GLI in TIC downstream of SMO. We therefore investigated members of the casein kinase 1 (CSNK1) family as novel drug targets in HH-GLI-driven malignancies. (2) Methods: We genetically and pharmacologically inhibited CSNK1D in HH-dependent cancer cells displaying either sensitivity or resistance to SMO inhibitors. To address the role of CSNK1D in oncogenic HH signaling and tumor growth and initiation, we quantitatively analyzed HH target gene expression, performed genetic and chemical perturbations of CSNK1D activity, and monitored the oncogenic transformation of TIC in vitro and in vivo using 3D clonogenic tumor spheroid assays and xenograft models. (3) Results: We show that CSNK1D plays a critical role in controlling oncogenic GLI activity downstream of SMO. We provide evidence that inhibition of CSNK1D interferes with oncogenic HH signaling in both SMO inhibitor-sensitive and -resistant tumor settings. Furthermore, genetic and pharmacologic perturbation of CSNK1D decreases the clonogenic growth of GLI-dependent TIC in vitro and in vivo.

Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of LCN2 overexpression in MPN. LCN2 mRNA expression was 20-fold upregulated in peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cells of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and myelofibrosis (MF) patients vs. healthy controls. In addition, LCN2 serum levels were significantly increased in polycythemia vera (PV) and MF and positively correlated with JAK2V617F and mutated CALR allele burden and neutrophil counts. Mechanistically, we identified endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) as a main driver of LCN2 expression in BCR-ABL- and JAK2V617F-positive 32D cells. The UPR inducer thapsigargin increased LCN2 expression >100-fold, and this was not affected by kinase inhibition of BCR-ABL or JAK2V617F. Interestingly, inhibition of the UPR regulators inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) significantly reduced thapsigargin-induced LCN2 RNA and protein expression, and luciferase promoter assays identified nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) and CCAAT binding protein (C/EBP) as critical regulators of mLCN2 transcription. In conclusion, the IRE1-JNK-NF-kappaB-C/EBP axis is a major driver of LCN2 expression in MPN, and targeting UPR and LCN2 may represent a promising novel therapeutic approach in MPN.",,"['Tillmann,

With the introduction of these agents, CML is now considered a chronic disease for some patients. Taking into consideration the side effects, toxicity, and high cost, discontinuing TKI became a goal for patients with chronic phase CML. Patients who achieved deep molecular response (DMR) and discontinued TKI, remained in treatment-free remission (TFR). Currently, the data from the published literature demonstrate that 40-60% of patients achieve TFR, with relapses occurring within the first six months. In addition, almost all patients who relapsed regained a molecular response upon retreatment, indicating TKI discontinuation is safe. However, there is still a gap in understanding the mechanisms behind TFR, and whether there are prognostic factors that can predict the best candidates who qualify for TKI discontinuation with a view to keeping them in TFR. Furthermore, the information about a second TFR attempt and the role of gradual de-escalation of TKI before complete cessation is limited. This review highlights the factors predicting success or failure of TFR. In addition, it examines the feasibility of a second TFR attempt after the failure of the first one, and the current guidelines concerning TFR in clinical practice.",,"['Saifullah, Hilbeen Hisham', 'Lucas, Claire Marie']","['Saifullah HH', 'Lucas CM']",,"['Chester Medical School, University of Chester, Bache Hall, Chester CH2 1BR, UK.', 'Chester Medical School, University of Chester, Bache Hall, Chester CH2 1BR, UK.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3GA, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL', 'TFR deep molecular response', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'chronic phase', 'treatment-free remission', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2021/08/28 06:00,2021/08/28 06:01,['2021/08/27 01:03'],"['2021/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/04 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/27 01:03 [entrez]', '2021/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/28 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13164175 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13164175 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Aug 19;13(16). pii: cancers13164175. doi: 10.3390/cancers13164175.,20210819,,,,PMC8392063,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Paediatric myeloid malignancies in DS occur at an unusually high frequency and generally follow a well-defined stepwise clinical evolution. First, the acquisition of mutations in the GATA1 transcription factor gives rise to a transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) in DS newborns. While this condition spontaneously resolves in most cases, some clones can acquire additional mutations, which trigger myeloid leukaemia of Down syndrome (ML-DS). These secondary mutations are predominantly found in chromatin and epigenetic regulators-such as cohesin, CTCF or EZH2-and in signalling mediators of the JAK/STAT and RAS pathways. Most of them are also found in non-DS myeloid malignancies, albeit at extremely different frequencies. Intriguingly, mutations in proteins involved in the three-dimensional organization of the genome are found in nearly 50% of cases. How the resulting mutant proteins cooperate with trisomy 21 and mutant GATA1 to promote ML-DS is not fully understood.

Exclusive formula feeding (ExFF) is therefore generally used to prevent MTCT. A recent cohort study revealed that 55% of pregnant carriers chose short-term breastfeeding for </=3 months in Japan. Our meta-analysis showed that there was no significant increase in the risk of MTCT when breastfeeding was carried out for </=3 months compared with ExFF (pooled relative risk (RR), 0.72; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.30-1.77), but there was an almost threefold increase in risk when breastfeeding was carried out for up to 6 months (pooled RR, 2.91; 95% CI, 1.69-5.03). Thus, short-term breastfeeding for </=3 months may be useful in preventing MTCT. Breastmilk is the best nutritional source for infants, and any approach to minimizing MTCT by avoiding or limiting breastfeeding must be balanced against the impact on the child's health and mother-child bonding.

A novel anticancer compound Polyethylene glycol-conjugated bi-TriAzole Tetraiodothyroacetic acid (P-bi-TAT) interacts with high affinity (Ki 0.3 nM) and specificity with the thyrointegrin alphavbeta3. We evaluated P-bi-TAT activities in two different AML models representing monocytic and myelocytic forms of acute leukemia. (2) Methods and Results: The in vivo AML models were established prior to initiation of treatment protocols by grafting human leukemia cells in immunocompromised mice. IVIS imaging scans revealed that leukemic colonies were extensively established throughout the bone marrow, liver, and lung of the untreated animals. In animals treated with P-bi-TAT at daily doses ranging from 1-10 mg/kg, subcutaneously for 2-3 weeks, IVIS imaging scans revealed 95% reduction in bone marrow colonies and leukemic colonies in liver and lung. Also, the leukemic cells were not detected in bone marrow samples of P-bi-TAT-treated animals. The anti-neoplastic effect of P-bi-TAT administration on leukemic cells was associated with marked inhibition of NF-kappaB activity. We conclude that experimental P-bi-TAT therapy in vivo appears extraordinarily effective against the two forms of human AML models in mice. Because the P-bi-TAT molecular target, thyrointegrin alphavbeta3, is consistently expressed in many, if not all, clinical AML samples, P-bi-TAT-based therapy seems to have significant clinical potential in treating most AML sub-types. Hence, P-bi-TAT represents a promising targeted therapeutic agent for AML patients.",,"['Sudha, Thangirala', 'Godugu, Kavitha', 'Darwish, Noureldien H E', 'Nazeer, Tipu', 'Mousa, Shaker A']","['Sudha T', 'Godugu K', 'Darwish NHE', 'Nazeer T', 'Mousa SA']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4124-9772', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9294-015X']","['Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Rensselaer, NY 12144, USA.', 'Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Rensselaer, NY 12144, USA.', 'Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Rensselaer, NY 12144, USA.', 'Hematology Unit, Clinical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura 35516, Egypt.', 'Albany Medical Center, Pathology Department, AMC Hospital, Albany, NY 12208, USA.', 'Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Rensselaer, NY 12144, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML therapy', 'P-bi-TAT', 'leukemia', 'thyrointegrin receptor', 'alphavbeta3']",2021/08/28 06:00,2021/08/28 06:01,['2021/08/27 01:03'],"['2021/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/05 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/27 01:03 [entrez]', '2021/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/28 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13164070 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13164070 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Aug 13;13(16). pii: cancers13164070. doi: 10.3390/cancers13164070.,20210813,,,,PMC8392871,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Receptor binding activates intracellular signaling cascades in the target cell that bring about a wide range of cellular responses, including induction of cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, and apoptosis. The Janus kinase and transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathways are activated upon cytokines and growth factors binding with their corresponding receptors. The SOCS family of proteins has emerged as a key regulator of cytokine signaling, and SOCS insufficiency leads to constitutive activation of JAK/STAT signaling and oncogenic transformation. Dysregulation of SOCS expression is linked to various solid tumors with invasive properties. However, the roles of SOCS in hematological malignancies, such as leukemia, are less clear. In this review, we discuss the recent advances pertaining to SOCS dysregulation in leukemia development and progression. We also highlight the roles of specific SOCS in immune cells within the tumor microenvironment and their possible involvement in anti-tumor immunity.

Although regulation of TF procoagulant activity (PCA) involves thiol-disulfide exchange reactions, the specific role of protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and other thiol isomerases in AML-associated TF biology is unclear. THP1 cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy controls or AML patients were analyzed for thiol isomerase-dependent TF production under various experimental conditions. Total cellular and membrane TF antigen, TF PCA and TF mRNA were analyzed by ELISA, flow cytometry, clotting or Xa generation assay and qPCR, respectively. PBMCs and THP1 cells showed significant insulin reductase activity, which was inhibited by bacitracin or rutin. Co-incubation with these thiol isomerase inhibitors prevented LPS-induced TF production by CD14-positive monocytes and constitutive TF expression by THP1 cells and AML blasts. Downregulation of the TF antigen was mainly restricted to the cryptic pool of TF, efficiently preventing phosphatidylserine-dependent TF activation by daunorubicin, and at least partially regulated on the mRNA level in LPS-stimulated monocytes.

Therefore, it is important to better understand how genetic mutations translate to phenotypic features of AML cells to further improve response predictions and to find innovative therapeutic approaches. In this respect, aberrant splicing is a crucial contributor to the pathogenesis of hematological malignancies. Thus far, altered splicing is well characterized in relation to splicing factor mutations in AML. However, splicing profiles associated with mutations in other genes remain largely unexplored. In this study, we explored differential splicing profiles associated with two of the most common aberrations in AML: FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations. Using RNA-sequencing data of a total of 382 primary AML samples, we found that the co-occurrence of FLT3-ITD and mutated NPM1 is associated with differential splicing of FAB-type specific gene sets. Despite the FAB-type specificity of particular gene sets, the primary functions perturbed by differential splicing in all three FAB types include cell cycle control and DNA damage response. Interestingly, we observed functional divergence between alternatively spliced and differentially expressed genes in FLT3-ITD+/NPM1+ samples in all analyzed FAB types, with differential expression affecting genes involved in hematopoietic differentiation.

Circulating IGFs are bound by IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) that regulate their action. IGFBP7 is an IGFBP-related protein (IGFBP-rP) that in contrast to other IGFBPs/IGFBP-rPs features higher affinity for insulin than IGFs and was shown to bind the IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) as well. The role of IGFBP7 in cancer is controversial: on some tumors, it functions as an oncogene, whereas in others, it functions as a tumor suppressor. In childhood ALL, higher IGFBP7 expression levels were associated with worse prognosis. Here we show that IGFBP7 exerts mitogenic and prosurvival autocrine effects on ALL cells that were dependent on insulin/IGF. IGFBP7 knockdown or antibody-mediated neutralization resulted in significant attenuation of ALL cell viability in vitro and leukemia progression in vivo. IGFBP7 was shown to prolong the surface retention of the IGF1R under insulin/IGF1 stimulation, resulting in sustained IGF1R, insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), protein kinase B (AKT), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. Conversely, the insulin receptor was readily internalized and dephosphorylated on insulin stimulation, despite IGFBP7 addition. The affinity of homodimeric IGF1R for insulin is reportedly >100 times lower than for IGF1. In the presence of IGFBP7, however, 25 ng/mL insulin resulted in IGF1R activation levels equivalent to that of 5 ng/mL IGF1. In conclusion, IGFBP7 plays an oncogenic role in ALL by promoting the perdurance of IGF1R at the cell surface, prolonging insulin/IGF stimulation.

The aim of this work was to develop recommendations for TKI discontinuation in Latin America (LA), outside of clinical trials. A working group of CML experts from LA discussed 22 questions regarding TFR and reached a consensus for TFR recommendations in the region. TFR is indicated in patients in first chronic phase, with typical BCR-ABL transcripts, under TKI treatment of a minimum of 5 years, in sustained deep molecular response (DMR; molecular response 4.5 [MR4.5]) for 2 years. Sustained DMR must be demonstrated on at least 4 international reporting scale quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, separated by at least 3 months, in the immediate prior 2 years. After second-line therapy, TFR is indicated in previously intolerant, not resistant, patients. Molecular monitoring is recommended monthly for the first 6 months, every 2 to 3 months from months 7 to 12, and every 3 months during the second year, indefinitely. Treatment should be reintroduced if major molecular response is lost. Monitoring of withdrawal syndrome, glucose levels, and lipid profile is recommended after discontinuation. After TKI reintroduction, molecular monitoring is indicated every 2 to 3 months until MR4.0 achievement; later, every 3 to 6 months. For the TFR attempt, having standardized and reliable BCR-ABL PCR tests is mandatory. These recommendations will be useful for safe discontinuation in daily practice and will benefit patients who wish to stop treatment in emergent regions, in particular, with TKI-related chronic adverse events.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

Here we analyzed in a large chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cohort (n = 80) the inter-patient variability in CLL cell count reduction within the first 24 h of rituximab administration in vivo, and a phenomenon of blood repopulation by malignant cells after anti-CD20 antibody therapy. Larger CLL cell elimination after rituximab infusion was associated with lower pre-therapy CLL cell counts, higher CD20 levels, and the non-exhausted capacity of complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). The absolute amount of cell-surface CD20 molecules (CD20 density x CLL lymphocytosis) was a predictor for complement exhaustion during therapy. We also describe that a highly variable decrease in CLL cell counts at 5 h (88 %-2%) following rituximab infusion is accompanied in most patients by peripheral blood repopulation with CLL cells at 24 h, and in approximately 20 % of patients, this resulted in CLL counts higher than before therapy. We provide evidence that CLL cells recrudescence is linked with i) CDC exhaustion, which leads to the formation of an insufficient amount of membrane attack complexes, likely resulting in temporary retention of surviving rituximab-opsonized cells by the mononuclear-phagocyte system (followed by their release back to blood), and ii) CLL cells regression from immune niches (CXCR4(dim)CD5(bright) intraclonal subpopulation). Patients with major peripheral blood CLL cell repopulation exhibited a longer time-to-progression after chemoimmunotherapy compared to patients with lower or no repopulation, suggesting chemotherapy vulnerability of CLL cells that repopulate the blood.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study aimed to assess the impact of CLL on clinical outcomes and resource utilization after cardiac operations in a nationally representative cohort. METHODS: All adult patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting, valve repair, or valve replacement were identified utilizing the 2010 to 2017 Nationwide Readmissions Database. Patients were stratified by history of CLL. Incidence of in-hospital mortality, perioperative complications, blood transfusions, and readmission within 90 days were examined. We subsequently performed 3:1 nearest neighbor matching between CLL and non-CLL patients for all primary and secondary outcomes of interest. RESULTS: Of an estimated 1,250,882 patients undergoing cardiac operations, 0.23% had a diagnosis of CLL. Among 11,237 propensity matched patients, those with CLL had similar rates of in-hospital mortality (3.8% vs 2.6%; P = .08) and perioperative complications (33.4% vs 33.6%; P = .92) compared with their non-CLL counterparts. Although the incidence of infection was comparable (8.5% vs 9.4%; P = .38), CLL patients did require blood transfusions more frequently (33.7% vs 28.4%; P = .003) than others. Furthermore, CLL patients were more likely to be readmitted with respiratory etiologies contributing significantly to rehospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CLL generally have similar outcomes after cardiac operations but may more commonly require blood transfusion. Blood-conserving interventions may be considered in this at-risk population to improve outcomes.

Hence, we performed herein a systemic literature review and meta-analysis to comprehensively address the prognostic value of MRD in Ph+ ALL. Systematic literature review was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases with the data access date up to September 23, 2020. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with fixed-effects or random-effects models. Furthermore, subgroup analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the associations. 27 studies with a total number of 3289 patients were eligible for this meta-analysis. Combined HRs suggested that MRD positivity was associated with inferior event-free survival (EFS) (HR = 2.00, 95% CI 1.77-2.26) and overall survival (OS) (HR = 2.34, 95% CI 1.86-2.95). The associations remained statistically significant in subgroup analyses including age group, MRD timing, disease status at MRD, MRD cutoff level, et al.

Recently, several nonconventional frontline AML regimens, including hypomethylating agents, the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax, and targeted therapies, have emerged, and they may offer new options for older adults. This study was aimed at describing treatment patterns and outcomes of older adult AML in a modern population-based cohort. METHODS: This study evaluated patients aged >/=60 years with a first primary diagnosis of AML (2014-2017) in the California Cancer Registry linked to inpatient hospitalizations. Multivariable regression examined factors associated with the frontline treatment regimen and survival. RESULTS: In all, 3068 patients were included; 36% received frontline therapy with a conventional chemotherapy backbone, 42% received nonconventional therapy, and 22% received no treatment. The use of nonconventional therapy increased over time from 38% of patients in 2014 to 47% in 2017 (P < .001). In multivariable analyses, receipt of treatment was associated with an age younger than 80 years, fewer than 2 comorbidities, and care at a National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center (NCI-CC). Compared with conventional chemotherapy, nonconventional therapy was associated with Black race/ethnicity, public health insurance, fewer hospital admissions, and fewer inpatient days. Receiving frontline therapy at an NCI-CC was independently associated with superior overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: Using a population-based approach, this study has demonstrated that patterns of care for frontline AML treatment in older adults are changing, with increasing use of nonconventional therapies. A significant proportion of older adults remain untreated. At the population level, there remain opportunities to increase therapy access for older adults with AML.",['(c) 2021 American Cancer Society.'],"['Kennedy, Vanessa E', 'Keegan, Theresa H M', 'Li, Qian', 'Maguire, Frances B', 'Muffly, Lori S']","['Kennedy VE', 'Keegan THM', 'Li Q', 'Maguire FB', 'Muffly LS']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1912-4076', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1961-4008', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8490-6229']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California.', 'Center for Oncology Hematology Outcomes Research and Training, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, California.', 'Center for Oncology Hematology Outcomes Research and Training, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, California.', 'California Cancer Reporting and Epidemiologic Surveillance Program, University of California Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center, Sacramento, California.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, California.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'older adults', 'patterns of care']",2021/08/27 06:00,2021/08/27 06:00,['2021/08/26 12:39'],"['2021/07/09 00:00 [revised]', '2021/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/27 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/26 12:39 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.33873 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2022 Jan 1;128(1):139-149. doi: 10.1002/cncr.33873.

Additionally, SERBP1 is upregulated in glioblastoma, leukemia as well as liver, prostrate and ovarian cancers where it has been implicated in metastatic disease and poor patient outcomes. SERBP1 binds target mRNA, stabilizing and regulating the post-translational expression of the transcript. Since SERBP1 lacks canonical RNA-binding motifs such as RRM domains or zinc fingers, its target recognition and binding mechanisms are not well understood. Recent reports suggest that it is capable of recognizing both RNA sequence motifs and structured domains. Here we report the production and purification of the intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain of SERBP1, the assignment of the (1)H, (13)C, (15)N backbone resonances of the protein by solution-state NMR, and secondary structure predictions. We show that the protein is not entirely disordered and identify an alpha-helix that was stable under the experimental conditions. This work is the first step toward understanding the structural basis underpinning the molecular mechanisms of SERBP1 functions, particularly interactions with mRNA targets.","['(c) 2021.

Pro-differentiation approaches have thus far yielded clinical success in the reversion of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL), and new developments are fast widening their therapeutic applicability to solid carcinomas. Recent advances in cancer differentiation discussed here highlight the potential and outstanding challenges of differentiation-based approaches.","['(c) 2021 The Author(s).

Three of the isolated compounds (1, 3 and 6) are characterized by the unusual aglycone of new type having 18(20)-ether bond and lacking a lactone in contrast with wide spread holostane derivatives. Another unexpected finding is 3-O-methylxylose residue as a terminal unit in the carbohydrate chains of chitonoidosides B (3), C (4), and E (6), which has never been found before in the glycosides from holothurians belonging to the Psolidae family. Moreover, this monosaccharide is sulfated in the compound 4 into unprecedented 3-O-methylxylose 4-O-sulfate residue. Chitonoidoside C (4) is characterized by tetrasaccharide moiety lacking a part of the bottom semi-chain, but having disaccharide fragment attached to C-4 of Xyl1. Such architecture is not common in sea cucumber glycosides. Cytotoxic activities of the compounds 1-5 against mouse and human erythrocytes and human cancer cell lines: adenocarcinoma HeLa, colorectal adenocarcinoma DLD-1, and leukemia promyeloblast HL-60 cells were studied. The cytotoxic effect of chitonoidoside d (5) was the most significant in this series due to the presence of pentasaccharide disulfated sugar chain in combination with holostane aglycone. Surprisingly, the glycosides 1 and 3, comprising the new aglycone without gamma-lactone, demonstrated similar activity to the known compounds with holostane aglycones. Chitonoidoside C (4) was less cytotoxic due to the different architecture of the carbohydrate chain compared to the other glycosides and probably due to the presence of a sulfate group at C-4 in 3-O-MeXyl4.",,"['Silchenko, Alexandra S', 'Kalinovsky, Anatoly I', 'Avilov, Sergey A', 'Andrijaschenko, Pelageya V', 'Popov, Roman S', 'Dmitrenok, Pavel S', 'Chingizova, Ekaterina A', 'Kalinin, Vladimir I']","['Silchenko AS', 'Kalinovsky AI', 'Avilov SA', 'Andrijaschenko PV', 'Popov RS', 'Dmitrenok PS', 'Chingizova EA', 'Kalinin VI']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-4416-7844'],"['G.B.

We analyzed real-life data collected in two major pediatric cancer centers over a period of 4 years. Patients were identified in an observational study on children with acute leukemia and lymphoma or undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation. Out of 438 patients, 19 patients received 21 episodes of antifungal combination therapy. Therapy was mostly started for sepsis (n = 5) or clinical deterioration with pulmonary infiltrates (n = 10), and less often for periorbital swelling with suspected mold infection (n = 2), clinical deterioration and new skin lesions, secondary antifungal prophylaxis, a persistently elevated galactomannan index, or as pre-emptive treatment (n = 1 each). Diagnostics revealed proven, probable, and possible invasive fungal disease in two, seven and four episodes, respectively. Most regimens included caspofungin (n = 19), and treatment was initiated as first line therapy in 10 episodes. The median duration was 13 days (4-46 days). Nine of the 13 patients with proven, probable, or possible invasive fungal disease survived, which was comparable to patients receiving antifungal monotherapy.

These interactions, which are deeply reorganized in tumors, contribute to LSC resistance to chemotherapy and leukemia relapse. However, LSC adhesion mechanisms and potential therapeutic disruption using blocking antibodies remain largely unknown. Junctional adhesion molecule C (JAM-C, also known as JAM3) overexpression by LSCs correlates with increased leukemia severity, and thus constitutes a putative therapeutic target. Here, we took advantage of the ability of nanoscopy to detect single molecules with nanometric accuracy to characterize junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) dynamics at leuko-stromal contacts. Videonanoscopy trajectories were reconstructed using our dedicated multi-target tracing algorithm, pipelined with dual-color analyses (MTT2col). JAM-C expressed by LSCs engaged in transient interactions with JAM-B (also known as JAM2) expressed by stromal cells. JAM recruitment and colocalization at cell contacts were proportional to JAM-C level and reduced by a blocking anti-JAM-C antibody.

Despite remarkable improvements in the treatment outcome in paediatric ALL over the past several decades, it remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children. Cytokines have been extensively studied in haematologic diseases; however, the mechanisms by which cytokines contribute to ALL pathogenesis remain poorly understood. METHODS: IL-33 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). IL1RL1 expression on ALL cell surface was accessed by flow cytometry. Expression of phosphorylated p38 MAPK, p38, pAKT, AKT and GAPDH were quantified by western blot. Cell survival signals were evaluated by apoptosis using flow cytometry. RESULTS: BM samples from ALL patients at diagnosis upregulated their cell surface expression of IL1RL1, and a higher interleukin (IL)-33 level in the serum was observed as compared to the healthy individuals. Moreover, exogenous IL-33 treatment significantly inhibited apoptosis by activating p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and AKT pathway, while the inhibitor for p38 MAPK, SB203580, counteracted IL-33-induced anti-apoptosis via inactivation of p38 MAPK and AKT. Furthermore, IL-33 negatively regulates cyclin B1 protein level while increasing the expression of CDK1, with SB203580 inhibiting the effect. CONCLUSION: Our study reveals an important role for IL-33/IL1RL1 axis in supporting ALL which may represent a novel treatment for paediatric patients.KEY MESSAGESBoth IL-33 and IL1RL1 levels are upregulated in primary ALL samples.IL-33 increased both p38 MAPK and AKT activation in ALL.IL-33 promotes survival and cell cycle progression of ALL cells via activating p38 MAPK.",,"['Wang, Yiqian', 'Hou, Hanyi', 'Liang, Zhongping', 'Chen, Xuexin', 'Lian, Xindan', 'Yang, Jie', 'Zhu, Zeyu', 'Luo, Huanmin', 'Su, Haibo', 'Gong, Qing']","['Wang Y', 'Hou H', 'Liang Z', 'Chen X', 'Lian X', 'Yang J', 'Zhu Z', 'Luo H', 'Su H', 'Gong Q']",,"['The Sixed Affiliated Hospital, GMU-GIBH Joint School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'The Second Clinical Medicine School, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, the Sixth Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'The Sixed Affiliated Hospital, GMU-GIBH Joint School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'School of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'School of Pediatrics, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'KingMed School of Laboratory Medicine, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'The Third Clinical Medicine School, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'The Sixed Affiliated Hospital, GMU-GIBH Joint School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'The Sixed Affiliated Hospital, GMU-GIBH Joint School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ann Med,Annals of medicine,8906388,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*AKT', '*ALL', '*IL-33', '*IL1RL1', '*P38 MAPK', '*anti-apoptosis']",2021/08/27 06:00,2021/12/28 06:00,['2021/08/26 08:42'],"['2021/08/26 08:42 [entrez]', '2021/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/07853890.2021.1970217 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Med. 2021 Dec;53(1):1461-1469. doi: 10.1080/07853890.2021.1970217.,,20211227,"['0 (IL33 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-33)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']","['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Child', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-33/blood/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",PMC8405111,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: To verify the role of BM-MSCs in H pylori-associated GC, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labelled BM-MSCs were transplanted into the subserosal layers of the stomach in a mouse model of chronic H pylori infection. Three months post-transplantation, the mice were sacrificed, and the gastric tissues were subjected to histopathological and immunofluorescence analyses. In addition, we performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunofluorescence analyses of gastric tissue from a female patient with H pylori infection and a history of acute myeloid leukaemia who received a BM transplant from a male donor. RESULTS: In mice with chronic H pylori infection, GFP-labelled BM-MSCs migrated from the serous layer to the mucosal layer and promoted GC progression. The BM-MSCs differentiated into pan-cytokeratin-positive epithelial cells and alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) by secreting the protein thrombospondin-2. FISH analysis of gastric tissue from the female patient revealed Y-chromosome-positive cells. Immunofluorescence analyses further confirmed that Y-chromosome-positive cells showed positive BM-MSCs marker. These results suggested that allogeneic BMDCs, including BM-MSCs, can migrate to the stomach under chronic H pylori infection. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these findings imply that BM-MSCs participate in the development of chronic H pylori-associated GC by differentiating into both gastric epithelial cells and CAFs.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

A defect in B-cell development can lead to immunodeficiency or malignant disorders, such as leukaemia or lymphoma. Long non-coding RNAs have been reported to act as important regulators of many pathological processes. However, very little is known regarding the role of lncRNAs during B-cell development and the regulation of their expression. In this study, we explored the expression and role of lncRNA Gme00492 in B-cell development. We observed that lnc00492 was highly expressed in B-cell development and primarily expressed in the nucleus. Lnc00492-deficient mice had fewer marginal zone B cells in the spleen, likely due to a developmental block. Importantly, lnc00492 interacts with CTBP1 and targets it for ubiquitination and degradation during B-cell development, whereas the transcriptional corepressor factor CTBP1 plays a critical role in Notch2 signalling. Thus, we identified a novel regulatory axis between lnc00492 and CTBP1 in B cells, suggesting that lnc00492 is essential for marginal zone B-cell development.",['(c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Wang, Faming', 'Cui, Dongya', 'Zhang, Qingyun', 'Shao, Yingying', 'Zheng, Baijiao', 'Chen, Liling', 'Luo, Yao', 'Yuan, Liudi', 'Wang, Demin']","['Wang F', 'Cui D', 'Zhang Q', 'Shao Y', 'Zheng B', 'Chen L', 'Luo Y', 'Yuan L', 'Wang D']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5360-7285'],"['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical School of Southeast University, Nanjing, China.', 'Biomedical Research Center of South China, Fujian Normal University, Fuzhou, China.', 'The Key Laboratories of Innate Immune Biology of Fujian Province, Fuzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Developmental Genes and Human Disease, Ministry of Education, Institute of Life Sciences, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Developmental Genes and Human Disease, Ministry of Education, Institute of Life Sciences, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.', 'Biomedical Research Center of South China, Fujian Normal University, Fuzhou, China.', 'The Key Laboratories of Innate Immune Biology of Fujian Province, Fuzhou, China.', 'Biomedical Research Center of South China, Fujian Normal University, Fuzhou, China.', 'The Key Laboratories of Innate Immune Biology of Fujian Province, Fuzhou, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical School of Southeast University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical School of Southeast University, Nanjing, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Developmental Genes and Human Disease, Ministry of Education, Institute of Life Sciences, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.', 'Blood Research Institute, Blood Center of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.']",['eng'],['KYCX19_0114/Graduate Research and Innovation Projects of Jiangsu Province'],['Journal Article'],England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell development', 'CTBP1', 'Lnc00492', 'marginal zone B cells', 'notch2 signalling']",2021/08/27 06:00,2021/08/27 06:00,['2021/08/26 06:27'],"['2021/08/05 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/27 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/26 06:27 [entrez]']",['10.1111/imm.13408 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunology. 2022 Jan;165(1):88-98. doi: 10.1111/imm.13408.

Among signaling pathways involved in AML, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is of particular importance. While dysregulation of mTOR signaling has been reported in a wide range of patients with AML, but most studies have focused on mTOR downstream targets, and mTOR upstream targets have been overlooked. Objective: In this study, expression of mTOR genes and three upstream targets (5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK, adiponectin, and sestrin 2) involved in mTOR signaling was investigated. Materials and Methods: In this study, expression of mTOR, AMPK, sestrin 2, and adiponectin genes in 60 patients with AML were evaluated compared to those of 30 healthy individuals as controls using the Real-Time polymerase chain reaction (Real-Time RT-PCR) method. Results: According to the results, there was a significant difference in the expression of all the studied genes in patients in comparison to the normal control group (P <0.05). Expression of the mTOR gene was increased, while expression of AMPK, sestrin 2, and adiponectin genes was decreased in the patients with AML. Mean expression of the genes (2-DeltaCt) (AMPK, sestrin 2, adiponectin, and mTOR) was equal to 7.9, 3.2, 3.74, and 1.49 for controls and 6, 2.1, 2.83, and 2.64 for patients with AML, respectively. Conclusions: Given the decreased expression levels of sestrin 2, adiponectin, and AMPK genes as tumor inhibitors and the increased expression level of the mTOR gene as an oncogene in the patients with AML in our study, it is thought that disruption of this pathway may be involved in leukemogenesis and can be considered as an effective factor in the progression of cancer.",['Copyright: (c) 2021 The Author(s); Published by Iranian Journal of Biotechnology.'],"['Abtahi, Seyed Hossein', 'Mohammadi, Mohammad Hossein', 'Allahbakhshian Farsani, Mehdi', 'Aghelan, Zahra', 'Salari, Sina']","['Abtahi SH', 'Mohammadi MH', 'Allahbakhshian Farsani M', 'Aghelan Z', 'Salari S']",,"['Department of Laboratory Hematology and Blood Bank, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Laboratory Hematology and Blood Bank, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'HSCT Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Science, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Laboratory Hematology and Blood Bank, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'HSCT Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Science, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, School of Medical Siences, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Taleghani Hospital, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Iran,Iran J Biotechnol,Iranian journal of biotechnology,101276796,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'AMPK', 'Adiponectin', 'Sestrin 2', 'mTOR']",2021/08/27 06:00,2021/08/27 06:01,['2021/08/26 06:18'],"['2021/08/26 06:18 [entrez]', '2021/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.30498/IJB.2021.2860 [doi]', 'IJB-19-2 [pii]']",epublish,Iran J Biotechnol. 2021 Apr 1;19(2):e2860. doi: 10.30498/IJB.2021.2860. eCollection 2021 Apr.,20210401,,,,PMC8358177,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most representative causative bacterium is Streptococcus pyogenes, followed by Staphylococcus, Pneumococcus and Enterococcus. Hepatic portal venous gas (HPVG) is considered a potentially fatal condition and is rarely associated with PG. CASE SUMMARY: The white blood cell count of a 70-year-old woman with acute lymphocytic leukemia in complete remission dropped to 100/muL after consolidation chemotherapy. Her vital signs were consistent with septic shock. Venous blood culture revealed the presence of Bacillus cereus. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed marked thickening of the gastric wall. As with the other findings, CT was suggestive of HPVG, and EGD showed pseudomembrane-like tissue covering the superficial mucosa. Histopathological examination of gastric biopsy specimens showed mostly necrotic tissue with lymphocytes rather than neutrophils. Culture of gastric specimens revealed the presence of Bacillus cereus. We finally diagnosed this case as PG with Bacillus cereus-induced sepsis and HPVG. This patient recovered successfully with conservative treatment, chiefly by using carbapenem antibiotics. CONCLUSION: The histopathological finding of this gastric biopsy specimen should be called ""neutropenic necrotizing gastritis"".","['(c)The Author(s) 2021.

Invasive fungal infections usually occur in these patients, especially those who have had hematological malignances and received chemotherapy. Fusariosis is a rare pathogenic fungus, it can lead to severely invasive Fusarium infections. Along with the increased rate of immune compromised patients, the incidence of invasive Fusarium infections has also increased from the past few years. Early diagnosis and therapy are important to prevent further development to a more aggressive or disseminated infection. CASE SUMMARY: We report a case of a 19-year-old male acute B-lymphocytic leukemia patient with fungal infection in the skin, eyeball, and knee joint during the course of chemotherapy. We performed skin biopsy, microbial cultivation, and molecular biological identification, and the pathogenic fungus was finally confirmed to be Fusarium solani. The patient was treated with oral 200 mg voriconazole twice daily intravenous administration of 100 mg liposomal amphotericin B once daily, and surgical debridement. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was administered to expedite neutrophil recovery. The disseminated Fusarium solani infection eventually resolved, and there was no recurrence at the 3 mo follow-up. CONCLUSION: Our case illustrates the early detection and successful intervention of a systemic invasive Fusarium infection. These are important to prevent progression to a more aggressive infection.

RUNX1 mutations, including chromosomal translocations, cause abnormal cell differentiation, but the mutation alone is not sufficient to cause leukemia. In MLL-fusion-induced leukemia, dysregulated wild-type RUNX1 can promote leukemia survival. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms of dysregulated wild-type RUNX1 in leukemia development have not been fully elucidated. This study overexpressed and knocked down RUNX1 expression in THP-1 human leukemia cells and CD34(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells to investigate the biological functions affected by dysregulated RUNX1. Our data indicated RUNX1 facilitated proliferation to promote leukemia cell growth. Furthermore, we demonstrated that RUNX1 knockdown in leukemia cells drastically diminished colony-forming ability. Finally, the RUNX1-knocked down cell depletion phenotype could be rescued by overexpression of CENPE, a cell proliferation gene and a RUNX1 direct target gene. Our results indicate a possible mechanism involving the RUNX1-CENPE axis on promoting leukemic cell growth.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Liu, Yang, Sun, Zhang, Cheng, Xu, Yen and Lu.']","['Liu, Shan', 'Yang, Jianyu', 'Sun, Guohuan', 'Zhang, Yawen', 'Cheng, Cong', 'Xu, Jin', 'Yen, Kuangyu', 'Lu, Ting']","['Liu S', 'Yang J', 'Sun G', 'Zhang Y', 'Cheng C', 'Xu J', 'Yen K', 'Lu T']",,"['School of Biology and Biological Engineering, Southern China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Developmental Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Division of Cell, Developmental and Integrative, School of Medicine, Southern China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Developmental Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Mol Biosci,Frontiers in molecular biosciences,101653173,,['NOTNLM'],"['Runx1', 'apoptosis', 'cell cycle', 'differentiation potential', 'leukemia cell']",2021/08/27 06:00,2021/08/27 06:01,['2021/08/26 06:17'],"['2021/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/26 06:17 [entrez]', '2021/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fmolb.2021.692880 [doi]', '692880 [pii]']",epublish,Front Mol Biosci. 2021 Aug 9;8:692880. doi: 10.3389/fmolb.2021.692880. eCollection 2021.,20210809,,,,PMC8381024,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), on the other hand, are a spectrum of clonal myeloid disorders, with a higher risk of acute leukemia, characterized by ineffective bone marrow (BM) hematopoiesis and, thus, peripheral blood (PB) cytopenias. Immune deregulation is thought to take part in the pathophysiology of the disease, including abnormal T and/or B cell responses, innate immunity, and cytokine expression. In the literature, there are a few case reports of patients with MDS that have presented pulmonary infiltrates and were diagnosed as having AFOP or organizing pneumonia (OP). It is rare, though, to have isolated pulmonary infiltrates without Sweet's syndrome or even the pulmonary infiltrates to precede the diagnosis and treatment of MDS, which was our case. We present a 72-year-old female developing new lung infiltrates refractory to antibiotic treatment that responded well to corticosteroids and was histologically described as having OP. The treatment was gradually successfully switched to mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). The patient was later diagnosed with MDS. This interesting case report suggests firstly that a diagnosis of AFOP or OP should alert the clinician to search for an underlying cause including MDS and vice versa, the use of systemic steroids should not be postponed, and, finally, that MMF can successfully be used in these patients.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Bizymi, Pitsidianakis, Ierodiakonou, Stathakis, Vasarmidi,', 'Hiraki, Bolaki, Karagiannis, Fanaridis, Liopyrakis, Marinos, Xilouri, Antoniou', 'and Tzanakis.']","['Bizymi, Nikoleta', 'Pitsidianakis, Georgios', 'Ierodiakonou, Despo', 'Stathakis, Georgios', 'Vasarmidi, Eirini', 'Hiraki, Stavroti', 'Bolaki, Maria', 'Karagiannis, Konstantinos', 'Fanaridis, Michail', 'Liopyrakis, Konstantinos', 'Marinos, Leonidas', 'Xilouri, Irini', 'Antoniou, Katerina M', 'Tzanakis, Nikolaos']","['Bizymi N', 'Pitsidianakis G', 'Ierodiakonou D', 'Stathakis G', 'Vasarmidi E', 'Hiraki S', 'Bolaki M', 'Karagiannis K', 'Fanaridis M', 'Liopyrakis K', 'Marinos L', 'Xilouri I', 'Antoniou KM', 'Tzanakis N']",,"['Department of Respiratory Medicine, University Hospital of Heraklion, Heraklion, Greece.', 'Hemopoiesis Research Laboratory, School of Medicine, University of Crete and Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Heraklion, Heraklion, Greece.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, University Hospital of Heraklion, Heraklion, Greece.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, University Hospital of Heraklion, Heraklion, Greece.', 'Department of Primary care and Population Health, University of Nicosia Medical School, Nicosia, Cyprus.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, University Hospital of Heraklion, Heraklion, Greece.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, University Hospital of Heraklion, Heraklion, Greece.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, University Hospital of Heraklion, Heraklion, Greece.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, University Hospital of Heraklion, Heraklion, Greece.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, University Hospital of Heraklion, Heraklion, Greece.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, University Hospital of Heraklion, Heraklion, Greece.', 'Hemopoiesis Research Laboratory, School of Medicine, University of Crete and Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Heraklion, Heraklion, Greece.', 'Department of Hemopathology, Evangelismos General Hospital, Athens, Greece.', 'Hemopoiesis Research Laboratory, School of Medicine, University of Crete and Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Heraklion, Heraklion, Greece.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, University Hospital of Heraklion, Heraklion, Greece.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, University Hospital of Heraklion, Heraklion, Greece.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],Switzerland,Front Med (Lausanne),Frontiers in medicine,101648047,,['NOTNLM'],"['corticosteroid-therapy', 'immune deregulation', 'mycophenolate mofetil', 'myelodysplastic syndrome', 'pulmonary infiltrates']",2021/08/27 06:00,2021/08/27 06:01,['2021/08/26 06:17'],"['2021/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/26 06:17 [entrez]', '2021/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/27 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmed.2021.673573 [doi]'],epublish,Front Med (Lausanne). 2021 Aug 9;8:673573. doi: 10.3389/fmed.2021.673573. eCollection 2021.,20210809,,,,PMC8380831,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the aggressive nature of this tumor, patients may present with nodal and distal metastasis. Locoregional disease can be managed with definitive radiotherapy or surgery with or without adjuvant radiotherapy, depending on the case. Disseminated disease, on the other hand, often requires a multidisciplinary tumor board consultation to individually tailor the treatment. Possible treatments include systemic therapy with chemotherapy or immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery. Here we report a case of a patient with a medical history significant for chronic lymphocytic leukemia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who presented with a rapidly growing lesion that contained neighboring MCC and CLL/SLL on biopsy. Management included immunotherapy with pembrolizumab and radiotherapy to limit the tumor's growth and spread.

The disease typically manifests in three phases: chronic course followed by an accelerated phase and finally a terminal blast crisis. A blast crisis is defined as the presence of > 20% blasts in the peripheral blood or bone marrow. The blasts could be characterized as either myeloid (60-80% of cases) resulting in acute myeloblastic leukemia or lymphoid (20-30% of cases) resulting in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In rare instances, a blast crisis could present with biphenotypic expression for both myeloid and lymphoid blasts. In such cases, about 6-10% of the time, the course of the disease is more aggressive and renders a poorer prognosis especially if there is evidence of extramedullary involvement. We present a case of a 41-year-old woman with history of CML who presented with acute biphenotypic blast crisis with extramedullary involvement in the context of aggressive chemotherapy.

In 2019, a total of 12,323 cases of HSCT were reported from 149 transplant teams, 78% (9597 cases) were allogeneic HSCTs. Haploidentical donor (HID) HSCT accounted for 60% (5771 cases) of allogeneic HSCT. The most common indications for allogeneic HSCT for malignant disease were acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (37%) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (24%), and the largest proportion of non-malignant diseases comprised aplastic anemia (AA) (13%). Multiple stem cell source composed 70% of HID and 28% of MSD, which was typical in China. The BuCy based regimen (59%) was the most popular conditioning regimen for allogeneic HSCT, followed by the BuFlu based regimen (23%) and TBI-based regimen (12%).

Previous studies showed that this stimulated coupling between Lyn and FcepsilonRI occurs in liquid ordered (Lo)-like nanodomains of the plasma membrane and that Lyn binds directly to cytosolic segments of FcepsilonRI that it initially phosphorylates for amplified activity. Net phosphorylation above a nonfunctional threshold is achieved in the stimulated state but not in the resting state, and current evidence supports the hypothesis that this relies on Ag crosslinking to disrupt a balance between Lyn and tyrosine phosphatase activities. However, the structural interactions that underlie the stimulation process remain poorly defined. This study evaluates the relative contributions and functional importance of different types of interactions leading to suprathreshold phosphorylation of Ag-crosslinked IgE-FcepsilonRI in live rat basophilic leukemia mast cells. Our high-precision diffusion measurements by imaging fluorescence correlation spectroscopy on multiple structural variants of Lyn and other lipid-anchored probes confirm subtle, stimulated stabilization of the Lo-like nanodomains in the membrane inner leaflet and concomitant sharpening of segregation from liquid disordered (Ld)-like regions.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) downregulates the expression of argininosuccinate synthase (ASS1), a recognized rate-limiting enzyme for arginine synthesis, and yet displays a critical dependence on extracellular arginine for survival and proliferation. This dependence on extracellular arginine, also known as arginine auxotrophy, suggests that arginine deprivation would be a treatment strategy for AML. NEI-01, a novel arginine-depleting enzyme, is capable of binding to serum albumin to extend its circulating half-life, leading to a potent anticancer activity. Here we reported the preclinical activity of NEI-01 in arginine auxotrophic AMLs. NEI-01 efficiently depleted arginine both in vitro and in vivo NEI-01-induced arginine deprivation was cytotoxic to arginine auxotrophic AML cells through induction of cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, the potent anti-leukemia activities of NEI-01 were observed in three different types of mouse models including human cell line-derived xenograft, mouse cell line-derived homografts in syngeneic mice and patient-derived xenograft.

In comparison with pediatric patients, where responses are maintained over many years, older patients, such as those with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma (MM), present lower persistence of CAR-T cells that might be due to decreased fitness of T cells acquired with aging. Moreover, cord blood derived-NK cells (CB-NKs) and CAR-NK cells derived from CB-NK can be used 'off-the-shelf' as immune cells with antitumor properties for the treatment of cancer patients. However, to date, clinical studies have only demonstrated the safety of these therapies but not optimal efficacy. To confront the shortcomings of each therapy, we devised a novel approach consisting of simultaneous (CAR-)NK cell and CAR-T cell administration. In this setting, NK cells demonstrate an important immunoregulation of T cells that could be exploited to enhance the efficacy of CAR-T cells. METHODS: A combinatorial treatment based on either CAR-T and CAR-NK cells or CB-NK and CAR-T cells in two models of NHL and MM was performed. Antitumor efficacy was analyzed in vitro and in vivo, and parameters related to early activation, exhaustion and senescence of T cells were analyzed. RESULTS: We show that CAR-NK cells derived from CB-NK are only effective at high doses (high E:T ratio) and that their activity rapidly decreases over time in comparison with CAR-T cells. In comparison and to exploit the potential of 'off-the-shelf' CB-NK, we demonstrate that a low number of CB-NK in the CAR-T cell product promotes an early activation of CAR-T cells and their migration to MM cells leading to enhanced anti-MM efficacy. Moreover, cytokines related to CRS development were not increased, and importantly, CB-NK enhanced the fitness of both CAR(pos) and CAR(neg) T cells, promoting lower levels of exhaustion and senescence. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a relevant immunoregulatory role of CB-NK collaborating with CAR-T cells to enhance their antitumor activity. A novel and different approach to consider in CAR-T cell immunotherapy studies is presented here with the goal to enhance the efficacy of the treatment.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

However, the efficacy of TKIs varies for reasons yet to be fully elucidated. As NK cell activity is modulated by interactions between their killer cell Ig-like receptors (KIRs) and HLAs of target cells, the combination of their polymorphisms may have functional significance. We previously showed that allelic polymorphisms of KIR3DL1 and HLAs were associated with the prognosis of TKI-treated CML patients. In this study, we focus on differential NK cell activity modulation through KIR3DL1 allotypes. KIR3DL1 expression levels varied according to their alleles. The combination of KIR3DL1 expression level and HLA-Bw4 motifs defined NK cell activity in response to the CML-derived K562 cell line, and Ab-mediated KIR3DL1 blocking reversed this activity. The TKI dasatinib enhanced NK cell activation and cytotoxicity in a KIR3DL1 allotype-dependent manner but did not significantly decrease effector regulatory T cells, suggesting that it directly activated NK cells. Dasatinib also enhanced NK cell cytotoxicity against K562 bearing the BCR-ABL1 T315I TKI resistance-conferring mutation, depending on KIR3DL1/HLA-Bw4 allotypes. Transduction of KIR3DL1*01502 into the NK cell line NK-92 resulted in KIR3DL1 expression and suppression of NK-92 activity by HLA-B ligation, which was reversed by anti-KIR3DL1 Ab. Finally, KIR3DL1 expression levels also defined activation patterns in CML patient-derived NK cells. Our findings raise the possibility of a novel strategy to enhance antitumor NK cell immunity against CML in a KIR3DL1 allotype-dependent manner.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors.'],"['Izumi, Kiyotaka', 'Shindo, Takero', 'Ngo, Huong Thi', 'Nakayama-Hosoya, Kaori', 'Akahane, Koshi', 'Tamai, Minori', 'Nguyen, Thao T T', 'Kawana-Tachikawa, Ai', 'Inukai, Takeshi', 'Takaori-Kondo, Akifumi']","['Izumi K', 'Shindo T', 'Ngo HT', 'Nakayama-Hosoya K', 'Akahane K', 'Tamai M', 'Nguyen TTT', 'Kawana-Tachikawa A', 'Inukai T', 'Takaori-Kondo A']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2085-6151', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5093-167X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3082-5324', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7678-4284']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan; takeros@kuhp.kyoto-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'AIDS Research Center, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan; and.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Chuo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Chuo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Chuo, Japan.', 'AIDS Research Center, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan; and.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Chuo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Immunohorizons,ImmunoHorizons,101708159,IM,,,2021/08/27 06:00,2021/08/27 06:00,['2021/08/26 05:36'],"['2021/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/26 05:36 [entrez]', '2021/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/27 06:00 [medline]']","['immunohorizons.2100054 [pii]', '10.4049/immunohorizons.2100054 [doi]']",epublish,Immunohorizons. 2021 Aug 25;5(8):687-702. doi: 10.4049/immunohorizons.2100054.,20210825,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we present the protocol for a systematic review of the scientific literature on cancer hazards from exposure to RF-EMF in humans, commissioned by the WHO as part of that project. OBJECTIVE: To assess the quality and strength of the evidence provided by human observational studies for a causal association between exposure to RF-EMF and risk of neoplastic diseases. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We will include cohort and case-control studies investigating neoplasia risks in relation to three types of exposure to RF-EMF: near-field, head-localized, exposure from wireless phone use (SR-A); far-field, whole body, environmental exposure from fixed-site transmitters (SR-B); near/far-field occupational exposures from use of handheld transceivers or RF-emitting equipment in the workplace (SR-C). While no restriction on tumour type will be applied, we will focus on selected neoplasms of the central nervous system (brain, meninges, pituitary gland, acoustic nerve) and salivary gland tumours (SR-A); brain tumours and leukaemias (SR-B, SR-C). INFORMATION SOURCES: Eligible studies will be identified through Medline, Embase, and EMF-Portal. RISK-OF-BIAS ASSESSMENT: We will use a tailored version of the OHAT's tool to evaluate the study's internal validity. DATA SYNTHESIS: We will consider separately studies on different tumours, neoplasm-specific risks from different exposure sources, and a given exposure-outcome pair in adults and children. When a quantitative synthesis of findings can be envisaged, the main aims of the meta-analysis will be to assess the strength of association and the shape of the exposure-response relationship; to quantify the degree of heterogeneity across studies; and explore the sources of inconsistency (if any). When a meta-analysis is judged inappropriate, we will perform a narrative synthesis, complemented by a structured tabulation of results and appropriate visual displays. EVIDENCE ASSESSMENT: Confidence in evidence will be assessed in line with the GRADE approach. FUNDING: This project is supported by the World Health Organization.

Our analyses of existing data from three widely used single-cell assays for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) show the superior performance of TooManyPeaks in delineating and visualizing pure clusters of rare and abundant subpopulations. Furthermore, the application of TooManyPeaks to new scATAC-seq data from drug-naive and drug-resistant leukemic T cells clearly visualizes relationships among these cells and stratifies a rare ""resistant-like"" drug-naive sub-clone with distinct cis-regulatory elements.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s).

Therapies for MDS are lacking, particularly those that have an impact in the early stages of disease. We developed a model of MDS in zebrafish with knockout of Rps14, the primary mediator of the anemia associated with del(5q) MDS. These mutant animals display dose- and age-dependent abnormalities in hematopoiesis, culminating in bone marrow failure with dysplastic features. We used Rps14 knockdown to undertake an in vivo small-molecule screening, to identify compounds that ameliorate the MDS phenotype, and we identified imiquimod, an agonist of Toll-like receptor-7 (TLR7) and TLR8. Imiquimod alleviates anemia by promoting hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell expansion and erythroid differentiation, the mechanism of which is dependent on TLR7 ligation and Myd88. TLR7 activation in this setting paradoxically promoted an anti-inflammatory gene signature, indicating cross talk via TLR7 between proinflammatory pathways endogenous to Rps14 loss and the NF-kappaB pathway. Finally, in highly purified human bone marrow samples from anemic patients, imiquimod led to an increase in erythroid output from myeloerythroid progenitors and common myeloid progenitors. Our findings have both specific implications for the development of targeted therapeutics for del(5q) MDS and wider significance identifying a potential role for TLR7 ligation in modifying anemia.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

The EASIX (Endothelial Activation and Stress Index) score (lactate dehydrogenase [LDH; U/L] x creatinine [mg/dL]/platelets [PLTs; 109 cells/L]) is a marker of endothelial damage that correlates with outcomes in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Elevated LDH and low PLTs have been associated with severe CRS and ICANS, as has C-reactive protein (CRP), while increased creatinine is seen only in a minority of advanced severe CRS cases. We hypothesized that EASIX and 2 new modified EASIX formulas (simplified EASIX, which excludes creatinine, and modified EASIX [m-EASIX], which replaces creatinine with CRP [mg/dL]), calculated peri-CAR T-cell infusion, would be associated with development of severe (grade >/= 3) CRS and ICANS. We included 118 adults, 53 with B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with 1928z CAR T cells (NCT01044069) and 65 with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel or tisagenlecleucel. The 3 formulas showed similar predictive power for severe CRS and ICANS. However, low PLTs and high CRP values were the only variables individually correlated with these toxicities. Moreover, only m-EASIX was a significant predictor of disease response. m-EASIX could discriminate patients who subsequently developed severe CRS preceding the onset of severe symptoms (area under the curve [AUC] at lymphodepletion, 80.4%; at day -1, 73.0%; and at day +1, 75.4%). At day +3, it also had high discriminatory ability for severe ICANS (AUC, 73%).

Immune escape through overexpression of PD-L1 in JAK2V617F-mutated MPN provides a rationale for therapeutic PD-1 blockade, and indeed, clinical activity of nivolumab in relapsed MPN post-HSCT has been observed. Elucidation of the features of response following PD-1 blockade in such patients could inform novel therapeutic concepts that enhance GVL. Here, we report an integrated high-dimensional analysis using single-cell RNA sequencing, T-cell receptor sequencing, cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq), and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq), together with mass cytometry, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected at 6 timepoints before, during, and after transient response to PD-1 blockade from an index case of relapsed MPN following HSCT. Before nivolumab infusion, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts demonstrated high expression of chemokines, and T cells were characterized by expression of interferon-response genes. This baseline inflammatory signature disappeared after nivolumab infusion. Clinical response was characterized by transient expansion of a polyclonal CD4+ T-cell population and contraction of an AML subpopulation that exhibited megakaryocytic features and elevated PD-L1 expression. At relapse, the proportion of the AML subpopulation with progenitor-like features progressively increased, suggesting coevolution of AML blasts and donor-derived T cells. We thus demonstrate how single-cell technologies can provide complementary insight into cellular mechanisms underlying response to PD-1 blockade, motivating future longitudinal high-dimensional single-cell studies of GVL responses in relapsed myeloid disease.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

However, de novo resistance can result in failure to achieve negative minimal residual disease and predicts poor treatment outcomes. Consequently, additional proapoptotic drugs, such as inhibitors of Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL, are in development. By profiling antiapoptotic proteins using flow cytometry, we find that leukemic B cells that recently emigrated from the lymph node (CD69+/CXCR4Low) in vivo are enriched for cell clusters simultaneously overexpressing multiple antiapoptotic proteins (Mcl-1High/Bcl-xLHigh/Bcl-2High) in both treated and treatment-naive CLL patients. These cells exhibited antiapoptotic resistance to multiple BH-domain antagonists, including inhibitors of Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and Bcl-xL, when tested as single agents in a flow cytometry-based functional assay. Antiapoptotic multidrug resistance declines ex vivo, consistent with resistance being generated in vivo by extrinsic microenvironmental interactions. Surviving ""persister"" cells in patients undergoing venetoclax treatment are enriched for CLL cells displaying the functional and molecular properties of microenvironmentally induced multidrug resistance. Overcoming this resistance required simultaneous inhibition of multiple antiapoptotic proteins, with potential for unwanted toxicities. Using a drug screen performed using patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells cultured in an ex vivo microenvironment model, we identify novel venetoclax drug combinations that induce selective cytotoxicity in multidrug-resistant CLL cells. Thus, we demonstrate that antiapoptotic multidrug-resistant CLL cells exist in patients de novo and show that these cells persist during proapoptotic treatment, such as venetoclax.

The tisagenlecleucel chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) contains a murine single-chain variable fragment domain; we examined the effects of humoral and cellular immune responses to tisagenlecleucel on clinical outcomes using 2 validated assays. Data were pooled from the ELIANA (registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02435849) and ENSIGN (#NCT02228096) trials in r/r B-ALL (N = 143) and the JULIET trial (#NCT02445248) in r/r DLBCL (N = 115). Humoral responses were determined by flow cytometric measurement of anti-murine CAR19 (mCAR19) antibodies in serum. Cellular responses were determined using T-cell production of interferon-gamma in response to 2 different pools of mCAR19 peptides. Pretreatment anti-mCAR19 antibodies were detected in 81% of patients with r/r B-ALL and 94% of patients with r/r DLBCL. Posttreatment anti-mCAR19 antibodies were higher than patient-specific baseline in 42% of r/r B-ALL and 9% of r/r DLBCL patients. Pretreatment and posttreatment anti-mCAR19 antibodies did not affect tisagenlecleucel cellular kinetics, including maximum concentration and persistence (r2 < 0.05), clinical response (day-28 response, duration of response, and event-free survival), and safety. T-cell responses were consistent over time, with net responses <1% at baseline and posttreatment time points in a majority of patients and no effect on transgene expansion or persistence or outcomes. Presence of baseline and/or posttreatment anti-mCAR19 antibodies or T-cell responses did not alter the activity of tisagenlecleucel in patients with r/r B-ALL or r/r DLBCL.","['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.

Interestingly, FX-9 shows no hemolytic activity and low toxicity in benign adherent cells. The detailed FX-9 molecular mode of action is currently not fully understood. But application on neoplastic cells induces pro-apoptotic and antimitotic effects. Canine prostate cancer (cPC) represents a unique spontaneous occurring animal model for human androgen-independent PC. Human androgen-independent PC as well as cPC are currently not satisfactorily treatable with chemotherapeutic protocols. Accordingly, the evaluation of novel agent combinations bears significant potential for identifying novel treatment strategies. In this study, we combined FX-9 with the currently approved therapeutic agents doxorubicin, carboplatin, the demethylating substance azacitidine as well as further potentially antitumorigenic agents such as dichloroacetic acid (DCA) in order to evaluate the respective synergistic potential. The combinations with 1-5 muM FX-9 were evaluated regarding the effect after 72 hours on cell viability, cell count and apoptotic/necrotic cells in two human prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, PC-3) and a canine prostate cancer cell line (Adcarc1258) representing androgen-dependent and -independent PC/cPC forms. FX-9 in combination with azacitidine decreases cell viability and increases cell death with positive Bliss values. Furthermore, this decreases the cell count with neutral Bliss values on PC-3. Carboplatin in combination with FX-9 reduces cell viability with a neutral Bliss value and increases cell death on LNCaP with calculated positive Bliss values. DCA or doxorubicin in combination with FX-9 do not show synergistic or additive effects on the cell viability. Based on these results, azacitidine or carboplatin in combination with FX-9 offers synergistic/additive efficacy against prostate adenocarcinoma cell lines in vitro. The beneficial effects of both combinations are worth further investigation.",,"['Weiner, Franziska', 'Schille, Jan Torben', 'Hein, Jens Ingo', 'Wu, Xiao-Feng', 'Beller, Matthias', 'Junghanss, Christian', 'Murua Escobar, Hugo', 'Nolte, Ingo']","['Weiner F', 'Schille JT', 'Hein JI', 'Wu XF', 'Beller M', 'Junghanss C', 'Murua Escobar H', 'Nolte I']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4577-3739'],"['Small Animal Clinic, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Clinic III, Hematology, Oncology, Palliative Medicine, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany.', 'Small Animal Clinic, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Clinic III, Hematology, Oncology, Palliative Medicine, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany.', 'Small Animal Clinic, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Hannover, Germany.', 'Leibniz Institute for Catalysis, Rostock, Germany.', 'Leibniz Institute for Catalysis, Rostock, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Clinic III, Hematology, Oncology, Palliative Medicine, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Clinic III, Hematology, Oncology, Palliative Medicine, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany.', 'Small Animal Clinic, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,,,2021/08/26 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/08/25 17:25'],"['2021/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/25 17:25 [entrez]', '2021/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0256468 [doi]', 'PONE-D-21-09534 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2021 Aug 25;16(8):e0256468. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0256468. eCollection 2021.,20210825,20211207,"['0 (3-(p-tolyl)isoquinolin-1-amine)', '0 (Androgens)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9LSH52S3LQ (Dichloroacetic Acid)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']","['Androgens/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Azacitidine/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Carboplatin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dichloroacetic Acid/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology']",PMC8386839,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, few studies systematically investigated the expression of NEDD family members in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). We systemically determined the expression of NEDD family members in AML and determined their clinical significance. We identified that NEDD9 expression was the only member among NEDD family which was significantly increased in AML. NEDD9 overexpression was more frequently classified as FAB-M4/M5 (p = 0.008 and 0.013, respectively), hardly as FAB-M2/M3. Moreover, NEDD9 overexpression was significantly associated with complex karyotype and TP53 mutation. The significant association between NEDD9 overexpression and survival was also observed in whole-cohort AML and non-M3 AML patients. Notably, AML patients with NEDD9 overexpression may benefit from hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), whereas those cases without NEDD9 overexpression did not. Finally, a total of 822 mRNAs and 31 microRNAs were found to be differentially expressed between two groups. Among the microRNAs, miR-381 was also identified as a microRNA that could direct target NEDD9. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that NEDD9 overexpression is associated with genetic abnormalities as well as prognosis and might act as a potential biomarker guiding the choice between HSCT and chemotherapy in patients with AML after achieving complete remission.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

According to their immunophenotype pre-HCT, we divided the MRD-positive group and NR group into three subgroups: MRD 0+ group (without any antigen abnormal expression of CD7+, CD56+, CD38-, or HLA-DR-) 28 patients, MRD 1+ group (with one abnormal antigen expression of CD7+, CD56+, CD38-, or HLA-DR-) 63 patients, MRD 2+ group (with two or more abnormal antigens expression of CD7+, CD56+, CD38-, or HLA-DR-) 52 patients. 3-year estimates of disease-free survival (DFS) for MRD 0+, MRD 1+ and MRD 2+ patients were 59.5 +/- 9.5%, 29.9 +/- 6.1%, and 9.4 +/- 5.1%, and 3-year estimates of overall survival (OS) were 59.5 +/- 9.5%, 34.5 +/- 6.3%, and 14.5 +/- 10.8%, respectively. Multivariate analysis adjusted for genetic risk, blast cell level, secondary disease, age, sex, and donor relationship pre-HCT, the hazard ratios of abnormal expression of CD7+, CD56+, HLA-DR-, and CD38(-) were 6.69 (range 2.08-21.52; p = 0.001) for DFS, 2.24 (range 1.21-4.14; p = 0.010) for OS, and 7.18 (range 2.23-23.10; p = 0.001) for relapse compared with CD7-, CD56-, HLA-DR+, and CD38+ patients. Our finding suggested that abnormal expression of CD7+, CD56+, HLA-DR-, and CD38- is associated with poor outcomes, and the more number of abnormal antigens expression predict worse outcomes.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

OBJECTIVES: Primary objective was to describe the indications of real-life isavuconazole administration at a university hospital. Secondary objectives included the description of liver function tests and QTc interval between baseline and end of treatment (EOT), clinical outcomes and breakthrough IMI by the EOT. PATIENTS/METHODS: This was a 5-year single-center retrospective study of all adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia and/or allogeneic HCT recipients who received isavuconazole as prophylaxis and/or treatment between June 1, 2016, and July 31, 2020. RESULTS: Among 30 identified patients, the indications for isavuconazole administration were adverse events associated with prior antifungal treatment (N: 18, 60%: hepatotoxicity, renal insufficiency, long QTc interval, neurotoxicity, and potential drug-drug interactions in 6, 4, 3, 1 and 4 patients, respectively), clinical efficacy (N: 5, 16.6%), and other reasons (N: 10, 33.3%; 5/10 patients treated with isavuconazole to facilitate hospital discharge with orally administered appropriate treatment). Alanine aminotransferase significantly decreased from baseline (mean: 129 IU/L, range: 73, 202) to a mean of 48 IU/L (range: 20, 80) by day 14 (P-value: 0.02), 23.5 IU/L (range: 20, 27) by day 28 (P-value: 0.03) and 16.5 IU/L (range: 16, 17) by day 42 (P-value: 0.009). The QTc interval decreased from baseline (mean: 456.8 ms, range: 390, 533) to EOT (mean: 433.8 ms, range: 400, 472; P-value: 0.03). The mean isavuconazole plasma concentration was 2.9 mg/L (range: 0.9, 6.7). There was no breakthrough IMI observed. CONCLUSION: Isavuconazole is a safe and reliable antifungal agent in complex hematological patients, with relatively low hepatotoxicity and QTc interval shortening properties.",['(c) 2021.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying aberrant gene activation remains elusive. Here, we showed that leukemic MLL fusion proteins associate with the HBO1 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex through their trithorax homology domain 2 (THD2) in various human cell lines. MLL proteins associated with the HBO1 complex through multiple contacts mediated mainly by the ING4/5 and PHF16 subunits in a chromatin-bound context where histone H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation marks were present. Of the many MLL fusions, MLL-ELL particularly depended on the THD2-mediated association with the HBO1 complex for leukemic transformation. The C-terminal portion of ELL provided a binding platform for multiple factors including AF4, EAF1, and p53. MLL-ELL activated gene expression in murine hematopoietic progenitors by loading an AF4/ENL/P-TEFb (AEP) complex onto the target promoters wherein the HBO1 complex promoted the association with AEP complex over EAF1 and p53. Moreover, the NUP98-HBO1 fusion protein exerted its oncogenic properties via interaction with MLL but not its intrinsic HAT activity. Thus, the interaction between the HBO1 complex and MLL is an important nexus in leukemic transformation, which may serve as a therapeutic target for drug development.","['(c) 2021, Takahashi et al.']","['Takahashi, Satoshi', 'Kanai, Akinori', 'Okuda, Hiroshi', 'Miyamoto, Ryo', 'Komata, Yosuke', 'Kawamura, Takeshi', 'Matsui, Hirotaka', 'Inaba, Toshiya', 'Takaori-Kondo, Akifumi', 'Yokoyama, Akihiko']","['Takahashi S', 'Kanai A', 'Okuda H', 'Miyamoto R', 'Komata Y', 'Kawamura T', 'Matsui H', 'Inaba T', 'Takaori-Kondo A', 'Yokoyama A']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1555-6768', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7678-4284', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5639-8068']","['Tsuruoka Metabolomics Laboratory, National Cancer Center, Tsuruoka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology and Leukemia Program Project, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Tsuruoka Metabolomics Laboratory, National Cancer Center, Tsuruoka, Japan.', 'Tsuruoka Metabolomics Laboratory, National Cancer Center, Tsuruoka, Japan.', 'Tsuruoka Metabolomics Laboratory, National Cancer Center, Tsuruoka, Japan.', 'Isotope Science Center, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Life Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology and Leukemia Program Project, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Tsuruoka Metabolomics Laboratory, National Cancer Center, Tsuruoka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Division of Hematological Malignancy, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Elife,eLife,101579614,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*AF4', '*ENL', '*HBO1', '*MLL', '*cancer biology', '*chromosomes', '*epigenetic regulators', '*gene expression', '*leukemia', '*mouse']",2021/08/26 06:00,2021/10/13 06:00,['2021/08/25 12:17'],"['2020/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/25 12:17 [entrez]', '2021/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.7554/eLife.65872 [doi]', '65872 [pii]']",epublish,Elife. 2021 Aug 25;10. pii: 65872. doi: 10.7554/eLife.65872.,20210825,20211012,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (KAT7 protein, human)']","['Animals', 'Carcinogenesis/*genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Female', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC8387021,"['ST, AK, HO, RM, YK, TK, HM, TI, AT No competing interests declared, AY A.Y.', 'received a research grant from Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co.

Long noncoding RNA-DUXAP8 (lncRNA-DUXAP8) has been found to be abnormally expressed in a variety of tumors. However, its function and mechanism in AML have not been studied. We investigate the effect of lncRNA-DUXAP8 on AML and its mechanism so as to provide a new theoretical basis for the diagnosis and treatment of AML. Materials and Methods: The expression of lncRNA-DUXAP8 in AML bone marrow tissues and the THP-1, HL-60, TF-1, AML193, and U937 cell lines was detected by qRT-PCR. It was then altered by transfecting plasmids overexpressing si-DUXAP8 and lncRNA-DUXAP8, respectively. CCK8 and cell colony assay were performed to evaluate the proliferation ability of AML cells. In addition, flow cytometry was used to observe the apoptosis process. Glucose and lactate kits were utilized to detect glucose consumption and lactate levels. Finally, western blotting was performed to detect the expression of proteins related to the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in cells. Results: LncRNA-DUXAP8 was downregulated in both AML bone marrow tissues and cell lines. Upon interfering with lncRNA-DUXAP8 in AML cell line THP-1, AML cell proliferation and glycolysis were promoted while cell apoptosis was inhibited. The opposite results were obtained after overexpressing lncRNA-DUXAP8. Meanwhile, western blotting confirmed that interference with lncRNA-DUXAP8 stimulated the expression of proteins Wnt5a, beta-catenin, c-Myc, and cyclin-D1 in the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Moreover, overexpression of lncRNA-DUXAP8 inhibited the expression of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway proteins. Finally, LiCl, an activator of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, reversed the regulation of AML cells by lncRNA-DUXAP8 upregulation compared with the DUXAP group. Conclusion: This study showed that lncRNA-DUXAP8 regulated the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway to inhibit glycolysis and induce apoptosis in AML.

A significant advance was the incorporation of asparaginase. However, hypersensitivity reactions are a common cause of early discontinuation of this drug. AIM: The proposed study aims to evaluate early interruptions and the influence of the number of asparaginase doses effectively administered on the prognosis of patients with ALL. METHODS AND RESULTS: An observational cohort study was carried out, with retrospective data collection, in medical records. The prognostic variables indicated in the protocol applied were used, and the principal outcomes were 5 years event-free survival (EFS) and 5 years of overall survival (OS) probability. Statistical analyzes were performed using SPPS 20.0 and R. In Cox's proportional hazards model for EFS and OS, variables of prognostic importance (n = 126 children) were: high-risk group (HGR), by the protocol classification, and less than 10 doses of asparaginase. The increased risk of events and death in HGR, who did less than 10 doses, was 3.6 and 7 times, respectively. The study did not show statistical significance for the number of asparaginase doses in patients who were not at high risk. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that the early interruption of asparaginase treatment could negatively impact the prognosis of patients with ALL, especially HGR, reinforcing the need for careful diagnosis of reactions and the availability of alternative types of asparaginase.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Toxicities may be managed by converting CNI to sirolimus as often done in solid organ transplantation. This study aimed to characterize allo-HCT patients who completely transitioned from tacrolimus to sirolimus and evaluate the incidence of aGVHD within 100 days post-transition, overall survival (OS), and incidence of relapse. METHODS: Safety and efficacy data were collected at baseline and at day 30 and 90 post-transition from tacrolimus to sirolimus and at one-year post-HCT. RESULTS: Most patients who transitioned had acute leukemia, received a matched unrelated donor allo-HCT, and transitioned due to nephrotoxicity or neurotoxicity. The resolution rate was 83% and 48% in the nephrotoxicity group, 78% and 61% in the neurotoxicity group, 33% and 33% in the group that developed both nephrotoxicity and transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy at 30 and 90 days of assessments, respectively. Patients who transitioned before day 55 post-allo-HCT were more likely to develop new or worsening aGVHD. The one-year OS and relapse rates were 37% and 20%, respectively.

One of such important cascades is the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, which can regulate various physiological processes such as embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, and tissue regeneration; while its dysregulation is implicated in several pathological conditions especially cancers. Interestingly, deregulation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway has been reported to be closely associated with initiation, progression, metastasis, maintenance of cancer stem cells, and drug resistance in human malignancies. Moreover, several genetic and experimental models support the inhibition of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway to answer the key issues related to cancer development. The present review focuses on different regulators of Wnt pathway and how distinct mutations, deletion, and amplification in these regulators could possibly play an essential role in the development of several cancers such as colorectal, melanoma, breast, lung, and leukemia. Additionally, we also provide insights on diverse classes of inhibitors of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, which are currently in preclinical and clinical trial against different cancers.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Hiremath, Ishita S', 'Goel, Arul', 'Warrier, Sudha', 'Kumar, Alan Prem', 'Sethi, Gautam', 'Garg, Manoj']","['Hiremath IS', 'Goel A', 'Warrier S', 'Kumar AP', 'Sethi G', 'Garg M']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8677-8475'],"['Department of Bioengineering, Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, Ranchi, Jharkhand, India.', 'La Canada High School, La Canada Flintridge, California, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Stem Cells and Cardiovascular Regeneration, Manipal Institute of Regenerative Medicine, Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE), Bangalore, Karnataka, India.', 'Cuor Stem Cellutions Pvt Ltd, Manipal Institute of Regenerative Medicine, Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE), Bangalore, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore and Department of Pharmacology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'NUS Centre for Cancer Research, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'NUS Centre for Cancer Research, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Amity Institute of Biotechnology, Amity University, Manesar, Haryana, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['APC', 'Wnt/beta-catenin signaling', 'cancer', 'clinical trials', 'mutations', 'pharmacological agents']",2021/08/26 06:00,2021/08/26 06:00,['2021/08/25 06:36'],"['2021/07/28 00:00 [revised]', '2021/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/25 06:36 [entrez]', '2021/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.30561 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Cell Physiol. 2021 Aug 25. doi: 10.1002/jcp.30561.,20210825,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although patients with t(8;21) AML have a more favorable prognosis than other cytogenetic subgroups, relapse is still common and novel therapeutic approaches are needed. A recent study showed that t(8;21) AML is characterized by CCND2 deregulation and that co-inhibition of CDK4/6 and autophagy induces apoptosis in t(8;21) AML cells. In this study, we examined the in vivo effects of co-inhibiting CDK4/6 and autophagy. We used a mouse model in which t(8;21)-positive Kasumi-1 cells were subcutaneously inoculated into NOD/Shi-scid IL2Rg(null) mice. The mice were treated with the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ), a CDK4/6 inhibitor (either abemaciclib or palbociclib), or a CDK4/6 inhibitor plus CQ. After 20 days of treatment, tumor volume was measured, and immunostaining and transmission electron microscopy observations were performed. There was no change in tumor growth in CQ-treated mice. However, mice treated with a CDK4/6 inhibitor plus CQ had significantly less tumor growth than mice treated with a CDK4/6 inhibitor alone. CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment increased the formation of autophagosomes. The number of single-strand DNA-positive (apoptotic) cells was significantly higher in the tumors of mice treated with a CDK4/6 inhibitor plus CQ than in mice treated with either CQ or a CDK4/6 inhibitor. These results show that CDK4/6 inhibition induces autophagy, and that co-inhibition of CDK4/6 and autophagy induces apoptosis in t(8;21) AML cells in vivo. The results suggest that inhibiting CDK4/6 and autophagy could be a novel and promising therapeutic strategy in t(8;21) AML.",['(c) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.'],"['Matsuo, Hidemasa', 'Nakatani, Kana', 'Harata, Yutarou', 'Higashitani, Moe', 'Ito, Yuri', 'Inagami, Aina', 'Noura, Mina', 'Nakahata, Tatsutoshi', 'Adachi, Souichi']","['Matsuo H', 'Nakatani K', 'Harata Y', 'Higashitani M', 'Ito Y', 'Inagami A', 'Noura M', 'Nakahata T', 'Adachi S']",,"['Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Drug Discovery Technology Development Office, Center for iPS Cell Research and Application, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Biochem Biophys Rep,Biochemistry and biophysics reports,101660999,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Autophagy', 'CDK4/6', 'Leukemia', 't(8;21)']",2021/08/26 06:00,2021/08/26 06:01,['2021/08/25 06:29'],"['2021/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/26 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/25 06:29 [entrez]', '2021/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/26 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.bbrep.2021.101099 [doi]', 'S2405-5808(21)00194-1 [pii]']",epublish,Biochem Biophys Rep. 2021 Aug 13;27:101099. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrep.2021.101099. eCollection 2021 Sep.,20210813,,,,PMC8371187,"['The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or', 'personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in', 'this paper.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Differential diagnosis between CLL and other B-chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (B-CLPDs) is sometimes difficult. This study aimed to investigate whether cluster of differentiation 35 (CD35) could be a useful marker for the differential diagnosis of CLL and other B-CLPDs. Methods: The CD35 expression on lymphoma cells from 516 B-CLPD patients (347 CLL, 169 other B-CLPDs) was investigated through flow cytometry analysis. Serum C3 and C4 levels in B-CLPD patients were also evaluated. Results: The results showed that the expression percentage and mean fluorescence intensity of CD35 were reduced in CLL cases compared with other B-CLPD patients. Furthermore, CD35 <17% produced a sensitivity of 81.8% and a specificity of 88.4% for supporting the diagnosis of CLL. Additionally, the addition of CD35 to Matutes score improved the score's discriminative power. The sensitivity of the Matutes score was improved from 81.3% to 88.5%, and the accuracy was improved from 96.6% to 97.6%. Finally, 15.0% and 16.4% of CLL patients had defective serum C3 and C4 levels at diagnosis, respectively. Conclusions: Evaluating CD35 expression could have potential differential diagnostic value in distinguishing CLL from other B-CLPDs, especially between CLL and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).",['2021 Annals of Translational Medicine.

LSCs are tightly modulated by hypoxic exposure and macrophage-conditioned microenvironment. Nevertheless, the impacts on the biology of LSCs imposed by the interaction of hypoxia and macrophage polarization remain elusive. Methods: In the study, LSCs characterized by CD34+CD38- immunophenotype sorted from KG1alpha and primary AML cells were employed as in vitro and ex vivo cell models. mRNA and protein expressions of cytokine/chemokine of cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions were determined by RT-PCR and western blot. Macrophage polarization, cell cycle and apoptosis were determined by flowcytometry. Cell viability was assayed by CCK-8. Results: Macrophages preferentially presented with M2 polarization phenotype characterized by upregulated VEGF and CCL17 cytokine/chemokine profile, when stimulated by specific set of cytokines under hypoxic exposure, and induced an anti-inflammatory microenvironment. LSCs exhibited significantly increased cell viability, colony-forming capacity and chemoresistance when co-incubated in hypoxic conditioned medium (H-CM) primed by polarized M1 macrophages. VEGF expression was upregulated in LSCs which in turn activated survivin expression. VEGF-mediated upregulation of survivin could be abolished by inhibition of VEGF receptor, but not blocked by survivin-targeting siRNA. In addition, survivin upregulation exerted antiapoptotic effects and was associated with increased chemoresistance. Finally, VEGF mediated transcriptional induction of HIF-1alpha of LSCs coincubated in H-CM, and HIF-1alpha induction in turn enhanced chemoresistance and reduced cell apoptosis. Conclusions: To our best knowledge, this is the first study that focus to explore molecule players and interacting signal pathways regulating LSC biology under hypoxic exposure.

However, achieving durable remission for these hematological malignancies and extending CAR T cell therapy to patients with solid tumors will require receptors that can recognize and eliminate tumor cells with a low density of target antigen. Although CARs were designed to mimic T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, TCRs are at least 100-fold more sensitive to antigen. To design a CAR with improved antigen sensitivity, we directly compared TCR and CAR signaling in primary human T cells. Global phosphoproteomic analysis revealed that key T cell signaling proteins-such as CD3delta, CD3epsilon, and CD3gamma, which comprise a portion of the T cell co-receptor, as well as the TCR adaptor protein LAT-were either not phosphorylated or were only weakly phosphorylated by CAR stimulation. Modifying a commonplace 4-1BB/CD3zeta CAR sequence to better engage CD3epsilon and LAT using embedded CD3epsilon or GRB2 domains resulted in enhanced T cell activation in vitro in settings of a low density of antigen, and improved efficacy in in vivo models of lymphoma, leukemia, and breast cancer. These CARs represent examples of alterations in receptor design that were guided by in-depth interrogation of T cell signaling.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American', 'Association for the Advancement of Science.

DNMT3A variants occur across the gene with some particularly associated with malignancy, but the functional relevance and mechanisms of pathogenesis of the majority of mutations are unknown. Here, we systematically investigated the methyltransferase activity and protein stability of 253 disease-associated DNMT3A mutations, and found that 74% were loss-of-function mutations. Half of these variants exhibited reduced protein stability and, as a class, correlated with greater clonal expansion and acute myeloid leukemia development. We investigated the mechanisms underlying the instability using a CRISPR screen and uncovered regulated destruction of DNMT3A mediated by the DCAF8 E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor. We establish a new paradigm to classify novel variants that has prognostic and potential therapeutic significance for patients with hematologic disease. SIGNIFICANCE: DNMT3A has emerged as the most important epigenetic regulator and tumor suppressor in the hematopoietic system. Our study represents a systematic and high-throughput method to characterize the molecular impact of DNMT3A missense mutations and the discovery of a regulated destruction mechanism of DNMT3A offering new prognostic and future therapeutic avenues.See related commentary by Ma and Will, p. 23.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1.",['(c)2021 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Huang, Yung-Hsin', 'Chen, Chun-Wei', 'Sundaramurthy, Venkatasubramaniam', 'Slabicki, Mikolaj', 'Hao, Dapeng', 'Watson, Caroline J', 'Tovy, Ayala', 'Reyes, Jaime M', 'Dakhova, Olga', 'Crovetti, Brielle R', 'Galonska, Christina', 'Lee, Minjung', 'Brunetti, Lorenzo', 'Zhou, Yubin', 'Tatton-Brown, Katrina', 'Huang, Yun', 'Cheng, Xiaodong', 'Meissner, Alexander', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'Van Maldergem, Lionel', 'Sanders, Mathijs A', 'Blundell, Jamie R', 'Li, Wei', 'Ebert, Benjamin L', 'Goodell, Margaret A']","['Huang YH', 'Chen CW', 'Sundaramurthy V', 'Slabicki M', 'Hao D', 'Watson CJ', 'Tovy A', 'Reyes JM', 'Dakhova O', 'Crovetti BR', 'Galonska C', 'Lee M', 'Brunetti L', 'Zhou Y', 'Tatton-Brown K', 'Huang Y', 'Cheng X', 'Meissner A', 'Valk PJM', 'Van Maldergem L', 'Sanders MA', 'Blundell JR', 'Li W', 'Ebert BL', 'Goodell MA']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5180-934X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6317-9296', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9043-371X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8351-268X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2624-8576', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1111-2932']","['Program in Developmental Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Center, and Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology Department, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Center, and Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology Department, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Interdepartmental Program in Integrative Molecular and Biomedical Sciences, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Center, and Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology Department, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', ""Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Division of Hematology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts."", 'Division of Biostatistics, Dan L.

An earlier Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) analysis of 868 allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantations (allo-HCTs) performed between 1990 and 2004 showed a 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of 22% and 21%, respectively. Modern supportive care, graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis, and reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens have led to improved outcomes. Therefore, the CIBMTR analyzed 1531 allo-HCTs performed in adults with t-MDS (n = 759) or t-AML (n = 772) between and 2000 and 2014. The median age was 59 years (range, 18 to 74 years) for the patients with t-MDS and 52 years (range, 18 to 77 years) for those with t-AML. Twenty-four percent of patients with t-MDS and 11% of those with t-AML had undergone a previous autologous (auto-) HCT. A myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimen was used in 49% of patients with t-MDS and 61% of patients with t-AML. Nonrelapse mortality at 5 years was 34% (95% confidence interval [CI], 30% to 37%) for patients with t-MDS and 34% (95% CI, 30% to 37%) for those with t-AML. Relapse rates at 5 years in the 2 groups were 46% (95% CI, 43% to 50%) and 43% (95% CI, 40% to 47%). Five-year OS and DFS were 27% (95% CI, 23% to 31%) and 19% (95% CI, 16% to 23%), respectively, for patients with t-MDS and 25% (95% CI, 22% to 28%) and 23% (95% CI, 20% to 26%), respectively, for those with t-AML. In multivariate analysis, OS and DFS were significantly better in young patients with low-risk t-MDS and those with t-AML undergoing HCT with MAC while in first complete remission, but worse for those with previous auto-HCT, higher-risk cytogenetics or Revised International Prognostic Scoring System score, and a partially matched unrelated donor. Relapse remains the major cause of treatment failure, with little improvement seen over the past 2 decades. These data mandate caution when recommending allo-HCT in these conditions and indicate the need for more effective antineoplastic approaches before and after allo-HCT.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

However, the long-term treatment outcomes with TKIs are strongly limited by multiple drug resistances, resulting in relapse albeit with initial high response rate. Here, we reported a realgar (As4S4) nanocrystal-based delivery system to reverse drug resistance for synergistic CML therapy. While As4S4 is extremely insoluble in water, bovine serum albumin (BSA) was rationally screened to effectively stabilize As4S4 nanocrystal with uniformed size of ~40 nm. Imatinib (IMA), a representative TKIs, can be readily loaded into the hydrophobic domain of BSA to develop As4S4/IMA co-delivery system. Mechanistically, IMA inhibits PTK activity, while As4S4 degrades BCR-ABL1, which co-contribute to tumor suppression via complementary pathways for synergistic effect. Moreover, the nanosystem was modified with folic acid (FA) to enable tumor targetability, which has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo, resulting in robust tumor growth inhibition and significantly prolonged mice survival without any noticeable adverse effects. This work designed a synergistic nanoplatform for targeted CML therapy, provided a strategy to address the key limitation of As4S4 for biomedical applications, and highlighted the advantages of the combination between traditional Chinese and western medicine for diseases treatment.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

We classified 553 lymphoid neoplasm cases diagnosed between 1950 and 1994 in the Life Span Study cohort of atomic bomb survivors into World Health Organization subtypes. Mature B-cell neoplasms represented 58%, mature T-cell and natural killer (NK)-cell neoplasms 20%, precursor cell neoplasms 5%, and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) 3%, with the remaining 15% classified as non-Hodgkin lymphoid (NHL) neoplasms or lymphoid neoplasms not otherwise specified. We used Poisson regression methods to assess the relationship between radiation exposure and the more common subtypes. As in earlier reports, a significant dose response for NHL neoplasms as a group was seen for males but not females. However, subtype analyses showed that radiation dose was strongly associated with increased precursor cell neoplasms rates, with an estimated excess relative risk per Gy of 16 (95% Confidence interval: 7.0, >533) at age 50. The current data based primarily of tissue-based diagnoses suggest that the association between radiation dose and lymphoid neoplasms as a group is largely driven by the radiation effect on precursor cell neoplasms while presenting no evidence of a radiation dose response for major categories of mature cell neoplasms, either B- or T-/NK-cell, or more specific disease entities (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, plasma cell myeloma, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma) or HL.",['(c) 2022 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Fujihara, Megumu', 'Sakata, Ritsu', 'Yoshida, Noriaki', 'Ozasa, Kotaro', 'Preston, Dale L', 'Mabuchi, Kiyohiko']","['Fujihara M', 'Sakata R', 'Yoshida N', 'Ozasa K', 'Preston DL', 'Mabuchi K']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7001-0106', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5637-1383', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0641-2925', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8867-8777']","['Department of Pathology, Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital and Atomic-bomb Survivors Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Epidemiology, and.', 'Department of Clinical Studies, Radiation Effects Research Foundation, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Epidemiology, and.', 'Hirosoft International Corporation, Eureka, CA; and.', 'Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,,2021/08/25 06:00,2021/08/25 06:00,['2021/08/24 17:24'],"['2020/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/25 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/24 17:24 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(21)01516-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2020010475 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2022 Jan 13;139(2):217-227. doi: 10.1182/blood.2020010475.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis compared survival outcomes observed with enasidenib 100 mg daily in the phase I/II AG221-C-001 trial and SoC outcomes obtained from a real-world chart review of patients in France. RESULTS: Before matching, enasidenib (n = 195) was associated with numerically improved overall survival (OS) relative to SoC (n = 80; hazard ratio [HR], 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61-1.11). After matching and adjusting for covariates (n = 78 per group), mortality risk was significantly lower with enasidenib than with SoC (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.47-0.97). The median OS was 9.26 months for enasidenib (95% CI, 7.72-13.24) and 4.76 months for SoC (95% CI, 3.81-8.21). Results remained robust across all sensitivity analyses conducted. CONCLUSIONS: PSM analyses indicate that enasidenib significantly prolongs survival relative to SoC among patients with R/R AML and an IDH2 mutation who are ineligible for HSCT. Future prospective studies are needed to validate these findings using other data sources and to assess the comparative efficacy of enasidenib for other treatment outcomes.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

The modern treatment mechanisms that are associated with leukemia comprise chemotherapy, allogeneic cell transplantation, and radiation therapy that comes with adverse side effects. Thus, medicinal herbs and their bioactive compounds are gaining more attention nowadays toward the treatment of leukemia, owing to their minimal side effects. The current study was aimed to scrutinize the antileukemic effect of daphnetin against benzene-induced leukemia in rats and explore the underlying mechanism of its action. Benzene was used for the induction of leukemia in experimental rats. The rats were divided into different groups and body weight; hematological parameters, DNA fragmentation, and cell cycle regulatory parameter were also estimated. RT-PCR was used for the estimation of mRNA expression of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), a membrane protein widely found in liver cells. Daphnetin-treated rats showed upregulation of body weight as compared to other groups. Moreover, daphnetin reduced the blasts (67.8%) in leukemic rats. It also altered the hematological parameters such as RBC (69.8%), WBC (54.5%), lymphocytes (47.6%), neutrophils (48.9%), monocytes (44.7%), eosinophils (48.7%), and basophils (43.5%), respectively. Daphnetin-treated rats showed an increased level of proteins p21 and p53 and reduced level of cyclins D1 and E. RT-PCR showed an upregulated mRNA expression of CYP2E1 (48.4%) of the daphnetin-treated group as compared to other groups. The current study shows the antileukemic effect of daphnetin and highlights the possibility of its use in leukemia to minimize the side effect of the usual therapy.","['(c) 2021.

Here, we report clinical hematologic manifestations and unique bone marrow (BM) features in 16 patients with VEXAS. All patients were male and had a history of severe autoinflammatory and rheumatologic manifestations and a somatic UBA1 mutation (p.Met41). Ten patients had hematologic disorders: myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; 6 of 16), multiple myeloma (2 of 16), monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (2 of 16), and monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (2 of 16), and a few of those patients had 2 co-existing clonal processes. Although macrocytic anemia (100%) and lymphopenia (80%) were prevalent in all patients with VEXAS, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia were more common in patients with progression to MDS. All BMs in VEXAS patients had prominent cytoplasmic vacuoles in myeloid and erythroid precursors. In addition, most BMs were hypercellular with myeloid hyperplasia, erythroid hypoplasia, and varying degrees of dysplasia. All patients diagnosed with MDS were lower risk (low blast count, very good to intermediate cytogenetics) according to standard prognostic scoring with no known progression to leukemia. In addition, 10 of 16 patients had thrombotic events, including venous thromboembolism and arterial stroke. Although VEXAS presents symptomatically as a rheumatologic disease, morbidity and mortality are associated with progression to hematologic disease.

Furthermore, the prevalence and characteristics of psoriasis differ among racial groups. Therefore, it is important to obtain real-world evidence in specific regions. To identify the optimal systemic treatment for psoriatic patients in Western Japan, we established the Western Japan Psoriasis Registry (WJPR). This registry is led by a neutral physicians' league associated with university hospitals, general hospitals, and clinics that specialize in treatment of psoriasis. Systemically treated psoriatic patients who provided written informed consent were enrolled, and data were collected on their background information, several patient-reported outcomes, dermatologists' objective evaluations, and treatment regimens. Patient enrollment began in 2019, and 1394 patients had been recruited by the end of 2020. The prevalence of psoriatic arthritis was 27.2% and that of pustular psoriasis was 7.5%. The mean body mass index was 24.1 kg/m(2) , and 12% of patients had severe obesity (body mass index >/=30 kg/m(2) ). Major comorbidities were hypertension (35.0%), diabetes (14.1%), and hyperlipidemia (12.2%). Serological data showed that hepatitis B virus surface antigen, anti-hepatitis B virus core antibody, anti-hepatitis C virus antibody, and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 antibody were detected in 1.1%, 18.0%, 3.1%, and 3.7% of patients, respectively. The most frequently used small-molecule-systemic intervention was apremilast (18.0%), followed by methotrexate (7.7%), etretinate (4.2%), and cyclosporin (3.7%). The most frequently used biologics were interleukin (IL)-17 inhibitors (31.8%), followed by IL-23 inhibitors (including IL-12/23 inhibitors) (26.7%), and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (11.1%). The WJPR is the first Japanese prospective observational cohort of psoriatic patients. Annual WJPR updates may provide the incidences of comorbidities such as cardiovascular events or onset of arthritis in systemically treated patients, identify rare complications, and identify the optimal treatment regimens for various psoriatic patients.",['(c) 2021 Japanese Dermatological Association.'],"['Tsuruta, Noriko', 'Imafuku, Shinichi']","['Tsuruta N', 'Imafuku S']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2907-9205', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8568-4349']","['Department of Dermatology, Fukuoka University Faculty of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Fukuoka University Faculty of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Maruho', 'Kyowa Hakko Kirin', 'AbbVie', 'Eisai', 'Amgen', 'Taiho Pharmaceutical']","['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",England,J Dermatol,The Journal of dermatology,7600545,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Japan', 'cohort', 'patient registry', 'prospective study', 'psoriasis']",2021/08/25 06:00,2021/11/04 06:00,['2021/08/24 09:27'],"['2021/06/27 00:00 [revised]', '2021/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/04 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/24 09:27 [entrez]']",['10.1111/1346-8138.16092 [doi]'],ppublish,J Dermatol. 2021 Nov;48(11):1709-1718. doi: 10.1111/1346-8138.16092.

Immune checkpoint blockade has shown efficacy in some B-cell malignancies and modest responses in early clinical trials for RS. We investigated the immune checkpoint profile of RS as a basis to inform rational therapeutic investigations in RS. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsies of RS (n = 19), de novo diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL; n = 58), transformed indolent lymphomas (follicular [tFL], n = 16; marginal zone [tMZL], n = 24) and non-transformed small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL; n = 15) underwent gene expression profiling using the NanoString Human Immunology panel. Copy number assessment was performed using next-generation sequencing. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for LAG3 and PD-1 was performed. LAG3 gene expression was higher in RS compared to DLBCL (P = 0.0002, log2FC 1.96), tFL (P < 0.0001, log2FC 2.61), tMZL (P = 0.0004, log2FC 1.79) and SLL (P = 0.0057, log2FC 1.45). LAG3 gene expression correlated with the gene expression of human leukocyte antigen Class I and II, and related immune genes and immune checkpoints. IHC revealed LAG3 protein expression on both malignant RS cells and tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes.

The role of SCAMPs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), however, remains to be identified. In the present study, we explored expression patterns and prognostic value of SCAMPs and network analysis of SCAMPs-related signaling pathways in AML using Oncomine, GEPIA, cBioPortal, LinkedOmics, DAVID and Metascape databases. Genetic alteration analysis revealed that the mutation rate of SCAMP genes was below 1% (9/1272) in AML, and there was no significant correlation between SCAMPs gene mutation and AML prognosis. However, the SCAMP2/5 mRNA levels were significantly higher in AML patients than in healthy controls. Moreover, high mRNA expressions of SCAMP2/4/5 were associated with poor overall survival, which might be due to that SCAMP2/4/5 and their co-expressed genes were associated with multiple pathways related to tumorigenesis and progression, including human T-cell leukemia virus 1 infection, acute myeloid leukemia, mTOR and NF-kappa B signaling pathways. These results suggest that SCAMP2/4/5 are potential prognostic markers for AML, and that SCAMP2 and SCAMP5 individually or in combination may be used as diagnostic markers for AML.",['(c) 2021.

The incidence ranges from 1 to 20 per 100 000/year, with increased prevalence in the elderly, in males, and with use of anticoagulants or antiplatelets. Chronic myeloid leukemia has been linked to spontaneous subdural hematoma, with the highest reported cases of 39 patients in Korea, but no management is mentioned in that paper. There are few reported cases of patients who are medically free with no use of anticoagulants, diagnosed as having a subdural hematoma and then later discovered to have chronic myelogenous leukemia. CASE REPORT We report the case of a 45-year-old man, with known hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2, on aspirin weekly, who was referred from another hospital with a history of sudden-onset severe headache not related to trauma. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain done in the other hospital showed a left-side subdural hematoma with midline shift. He underwent left-sided acute subdural hematoma evacuation and decompressive hemicraniectomy. He was started on hydroxyurea for chronic myelogenous leukemia. CONCLUSIONS A lesson from this rare case is to look for a differential diagnosis and to keep chronic myelogenous leukemia in mind in patients with leukocytosis.

However, the low responses, drug-related adverse effects, and most significantly, the clinically-acquired resistance of AG-221 and AG-120 has shown great influence on their clinical application. Therefore, searching for novel therapeutic strategies to enhance tumor sensitivity, reduce drug-related side effects, and overcome drug resistance have opened a new research field for defeating IDH-mutated cancers. As the effective methods, synthetic lethal interactions and synergetic therapies are extensively investigated in recent years for the cure of different cancers. In this review, the molecules displaying synergetic effects with mIDH1/2 inhibitors, as well as the targets showing relevant synthetic lethal interactions with mIDH1/2 are described emphatically.

A key challenge in democratizing long-read sequencing technology in the biomedical and clinical community is the lack of graphical bioinformatics software tools which can efficiently process the raw nanopore reads, support graphical output and interactive visualizations for interpretations of results. Another obstacle is that high performance software tools for long-read sequencing data analyses often leverage graphics processing units (GPU), which is challenging and time-consuming to configure, especially on the cloud. RESULTS: We present a graphical cloud-enabled workflow for fast, interactive analysis of nanopore sequencing data using GPUs. Users customize parameters, monitor execution and visualize results through an accessible graphical interface. The workflow and its components are completely containerized to ensure reproducibility and facilitate installation of the GPU-enabled software. We also provide an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) with all software and drivers pre-installed for GPU computing on the cloud. Most importantly, we demonstrate the potential of applying our software tools to reduce the turnaround time of cancer diagnostics by generating blood cancer (NB4, K562, ME1, 238 MV4;11) cell line Nanopore data using the Flongle adapter. We observe a 29x speedup and a 93x reduction in costs for the rate-limiting basecalling step in the analysis of blood cancer cell line data. CONCLUSIONS: Our interactive and efficient software tools will make analyses of Nanopore data using GPU and cloud computing accessible to biomedical and clinical scientists, thus facilitating the adoption of cost effective, fast, portable and real-time long-read sequencing.",['(c) 2021.

We previously found that deletion or inhibition of the histone methyltransferase Ezh2 (enhancer of zeste homolog 2) in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from both mice and humans enhanced the commitment and cytotoxicity of NK cells to tumor cells. This study tested the hypothesis that inhibiting Ezh2, especially in NK lineage cells, could also affect NK cell development and function. We crossed Ezh2(fl/fl) mice with Ncr1(iCre) mice to delete the Ezh2 gene in immature NK cells and downstream progeny. Ezh2 deficiency increased the total number of NK cells and promoted NK cell terminal differentiation, as the percentages of the most mature CD27(-) CD11b(+) subsets were increased. The NK cell cytotoxicity against tumor cells in vitro was enhanced, with increased degranulation and IFN-gamma production. In addition, during the process of human NK cells differentiating from HSPCs , inhibiting EZH2 catalytic activity at day 14 (when NK lineage commitment began) also resulted in increased proportions of mature NK cells and cytotoxicity.

But the mechanisms of PAX5 mutations inducing tumor immune escape have not been clarified. Our aim was to study how PAX5 haploinsufficiency influences effector CD8 + T cells in tumor microenvironment. METHODS: We estimated the proportions of 22 immune cell types and the expressions of immune inhibitory-related molecules based on gene expression profiles (GEPs) from children's B- acute lymphoblastic leukemia(B-ALL) with PAX5 mutations by CIBERSORT, an established algorithm. We constructed the PAX5 haplodeletion A20 cell lines, built allografted A20 tumor models and evaluated the effect of PAX5 haplodeletion on immune inhibitory-related molecules in the tumor microenvironment (TME). RESULTS: Our results indicated the percentages of T cells in bone marrow of children's B-ALL with PAX5 mutations were not statistically different from that in bone marrow of B-ALL without PAX5 mutations, except for T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. But a variety of up-regulated immune inhibitory-related molecules in bone marrow of children's B- ALL with PAX5 mutations were identified. By different approaches, we found that several immune inhibitory-related molecules of CD8+ T cells in TME of PAX5 haplodeletion clones such as TIM3, NR4A1 and BATF, were increased significantly compared with that of PAX5 wild type control. The IFN- of CD8+ T cells in TME of PAX5 haplodeletion tumors was decreased significantly compared with that of PAX5 wild type control. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that PAX5 haploinsufficiency induced CD8+ T cells dysfunction or exhaustion by high expression of TIM3, NR4A1 and BATF in the CD8+ T cells of TME.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

The myeloid bias of hematopoiesis in elderly individuals has been considered causative, but the age of the bone marrow microenvironment (BMM) may be contributory. Using various murine models of B-ALL in young vs old mice, we recapitulated B-ALL preponderance in children vs adults. We showed differential effects of young vs old BM macrophages on B-ALL cell function. Molecular profiling using RNA- and ATAC-sequencing revealed pronounced differences in young vs old BMM-derived macrophages and enrichment for gene sets associated with inflammation. In concordance with the role of C-X-C motif chemokine (CXCL) 13 for disease-associated B-cell chemoattraction, we found CXCL13 to be highly expressed in young macrophages on a translational compared with a transcriptional level. Inhibition of CXCL13 in BM macrophages impaired leukemia cell migration and decreased the proliferation of cocultured B-ALL cells, whereas recombinant CXCL13 increased pAKT and B-ALL cell expansion. Pretreatment of B-ALL-initiating cells with CXCL13 accelerated B-ALL progression. Deficiency of Cxcr5, the receptor for CXCL13, on B-ALL-initiating cells prolonged murine survival, whereas high expression of CXCR5 in pediatric B-ALL may predict central nervous system relapse.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the survival benefit of administering sapacitabine, an oral nucleoside analogue, in alternating cycles with decitabine, a low-intensity therapy, to elderly patients with newly diagnosed AML. METHODS: This randomized, open-label, phase 3 study (SEAMLESS) was conducted at 87 sites in 11 countries. Patients aged >/=70 years who were not candidates for or chose not to receive standard induction chemotherapy were randomized 1:1 to arm A (decitabine in alternating cycles with sapacitabine) received 1-hour intravenous infusions of decitabine 20 mg/m(2) once daily for 5 consecutive days every 8 weeks (first cycle and subsequent odd cycles) and sapacitabine 300 mg twice daily on 3 consecutive days per week for 2 weeks every 8 weeks (second cycle and subsequent even cycles) or to control arm C who received 1-hour infusions of decitabine 20 mg/m(2) once daily for 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks. Prior hypomethylating agent therapy for preexisting myelodysplastic syndromes or myeloproliferative neoplasms was an exclusion criterion. Randomization was stratified by antecedent myelodysplastic syndromes or myeloproliferative neoplasms, white blood cell count (<10 x 10(9) /L and >/=10 x 10(9) /L), and bone marrow blast percentage (>/=50% vs <50%). The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Secondary end points were the rates of complete remission (CR), CR with incomplete platelet count recovery, partial remission, hematologic improvement, and stable disease along with the corresponding durations, transfusion requirements, number of hospitalized days, and 1-year survival. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01303796). RESULTS: Between October 2011 and December 2014, 482 patients were enrolled and randomized to receive decitabine administered in alternating cycles with sapacitabine (study arm, n = 241) or decitabine monotherapy (control arm, n = 241). The median OS was 5.9 months on the study arm versus 5.7 months on the control arm (P = .8902). The CR rate was 16.6% on the study arm and 10.8% on the control arm (P = .1468). In patients with white blood cell counts <10 x 10(9) /L (n = 321), the median OS was higher on the study arm versus the control arm (8.0 vs 5.8 months; P = .145), as was the CR rate (21.5% vs 8.6%; P = .0017). CONCLUSIONS: The regimen of decitabine administered in alternating cycles with sapacitabine was active but did not significantly improve OS compared with decitabine monotherapy. Subgroup analyses suggest that patients with baseline white blood cell counts <10 x 10(9) /L might benefit from decitabine alternating with sapacitabine, with an improved CR rate and the convenience of an oral drug. These findings should be prospectively confirmed.",['(c) 2021 American Cancer Society.'],"['Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Begna, Kebede H', 'Altman, Jessica K', 'Goldberg, Stuart L', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'Strickland, Stephen A', 'Arellano, Martha L', 'Claxton, David F', 'Baer, Maria R', 'Gautier, Marc', 'Berman, Ellin', 'Seiter, Karen', 'Solomon, Scott R', 'Schiller, Gary J', 'Luger, Selina M', 'Butrym, Aleksandra', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Thomas, Xavier G', 'Montesinos, Pau', 'Rizzieri, David A', 'Quick, Donald P', 'Venugopal, Parameswaran', 'Gaur, Rakesh', 'Maness, Lori J', 'Kadia, Tapan M', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Buyse, Marc E', 'Chiao, Judy H']","['Kantarjian HM', 'Begna KH', 'Altman JK', 'Goldberg SL', 'Sekeres MA', 'Strickland SA', 'Arellano ML', 'Claxton DF', 'Baer MR', 'Gautier M', 'Berman E', 'Seiter K', 'Solomon SR', 'Schiller GJ', 'Luger SM', 'Butrym A', 'Gaidano G', 'Thomas XG', 'Montesinos P', 'Rizzieri DA', 'Quick DP', 'Venugopal P', 'Gaur R', 'Maness LJ', 'Kadia TM', 'Ravandi F', 'Buyse ME', 'Chiao JH']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1908-3307', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2730-8593', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2175-4082', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2009-6524', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6861-2041', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1636-1962', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9209-2405', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9499-1348', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3973-0230', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3838-7901', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2061-8126', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7508-3467', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3364-4366', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8199-2018', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4681-0151', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5332-2404', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3275-5593', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9886-5771', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7518-9579', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9480-0177', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9892-9832', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7621-377X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4559-0994', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2818-4644']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Department of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey.', 'Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, Tennessee.', 'Hematology/Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Penn State Milton S.

Such changes lead to many unique features in blood cell function and immune responses in early childhood. The blood cells and immune cells in neonates are a mixture of fetal and adult origin due to the co-existence of both fetal and adult types of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and progenitor cells (HPCs). Fetal blood and immune cells gradually diminish during maturation of the infant and are almost completely replaced by adult types of cells by 3 to 4 weeks after birth in mice. Such features in early childhood are associated with unique features of hematopoietic and immune diseases, such as leukemia, at these developmental stages. Therefore, understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which hematopoietic and immune changes occur throughout ontogeny will provide useful information for the study and treatment of pediatric blood and immune diseases. In this review, we summarize the most recent studies on hematopoietic initiation during early embryonic development, the expansion of both fetal and adult types of HSCs and HPCs in the fetal liver and fetal bone marrow stages, and the shift from fetal to adult hematopoiesis/immunity during neonatal/infant development. We also discuss the contributions of fetal types of HSCs/HPCs to childhood leukemias.","['(c) 2021.

Receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) is an oncofetal protein with limited expression on normal adult tissues and is overexpressed on the surface of malignant cells in mantle cell lymphoma, acute lymphocytic leukemia with t(1;19)(q23;p13) translocation, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This differential expression makes ROR1 an attractive target for antibody-drug conjugate therapy, especially in malignancies such as mantle cell lymphoma and acute lymphocytic leukemia, in which systemic chemotherapy remains the gold standard. Several preclinical and phase 1 clinical studies have established the safety and effectiveness of anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody-based therapies. Herein we describe a humanized, first-in-class anti-ROR1 antibody-drug conjugate, huXBR1-402-G5-PNU, which links a novel anti-ROR1 antibody (huXBR1-402) to a highly potent anthracycline derivative (PNU).

In certain clinical situations, such as severe thrombocytopenia, administration of most JAK inhibitors are contraindicated. Thus, there is an unmet medical need for the development of novel agents for patients with MF. SMAC mimetics [or inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) antagonists] induce apoptosis in cancer cells. Because these agents are hypothesized to have increased activity in a tumor necrosis factor-alpha cytokine-rich microenvironment, as is the case with MF, we conducted a single-center, investigator-initiated phase 2 clinical trial, with a monovalent SMAC mimetic LCL161 (oral, starting dose, 1500 mg per week) in patients with intermediate to high-risk MF. In an older group, 66% with >/=2 prior therapies and a median baseline platelet count of 52 x 103/muL and 28% with ASXL1 mutations, we observed a 30% objective response by Revised International Working Group-Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) 2013 criteria. Notably, 6 responding patients achieved clinical improvement of anemia: 4, hemoglobin response; 2, transfusion independence. Median OS was 34 months (range, 2.2-60.1+). Reductions of cIAPs were observed in all responders. The most common toxicity was nausea/vomiting (N/V) in 64% (mostly grade 1/2); fatigue in 46%; and dizziness/vertigo in 30%. There were 4 grade 3/4 adverse events (2, syncope; 1, N/V; 1, skin eruption/pruritis). There were 2 deaths during the study period, both unrelated to the study drug.

To enhance our understanding of the biological impact of these mutations, we established cell lines that overexpress wild-type or mutant BTK in in vitro and in vivo models that mimic ibrutinib-sensitive and -resistant CLL. MEC-1 cell lines stably overexpressing wild-type or mutant BTK were generated. All cell lines coexpressed GFP, were CD19+ and CD23+, and overexpressed BTK. Overexpression of wild-type or mutant BTK resulted in increased signaling, as evidenced by the induction of p-BTK, p-PLCgamma2, and p-extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) levels, the latter further augmented upon IgM stimulation. In all cell lines, cell cycle profiles and levels of BTK expression were similar, but the RNA sequencing and reverse-phase protein array results revealed that the molecular transcript and protein profiles were distinct. To mimic aggressive CLL, we created xenograft mouse models by transplanting the generated cell lines into Rag2-/-gammac-/- mice. Spleens, livers, bone marrow, and peripheral blood were collected. All mice developed CLL-like disease with systemic involvement (engraftment efficiency, 100%). We observed splenomegaly, accumulation of leukemic cells in the spleen and liver, and macroscopically evident necrosis. CD19+ cells accumulated in the spleen, bone marrow, and peripheral blood. The overall survival duration was slightly lower in mice expressing mutant BTK.

Main protease, M(pro) of SARS-CoV-2 draws significant attention as a drug target. Herein, we have screened FDA approved organosulfur drugs (till 2016) and our laboratory synthesized organosulfur and organoselenium compounds (L1-L306) against M(pro)-apo using docking followed by classical MD simulations. Additionally, a series of compounds (L307-L364) were chosen from previous experimental studies, which were reported to exhibit inhibitory potentials towards M(pro). We found several organosulfur drugs, particularly Venetoclax (FDA approved organosulfur drug for Leukemia) to be a high-affinity binders to the M(pro) of SARS-CoV-2. The results reveal that organosulfur compounds including Venetoclax preferentially bind (non-covalently) to the non-catalytic pocket of the protein located in the dimer interface. We found that the ligand binding is primarily favoured by ligand-protein van der Waals interaction and penalized by desolvation effect. Interestingly, Venetoclax binding alters the local flexibility of M(pro) and exerts pronounced effect in the C-terminal as well as two loop regions (Loop-A and Loop-B) that play important roles in catalysis. These findings highlighted the importance of drug repurposing and explored the non-catalytic pockets of M(pro) in combating COVID-19 infection in addition to the importance of catalytic binding pocket of the protein.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Patients with mutations in the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene have poor survival and higher relapse rates compared with wild-type cases.Areas covered: Several FLT3 inhibitors have been proved in FLT3(mut) AML patients, with differences in their pharmacokinetics, kinase inhibitory and adverse events profiles. First-generation multi-kinase inhibitors (midostaurin, sorafenib, lestaurtinib) target multiple proteins, whereassecond-generation inhibitors (crenolanib, quizartinib, gilteritinib) are more specific and potent inhibitors of FLT3, so they are associated with less off-target toxic effects. All of these drugs have primary and acquired mechanisms of resistance, and therefore their combinations with other drugs (checkpoint inhibitors, hypomethylating agents, standard chemotherapy) and its application in different clinical settings are under study.Expert opinion: The recent clinical development of various FLT3 inhibitors for the treatment of FLT3(mut) AML is an effective therapeutic strategy. However, there are unique toxicities and drug-drug interactions that need to be resolved.

Here, we review recent studies supporting an emerging view that PML's pleiotropic effects derive, at least partially, from its role in regulating histone H3.3 chromatin assembly, a critical epigenetic mechanism. These studies suggest that PML maintains heterochromatin organization by restraining H3.3 incorporation. Examination of PML's contribution to H3.3 chromatin assembly in the context of the cell cycle and PML-NB assembly suggests that PML represses heterochromatic H3.3 deposition during S phase and that transcription and SUMOylation regulate PML's recruitment to heterochromatin. Elucidating PML' s contributions to H3.3-mediated epigenetic regulation will provide insight into PML's expansive influence on cellular physiology and open new avenues for studying oncogenesis linked to PML malfunction.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

We devised a method for simultaneous subgroup discovery across multiple data types and applied it to genomic, transcriptomic, DNA methylation and ex-vivo drug response data from 217 Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) cases. We uncovered a biological axis of heterogeneity strongly associated with clinical behavior and orthogonal to the known biomarkers. We validated its presence and clinical relevance in four independent cohorts (n=547 patients). We find that this axis captures the proliferative drive (PD) of CLL cells, as it associates with lymphocyte doubling rate, global hypomethylation, accumulation of driver aberrations and response to pro-proliferative stimuli. CLL-PD was linked to the activation of mTOR-MYC-oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) through transcriptomic, proteomic and single cell resolution analysis.

No specific molecular classification combining therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia and therapy-related myelodysplastic syndromes has been proposed. We aimed to describe the molecular landscape of TRMN at diagnosis, among 77 patients with previous gynecologic and breast cancer with a dedicated next-generation sequencing panel covering 74 genes. We investigated the impact of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential-associated mutations (CHIP-AMs defined as presence at TRMN stage of mutations described in CHIP with a frequency >1%) on overall survival (OS) and the clinical relevance of a modified genetic ontogeny-based classifier that categorized patients in 3 subgroups. The most frequently mutated genes were TP53 (31%), DNMT3A (19%), IDH1/2 (13%), NRAS (13%), TET2 (12%), NPM1 (10%), PPM1D (9%), and PTPN11 (9%). CHIP-AMs were detected in 66% of TRMN patients, with no impact on OS. Yet, patients with CHIP-AM were older and had a longer time interval between solid tumor diagnosis and TRMN. According to our modified ontogeny-based classifier, we observed that the patients with TP53 or PPM1D mutations had more treatment lines and complex karyotypes, the ""MDS-like"" patients were older with more gene mutations, while patients with ""De novo/pan-AML"" mutations were younger with more balanced chromosomal translocations. Median OS within each subgroup was 7.5, 14.5, and 25.2 months, respectively, with statistically significant difference in multivariate analysis. These results support the integration of cytogenetic and molecular markers into the future TRMN classification to reflect the biological diversity of TRMN and its impact on outcomes.","['Copyright (c) 2021 the Author(s).

Herein we used mouse leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), which supports ESCs self-renewal and Activin A (Act A), which is the main factor in maintaining EpiSCs in post-implantation epiblast cultures, to derive a primed stem cell line named ALSCs. Like EpiSCs, ALSCs express key pluripotent genes Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog; one X chromosome was inactivated; and the cells failed to contribute to chimera formation in vivo. Notably, compared to EpiSCs, ALSCs efficiently reversed to ESCs (rESCs) on activation of Wnt signaling. Moreover, we also discovered that culturing EpiSCs in AL medium for several passages favored Wnt signaling-driven naive pluripotency. Our results show that ALSCs is a primed state stem cell and represents a simple model to study the control of pluripotency fate and conversion from the primed to the naive state.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wei, Chen, Zhao, Zheng, Wu, Chen, Li and Bao.']","['Wei, Mengyi', 'Chen, Yanglin', 'Zhao, Chaoyue', 'Zheng, Li', 'Wu, Baojiang', 'Chen, Chen', 'Li, Xihe', 'Bao, Siqin']","['Wei M', 'Chen Y', 'Zhao C', 'Zheng L', 'Wu B', 'Chen C', 'Li X', 'Bao S']",,"['State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Regulation and Breeding of Grassland Livestock, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, China.', 'Institute of Animal Genetic Research of Mongolia Plateau, College of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Regulation and Breeding of Grassland Livestock, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, China.', 'Institute of Animal Genetic Research of Mongolia Plateau, College of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, China.', 'School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Regulation and Breeding of Grassland Livestock, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, China.', 'Institute of Animal Genetic Research of Mongolia Plateau, College of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Regulation and Breeding of Grassland Livestock, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, China.', 'Institute of Animal Genetic Research of Mongolia Plateau, College of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Regulation and Breeding of Grassland Livestock, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, China.', 'Institute of Animal Genetic Research of Mongolia Plateau, College of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Regulation and Breeding of Grassland Livestock, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, China.', 'Institute of Animal Genetic Research of Mongolia Plateau, College of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Regulation and Breeding of Grassland Livestock, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, China.', 'Institute of Animal Genetic Research of Mongolia Plateau, College of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, China.', 'Inner Mongolia Saikexing Institute of Breeding and Reproductive Biotechnology in Domestic Animal, Hohhot, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Regulation and Breeding of Grassland Livestock, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, China.', 'Institute of Animal Genetic Research of Mongolia Plateau, College of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,['NOTNLM'],"['Activin A', 'LIF', 'conversion', 'embryonic stem cells', 'primed stem cells']",2021/08/24 06:00,2021/08/24 06:01,['2021/08/23 06:36'],"['2021/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/23 06:36 [entrez]', '2021/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/24 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2021.713503 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Aug 5;9:713503. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.713503. eCollection 2021.,20210805,,,,PMC8375391,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytogenetic and genomic features are used to classify AML patients into prognostic and treatment groups. However, these molecular characteristics harbor significant patient-to-patient variability and do not fully account for AML heterogeneity. RNA-based classifications have also been applied in AML as an alternative approach, but transcriptomic grouping is strongly associated with AML morphologic lineages. We used a training cohort of newly diagnosed AML patients and conducted unsupervised RNA-based classification after excluding lineage-associated genes. We identified three AML patient groups that have distinct biological pathways associated with outcomes. Enrichment of inflammatory pathways and downregulation of HOX pathways were associated with improved outcomes, and this was validated in 2 independent cohorts. We also identified a group of AML patients who harbored high metabolic and mTOR pathway activity, and this was associated with worse clinical outcomes. Using a comprehensive reverse phase protein array, we identified higher mTOR protein expression in the highly metabolic group. We also identified a positive correlation between degree of resistance to venetoclax and mTOR activation in myeloid and lymphoid cell lines.

The phase III PHOEBE study proved that pyrotinib plus capecitabine exceeded lapatinib plus capecitabine (LX) in PFS (p < 0.001). Oral vinorelbine is commonly used in combination with anti-HER2 treatment. However, no evidence was reported in terms of the real-world pattern, safety, and efficacy of pyrotinib plus vinorelbine (NP) compared with LX. Methods: Medical records were retrospectively evaluated for all HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients who experienced progression on prior trastuzumab-containing regimens (advanced setting) and taxane (any setting) and received NP or LX therapy from 2015 to 2021 in five institutions. Results: A total of 224 patients were enrolled and evaluated, of which 132 (58.9%) patients received LX and 92 (41.1%) patients received NP. The median progression-free survival (mPFS) of NP group was significantly longer than that in LX group (8.3 vs 5.0 months, HR = 0.47 95% CI 0.34-0.65, p < 0.001). The advantage of NP over LX was seen both in patients with trastuzumab resistance (p < 0.001) and refractoriness (p = 0.004). The NP group had more diarrhea cases (23.9%) compared to the LX group (8.3%). Discontinuation rates in the two groups were similar. Conclusions: This trial revealed the clinical practice of NP and LX treatment among HER2+ MBC patients pretreated with trastuzumab in China. More patients received LX than NP in real-world while the efficacy of NP exceeded LX in terms of PFS regardless of resistant status of trastuzumab. Although the NP group had more diarrhea cases, toxicities in both groups were acceptable.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Xie, Li, Ting, Sang, Yuan, Li, Li, Ge and Wang.']","['Xie, Yizhao', 'Li, Yi', 'Ting, Luo', 'Sang, Die', 'Yuan, Peng', 'Li, Wei', 'Li, Huihui', 'Ge, Rui', 'Wang, Biyun']","['Xie Y', 'Li Y', 'Ting L', 'Sang D', 'Yuan P', 'Li W', 'Li H', 'Ge R', 'Wang B']",,"['Department of Medical Oncology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', ""Guangzhou First People's Hospital, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China."", 'Department of Head, Neck and Mammary Gland Oncology, Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Oncology, San Huan Cancer Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'National Cancer Center, Tumor Hospital of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Breast Medical Oncology, Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute, Shandong First Medical University and Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Huadong Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['HER2', 'breast cancer', 'combined therapy', 'metastatic', 'pyrotinib']",2021/08/24 06:00,2021/08/24 06:01,['2021/08/23 06:35'],"['2021/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/23 06:35 [entrez]', '2021/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/24 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.699333 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Aug 5;11:699333. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.699333. eCollection 2021.,20210805,,,,PMC8374067,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.

Methods: Bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) were collected from 20 AML children at the time of initial diagnosis, and a ctDNA sample was isolated from PB. Detection of mutation was performed on ctDNA, BM, and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) by NGS based on a 185-gene panel. Results: Among 185 genes sequenced by the NGS platform, a total of 82 abnormal genes were identified in 20 patients. Among them, 61 genes (74.39%) were detected in ctDNA, PBMC, and BM samples, while 11 (13.41%) genes were found only in ctDNA and 4 (4.88%) were detected only in the BM sample, and 2 (2.44%) were detected only in PBMC. A total of 239 mutations were detected in three samples, while 209 in ctDNA, 180 in bone marrow, and 184 in PBMC. One hundred sixty-four mutations in ctDNA were shared by matched BM samples, and the median variant allelic frequency (VAF) of these mutations was 41.34% (range, 0.55% to 99.96%) and 44.36% (range, 0.56% to 99.98%) in bone marrow and ctDNA. It was found that 65.79% (75/114) of mutations with clinical significance were detected in three samples, with 9 mutations detected both in ctDNA and BM, and 2 mutations detected both in PBMC and BM. The consistency of mutations with clinical significance between ctDNA and BM was 77.06% (84/109). Among the 84 mutations with clinical significance detected in both sources, the concordance of VAF assessment by both methods was high (R(2) = 0.895). Conclusion: This study demonstrates that ctDNA was a reliable sample in pediatric AML and can be used for mutation detection. Consistency analysis showed that ctDNA can mirror the genomic information from BM. In addition, a subset of mutations was exclusively detected in ctDNA. These data support the fact that monitoring ctDNA with next-generation sequencing-based assays can provide more information about gene mutations to guide precision treatment in pediatric AML.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Ruan, Liu, Qi, Chen, Chang, Zhang, Liu, Wang, Liu, Chen,', 'Zhang, Guo, Zou, Zhang, Chen, Liu, Cao, Lou, Wang and Zhu.']","['Ruan, Min', 'Liu, Lipeng', 'Qi, Benquan',

In this study, 131 CML patients were enrolled. Complete blood cell count was performed at the time of diagnosis for all the patients. Cytogenetic (karyotyping) examination using bone marrow samples was conducted on 76 CML patients for the confirmation of Ph-positive (9;22)(q34;q11) standard translocation, complex variant translocation, and additional chromosome abnormalities. FISH was performed on 38 patients for diagnostic purposes and on 39 patients for monitoring purposes. Twenty-two samples of CML patients were evaluated by reverse transcriptase PCR and real-time PCR for the patients who failed to respond against imatinib mesylate. In this study, 72 (54.96%) were males and 59 (45.03%) were females with a median age of 38.5 years. CBC values in the diagnosis process showed that 75 patients had high values of WBC being >100 x 10(3)/mul, while 71 (58.01) patients exhibited reduced values of hemoglobin, i.e., <10.00 mg/dl, and high values of PLTs > 100 were observed in 40 (30.53%) patients. Cytogenetic results show that standard translocation was developed in 63 (82.89%), development of complex variant translocations in 4 (5.32%), additional chromosomal abnormalities (ACAs) in 3 (3.94%), and ACAs together with complex variant translocations in 1 (1.31%) patient.

However, significant adverse effects including nephrotoxicity associated with its use limit its more widespread use. The objectives of our study were to determine the incidence of AmB-d associated nephrotoxicity, to evaluate clinical and epidemiological characteristics of patients, and to support the notion that conventional amphotericin B remains a valid therapeutic option among hematologic patients with proper patient selection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 110 patients with hematologic malignancies were admitted to our Hematology Unit between January 2014 and November 2017 who required anti-fungal therapy during intensive systemic chemotherapy. The incidence of AmB-d associated nephrotoxicity, side effect profile, time to nephrotoxicity, and clinical and epidemiological characteristics associated with treatment success were assessed retrospectively. RESULTS: Of the 110 patients receiving AmB-d, 70 (63.6%) were male and 40 (36.4%) were female. The mean age of participants was 44 years. The most common diagnosis was acute myeloid leukemia (n=53, 48.2%), and the most common chemotherapy protocol was 7 + 3 remission-induction (cytarabine 100 mg/m(2) days 1-7, Idarubicin 12 mg/m(2) days 1-3; n=24, 21.8%). In 56.4% of the patients, antifungal therapy was given empirically. In 40 patients (36.4%), nephrotoxicity was observed following antifungal treatment, and only four patients had stage 3 renal failure. The mean duration of time to nephrotoxicity from initiation of amphotericin B was four days (min: 2, max: 31). All patients were found to receive at least one additional potential nephrotoxic treatment during the antifungal treatment process. Conclusion: AmB-d is associated with a significant risk of nephrotoxicity. In most hematological patients, antifungal treatment is initiated empirically, and patients received prolonged courses of treatment. Therefore, it is plausible to initiate such treatment with AmB-d, when one considers the already high treatment costs in this patient group as well as the fact that AmB-d offers similar efficacy to antifungal agents at a lower cost. AmB-d may be recommended as a first-line agent in this patient group with the introduction of newer and more costly antifungal agents when needed, on the basis of the fact that these patients can be closely monitored in a hospital setting, reversible nature of nephrotoxicity upon discontinuation, and rare occurrence of severe renal failure requiring dialysis.","['Copyright (c) 2021, Gursoy et al.']","['Gursoy, Vildan', 'Ozkalemkas, Fahir', 'Ozkocaman, Vildan', 'Serenli Yegen, Zafer', 'Ethem Pinar, Ibrahim', 'Ener, Beyza', 'Akalin, Halis', 'Kazak, Esra', 'Ali, Ridvan', 'Ersoy, Alparslan']","['Gursoy V', 'Ozkalemkas F', 'Ozkocaman V', 'Serenli Yegen Z', 'Ethem Pinar I', 'Ener B', 'Akalin H', 'Kazak E', 'Ali R', 'Ersoy A']",,"['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Usak University, Usak, TUR.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Uludag University Medical Faculty, Bursa, TUR.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Uludag University Medical Faculty, Bursa, TUR.', 'Division of Hematology, Bursa City Hospital, Bursa, TUR.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Uludag University Medical Faculty, Bursa, TUR.', 'Department of Microbiology, Uludag University Medical Faculty, Bursa, TUR.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Uludag University Medical Faculty, Bursa, TUR.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Uludag University Medical Faculty, Bursa, TUR.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Uludag University Medical Faculty, Bursa, TUR.', 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, Uludag University Medical Faculty, Bursa, TUR.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,['NOTNLM'],"['conventional amphotericin b', 'fungal infections', 'hematological malignancy', 'hypokalemia', 'nephrotoxicity']",2021/08/24 06:00,2021/08/24 06:01,['2021/08/23 06:34'],"['2021/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/23 06:34 [entrez]', '2021/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/24 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.16445 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2021 Jul 17;13(7):e16445. doi: 10.7759/cureus.16445. eCollection 2021 Jul.,20210717,,,,PMC8367387,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multiple cranial nerve palsy is a sign of neurological involvement of CML in its blast phase. The blast crisis represents a real challenge for the clinician, especially during COVID-19 infection. The treatment remains the association of a tyrosine kinase inhibitors with a chemotherapy protocol, as well as the administration of methotrexate and cytarabine by intrathecal and intravenous infusion in high doses. Despite the importance of the association of CML with COVID-19 infection, there is not yet enough data to know the true impact of this infection on the evolution of this hemopathy.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Most infections occur in early childhood, but reinfections during life are common. The clinical course of these infections are usually mild and do not require hospitalization. However, this is not the case for older and/or comorbid patients, especially if lymphoma is a concurrent disease. Here, we report on a case of an 81-year-old man, who suffered from chronic lymphocytic leukemia. During the first coronavirus disease (COVID) wave, he was admitted to the emergency department with respiratory symptoms. Initially, he was suspected as having SARS-CoV2 infection, but a broad diagnostic approach revealed a HMPV infection. The patient showed remarkable, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and worsened within a few days. Consequently, he had to be admitted to the intensive care unit, where he was mechanically ventilated. Clinically, the patient worsened further and died on day 5 after admission. Severe HMPV infections are rare. However, patients suffering from hematological diseases are at high risk, which is exemplified in this case report.","['(c) Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature 2021.']","['Rumpold, Holger']",['Rumpold H'],['ORCID: 0000-0002-4118-0111'],"['Gastrointestinal Cancer Center, Ordensklinikum Linz, Seilerstatte 4, 4010 Linz, Austria.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Austria,Memo,Memo,101467972,,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'Compromised immunsystem', 'Corona virus', 'Human metapneumovirus', 'Severe course']",2021/08/24 06:00,2021/08/24 06:00,['2021/08/23 06:29'],"['2021/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/23 06:29 [entrez]', '2021/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12254-021-00734-0 [doi]', '734 [pii]']",aheadofprint,Memo. 2021 Aug 18:1-3. doi: 10.1007/s12254-021-00734-0.,20210818,,,,PMC8371298,['Conflict of interestH.

Despite the identification of many prognostic factors, relatively few have made their way into clinical practice. Therefore, the identification of new AML biomarkers is useful in the prognosis and monitoring of AML and contributes to a better understanding of the molecular basis of the disease. Homeobox (HOX) genes are transcription factors that lead to cell differentiation blockade and malignant self-renewal. However, the roles of HOX genes in AML are still not fully understood and need further exploration, which may provide new strategies for the prognosis and monitoring of AML. Methods: We analyzed the RNA sequencing and clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), VIZOME, GSE13159, and GSE9476 cohorts. Analyses were performed with GraphPad 7, the R language, and several online databases. We applied quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western Blotting, CCK8 cell proliferation assays, and flow cytometry to verify the conclusions of the bioinformatics analysis. Results: We identified HOXB5 as the only gene among the HOX family that was not only elevated in AML but also a significant prognostic marker in AML patients. HOXB5 was highly expressed in AML patients with NPM1, FLT3, or DNMT3A mutations and was expressed at the highest level in patients with NPM1-FLT3-DNMT3A triple-mutant AML. Gene Ontology analysis and gene set enrichment analysis revealed that HOXB5 showed a negative correlation with the myeloid cell differentiation signature and that the tumor necrosis factor/nuclear factor kappaB signaling pathway was involved in the molecular mechanism. Moreover, we performed in silico protein-protein interaction analysis and 450K TCGA DNA methylation data analysis and found that HOXB5 interacted with two HOX genes (HOXA7 and HOXB4) that were commonly regulated by DNA methylation levels. Conclusion: HOXB5 is associated with the malignant development of AML and may be a treatment target and biomarker for AML prognosis prediction.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Chen, Qu, Yue and Yan.']","['Chen, Miao', 'Qu, Yi', 'Yue, Pengjie', 'Yan, Xiaojing']","['Chen M', 'Qu Y', 'Yue P', 'Yan X']",,"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'HOXB5', 'TNF/NF-kappaB', 'differentiation', 'methylation', 'prognosis']",2021/08/24 06:00,2021/08/24 06:01,['2021/08/23 06:27'],"['2021/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/23 06:27 [entrez]', '2021/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/24 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fgene.2021.678368 [doi]'],epublish,Front Genet. 2021 Aug 5;12:678368. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2021.678368. eCollection 2021.,20210805,,,,PMC8376581,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immune cells are known to migrate towards both chemical (chemotaxis), physical (mechanotaxis) and electric stimuli (electrotaxis). Electrotaxis is the guided migration of cells along electric fields, and has previously been reported in T-cells and cancer cells. However, there remains a need for engineering tools with high spatial and temporal resolution to quantify EF guided migration. Here we report the development of an electrotaxis-on-chip (ETOC) platform that enables the quantification of dHL-60 cell, a model neutrophil-like cell line, migration toward both electrical and chemoattractant gradients. Neutrophils are the most abundant white blood cells and set the stage for the magnitude of the immune response. Therefore, developing engineering tools to direct neutrophil migration patterns has applications in both infectious disease and inflammatory disorders. The ETOC developed in this study has embedded electrodes and four migration zones connected to a central cell-loading chamber with migration channels [10 microm X 10 microm]. This device enables both parallel and competing chemoattractant and electric fields. We use our novel ETOC platform to investigate dHL-60 cell migration in three biologically relevant conditions: 1) in a DC electric field; 2) parallel chemical gradient and electric fields; and 3) perpendicular chemical gradient and electric field. In this study we used differentiated leukemia cancer cells (dHL60 cells), an accepted model for human peripheral blood neutrophils. We first quantified effects of electric field intensities (0.4V/cm-1V/cm) on dHL-60 cell electrotaxis. Our results show optimal migration at 0.6 V/cm. In the second scenario, we tested whether it was possible to increase dHL-60 cell migration to a bacterial signal [N-formylated peptides (fMLP)] by adding a parallel electric field. Our results show that there was significant increase (6-fold increase) in dHL60 migration toward fMLP and cathode of DC electric field (0.6V/cm, n=4, p-value<0.005) vs. fMLP alone. Finally, we evaluated whether we could decrease or re-direct dHL-60 cell migration away from an inflammatory signal [leukotriene B4 (LTB4)]. The perpendicular electric field significantly decreased migration (2.9-fold decrease) of dHL60s toward LTB4 vs. LTB4 alone. Our microfluidic device enabled us to quantify single-cell electrotaxis velocity (7.9 microm/min +/- 3.6). The magnitude and direction of the electric field can be more precisely and quickly changed than most other guidance cues such as chemical cues in clinical investigation. A better understanding of EF guided cell migration will enable the development of new EF-based treatments to precisely direct immune cell migration for wound care, infection, and other inflammatory disorders.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Moarefian, Davalos, Burton and Jones.']","['Moarefian, Maryam', 'Davalos, Rafael V', 'Burton, Michael D', 'Jones, Caroline N']","['Moarefian M', 'Davalos RV', 'Burton MD', 'Jones CN']",,"['Department of Biological Sciences, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, United States.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering and Mechanics, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, United States.', 'Department of Neuroscience, Neuroimmunology and Behavior Group, School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, United States.', 'Department of Bioengineering, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, United States.']",['eng'],['R35 GM133610/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*electrotaxis', '*immunomodulation', '*microfluidics', '*migration', '*neutrophil', '*wound healing']",2021/08/24 06:00,2021/10/27 06:00,['2021/08/23 06:27'],"['2021/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/23 06:27 [entrez]', '2021/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2021.674727 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2021 Aug 6;12:674727. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.674727. eCollection 2021.,20210806,20211026,,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Movement/*physiology', 'Chemotaxis', 'Electricity', 'Electrochemical Techniques/*methods', 'Electromagnetic Fields', 'Humans', 'Lab-On-A-Chip Devices', 'Neutrophils/*physiology', 'Wound Healing']",PMC8379007,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this prospective study was to describe clinical management and outcomes of COVID-19 in pediatric oncology patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Conducted between May 1, 2020 and November 30, 2020, this study included 76 pediatric oncology patients with confirmed COVID-19. Remdesivir (RDV) was the antiviral therapy used. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 9 years. Sixty patients were on first line treatment. Hematological malignancies constituted 86.8% of patients. Severe to critical infections were 35.4% of patients. The commonest symptom was fever (93.4%). Chemotherapy was delayed in 59.2% of patients and doses were modified in 30.2%. The 60-day overall survival (OS) stood at 86.8%, with mortalities occurring only among critical patients. Of sixteen acute leukemia patients in the first induction therapy, 13 survived and 10 achieved complete remission. A negative RT-PCR within 2 weeks and improvement of radiological findings were statistically related to disease severity (P = .008 and .002, respectively). Better OS was associated with regression of radiological findings after 30 days from infection (P = .002). Forty-five patients received RDV, 42.1% had severe and critical forms of infection compared to 25.7% in the No-RDV group and yet OS was comparable in both groups. CONCLUSION: Most pediatric cancer patients with COVID-19 should have good clinical outcomes except for patients with critical infections. Cancer patients can tolerate chemotherapy including induction phase, alongside COVID-19 treatment. In severe and critical COVID-19, RDV might have a potential benefit.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

HTLV-1 principally infects CD4(+) T cells comprising regulatory T cells (Tregs), T helper 1 (Th1), and T helper 2 (Th2), while BLV infects B lymphocytes. Both viruses may impel cell proliferation and malignancy. METHODS: To survey the transcriptomic variations due to HTLV-1 and BLV infection and further hematologic malignancies, differential expression genes (DEGs) were explored between leukemia and normal samples using the DESeq2 package. Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) were then performed to identify significant gene sets using the FGSEA package. Afterward, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were reconstructed using the STRING online database. Eventually, the hub significant genes and modules were determined through network analysis and MCODE algorithm, respectively. RESULTS: Our results uncloaked that four common functional gene sets including mitotic-spindle, G2M-checkpoint, E2F-targets, and MYC-targets-V1 are involved in the human and ovine hosts. Furthermore, twelve up-regulated hub genes including BIRC5, CCNA2, CCNB2, BUB1, DLGAP5, TOP2A, PBK, ASPM, UBE2C, CEP55, KIF20A, and NUSAP1 were identified which were similarly activated in both human and ovine hosts. They mostly participate in pathways including cell cycle, cell division, DNA damage responses, growth factors production, and p53 signaling pathway. The dysregulated hub genes and pathways seem to be involved in the development and progression of the infected cells toward malignancy. CONCLUSION: There is common gene groups between HTLV-1 and BLV infections that promote viral malignancy through enhancing cell proliferation and overall survival of cancer cells. The dysregulated genes and pathways may be the efficient candidates for the therapy of the mentioned life-threatening diseases.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the expression profile of NORAD and its clinical implications in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is unclear. The current study aimed to explore the NORAD expression status and its clinical significance in non-M3 AML patients. METHODS: NORAD expression was evaluated in 60 de novo non-M3 AML patients and 49 healthy individuals using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction method. The correlation between NORAD transcription levels and clinicopathologic characteristics was statistically studied. RESULTS: Compared with the healthy controls, NORAD was consistently higher in non-M3 AML patients (p = .01). Furthermore, initial NORAD upregulation occurred more frequently in patients with unfavorable cytogenetic risk (p = .02). The non-M3 AML patients were divided into NORAD high-expressing (NORAD(high)) and NORAD low-expressing (NORAD(low)) groups based on the median NORAD expression level. Univariate analyses revealed that patients with high expression levels of NORAD had relatively poor overall survival (p = .03) and relapse-free survival (RFS) (p = .01). Additionally, multivariate analysis highlighted that NORAD upregulation was an independent risk factor for RFS. CONCLUSION: Our observations indicate the fact that high expression of NORAD could be an unfavorable risk factor in non-M3 AML patients, and NORAD might be a novel therapeutic candidate for future treatments targeting AML.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

However, its components and effectiveness in the treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and its mechanism of anti-cancer activity remain unknown. In the current study, high-performance liquid chromatography-evaporative light scattering detector (HPLC-ELSD) was used to analyze the components of BJOE. Then, the anti-leukemia effects of BJOE were examined both in vitro and in vivo using ALL Jurkat cells and the p388 mouse leukemia transplant model, respectively. The primary ALL leukemia cells were also used to confirm the anti-leukemia effects of BJOE. The apoptotic-related results indicated that BJOE induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells and were suggestive of intrinsic apoptotic induction. Moreover, BJOE inhibited Akt (protein kinase B) activation and upregulated its downstream targets p53 and FoxO1 (forkhead box gene, group O-1) to initiate apoptosis. The activation of GSK3beta was also involved. Our findings demonstrate that BJOE has anti-leukemia effects on ALL cells and can induce apoptosis in Jurkat cells through the phosphoinositide3-kinase (PI3K) /Akt signaling pathway.","['Copyright (c) 2021 China Pharmaceutical University.

Attention to the oral manifestations is essential for better management. This study assessed the oral and dental consultations conducted in the admitted leukemic patients of an Iranian teaching hospital. METHODS: In this descriptive cross-sectional study, medical records of patients admitted in Yazd Shahid Sadoughi Hospital were evaluated. Records of 300 patients with leukemia were randomly selected. Data including demographic information on age, sex, type of oral problems, prescribed instructions and leukemia type were extracted from archived records and registered on the checklist. Finally, Data were analyzed by SPSS17 using Chi-square test. RESULTS: The results showed the average age +/- SD of patients were 24.36 +/- 23.91 with a range of 4 days to 86 years. Among 300 files, 167 belonged to males (55.7%) and 133 pertained to females (44.3%). The most prevalent type of underlying disease was ALL (Acute lymphocytic leukemia) with the frequency of 180 persons (60%). Only 12 (4%) of patients were referred to a specialist due to oral problems. Of all cases of consultation requests, 75% received consultation because of dental problems and 25% for mucosal problems. There was a statistically significant difference between age and consultation request (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: According to the results of this study, orodental consultation request rate for admitted leukemic patients was low. Pediatric hematologist and oncologists to some extent had more interest to consult due to oral and dental problems rather than others.",['(c) 2021.

Such scenario connects two important consequences: (a) fire damage and (b) radiation health threat. Computational simulations considering hypothetic fire scenarios in hospitals using radioactive material can provide valuable information about such an event. The initial decision in regards to an emergency response should consider the fire consequences and radiation doses distribution in the environment with consequences appearing at different times. While the fire presents an immediate threat, radiation exposure also creates immediate and future concerns. The purpose of this study is to evaluate leukemia risk from a hypothetical radiological fire event in a hospital operating Cs-137 gamma blood irradiator. The simulation in this study used the Hotspot Health Physics software to generate output data such as total effective dose (TED). The data from HotSpot was then used as an input to the leukemia risk equations from Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation Committee V and VII (BEIR V and VII) models accordingly. Results suggest that the risks are dependent of wind speed and height of release; however, when age and sex are taken into account different outputs are shown. Also, the risk model can be changed from BEIR VII (low doses) to BEIR V (high doses) as radiation doses rise due to its time-dependent behavior. Such change would bring potential impacts on logistics and risk communication.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Nevertheless, significant concern has been raised regarding long-term TKI-associated vascular adverse events (VAEs). The objective of this retrospective cohort study was to investigate the incidence of VAEs in Taiwanese patients with CML treated with different TKIs (imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib) as well as potential risk factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Taiwan Cancer Registry Database and National Health Insurance Research Database. Adult patients diagnosed with CML from 2008 to 2016 were identified and categorized into three groups according to their first-line TKI treatment (imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib). Propensity score matching was performed to control for potential confounders. Cox regressions were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of VAEs in different TKI groups. RESULTS: In total, 1,111 patients with CML were included in our study. We found that the risk of VAEs in nilotinib users was significantly higher than that in imatinib users, with an HR of 3.13 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.30-7.51), whereas dasatinib users also showed a nonsignificant trend for developing VAEs, with an HR of 1.71 (95% CI, 0.71-4.26). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, only nilotinib usage, older age, and history of cerebrovascular diseases were identified as significant risk factors. The annual incidence rate of VAEs was highest within the first year after the initiation of TKIs. CONCLUSION: These findings can support clinicians in making treatment decisions and monitoring VAEs in patients with CML in Taiwan. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study found that patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) treated with nilotinib and dasatinib may be exposed to a higher risk of developing vascular adverse events (VAEs) compared with those treated with imatinib. Thus, this study suggests that patients with CML who are older or have a history of cerebrovascular diseases should be under close monitoring of VAEs, particularly within the first year after the initiation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors.",['(c) 2021 AlphaMed Press.'],"['Chen, Mei-Tsen', 'Huang, Shih-Tsung', 'Lin, Chih-Wan', 'Ko, Bor-Sheng', 'Chen, Wen-Jone', 'Huang, Huai-Hsuan', 'Hsiao, Fei-Yuan']","['Chen MT', 'Huang ST', 'Lin CW', 'Ko BS', 'Chen WJ', 'Huang HH', 'Hsiao FY']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7965-7579', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2098-5922', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3098-6371', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1660-9120']","['Graduate Institute of Clinical Pharmacy, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Pharmacy, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Pharmacy, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Hematological Oncology, National Taiwan University Cancer Center, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Pharmacy, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'School of Pharmacy, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*Tyrosine kinase inhibitors', '*Vascular adverse events']",2021/08/22 06:00,2021/12/22 06:00,['2021/08/21 17:16'],"['2021/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/22 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/21 17:16 [entrez]']",['10.1002/onco.13944 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncologist. 2021 Nov;26(11):974-982. doi: 10.1002/onco.13944.

Attempts to increase proportion of patients achieving TFR include combination of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) and other drugs. Interferon-alpha in addition to TKI has shown promising efficacy but with dose-dependent toxicity and discontinuations. NordCML007 was initiated to study the efficacy and safety of low dose pegylated IFN-alpha (PegIFN-alpha) in combination with dasatinib (DAS) in CML-CP. METHODS: Forty patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP were given DAS upfront. After month 3 (M3) 15 mug/wk of PegIFN-alpha was added and increased to 25 mug/wk from M7 until M15. DAS treatment was continued and adverse events and BCR-ABL1 qRT-PCR values were reported yearly after M24. Results from M1 to M18 have previously been published, and here we present long-term data. RESULTS: After 5 years of follow-up, there were no suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, no increase in serosal effusions, no disease progressions and no CML-related deaths. Rates of MR(3.0) (MMR), MR(4.0) and MR(4.5) were 84.6%, 64.1% and 51.3% respectively at M60, and 95% of patients reached MMR at some point during the study. CONCLUSION: Initial addition of PegIFN-alpha to DAS shows good long-term efficacy without increased toxicity.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

This review examines data on their epidemiology, genetics, clinical presentation, and response to treatment while highlighting areas of similarity and divergence between these two clinical entities. RECENT FINDINGS: Pediatric-type ALL chemotherapy regimens, compared to both lymphoma-type chemotherapy and adult-type ALL regimens, have led to improved outcomes for children, adolescents, and young adults with ALL. BCR-ABL-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have improved outcomes in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph +) ALL and in rare cases of Ph + LBL. Newer therapies including blinatumomab, inotuzumab, CAR-T therapy, and nelarabine have improved outcomes in selected cases of ALL and have an emerging role in the management of LBL. Better understanding of ALL and LBL biology allows for the development of therapies that target immunophenotypic or genetic features found in subsets of both diseases. Novel therapies are leading to improved outcomes in Ph + and relapsed and refractory disease.","['(c) 2021.

Topical ATRA (retin-a, retin-a micro, atralin, renova, and avita) is the active pharmaceutical ingredient for FDA-approved treatments for acne and skin wrinkles. Oral formulations (Vesanoid) treat acute promyelocytic leukemia, but oral dosing can induce severe side effects. Despite benefits in various rodent models of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), toxicity and controversial clinical observations have diminished enthusiasm for ATRA IBD clinical trials. To circumvent these issues and to use ATRA's key role in maintaining gut tolerance, we developed a poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microsphere (MS) encapsulated ATRA formulation aimed at directing ATRA delivery to immune structures of the gut, limiting systemic exposure. Initially, ATRA MS was developed as a component of a combinatorial product (TreXTAM) that also contained encapsulated transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and ATRA in a 1:2 w/w ratio. Although the combination was optimal, benefit was also observed when ATRA MS was given alone in the CD4+ CD25-T-cell adoptive transfer (ACT) colitis model. METHODS: We used the ACT and DSS-induced murine models of colitis to expand on the dose-dependent effects of oral ATRA MS when given alone. The DSS model was also used to compare the efficacy of ATRA MS and soluble ATRA, while healthy animals were used to compare the pharmacokinetics of the two drugs. RESULTS: In both the ACT and DSS-induced murine models of colitis, ATRA MS was observed to be effective in ameliorating disease. ATRA MS was also observed to be more effective than soluble ATRA in these models and displayed more favorable pharmacokinetics. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest ATRA MS, as a standalone product, may attenuate IBD and perhaps limit fibrosis, while limiting systemic side effects.","[""(c) 2021 Crohn's & Colitis Foundation.

We evaluated clinical characteristics and patient outcomes and proposed a management protocol. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective review of all children with mediastinal mass at the pediatric intensive care unit of the Hong Kong Children's Hospital between April 2019 and March 2020. RESULTS: Ten children with a median age of 14.5 years (interquartile range, 9.3-17.0 years) were included. Leukemia and lymphoma accounted for the majority of cases (n = 6, 60%). Nearly all patients (n = 9, 90%) required interhospital transport before definitive treatment could be instituted. There were no deaths, but 2 patients were transported with significant respiratory compromise. Among patients requiring more than 1 interhospital transport, there was a higher incidence of shortness of breath (100% vs 40%; odds ratio, 33; P = 0.048) and orthopnea (80% vs 0%; odds ratio, 33; P = 0.048), whereas none had a neck mass (0% vs 80%; odds ratio, 0.03; P = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS: Children with mediastinal mass are at risk of life-threatening cardiorespiratory compromise. Pretransport assessment, planning, and stabilization along with clear management plans for deterioration during transport are crucial especially for patients who are symptomatic at time of presentation, to reduce risks associated with delays in arriving at the specialist point of care for definitive treatment.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Transgenic expression of TCL1 in B cells leads after a long latency to a CLL-like disease in aged Emicro-TCL1 mice suggesting that TCL1 overexpression is not sufficient for full leukemic transformation. In search for secondary genetic events and to elucidate the clonal evolution of CLL, we performed whole exome and B-cell receptor sequencing of longitudinal leukemia samples of Emicro-TCL1 mice. We observed a B-cell receptor stereotypy, as described in patients, confirming that CLL is an antigen-driven disease. Deep sequencing showed that leukemia in Emicro-TCL1 mice is mostly monoclonal. Rare oligoclonality was associated with inability of tumors to develop disease upon adoptive transfer in mice. In addition, we identified clonal changes and a sequential acquisition of mutations with known relevance in CLL, which highlights the genetic similarities and therefore, suitability of the Emicro-TCL1 mouse model for progressive CLL. Among them, a recurrent gain of chromosome 15, where Myc is located, was identified in almost all tumors in Emicro-TCL1 mice. Interestingly, amplification of 8q24, the chromosomal region containing MYC in humans, was associated with worse outcome of patients with CLL.",['(c) 2021.

In this study, we demonstrate that whereas NK cells are inhibited, closely related type 1 innate lymphoid cells (ILC1s) are enriched in the bone marrow of leukemic mice and in patients with AML. Because NK cells and ILC1s share a common precursor (ILCP), we asked if AML acts on the ILCP to alter developmental potential. A combination of ex vivo and in vivo studies revealed that AML skewing of the ILCP toward ILC1s and away from NK cells represented a major mechanism of ILC1 generation. This process was driven by AML-mediated activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a key transcription factor in ILCs, as inhibition of AHR led to decreased numbers of ILC1s and increased NK cells in the presence of AML. These results demonstrate a mechanism of ILC developmental skewing in AML and support further preclinical study of AHR inhibition in restoring normal NK cell development and function in the setting of AML.","['Copyright (c) 2021 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']","['Lordo, Matthew R', 'Wu, Kevin G', 'Altynova, Ekaterina', 'Shilo, Nikolas', 'Kronen, Parker', 'Nalin, Ansel P', 'Weigel, Christoph', 'Zhang, Xiaoli', 'Yu, Jianhua', 'Oakes, Christopher C', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Freud, Aharon G', 'Mundy-Bosse, Bethany L']","['Lordo MR', 'Wu KG', 'Altynova E', 'Shilo N', 'Kronen P', 'Nalin AP', 'Weigel C', 'Zhang X', 'Yu J', 'Oakes CC', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Freud AG', 'Mundy-Bosse BL']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7108-9765', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3391-0815', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5673-0203', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0326-3223', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4095-3020', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6086-1521']","['Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Medical Scientist Training Program, Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Medical Scientist Training Program, Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Center for Biostatistics/Department of Biomedical Informatics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'City of Hope National Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH; and.', 'City of Hope National Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH; bethany.mundy@osumc.edu aharon.freud@osumc.edu.', 'Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH; bethany.mundy@osumc.edu aharon.freud@osumc.edu.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH; and.']",['eng'],"['K22 CA218466/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA068458/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'L30 CA199447/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA210087/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA208353/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA068458/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA247550/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,,,2021/08/22 06:00,2021/09/24 06:00,['2021/08/21 05:34'],"['2021/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/09/15 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/08/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/24 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/21 05:34 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.2100023 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.2100023 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2021 Sep 15;207(6):1672-1682. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.2100023.

SS is divided into three subtypes: classical (or idiopathic), malignancy associated and drug induced. Medication-induced subtype accounts for up to 26% of cases. In recent years, emerging evidence has showed that SS may also occur in neutropenic patients who underwent induction for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The identification of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene mutation in approximately 30% of patients with AML has promoted the targeted therapy with FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) inhibitors.

Here, we uncovered the mechanism underlying the relapse of ALL driven by an activating mutation of the NSD2 histone methyltransferase (p.E1099K). Using high-throughput drug screening, we found that NSD2-mutant cells were specifically resistant to glucocorticoids. Correction of this mutation restored glucocorticoid sensitivity. The transcriptional response to glucocorticoids was blocked in NSD2-mutant cells due to depressed glucocorticoid receptor (GR) levels and the failure of glucocorticoids to autoactivate GR expression. Although H3K27me3 was globally decreased by NSD2 p.E1099K, H3K27me3 accumulated at the NR3C1 (GR) promoter. Pretreatment of NSD2 p.E1099K cell lines and patient-derived xenograft samples with PRC2 inhibitors reversed glucocorticoid resistance in vitro and in vivo. PRC2 inhibitors restored NR3C1 autoactivation by glucocorticoids, increasing GR levels and allowing GR binding and activation of proapoptotic genes. These findings suggest a new therapeutic approach to relapsed ALL associated with NSD2 mutation. SIGNIFICANCE: NSD2 histone methyltransferase mutations observed in relapsed pediatric ALL drove glucocorticoid resistance by repression of the GR and abrogation of GR gene autoactivation due to accumulation of K3K27me3 at its promoter. Pretreatment with PRC2 inhibitors reversed resistance, suggesting a new therapeutic approach to these patients with ALL.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1.",['(c)2021 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Li, Jianping', 'Hlavka-Zhang, Julia', 'Shrimp, Jonathan H', 'Piper, Crissandra', 'Dupere-Richer, Daphne', 'Roth, Jacob S', 'Jing, Duohui', 'Casellas Roman, Heidi L', 'Troche, Catalina', 'Swaroop, Alok', 'Kulis, Marta', 'Oyer, Jon A', 'Will, Christine M', 'Shen, Min', 'Riva, Alberto', 'Bennett, Richard L', 'Ferrando, Adolfo A', 'Hall, Matthew D', 'Lock, Richard B', 'Licht, Jonathan D']","['Li J', 'Hlavka-Zhang J', 'Shrimp JH', 'Piper C', 'Dupere-Richer D', 'Roth JS', 'Jing D', 'Casellas Roman HL', 'Troche C', 'Swaroop A', 'Kulis M', 'Oyer JA', 'Will CM', 'Shen M', 'Riva A', 'Bennett RL', 'Ferrando AA', 'Hall MD', 'Lock RB', 'Licht JD']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9279-2970', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9872-942X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0521-8677', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1491-8002', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0317-6688', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9150-8333', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5073-442X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3942-1369']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Florida Health Cancer Center, Gainesville, Florida.', ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, University of New South Wales Sydney, Sydney, Australia."", 'National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NIH, Rockville, Maryland.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Florida Health Cancer Center, Gainesville, Florida.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Florida Health Cancer Center, Gainesville, Florida.', 'National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NIH, Rockville, Maryland.', ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, University of New South Wales Sydney, Sydney, Australia."", 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Florida Health Cancer Center, Gainesville, Florida.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Florida Health Cancer Center, Gainesville, Florida.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Florida Health Cancer Center, Gainesville, Florida.', 'Fundacio Clinic per a la Recerca Biomedica, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Pfizer Inc., Oncology Research and Development, San Diego, California.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Florida Health Cancer Center, Gainesville, Florida.', 'National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NIH, Rockville, Maryland.', 'Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Florida Health Cancer Center, Gainesville, Florida.', 'Institute of Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NIH, Rockville, Maryland.', ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, University of New South Wales Sydney, Sydney, Australia."", 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Florida Health Cancer Center, Gainesville, Florida. jdlicht@ufl.edu.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Comment']",United States,Cancer Discov,Cancer discovery,101561693,IM,,,2021/08/22 06:00,2021/08/22 06:00,['2021/08/21 05:34'],"['2020/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/21 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/22 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/21 05:34 [entrez]']","['2159-8290.CD-20-1771 [pii]', '10.1158/2159-8290.CD-20-1771 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Discov. 2022 Jan;12(1):186-203. doi: 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-20-1771.

Derangement of BCL2-regulated control mechanisms is a defining characteristic of certain malignancies, and it was hypothesized that the oligonucleotide would promote anticancer activity via suppression of BCL2 transcription. METHODS: PNT2258 was evaluated in this, multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label Phase 2 study in 13 participants with relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies to investigate potential antitumor activity and safety. Participants with follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia received intravenous PNT2258 120 mg/m(2) on Days 1 to 5 of a 21-day cycle for up to 8 cycles, followed by 100 mg/m(2) on Days 1 to 2 of a 28-day cycle until study withdrawal. RESULTS: All 13 participants were treated with PNT2258 monotherapy and evaluable for response and safety and tolerability. The overall response rate was 53.8% (7/13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 25.1%-80.8%). Median duration of response was 23.4 months (range, 3, 31.5). The disease control rate of participants with stable disease or better was 84.6% (95% CI, 54.6%-98.1%). The most frequently (>/=50%) observed adverse events (AEs) were nausea, chills, diarrhea, fatigue, headache, vomiting, and back pain. Hypertension (30.8%) and diarrhea (23.1%) were the most frequent grade >/=3 AEs. No deaths were observed. CONCLUSION: Clinically meaningful and durable activity with an acceptable safety profile was observed in participants with relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies who received single-agent PNT2258.

This study tests whether administration of propolis and nano-propolis (NP) can alleviate oxidative stress and apoptosis in rats with testicular damage induced by CP. METHODS: In this study, polymeric nanoparticles including propolis were synthesized with a green sonication method and characterized using Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, and wet scanning transmission electron microscopy techniques. In total, 56 rats were divided into the following seven groups: control, CP, propolis, NP-10, CP + propolis, CP + NP-10, and CP + NP-30. Propolis (100 mg/kg), NP-10 (10 mg/kg), and NP-30 (30 mg/kg) treatments were administered by gavage daily for 21 d, and CP (3 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally in a single dose. After the experiment, oxidative stress parameters, namely, malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase (CAT), and apoptotic pathways including B cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 protein (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) were measured in testicular tissues. Furthermore, sperm quality and weights of the testis, epididymis, right cauda epididymis, seminal vesicles and prostate were evaluated. RESULTS: Propolis and NP (especially NP-30) were able to preserve oxidative balance (decreased MDA levels and increased GSH, CAT, and GPx activities) and activate apoptotic pathways (decreased Bax and increased Bcl-2) in the testes of CP-treated rats. Sperm motility in the control, CP, and CP + NP-30 groups were 60%, 48.75%, and 78%, respectively (P < 0.001). Especially, NP-30 application completely corrected the deterioration in sperm features induced by CP. CONCLUSION: The results show that propolis and NP treatments mitigated the side effects of CP on spermatogenic activity, antioxidant situation, and apoptosis in rats.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

Monocytes/macrophages initiate innate immune response, and is considered to be the cell that first comes into contact with the pathogen. They play effective roles in innate immune and inflammatory responses by intercellular relations and inflammatory mediator secretion. Human THP-1 leukemia cells are frequently used for the in vitro determination of the signal pathways, and the functions of monocyte/macrophages. Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) are complex networks of signaling pathways that regulate many important cellular behaviors, especially in inflammation, cell death, cell differentiation or proliferation. Midkine (MK) is a cytokine and growth factor that is one of the regulators of inflammatory processes, immune cell functions, proliferation and autoimmunity. The effects of Vit D3 on inflammation and MK secretion in hyperglycemia is still unknown. In this study, it was aimed to determine the dose-dependent effects of Vit D3 on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated pro/ anti-inflammatory cytokine, NF-kappaB and MK responses of THP-1 monocyte cells under normo and hyperglycemic conditions. For this purpose, THP-1 monocyte cells stimulated with LPS (Escherichia coli, 0111, 1 mug/ml) under normoglycemic (glucose 100 mg/dl)/hyperglycemic (glucose 500 mg/dl) conditions, were incubated for 24 hours in the presence and absence of 10-50-100 IU/ml Vit D3. MK, TNF-alpha, IL-8, IL-10 cytokine levels in the supernatants collected from the wells at the end of the incubation periods, and NF-kappaB levels in the obtained cell lysates were detected by ELISA method. LPS stimulation induced higher levels of TNF-alpha, IL-8 and MK responses in hyperglycemic conditions. IL-10 secretions were found to be decreased under hyperglycemia. Vit D3 modulates TNF-alpha, IL-10 and MK secretions in hyperglycemic conditions. The MK and TNF-alpha levels were determined to be correlated with NF-kappaB and IL-10. The results obtained in the study showed that Vit D3 can play a role in immune modulation by regulating NF-kappaB and cytokine/ chemokine-like molecule MK suppression and proinflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokine balance. The mechanism of the action of Vit D3 under different conditions should be examined in detail.",,"['Biriken, Derya', 'Aribal Ayral, Pelin', 'Yazihan, Nuray']","['Biriken D', 'Aribal Ayral P', 'Yazihan N']",,"['Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Microbiology, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Division of Pathophysiology, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Division of Pathophysiology, Ankara, Turkey.']",['tur'],,['Journal Article'],Turkey,Mikrobiyol Bul,Mikrobiyoloji bulteni,7503830,IM,,,2021/08/22 06:00,2021/08/25 06:00,['2021/08/21 04:32'],"['2021/08/21 04:32 [entrez]', '2021/08/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5578/mb.20219809 [doi]'],ppublish,Mikrobiyol Bul. 2021 Jul;55(3):406-414. doi: 10.5578/mb.20219809.,,20210824,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)']","['*Cholecalciferol/pharmacology', 'Cytokines', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', '*Monocytes', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha']",,,,,,,,,,Vitamin D3'un Monositlerin Immun Yaniti Uzerindeki Rolu.,,,,,,,

Most patients, however, do not derive benefit from these agents. Therefore, there is a crucial need to identify novel and reliable biomarkers of resistance to such treatments in order to prescribe potentially toxic and costly treatments only to patients with expected therapeutic benefits. In the wake of genomics, the study of proteins is now emerging as the new frontier for understanding real-time human biology. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the proteome of plasma samples, collected before treatment onset, from two independent prospective cohorts of cancer patients treated with ICB (discovery cohort n = 95, validation cohort n = 292). We then investigated the correlation between protein plasma levels, clinical benefit rate, progression-free survival and overall survival by Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: By using an unbiased proteomics approach, we show that, in both discovery and validation cohorts, elevated baseline serum level of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is associated with a poor clinical outcome in cancer patients treated with ICB, independently of other prognostic factors. We also demonstrated that the circulating level of LIF is inversely correlated with the presence of tertiary lymphoid structures in the tumor microenvironment.

We assessed the risk of KFRT among patients with various types of cancer collectively and with specific types of cancer. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective population-based cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2,473,095 participants with (n = 824,365) or without (n = 1,648,730) cancer registered in the Korean National Health Insurance Service database. PREDICTORS: Cancer and cancer subtypes defined using International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification, codes. OUTCOMES: Primary outcome was KFRT defined as the initiation of hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis or kidney transplantation. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: For each patient with cancer, 2 controls matched for age, sex, estimated glomerular filtration rate, diabetes, and hypertension were included. To address the competing risk of death, a competing risk survival analysis was conducted using the Fine and Gray method. RESULTS: Occurrence of KFRT was higher in patients with cancer than in controls without cancer (incidence rates of 1.07 vs 0.51 cases per 1,000 person-years). Competing risk analysis showed that cancer was significantly associated with an increased risk of KFRT after adjusting for other potential predictors (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.29 [95% CI, 2.20-2.39]). Multiple myeloma, leukemia, lymphoma, and kidney, ovarian, and liver cancer were most significantly associated with an increased KFRT risk, with multiple myeloma conferring the highest risk across age and sex groups. All subgroups of patients with cancer (based on age, sex, smoking, alcohol, exercise, obesity, and comorbid conditions) exhibited a higher risk of KFRT. LIMITATIONS: Causal association between cancer and kidney outcomes could not be confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cancer, particularly those with multiple myeloma, exhibited an increased risk of KFRT after accounting for the competing risk of death.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors.

To what extent differences in cytidine deaminase (CDA) activity, the enzyme that catabolizes free cytarabine in the liver, can affect the pharmacokinetics of liposomal cytarabine as well, is unknown. We have studied the pharmacokinetics (PK) of released, liposomal and total cytarabine using a population-modeling approach in 9 adult AML patients treated with liposomal CPX-351. Exposure levels and PK parameters were compared with respect to the patient's CDA status (i.e., Poor Metabolizer (PM) vs. Extensive Metabolizer (EM)). Overall response rate was 75%, and 56% of patients had non-hematological severe toxicities, including one lethal toxicity. All patients had febrile neutropenia. A large (>60%) inter-individual variability was observed on pharmacokinetics parameters and subsequent drug levels. A trend towards severe toxicities was observed in patients with higher exposure of cytarabine. Results showed that liposomal CPX-351 led to sustained exposure with reduced clearance (Cl = 0.16 L/h) and prolonged half-life (T1/2 = 28 h). Liposomal nanoparticles were observed transiently in bone marrow with cytarabine levels 2.3-time higher than in plasma. Seven out of 9 patients were PM with a strong impact on the PK parameters, i.e., PM patients showing higher cytarabine levels as compared with EM patients (AUC: 5536 vs. 1784 ng/mL.h), sustained plasma exposure (T1/2: 33.9 vs. 13.7 h), and reduced clearance (Cl: 0.12 vs. 0.29 L/h). This proof-of-concept study suggests that CDA status has a major impact on cytarabine PK and possibly safety in AML patients even when administered as a liposome.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Current evidence suggests that ferroptosis can obviously affect the function of blood cells. This paper aims to elaborate the role of ferroptosis in blood cells and related diseases. First, abnormal ferroptosis damages the developing red blood cells by breaking systemic iron homeostasis, leading to erythropoiesis suppression and anaemia. Ferroptosis mediates neutrophils recruitment and neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NETosis). In T-cells, ferroptosis induces a novel point of synergy between immunotherapy and radiotherapy. Additionally, ferroptosis may mediate B cells differentiation, antibody responses and lymphoma. Nevertheless, increased ferroptosis can ameliorate acute myeloid leukaemia and T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma by inducing iron-dependent cancer cells death. Besides, ferroptosis activates platelets by increasing P-selectin, thus causing thromboembolism. Ferroptosis mediates virus infection and parasite infection by driving T-cell death and preventing T-cell immunity. Interestingly, ferroptosis is also considered as a critical player in COVID-19 infections, while targetting ferroptosis may also improve thromboembolism and prognosis in patients with COVID-19 infection. Overall, the crucial role of ferroptosis in blood cells will show a new therapeutic potential in blood cell-related diseases.HighlightsFerroptosis shows a new therapeutic potential for blood cell-related diseases.Ferroptosis damages erythropoiesis and thus induces anaemia.Ferroptosis induces platelet activation and leads to thromboembolism.Ferroptosis regulates T-cell and B-cell immunity, which participant in infectious diseases.Inversely, ferroptosis ameliorates acute myeloid leukaemia and T-cell leukaemia.",,"['Chen, Zhe', 'Jiang, Jinyong', 'Fu, Nian', 'Chen, Linxi']","['Chen Z', 'Jiang J', 'Fu N', 'Chen L']",,"['Institute of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, College of Basic Medical Science, Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory of Tumor Microenvironment Responsive Drug Research, Hengyang Medical School, University of South China, Hengyang, China.', 'Institute of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, College of Basic Medical Science, Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory of Tumor Microenvironment Responsive Drug Research, Hengyang Medical School, University of South China, Hengyang, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Affiliated Nanhua Hospital, University of South China, Hengyang, China.', 'Institute of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, College of Basic Medical Science, Hunan Provincial Key Laboratory of Tumor Microenvironment Responsive Drug Research, Hengyang Medical School, University of South China, Hengyang, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,J Drug Target,Journal of drug targeting,9312476,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Ferroptosis', 'anaemia', 'infectious diseases', 'leukaemia', 'thromboembolism']",2021/08/21 06:00,2021/08/21 06:00,['2021/08/20 17:13'],"['2021/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/21 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/20 17:13 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1061186X.2021.1971237 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Drug Target. 2021 Aug 31:1-15. doi: 10.1080/1061186X.2021.1971237.,20210831,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study compared social relationships (social networks, support, and isolation) between AYA cancer survivors and noncancer controls, and identified social integration mechanisms through which the cancer experience influences patient-reported outcomes (PROs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred two AYA cancer survivors and 102 age, sex, and race-matched noncancer controls from a national Internet panel completed an online survey to identify up to 25 of closest friends and relatives whom they have contacted within the past 2 years. Participants' interpersonal connections were used to create a social network index. The Duke-UNC Functional Social Support Questionnaire, UCLA Loneliness Scale, and PROMIS-29 Profile were used to measure social support, perceived isolation or loneliness, and PROs (physical functioning, pain interference, fatigue, anxiety, and depression domains), respectively. Path analysis tested effects of cancer experience on PROs using serial social relationship variables as mediators. RESULTS: Compared with controls, survivors of lymphoma, leukemia, and solid tumor had better social networks; however, survivors of solid tumor and central nervous system malignancies had higher perceived loneliness (all P values < .05). Cancer experience was directly associated with poor PROs (P values < .05 for all domains except fatigue) and indirectly associated through the social network-support-loneliness pathway (all P values < .05).

Leukostasis is characterized by highly elevated leukemic cell count and decreased tissue perfusion symptoms, leading to severe complications and even death. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a chronic lymphoproliferative disorder that shows a highly heterogeneous clinical course, ranging from indolent form to very aggressive disease. Due to its low metabolic and mitotic rate, there is a lower incidence of clinically significant leukostasis in patients with CLL. Two main theories have been proposed in the development of leukostasis: (1) increased blood viscosity due to large leukemic cell populations; (2) high metabolic activity and cytokine production by leukemic cells. Both mechanisms lead to local hypoxic damage.We present a case of a 70-year-old man who died suddenly in the absence of symptoms. Autopsy and histology examinations revealed findings consistent with CLL and diffuse leukostasis involving the major organs' vessels.In the presence of gross and/or microscopic findings suggesting a potential hematologic malignancy, undiagnosed or relapsing hematologic malignancies should be considered in the differential diagnosis of sudden deaths.","['(c) 2021.

Traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) with reported anti-allergy effects may be important sources for the development of new anti-allergy drugs. Thus, establishing an analytical method that can simultaneously identify and screen anti-allergic compounds in TCMs is important. The increased concentrations of intracellular calcium ions resulting in mast cell degranulation releasing active mediators play a key role in allergic diseases, which can be used as a potential index to identify anti-allergic herbs and compounds. In this study, we provide a new strategy that was applied to screening natural anti-allergic compounds based on fluorescence calcium ion (Ca(2+)) fluctuation integrated with cell extract and high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). A low-cost, convenient fluorescence detection Ca(2+) signaling method was established and successfully applied to identify three herbs. Then, the method was integrated with biospecific cell fishing and HPLC-MS to screen potential active components that have the effect of stabilizing the cell membrane of rat basophilic leukemia granulocytes (RBL-2H3). Seven components, namely, albiflorin and paeoniflorin from Radix Paeoniae Alba, ononin and formononetin from Radix Astragali, cimifugin, 4'-O-beta-D-glucosyl-5-O-methylvisamminol, and prim-O-glucosylcimifugin from Radix Saposhnikoviae were fished. These seven compounds have the effect of inhibiting cell Ca(2+) influx. 4'-O-beta-D-Glucosyl-5-O-methylvisamminol, prim-O-glucosylcimifugin, paeoniflorin, ononin, and formononetin significantly inhibit the release of beta-hexosaminidase, which is equivalent to the positive drug. In conclusion, the integrated strategy of fluorescence detection calcium ion kinetic method binding with biospecific cell fishing was an effective mode to identify and screen natural anti-allergic compounds.","['(c) 2021.

Currently, negative HIF-2alpha ccRCC lacks truly effective therapeutic agents to improve the outcomes. Bromodomain-containing protein 9 (BRD9) plays a critical role in human hepatocellular carcinoma, squamous cell lung cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and so on. However, expression and biological role of BRD9 in negative HIF-2alpha ccRCC is poorly understood. Clinically, we demonstrated that expression of BRD9 in negative HIF-2alpha ccRCC tissues was higher than that in positive HIF-2alpha ccRCC. Moreover, high BRD9 expression was correlated with unfavorable clinicopathological features and predicted the poor overall survival of negative HIF-2alpha ccRCC patients. Functionally, BRD9 knockout resulted in reduced proliferation, migration and invasion of negative HIF-2alpha ccRCC cells (Caki-2). In addition, BRD9 was related to the TIIC infiltration level in negative HIF-2alpha ccRCC tissues. Mechanistically, Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that BRD9 was closely related to Notch signaling pathway. BRD9 knockout resulted in reduced mRNA level of Hes1 and Notch1 in negative HIF-2alpha ccRCC in vitro. The overexpression of NICD (Notch intracellular domain) enhanced malignant behaviors of Caki-2 cells with BRD9 knockout. And Notch inhibition led to attenuation of cell growth and reduced migration and invasion in Caki-2 cells. Overall, our results identified that BRD9 promotes the proliferation, migration and invasion of negative HIF-2alpha ccRCC cells by targeting Notch signaling pathway and serve as a promising biomarker for negative HIF-2alpha ccRCC.",['(c) 2021 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.'],"['Lou, Weijuan', 'Gao, Ke', 'Xu, Chenyue', 'Li, Qingquan']","['Lou W', 'Gao K', 'Xu C', 'Li Q']",,"['Department of Pathology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,IUBMB Life,IUBMB life,100888706,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*BRD9', '*HIF-2alpha', '*immune infiltration', '*negative HIF-2alpha ccRCC', '*notch signaling pathway']",2021/08/21 06:00,2021/08/21 06:00,['2021/08/20 09:12'],"['2021/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/21 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/20 09:12 [entrez]']",['10.1002/iub.2547 [doi]'],ppublish,IUBMB Life. 2021 Nov;73(11):1334-1347. doi: 10.1002/iub.2547.

Such biomarker-driven designs, particularly ""adaptive enrichment"" designs that initially enroll an unselected population and then allow for later restriction of accrual to ""marker-positive"" patients based on interim results, are increasingly popular. Many biomarkers of interest are naturally continuous, however, and most existing design approaches either require upfront dichotomization or force monotonicity through algorithmic searches for a single marker threshold, thereby excluding the possibility that the continuous biomarker has a nondisjoint and truly nonlinear or nonmonotone prognostic relationship with outcome or predictive relationship with treatment effect. To address this, we propose a novel trial design that leverages both the actual shapes of any continuous marker effects (both prognostic and predictive) and their corresponding posterior uncertainty in an adaptive decision-making framework. At interim analyses, this marker knowledge is updated and overall or marker-driven decisions are reached such as continuing enrollment to the next interim analysis or terminating early for efficacy or futility. Using simulations and patient-level data from a multi-center Children's Oncology Group trial in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, we derive the operating characteristics of our design and compare its performance to a traditional approach that identifies and applies a dichotomizing marker threshold.",['(c) 2021 The International Biometric Society.'],"['Liu, Yusha', 'Kairalla, John A', 'Renfro, Lindsay A']","['Liu Y', 'Kairalla JA', 'Renfro LA']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4306-1896'],"['Department of Human Genetics, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.', ""Division of Biostatistics, University of Southern California and Children's Oncology Group, Los Angeles, California, USA.""]",['eng'],"['U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NIH KL2 TR002379/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'NIH/NCI 2U10CA180899-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],United States,Biometrics,Biometrics,0370625,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Bayesian adaptive design', 'adaptive enrichment', 'biomarker-driven design', 'continuous biomarkers', 'precision medicine']",2021/08/21 06:00,2021/08/21 06:00,['2021/08/20 09:08'],"['2020/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/21 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/20 09:08 [entrez]']",['10.1111/biom.13550 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Biometrics. 2021 Aug 20. doi: 10.1111/biom.13550.,20210820,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, information on other TKIs is limited.We retrospectively analyzed PH prevalence by reviewing transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) findings in a population of Korean CML patients treated with TKI at a single hospital between 2003 and 2020. PH was defined as a high PH probability according to the European Society of Cardiology/European Respiratory Society (ESC/ERS) guidelines.Of the 189 patients treated with TKI(s) during the study period, 112 (59.3%) underwent TTE. Among the 112 patients treated with a TKI for a median of 40.4 months (range: 1.1-167.2 months), PH was found in 12 (10.7%), most frequently in those treated with dasatinib (ie, in 3 [7.5%] of 40 of those treated with imatinib, 1 [3.1%] of 32 of those treated with nilotinib, and 8 [21.6%] of 37 of those treated with dasatinib). PH resolved in 4 (50.0%) of the 8 dasatinib-treated patients after discontinuation of the agent. One nilotinib-treated and all three imatinib-treated patients recovered from PH. In multivariate analyses, age >60 years, dasatinib treatment, and positive cardiopulmonary symptoms/signs at the time of transthoracic echocardiography were statistically significant risk factors for developing PH.These results show that PH is induced not only by dasatinib, but also by imatinib and nilotinib.

The aims of the present study were to identify new translocations and their clinical impact and to establish their frequency in a large cohort of 2843 CLL patients. By conventional cytogenetics 250 translocations were identified in 215 (7.5%) patients, 186 (74%) were apparently balanced and 64 (26%) were unbalanced. All chromosomes were involved in translocations, except Y chromosome. The chromosomes more frequently translocated were in decreasing frequency chromosomes 14, 18, 13, 17, 1, 6, 2, 3, 8, and 11. Translocations were found in the karyotypes either as the unique chromosomal abnormality (27%), associated with another alteration (24%), or as a part of a complex karyotype (CK, 48%). A large proportion of rearranged breakpoints involved genes related to CLL such as IGH (14q32), RB1, MIR15A, MIR16-1 (13q14), BCL2 (18q21), IGL (22q11.2), TP53 (17p13), IRF4 (6p25-p23), ATM (11q22), and CDK6 (7q21). Overall, 76 novel CLL translocations were identified, including a recurrent t(8;11)(p21;q21-23). Whole-genome sequencing and/or copy-number microarray data of 24 cases with translocations confirmed all rearrangements, enabled refinement of 3 karyotypes and all breakpoints at gene level. The projected survival and time to first treatment significantly decreased linearly with the number of translocations. In summary, this study allowed to establish the frequency of translocations (7.5%) and to identify new translocations in a cohort of 2843 CLL patients.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Costa, Dolors', 'Granada, Isabel', 'Espinet, Blanca', 'Collado, Rosa', 'Ruiz-Xiville, Neus', 'Puiggros, Anna', 'Uribe, Marisol', 'Arias, Amparo', 'Gomez, Candida', 'Delgado, Julio', 'Pereira, Arturo', 'Magnano, Laura', 'Colomer, Dolors', 'Lopez, Cristina', 'Bea, Silvia']","['Costa D', 'Granada I', 'Espinet B', 'Collado R', 'Ruiz-Xiville N', 'Puiggros A', 'Uribe M', 'Arias A', 'Gomez C', 'Delgado J', 'Pereira A', 'Magnano L', 'Colomer D', 'Lopez C', 'Bea S']",,"['Hematopathology Section, Department of Pathology, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematological Laboratory Service, Germans Trias i Pujol University Hospital, Catalan Institute of Oncology, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Laboratori de Citogenetica Molecular, Servei de Patologia, Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Laboratorio de Citogenetica y Biologia Molecular, Servicio de Hematologia, Consorcio Hospital General Universitario, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hematological Laboratory Service, Germans Trias i Pujol University Hospital, Catalan Institute of Oncology, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Laboratori de Citogenetica Molecular, Servei de Patologia, Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Laboratorio de Citogenetica y Biologia Molecular, Servicio de Hematologia, Consorcio Hospital General Universitario, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hematopathology Section, Department of Pathology, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematopathology Section, Department of Pathology, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", 'Hematology Department, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematopathology Section, Department of Pathology, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), Barcelona, Spain.', 'University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematopathology Section, Department of Pathology, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), Barcelona, Spain.', 'University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['306/18/FIHGUV', 'Marie Sklodowska-Curie COFUND Program', ""Secretaria d'Universitats i Recerca del Departament d'Empresa i Coneixement de la"", 'Generalitat de Catalunya', '2017-SGR-709/Generalitat de Catalunya', 'PI17/01061/Fondo de Investigaciones Sanitarias, Instituto de Salud Carlos III']",['Journal Article'],United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['breakpoints', 'chromosomal translocations', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'clinical impact', 'copy number microarray', 'karyotype', 'whole-genome sequencing']",2021/08/21 06:00,2021/08/21 06:00,['2021/08/20 07:25'],"['2021/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/21 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/20 07:25 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.22994 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2022 Jan;61(1):37-43. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22994.

However, the functional characteristics of these non-coding elements in the genome are poorly understood at present. In this study, we have explored several mechanisms that involve the novel lncRNA and microRNA (miRNA) axis participating in modulation of drug response and the tumor microenvironment of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). We identified novel lncRNAs via mRNA sequencing that was applied to leukemic cell lines derived from BCR-ABL1-positive and JAK2-mutant MPNs under treatment with therapeutic tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). The expression and sequence of novel LNC000093 were further validated in both leukemic cells and normal primary and pluripotent cells isolated from human blood, including samples from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Downregulation of LNC000093 was validated in TKI-resistant CML while a converse expression pattern was observed in blood cells isolated from TKI-sensitive CML cases. In addition to BCR-ABL1-positive CML cells, the driver mutation JAK2-V617F-regulated lncRNA BANCR axis was further identified in BCR-ABL1-negative MPNs. Further genome-wide validation using MPN patient specimens identified 23 unique copy number variants including the 7 differentially expressed lncRNAs from our database. The newly identified LNC000093 served as a competitive endogenous RNA for miR-675-5p and reversed the imatinib resistance in CML cells through regulating RUNX1 expression. The extrinsic function of LNC000093 in exosomal H19/miR-675-induced modulation for the microenvironment was also determined with significant effect on VEGF expression.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wong, Luo, Chow, Meng, Adesanya, Sun, Ma, Jin, Li, Yip and', 'Huang.']","['Wong, Nonthaphat Kent', 'Luo, Shumeng', 'Chow, Eudora Y D', 'Meng, Fei', 'Adesanya, Adenike', 'Sun, Jiahong', 'Ma, Herman M H', 'Jin, Wenfei', 'Li, Wan-Chun', 'Yip, Shea Ping', 'Huang, Chien-Ling']","['Wong NK', 'Luo S', 'Chow EYD', 'Meng F', 'Adesanya A', 'Sun J', 'Ma HMH', 'Jin W', 'Li WC', 'Yip SP', 'Huang CL']",,"['Department of Health Technology and Informatics, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Health Technology and Informatics, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Pathology, United Christian Hospital, Kwun Tong, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Health Technology and Informatics, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Health Technology and Informatics, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Health Technology and Informatics, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Biology, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China.', 'Department of Health Technology and Informatics, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Pathology, United Christian Hospital, Kwun Tong, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Biology, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, China.', 'Institute of Oral Biology, College of Dentistry, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Health Technology and Informatics, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Health Technology and Informatics, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'long non-coding RNAs', 'molecular targets', 'myeloproliferative neoplasms', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2021/08/21 06:00,2021/08/21 06:01,['2021/08/20 07:07'],"['2020/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/20 07:07 [entrez]', '2021/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/21 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2021.643043 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Aug 3;9:643043. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.643043. eCollection 2021.,20210803,,,,PMC8369571,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

KG-1a cell is considered a leukemia stem cell-enriched cell line, which is resistant to chemotherapy. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is effective against acute promyelocytic leukemia as a first-line treatment agent, even as remission induction of relapsed cases. ATO has a cytotoxic effect on KG-1a cells, but the mechanism remains unclear. Our results demonstrated that ATO can inhibit cell proliferation, induce apoptosis, and arrest KG-1a cells in the G2/M phase. Using transcriptome analysis, we investigated the candidate target genes regulated by ATO in KG-1a cells. The expression profile analysis showed that the ATO had significantly changed gene expression related to proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle. Moreover, MYC, PCNA, and MCM7 were identified as crucial hub genes through protein-protein interaction network analysis; meanwhile, the expressions of them in both RNA and protein levels are down-regulated as confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. Thus, our study suggests that ATO not only inhibits the expression of MYC, PCNA, and MCM7 but also leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in KG-1a cells. Overall, this study provided reliable clues for improving the ATO efficacy in AML.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Li, Feng, Si, Zhao, Wang and Niu.']","['Li, Yahui', 'Feng, Yingjie', 'Si, Xiaohui', 'Zhao, Chenjin', 'Wang, Fanping', 'Niu, Xinqing']","['Li Y', 'Feng Y', 'Si X', 'Zhao C', 'Wang F', 'Niu X']",,"['School of Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, China.', 'The Third Affiliated Hospital of Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, China.', 'School of Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, China.', 'School of Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, China.', 'School of Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, China.', 'School of Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'arsenic trioxide', 'cell cycle', 'proliferation', 'transcriptome']",2021/08/21 06:00,2021/08/21 06:01,['2021/08/20 07:02'],"['2021/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/20 07:02 [entrez]', '2021/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/21 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fgene.2021.654826 [doi]'],epublish,Front Genet. 2021 Aug 3;12:654826. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2021.654826. eCollection 2021.,20210803,,,,PMC8369888,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Promising results achieved by engineered chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in other blood neoplasms have paved the way for the development of immune cell-based therapies for adverse genetic risk AML. Among these, adoptive cell immunotherapies with single/multiple CAR-T cells, CAR-natural killer (NK) cells, cytokine-induced killer cells (CIK), and NK cells are subjects of ongoing clinical trials. On the other hand, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) still represents the only curative option for adverse genetic risk AML patients. Unfortunately, high relapse rates (above 50%) and associated dismal outcomes (reported survival ~10-20%) even question the role of current allo-HSCT protocols and emphasize the urgency of adopting novel effective transplant strategies. We have recently demonstrated that haploidentical allo-HSCT combined with regulatory and conventional T cells adoptive immunotherapy (Treg-Tcon haplo-HSCT) is able to overcome disease-intrinsic chemoresistance, prevent leukemia-relapse, and improve survival of adverse genetic risk AML patients. In this Perspective, we briefly review the recent advancements with immune cell-based strategies against adverse genetic risk AML and discuss how such approaches could favorably impact on patients' outcomes.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Limongello, Marra, Mancusi, Bonato, Hoxha, Ruggeri, Hui,', 'Velardi and Pierini.']","['Limongello, Roberto', 'Marra, Andrea', 'Mancusi, Antonella', 'Bonato, Samanta', 'Hoxha, Eni', 'Ruggeri, Loredana', 'Hui, Susanta', 'Velardi, Andrea', 'Pierini, Antonio']","['Limongello R', 'Marra A', 'Mancusi A', 'Bonato S', 'Hoxha E', 'Ruggeri L', 'Hui S', 'Velardi A', 'Pierini A']",,"['Institute of Hematology and Centre of Haemato-Oncology Research (CREO), University and Hospital of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology and Centre of Haemato-Oncology Research (CREO), University and Hospital of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology and Centre of Haemato-Oncology Research (CREO), University and Hospital of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology and Centre of Haemato-Oncology Research (CREO), University and Hospital of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology and Centre of Haemato-Oncology Research (CREO), University and Hospital of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology and Centre of Haemato-Oncology Research (CREO), University and Hospital of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA, United States.', 'Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Duarte, CA, United States.', 'Institute of Hematology and Centre of Haemato-Oncology Research (CREO), University and Hospital of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology and Centre of Haemato-Oncology Research (CREO), University and Hospital of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*CAR-T', '*HR-AML', '*HSCT', '*Treg-Tcon', '*adoptive immune therapies', '*poor outcome']",2021/08/21 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/08/20 07:02'],"['2021/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/20 07:02 [entrez]', '2021/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2021.695051 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2021 Aug 3;12:695051. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.695051. eCollection 2021.,20210803,20211213,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']","['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Cytokine-Induced Killer Cells/immunology/*transplantation', 'Diffusion of Innovation', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive/adverse effects/mortality', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/*transplantation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/genetics', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*transplantation', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC8368440,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 58-year-old man presented with leukocytosis and was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia. He was initially treated with imatinib for 6 years and abruptly discontinued treatment by himself. He was administered dasatinib 5 years after treatment interruption, and presented with pancytopenia 6 months after dasatinib initiation. Bone marrow biopsy revealed severe hypocellularity without blasts. Dasatinib was discontinued, and he recovered from pancytopenia 3 months later; however, BCR-ABL1 was positive for almost all white blood cells in the peripheral blood. We retreated with ponatinib, but pancytopenia developed again. The clinical course indicated TKI-induced bone marrow aplasia. Therefore, ponatinib was discontinued and the patient received an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a haploidentical daughter using post-transplant cyclophosphamide. He had a major molecular response and had normal complete blood counts and bone marrow 1 year after transplantation.","['Copyright (c) 2021 by S.

CH, defined as mosaic chromosome abnormalities (mCA) and/or driver mutations was identified in 5449 (2.9%) eligible UK Biobank participants (n = 190,487 median age = 58 years). CH was negatively associated with glomerular filtration rate estimated from cystatin-C (eGFR.cys; beta = -0.75, P = 2.37 x 10(-4)), but not with eGFR estimated from creatinine, and was specifically associated with CKD defined by eGFR.cys < 60 (OR = 1.02, P = 8.44 x 10(-8)). In participants without prevalent myeloid neoplasms, eGFR.cys was associated with myeloid mCA (n = 148, beta = -3.36, P = 0.01) and somatic driver mutations (n = 3241, beta = -1.08, P = 6.25 x 10(-5)) associated with myeloid neoplasia (myeloid CH), specifically mutations in CBL, TET2, JAK2, PPM1D and GNB1 but not DNMT3A or ASXL1. In participants with no history of cardiovascular disease or myeloid neoplasms, myeloid CH increased the risk of adverse outcomes in CKD (HR = 1.6, P = 0.002) compared to those without myeloid CH. Mendelian randomisation analysis provided suggestive evidence for a causal relationship between CH and CKD (P = 0.03). We conclude that CH, and specifically myeloid CH, is associated with CKD defined by eGFR.cys. Myeloid CH promotes adverse outcomes in CKD, highlighting the importance of the interaction between intrinsic and extrinsic factors to define the health risk associated with CH.",['(c) 2021.

Both scores predicted probabilities of achieving complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), major molecular response (MMR), failure- and progression-free survivals (FFS, PFS), and survival in all subjects and those receiving imatinib therapy. However, the ELTS score was a better predictor of MR(4), MR(4.5), and CML-related survival than the Sokal score. In subjects receiving 2G-TKI therapy, only the ELTS score accurately predicted probabilities of CCyR, MMR, MR(4), FFS, and PFS. In the propensity score matching, subjects classified as intermediate risk by the ELTS score receiving a 2G-TKI had better responses (p < 0.001~0.061), FFS (p = 0.002), and PFS (p = 0.03) but not survival. Our data suggest better overall prediction accuracy for the ELTS score compared with the Sokal score in CML patients, especially those receiving 2G-TKIs. People identified as intermediate risk by the ELTS score may benefit more from initial 2G-TKI therapy in achieving surrogate endpoints but not survival, especially when a briefer interval to stopping TKI therapy is the therapy objective.",['(c) 2021.

Here, we establish that acquired mutations in the EIF6 gene are a frequent mechanism of SGR in Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS), a leukemia predisposition disorder caused by a germline defect in ribosome assembly. Biallelic mutations in the SBDS or EFL1 genes in SDS impair release of the anti-association factor eIF6 from the 60S ribosomal subunit, a key step in the translational activation of ribosomes. Here, we identify diverse mosaic somatic genetic events (point mutations, interstitial deletion, reciprocal chromosomal translocation) in SDS hematopoietic cells that reduce eIF6 expression or disrupt its interaction with the 60S subunit, thereby conferring a selective advantage over non-modified cells. SDS-related somatic EIF6 missense mutations that reduce eIF6 dosage or eIF6 binding to the 60S subunit suppress the defects in ribosome assembly and protein synthesis across multiple SBDS-deficient species including yeast, Dictyostelium and Drosophila. Our data suggest that SGR is a universal phenomenon that may influence the clinical evolution of diverse Mendelian disorders and support eIF6 suppressor mimics as a therapeutic strategy in SDS.",['(c) 2021.

As survival rates for relapsed T-ALL remain dismal (10 to 25%), development of targeted therapies to prevent relapse is key to improving prognosis. Whereas mutations in the DNA demethylating enzyme TET2 are frequent in adult T-cell malignancies, TET2 mutations in T-ALL are rare. Here, we analyzed RNA-sequencing data of 321 primary T-ALLs, 20 T-ALL cell lines, and 25 normal human tissues, revealing that TET2 is transcriptionally repressed or silenced in 71% and 17% of T-ALL, respectively. Furthermore, we show that TET2 silencing is often associated with hypermethylation of the TET2 promoter in primary T-ALL. Importantly, treatment with the DNA demethylating agent, 5-azacytidine (5-aza), was significantly more toxic to TET2-silenced T-ALL cells and resulted in stable re-expression of the TET2 gene. Additionally, 5-aza led to up-regulation of methylated genes and human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), which was further enhanced by the addition of physiological levels of vitamin C, a potent enhancer of TET activity. Together, our results clearly identify 5-aza as a potential targeted therapy for TET2-silenced T-ALL.",['Copyright (c) 2021 the Author(s).

However, malignant cells sometimes escape the immunotherapeutic targeting by CD19 gene mutations, alternative splicing or lineage switch, commonly causing lack of CD19 expression on the surface of neoplastic cells. We assumed that, in addition to the known mechanisms, other means could act on CD19 to drive antigen-negative relapse. METHODS: Herein, we studied the mechanism of antigen loss in an in vivo CD19-negative recurrence model of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) to CART-19, established using NOD-scid IL2Rg(null) mice and HG3 cell line. We validated our findings in vitro in immortalized B-cell lines and primary CLL cells. RESULTS: In our in vivo CLL recurrence model, up to 70% of CART-19-treated mice eventually recurred with CD19-negative disease weeks after initial positive response. We found that the lack of CD19 expression was caused by promoter DNA hypermethylation. Importantly, the expression loss was partially reversible by treatment with a demethylating agent. Moreover, this escape mechanism was common for 3 B-cell immortalized lines as well as primary CLL cells, as assessed by in vitro coculture experiments. CONCLUSIONS: Epigenetically driven antigen escape could represent a novel, yet at least partially reversible, means of CD19 loss to CART-19 in B-cell tumors.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

DESIGN AND SETTING: A Danish population-based matched cohort study linking multiple nationwide registries. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were recruited from a total of 622 childhood ALL 2.5-year event-free survivors diagnosed between 1994 and 2015. Cases were survivors developing a relapse or an SMN and references were survivors still in first remission. Each case was matched with five references on age, sex, treatment protocol and risk group. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Consultations in general practice and hospital the last 6 months before relapse or SMN. Cases and references were compared with monthly incidence rate ratios (IRRs) from negative binomial regression models. RESULTS: Of the 622 childhood ALL survivors, 60 (9.6%) developed a relapse (49) or an SMN (11) and 295 matched references were identified. Health care utilisation in general practice increased among cases the last month before the event compared with references with an IRR of 2.71 (95% CI 1.71 to 4.28). Data showed a bimodal structure with a significantly increased number of visits 4, 5 and 6 months before the event. Hospital health care utilisation increased 2 months before the event in cases with an IRR of 5.01 (3.78 to 6.63) the last month before the event and an IRR of 1.94 (1.32 to 2.85) the second-last month comparing cases and references. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of childhood ALL developing a relapse or an SMN have a short period of increased health care utilisation before diagnosis. At hospital, this might be explained by pre-diagnostic examinations. In general practice, data suggest a bimodal structure with children later developing a relapse having more contacts also half a year before the relapse, suggesting that there could be early warnings.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

DESIGN: An incidence study. SETTING: The population-based Punjab Cancer Registry was established in 2005 in Lahore, which is the provincial metropolis of the province of Punjab (five rivers), and is located in the northeast region of Pakistan. The coordinating office of the Registry is located within Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Center. Both the active and passive forms of data collection are used. PARTICIPANTS: Residents of the district of Lahore diagnosed with cancer. The average annual population of Lahore was estimated at 11.1 million. OUTCOME MEASURES: Cancer counts and incidence rates per 100 000 population, by age-group, sex and cancer site/type, over 10 years. RESULTS: In Lahore, from 2010 to 2019, 58 394 incident cases were reported, with the majority seen in females (57.1%). Adults accounted for 92.2%, adolescents 2.2% and children 5.6% of the total cases. Per 100 000 population, the age-standardised incidence rate was 103.4 for females and 65.6 for males. Among females, the highest incidence rates were recorded for breast cancer (76.7) in adults, bone tumour (1.2) in adolescents and lymphoid leukaemia (1.6) in children, and among males, prostate cancer (10.7) in adults, bone tumour (2.2) in young adults and lymphoid leukaemia (2.4) in children. The age-specific incidence rates peaked in the 60-70 year group, reaching a high of 420 per 100 000 in women and 330 per 1 00 000 men. CONCLUSIONS: In Lahore, the incidence rates for cancers of the breast, prostate, lymphoid leukaemia and bone were among the highest documented. More cases were recorded in females than in males. The results reported could be used as a reference point for assessing the effectiveness of future interventions.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

METHODS: Patients with sepsis admitted to Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital from June 2020 to March 2021 were enrolled, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were extracted. Single-cell sequencing technology and pseudo-time analysis were used to verify the differential subsets of monocytes. Bioinformatics methods were used to analyze the expression of genes in differential subsets of monocytes and screen out differential genes for the preliminary construction of a candidate differential gene set. The digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology was used to verify the candidate differential genes in PBMC of sepsis patients and sepsis human myeloid leukemia mononuclear cells (THP-1) models, and the Venn diagram was used to construct the final differential gene set of monocytes. Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was used to validate the differential gene set of monocytes. RESULTS: (1) The results of cell annotation and pseudo-time analysis showed that the differentiation of NEAT1(+)CD163(+) monocyte occurred in the early stage of sepsis was significantly different from other subsets, which validated that NEAT1(+)CD163(+) monocyte was the characteristic subset in the pathological process of sepsis. (2) Twenty-two differential genes related to sepsis were screened out from the gene expression of NEAT1(+)CD163(+) monocyte. After further verification by digital PCR, basic leucine zipper ATF-like transcription factor (BATF), JUNB proto-oncogene, carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 4 (CEACAM4), chromosome 9 open reading frame 95 (C9orf95), G protein subunit alpha 15 (GNA15), complement C3a receptor 1 (C3AR1), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) and mitochondrial carrier homolog 1 (MTCH1) were screened out to construct the final differential gene set of monocytes. (3) The external validation results showed that C9orf95 gene had no data in GSE154918 and GSE133822 from GEO, it was excluded during validation. In GSE154918, the expressions of BATF, JUNB, CEACAM4, GNA15, C3AR1, TGFB1, and MTCH1 in the sepsis group were significantly higher than those in the healthy control group (log2expression level: BATF was 12.78+/-0.08 vs. 11.39+/-0.35, JUNB was 16.88+/-0.07 vs. 16.04+/-0.03, CEACAM4 was 14.73+/-0.08 vs. 13.77+/-0.05, GNA15 was 13.16+/-0.06 vs. 12.30+/-0.04, C3AR1 was 14.62+/-0.13 vs. 12.87+/-0.05, TGFB1 was 16.95+/-0.05 vs. 16.57+/-0.36, MTCH1 was 14.80+/-0.02 vs. 14.61+/-0.15, all P < 0.05). In GSE133822, the expressions of BATF, CEACAM4, GNA15, and C3AR1 in the sepsis group were significantly higher than those in the health control group (log2expression level: BATF was 8.66+/-0.16 vs. 7.92+/-0.14, CEACAM4 was 9.20+/-0.16 vs. 8.36+/-0.20, GNA15 was 10.66+/-0.18 vs. 10.13+/-0.16, C3AR1 was 11.49+/-0.27 vs. 10.48+/-0.16, all P < 0.05), while the expressions of JUNB, TGFB1, and MTCH1 were not statistically different between two groups. The results of gene set variation analysis (GSVA) showed that the enrichment scores of monocytes differential gene set of sepsis group were significantly higher than those of the healthy control group in both GSE154918 (0.38+/-0.04 vs. -0.44+/-0.02) and GSE133822 (0.56+/-0.02 vs. 0.20+/-0.05, both P < 0.01). Receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve) analysis showed that the differential gene set of monocytes had a reliable diagnostic value for early sepsis with the area under ROC curve (AUC) of 0.993 [95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.980-1.000] in GSE154918 and 0.944 (95%CI was 0.873-1.000) in GSE133822. CONCLUSIONS: A differential gene set of monocytes (BATF, JUNB, CEACAM4, GNA15, C3AR1, TGFB1, and MTCH1) screened out by single-cell sequencing and digital PCR technology has a reliable diagnostic value for the early sepsis, and may provide a new idea for the early diagnosis of sepsis.",,"['Cai, Gengxin', 'Zhou, Yuan', 'Wen, Miaoyun']","['Cai G', 'Zhou Y', 'Wen M']",,"['School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, China.', 'Second Clinical Medical College of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong, China.', ""Department of Critical Care Medicine, Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou 510080, Guangdong, China.

Morphology and size of A549 and H1299 cell-derived exosomes were assessed using transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis. BEAS-2B cell proliferation, apoptosis and SIRT7 protein expression were determined using CCK8, flow cytometry and Western blot. Transcriptome sequencing, GO analysis, and KEGG pathway analysis were performed. A549 and H1299 cell-derived exosomes demonstrated a microvesicle structure of bilayer membrane with a diameter of about 80 nm. Compared with control, these had no effect on BEAS-2B cell proliferation, but significantly promoted cell apoptosis, and decreased SIRT7 protein expression. Compared with control, A549 cell-derived exosomes have 20 differently expressed genes (10 upregulated, 10 downregulated); 1073 GO terms were enriched, while H1299 cell-derived exosomes have 112 differently expressed genes (80 upregulated, 32 downregulated); 3340 GO terms were enriched. For A549 cell-derived exosomes vs. control, the enriched pathways mainly included dorso-ventral axis formation, endocytosis, endometrial cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and pathogenic Escherichia coli infection. For H1299 cell-derived exosomes vs. control, the enriched pathways mainly included influenza A, herpes simplex infection, measles, TNF signaling pathway, salmonella infection, and Hepatitis C. A total of 608,315 mutation sites were identified, including 553,800 single nucleotide polymorphism sites (SNP) and 54,515 Indel polymorphism sites. The SNP mutation sites were mainly concentrated in A->G, C->T, G->A and T->C.

First, LMH cells stably overexpressing the chTERT gene (LMH-chTERT cells) and corresponding control cells (LMH-NC cells) were successfully constructed with a lentiviral vector expression system. The results showed that chTERT upregulated the expression of beta-catenin, Cyclin D1, TCF4 and c-Myc. chTERT expression level and telomerase activity were increased when cells were treated with LiCl. When the cells were treated with ICG001 or IWP-2, the activity of the Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathway was significantly inhibited, and chTERT expression and telomerase activity were also inhibited. However, when the beta-catenin gene was knocked down by small interfering RNA (siRNA), the changes in chTERT expression and telomerase activity were consistent with those in cells treated with ICG001 or IWP-2. These results indicated that chTERT and the Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathway can be mutually regulated. Subsequently, we found that chTERT not only shortened the cell cycle to promote proliferation but also inhibited apoptosis by downregulating the expression of Caspase 3, Caspase 9 and BAX; upregulating BCL-2 and BCL-X expression; and promoting autophagy. Moreover, chTERT significantly enhanced the migration ability of LMH cells, upregulated the protein and mRNA expression of ALV-J and increased the virus titre. ALV-J replication promoted chTERT expression and telomerase activity.",['(c) 2021.

Although several therapies are available including chemotherapy, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT), and receptor-antagonist drugs, the 5-year survival of patients is quietly disappointing, less than 30%. alloHSCT is the major curative approach for AML with promising results but the treatment has severe adverse effects such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Therefore, as an alternative, more efficient and less harmful immunotherapy-based approaches such as the adoptive transferring T cell therapy are in development for the treatment of AML. As such, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are engineered T cells which have been developed in recent years as a breakthrough in cancer therapy. Interestingly, CAR T cells are effective against both solid tumors and hematological cancers such as AML. Gradually, CAR T cell therapy found its way into cancer therapy and was widely used for the treatment of hematologic malignancies with successful results particularly with somewhat better results in hematological cancer in comparison to solid tumors. The AML is generally fatal, therapy-resistant, and sometimes refractory disease with a disappointing low survival rate and weak prognosis. The 5-year survival rate for AML is only about 30%. However, the survival rate seems to be age-dependent. Novel CAR T cell therapy is a light at the end of the tunnel. The CD19 is an important target antigen in AML and lymphoma and the CAR T cells are engineered to target the CD19. In addition, a lot of research goes on the discovery of novel target antigens with therapeutic efficacy and utilizable for generating CAR T cells against various types of cancers. In recent years, many pieces of research on screening and identification of novel AML antigen targets with the goal of generation of effective anti-cancer CAR T cells have led to new therapies with strong cytotoxicity against cancerous cells and impressive clinical outcomes. Also, more recently, an improved version of CAR T cells which were called modified or smartly reprogrammed CAR T cells has been designed with less unwelcome effects, less toxicity against normal cells, more safety, more specificity, longer persistence, and proliferation capability. The purpose of this review is to discuss and explain the most recent advances in CAR T cell-based therapies targeting AML antigens and review the results of preclinical and clinical trials. Moreover, we will criticize the clinical challenges, side effects, and the different strategies for CAR T cell therapy.",['(c) 2021.

Germline variants in drug-metabolizing enzyme genes TPMT and NUDT15 have been linked to the risk of thiopurine toxicity. However, the full spectrum of genetic polymorphism in these genes and their impact on the pharmacological effects of thiopurines remain unclear. Herein, we comprehensively sequenced the TPMT and NUDT15 genes in 685 children with ALL from the Children's Oncology Group AALL03N1 trial and evaluated their association with 6MP dose intensity. We identified 6 and 5 coding variants in TPMT and NUDT15 respectively, confirming the association at known pharmacogenetic variants. Importantly, we discovered a novel gain-of-function noncoding variants in TPMT associated with increased 6MP tolerance (rs12199316), with independent validation in 380 patients from the St. Jude Total Therapy XV protocol. Located adjacent to a regulatory DNA element, this intergenic variant was strongly associated TPMT transcription, with the variant allele linked to higher expression (P = 2.6 x 10-9). For NUDT15, one noncoding common variant, rs73189762, was identified as potentially related to 6MP intolerance.

As the most extensive tumor suppressor gene in cancer research, p53 can control multiple functions such as that of DNA repair, induction of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and so on. In view of the diversity associated with varied function of p53, this study analyzed the possible effect of gene on ALV-J replication and its regulatory mechanism. We successfully constructed a p53 knockout DF-1 cell line (p53-KO-DF-1 cells) by using CRISPR-Cas9 system. When ALV-J was co-infected with DF-1 and p53-KO-DF-1 cells, it was found that compared with wild-type DF-1 cells, the viral copy number of p53-KO-DF-1 cells infected with ALV-J increased significantly 48 h after infection, whereas the expression of innate immune factors such as Il-2,TNF- alpha, IFN- gamma and MX1 decreased significantly. Detection of p53-related tumor genes indicated that after p53 deletion, the expression of c-myc, bcl-2, and bak increased significantly, while the expression of p21 and p27 was noted to be decreased. The cell cycle distribution and apoptosis of the 2 cell lines was detected by flow cytometry analysis. The results showed that p53 knockout prevented G0/G1 and G2 M phase arrest induced by ALV-J, and substantially decreased the rate of apoptosis.

Standard anti-AML treatment remains almost unchanged for decades. Tingenone (TG) and 22-hydroxytingenone (22-HTG) are quinonemethide triterpenes found in the Amazonian plant Salacia impressifolia (Celastraceae), with cytotoxic properties in different histological types of cancer cells. In the present work, we investigated the anti-AML action mechanism of TG and 22-HTG in the AML HL-60 cell line. Both compounds exhibited potent cytotoxicity in a panel of cancer cell lines. Mechanistic studies found that TG and 22-HTG reduced cell growth and caused the externalization of phosphatidylserine, the fragmentation of internucleosomal DNA and the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential in HL-60 cells. In addition, pre-incubation with Z-VAD(OMe)-FMK, a pan-caspase inhibitor, prevented TG- and 22-HTG-induced apoptosis, indicating cell death by apoptosis via a caspase-dependent pathway. The analysis of the RNA transcripts of several genes indicated the interruption of the cellular antioxidant system, including the downregulation of thioredoxin, as a target for TG and 22-HTG. The application of N-acetyl-cysteine, an antioxidant, completely prevented apoptosis induced by TG and 22-HTG, indicating activation of the apoptosis pathway mediated by oxidative stress. Moreover, TG and 22-HTG induced DNA double-strand break and phosphorylation of JNK2 (T183/Y185) and p38alpha (T180/Y182), and co-incubation with SP 600125 (JNK/SAPK inhibitor) and PD 169316 (p38 MAPK inhibitor) partially prevented apoptosis induced by TG and 22-HTG. Together, these data indicate that TG and 22-HTG are new candidate for anti-AML therapy targeting thioredoxin.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the process of palliative care in patients with hematologic malignancies. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, we included patients with hematologic malignancies who received palliative care over a 12 month period from June 1, 2019, to May 31, 2020 at the day care hospital of the hematology department in University Hospital of Sfax, Tunisia. Blood transfusion was used to relieve symptoms of anemia and bleeding. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients were included. The median age was 68 years. Forty-three percent of patients were diagnosed with acute leukemia and 41.8% with myelodysplastic syndrome. Red cell and platelet transfusions were indicated in 94.5% and 36.3% of cases respectively. Patients reported improvement after blood transfusion in 50% of cases. Twenty-five transfusion reactions (45%) were noted. Fever was noted in 33 patients (60%), with documented sites of infection in 84.8% of them. Pulmonary infection was frequently noted (50%). Antimicrobial treatment was prescribed in all febrile cases. Pain was reported in 22 patients and in 77.5% of these cases, it was nociceptive. Patients who received analgesics showed clinical improvement in pain in 81% of cases. Anorexia with malnutrition was reported in 23% of cases which was treated with enteral nutrition in 75% of cases. Sleep disturbance (20 patients), anxiety (7 patients), and depression (4 patients) were mentioned respectively. CONCLUSION: Palliative care in hematology should be a multidisciplinary care approach with a global management of the various physical, psychological and sociological complications.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Societe francaise de transfusion sanguine (SFTS).

However, there are some potential pitfalls in using this method, such as retroviral insertion mutagenesis, non-physiological level gene expression, non-physiological expansion, and difficulty to construct. The mRNAsi index for each sample of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) could avoid these potential pitfalls by machine learning. In this work, we aimed to construct a network of LSC genes utilizing the mRNAsi. First, mRNAsi value was analyzed with expressions distributions, survival analysis, age, and gender in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples. Then, we used the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to construct modules of stemness genes. The correlation of the LSC genes transcription and interplay among LSC proteins was analyzed. We performed functional and pathway enrichment analysis to annotate stemness genes. Survival analysis further identified prognostic biomarkers by clinical data of TCGA and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. We found that the result of mRNAsi overall survival is not significant, which may be due to the heterogeneity of AML in the stage of myeloid differentiation, French-American-British (FAB) classification systems. Enrichment analysis indicated that the stemness genes were biologically clustered as a group and mainly associated with cell cycle and mitosis. Moreover, 10 key genes (SNRNP40, RFC4, RFC5, CDC6, HSPE1, PA2G4, SNAP23P, DARS2, MIS18A, and HPRT1) were screened by survival analysis with the data from TCGA and GEO. Among them, RFC4 and RFC5 were the distinguished biomarkers for their double-validated prognostic value in both databases. Additionally, the expression of RFC4 and RFC5 had the same trend as mRNAsi score in FAB subtypes. In conclusion, our result demonstrated that mRNAsi based LSC-related genes were found to have strong interactions as a cluster. These genes, especially RFC4 and RFC5, could be the therapeutic targets for inhibiting the stemness characteristics of AML. This work is also a comprehensive pipeline for future cancer stem cell studies.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Parents of CCS also completed distress and posttraumatic stress symptom (PTSS) questionnaires related to their child's cancer experience. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-nine parents were recruited: 77 parents of CCS and 52 comparison parents. Overall mean psychological symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, and family functioning were within normal limits for both groups. Parents of CCS endorsed higher scores for stress, depression, and family problems; however, mean scores for emotional distress were low for both groups, in particular the comparison group. Parents of CCS endorsed low rates of PTSS. Fifty-one percent of parents of CCS scored above the distress thermometer (DT-P) clinical cutoff (>4), with items elevated across all six DT-P domains. However, most parents did not indicate a wish to speak to a health professional about their symptoms. CONCLUSION: Specialist psychosocial intervention may be indicated for only a subset of parents at the end of treatment. As per psychosocial standards of care, effective screening at this timepoint is warranted. Further examination of appropriate timing of psychosocial information and support services that are tailored to parents' circumstances is needed. eHealth approaches may be appropriate.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['McCarthy, Maria C', 'Marks, India R', 'Mulraney, Melissa', 'Downie, Peter', 'Matson, Alice', 'De Luca, Cinzia R']","['McCarthy MC', 'Marks IR', 'Mulraney M', 'Downie P', 'Matson A', 'De Luca CR']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6543-3921', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1953-6481', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9310-1833']","[""Children's Cancer Centre, The Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."", ""Clinical Sciences, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."", 'Department of Paediatrics, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', ""Clinical Sciences, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."", ""Clinical Sciences, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."", 'Department of Paediatrics, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', ""Children's Cancer Centre, The Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Centre, Monash Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."", 'Department of Paediatrics, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'School of Psychological Science, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', ""Children's Cancer Centre, The Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."", ""Clinical Sciences, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*childhood cancer', '*leukemia', '*parents', '*psychological adjustment', '*treatment completion']",2021/08/20 06:00,2021/08/20 06:00,['2021/08/19 17:43'],"['2021/07/28 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/20 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/19 17:43 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.29302 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2021 Nov;68(11):e29302. doi: 10.1002/pbc.29302.

The challenge lies in producing, from small follicles present in the ovarian cortex, high-quality mature oocytes able to sustain embryo development. In vivo, an optimal combination of hormones and other factors coordinates the development of follicles and their enclosed oocyte. We have investigated the effect of the leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) cytokine, alone or in combination with FSH, on sheep in vitro follicle development from the preantral stage onwards. LIF did not alter follicle growth or antrum formation, but it modulated the differentiation of granulosa cells, as revealed by decreased production of anti-Mullerian hormone and abolished FSH-induced stimulation of oestradiol secretion. This modulatory role was also reflected in the abundance of mRNA from 35 genes, analysed by reverse-transcription coupled to microfluidic quantitative PCR. LIF stimulated or at least maintained the expression of genes involved in the dialogue between the oocyte and granulosa cells, through gap junctions (GJA4 encoding connexin 37) or paracrine signalling (Bone morphogenetic protein 15, KIT ligand and their receptors). Finally, the presence of both LIF and FSH during follicle growth strongly improved oocyte meiotic competence: most oocytes (56%) underwent subsequent nuclear maturation, a significant increase compared with their counterparts from follicles of similar size (550-900 microm) cultured with FSH only (28%) or developed in vivo (9%). Their ability to sustain embryo development remains to be evaluated. Combined supplementation with FSH and LIF certainly merits investigation with human follicles.","['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

This necessitated prompt deployment of a monitoring and treatment strategy which included twice-daily blood count assessment, multiple platelet transfusions and anti-coagulation therapy with dose-adjustment per blood count during both induction and consolidation chemotherapy. Multiple factors are believed to contribute to the development of thrombosis in acute leukemia such as diffuse intravascular coagulation, cytokine release and chemotherapy. CASE REPORT: Our patient presented early on in the COVID-19 pandemic, delaying his seeking out medical treatment and we suspect this to have contributed to his 'catastrophic' thrombotic presentation. Well-structured guidelines to help clinicians manage these patients are lacking, and most data are from retrospective analyses or case reports. Our patient continued full-dose anticoagulant therapy until successfully undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplant. The thrombi eventually diminished in size, and the patient was not diagnosed with any further thrombotic events. CONCLUSION: Our case highlights the feasibility of intensive monitoring and provision of platelet transfusion as necessary in order to safely administer low molecular weight heparin from the outset of chemotherapy.","['Copyright (c) 2021 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['Greenfeld, Sarah Matarasso', 'Tadmor, Tamar']","['Greenfeld SM', 'Tadmor T']",,"[""Hematology Unit, B'nai Zion Medical Center, Haifa, Israel sarah.greenfeld@b-zion.org.il."", ""Hematology Unit, B'nai Zion Medical Center, Haifa, Israel.""]",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'SARS-CoV2-Virus', 'anticoagulation', 'catastrophic thrombosis', 'thrombosis']",2021/08/20 06:00,2021/08/24 06:00,['2021/08/19 17:23'],"['2021/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/15 00:00 [revised]', '2021/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/19 17:23 [entrez]', '2021/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['35/5/2951 [pii]', '10.21873/invivo.12588 [doi]']",ppublish,In Vivo. 2021 Sep-Oct;35(5):2951-2955. doi: 10.21873/invivo.12588.,,20210823,,"['Adult', '*COVID-19', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Pandemics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'SARS-CoV-2', '*Thrombosis/diagnosis/etiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC8408683,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This work aimed to induce the maturation of leukemic stem cells with All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), making them sensitive to treatment with Imatinib (IM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: K562 cells were treated with IM and with the combined therapy of ATRA together with IM for 48 and 72 h. The expression of BCR-ABL gene and multidrug resistance gene ABCB1 were evaluated using RT-qPCR. RESULTS: The combined ATRA and IM therapy showed a discreet cell differentiation pattern, evidenced by the panoptic morphology analysis at 48 and 72 h of treatment. The BCR-ABL expression showed no statistical difference when treated alone with IM, however in combination with ATRA, the expression was statistically significant in 48 and 72 h (p</=0.0001) and when the treatment groups were compared to each other (p</=0.001). The ABCB1 gene expression showed a decrease in isolated IM therapy (p</=0.05) and in the combination in 48 and 72 h (p</=0.0001). CONCLUSION: Combined ATRA and IM therapy was shown to be effective in decreasing BCR-ABL and ABCB1 genes, possibly through the differentiation of blast cells, demonstrating that the therapy could be potentially effective in the blast crisis of the disease and for those patients who develop resistance to available CML treatments.","['Copyright (c) 2021 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['Pinto, Camila Albuquerque', 'DE Sousa Portilho, Adrhyann Jullyanne', 'Barbosa, Maritza Cavalcante', 'DE Moraes, Maria Elisabete Amaral', 'DE Lemos, Jose Alexandre Rodrigues', 'Burbano, Rommel Malphario Rodriguez', 'Moreira-Nunes, Caroline Aquino']","['Pinto CA', 'DE Sousa Portilho AJ', 'Barbosa MC', 'DE Moraes MEA', 'DE Lemos JAR', 'Burbano RMR', 'Moreira-Nunes CA']",,"['Human Cytogenetics Laboratory, Biological Science Institute, Federal University of Para, Belem, Brazil.', 'Pharmacogenetics Laboratory, Drug Research and Development Center (NPDM), Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Brazil.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Brazil.', 'Pharmacogenetics Laboratory, Drug Research and Development Center (NPDM), Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Brazil.', 'Biological Science Institute, Federal University of Para, Belem, Brazil.', 'Human Cytogenetics Laboratory, Biological Science Institute, Federal University of Para, Belem, Brazil.', 'Pharmacogenetics Laboratory, Drug Research and Development Center (NPDM), Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Brazil; carolfam@gmail.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['ATRA', 'BCR-ABL', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'MDR']",2021/08/20 06:00,2021/08/24 06:00,['2021/08/19 17:23'],"['2021/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/31 00:00 [revised]', '2021/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/19 17:23 [entrez]', '2021/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['35/5/2661 [pii]', '10.21873/invivo.12549 [doi]']",ppublish,In Vivo. 2021 Sep-Oct;35(5):2661-2667. doi: 10.21873/invivo.12549.,,20210823,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']","['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics', 'Apoptosis', '*Benzamides', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics', 'Piperazines', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin']",PMC8408721,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An unanswered question is whether age-linked disruption of the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment is secondary to hematological dysfunction or vice versa. We therefore studied MSC function in patients with different hematological disorders and found decreased MHC-II except from one sample with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The patients' MSCs were able to exert veto properties except for AML MSCs. While the expression of MHC-II appeared to be irrelevant to the immune licensing of MSCs, AML MSCs lost their ability to differentiate upon contact and rather, continued to proliferate, forming foci-like structures. We performed a retrospective study that indicated a significant increase in MSCs, based on phenotype, for patients with BM fibrosis. This suggests a role for MSCs in patients transitioning to leukemia. NFkB was important to MSC function and was shown to be a potential target to sensitize leukemic CD34+/CD38- cells to azacitidine. This correlated with their lack of allogeneic stimulation. This study identified NFkB as a potential target for combination therapy to treat leukemia stem cells and showed that understanding MSC biology and immune response could be key in determining how the aging BM might support leukemia. More importantly, we show how MSCs might be involved in transitioning the high risk patient with hematological disorder to AML.","['(c) 2021.

Mutation patterns and OS differed between the 84 patients with poor-risk cytogenetics and the 387 patients with good (n = 13), intermediate (n = 339), or unmeasured (n = 35) cytogenetic risk. TP53 (hazards ratio [HR], 2.49; P = .0003) and KRAS (HR, 3.60; P = .001) mutations independently worsened the OS of patients with poor-risk cytogenetics. In those without poor-risk cytogenetics, NPM1 (HR, 0.57; P = .0004), FLT3 internal tandem duplications with low (HR, 1.85; P = .0005) or high (HR, 3.51; P < 10-4) allelic ratio, DNMT3A (HR, 1.86; P < 10-4), NRAS (HR, 1.54; P = .019), and ASXL1 (HR, 1.89; P = .0003) mutations independently predicted OS. Combining cytogenetic risk and mutations in these 7 genes, 39.1% of patients could be assigned to a ""go-go"" tier with a 2-year OS of 66.1%, 7.6% to the ""no-go"" group (2-year OS 2.8%), and 3.3% of to the ""slow-go"" group (2-year OS of 39.1%; P < 10-5). Across 3 independent validation cohorts, 31.2% to 37.7% and 11.2% to 13.5% of patients were assigned to the go-go and the no-go tiers, respectively, with significant differences in OS between tiers in all 3 trial cohorts (HDF [Hauts-de-France], n = 141, P = .003; and SAL [Study Alliance Leukemia], n = 46; AMLSG [AML Study Group], n = 223, both P < 10-5).

We describe a novel deletion in 22q11.22 that was consistently associated with very poor outcomes in patients with B-ALL with IKZF1 alterations. Objective: To determine whether focal deletions within the lambda variable chain region in chromosome 22q11.22 were associated with patients with B-ALL with IKZF1 alterations with the highest risk of relapse and/or death. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included 1310 primarily high-risk pediatric patients with B-ALL who were taken from 6 independent clinical cohorts, consisting of 3 multicenter cohorts (AALL0232 [2004-2011], P9906 [2000-2003], and patients with Down syndrome who were pooled from national and international studies) and 3 single-institution cohorts (University of Utah [Salt Lake City], Children's Hospital of Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], and St. Jude Children's Hospital [Memphis, Tennessee]). Data analysis began in 2011 using patients from the older studies first, and data analysis concluded in 2021. Exposures: Focal 22q11.22 deletions. Main Outcomes and Measures: Event-free and overall survival was investigated. The hypothesis that 22q11.22 deletions stratified the prognostic effect of IKZF1 alterations was formulated while investigating nearby deletions in VPREB1 in 2 initial cohorts (n = 270). Four additional cohorts were then obtained to further study this association (n = 1040). Results: This study of 1310 patients with B-ALL (717 male [56.1%] and 562 female patients [43.9%]) found that focal 22q11.22 deletions are frequent (518 of 1310 [39.5%]) in B-ALL and inconsistent with physiologic V(D)J recombination. A total of 299 of 1310 patients with B-ALL had IKZF1 alterations. Among patients with IKZF1 alterations, more than half shared concomitant focal 22q11.22 deletions (159 of 299 [53.0%]). Patients with combined IKZF1 alterations and 22q11.22 deletions had worse outcomes compared with patients with IKZF1 alterations and wild-type 22q11.22 alleles in every cohort examined (combined cohorts: 5-year event-free survival rates, 43.3% vs 68.5%; hazard ratio [HR], 2.18; 95% CI, 1.54-3.07; P < .001; 5-year overall survival rates, 66.9% vs 83.9%; HR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.32-3.21; P = .001). While 22q11.22 deletions were not prognostic in patients with wild-type IKZF1 , concomitant 22q11.22 deletions in patients with IKZF1 alterations stratified outcomes across additional risk groups, including patients who met the IKZF1plus criteria, and maintained independent significance in multivariate analysis for event-free survival (HR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.27-3.29; P = .003) and overall survival (HR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.01-3.34; P = .05). Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study suggests that 22q11.22 deletions identify patients with B-ALL and IKZF1 alterations who have very poor outcomes and may offer a new genetic biomarker to further refine B-ALL risk stratification and treatment strategies.",,"['Mangum, David Spencer', 'Meyer, Julia A', 'Mason, Clinton C', 'Shams, Soheil', 'Maese, Luke D', 'Gardiner, Jamie D', 'Downie, Jonathan M', 'Pei, Deqing', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'Gleason, Adam', 'Luo, Minjie', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Aplenc, Richard', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Loh, Mignon', 'Greaves, Mel', 'Trede, Nikolaus', 'Raetz, Elizabeth', 'Frazer, J Kimble', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'Engel, Michael E', 'Miles, Rodney R', 'Rabin, Karen R', 'Schiffman, Joshua D']","['Mangum DS', 'Meyer JA', 'Mason CC', 'Shams S', 'Maese LD', 'Gardiner JD', 'Downie JM', 'Pei D', 'Cheng C', 'Gleason A', 'Luo M', 'Pui CH', 'Aplenc R', 'Hunger SP', 'Loh M', 'Greaves M', 'Trede N', 'Raetz E', 'Frazer JK', 'Mullighan CG', 'Engel ME', 'Miles RR', 'Rabin KR', 'Schiffman JD']",,"['Nemours/Alfred I.

We previously performed an in silico analysis of the Periplaneta americana transcriptome and detected periplanetasin-5 using an in silico antimicrobial peptide prediction method. In this study, we investigated whether periplanetasin-5 has anticancer activity against the human leukemia cell line K562. Cell growth and survival of K562 cells treated with periplanetasin-5 were decreased in a dose-dependent manner. By using flow cytometric analysis, acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining and DNA fragmentation, we found that periplanetasin-5 induced apoptotic and necrotic cell death in leukemia cells. In addition, these events were associated with increased levels of the pro-apoptotic proteins Fas and cytochrome c and reduced levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Periplanetasin-5 induces the cleavage of pro-caspase-9, pro-caspase-8, pro-caspase-3, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). The above data suggest that periplanetasin-5 induces apoptosis via both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Moreover, caspase-related apoptosis was further confirmed by using the caspase inhibitor carbobenzoxy-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-[O-methyl]- fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-FMK), which reversed the periplanetasin-5-induced reduction in cell viability.

Compounds (2E)-3-(1H-pyrrol-2-yl)-1-{4-[3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl]phenyl}prop-2-e n-1-one (5a) and (2E)-1-{3-methyl-4-[3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl]phenyl}-3-(1H-pyrrol-2-yl )prop-2-en-1-one (5c) displayed significant antiproliferative activity (Growth Percentage: -77.10 and -92.13, respectively at 10 muM concentration) against the UO-31 cell lines from renal cancer and were further selected for assay at 10-fold dilutions of five different concentrations (10(-4) to 10(-8) M). Both compounds 5a and 5c exhibited promising antiproliferative activity (GI50 : 1.36 to 0.27 muM) against leukemia cancer cell lines HL-60 and RPMI-8226, colon cancer cell lines KM-12; breast cancer cell lines BT-549. Moreover, both compounds 5a and 5c were found to be non-cytotoxic (LC50 >100) against HL-60, RPMI-8226, and KM-12 cell lines. Remarkably, GI50 values of compounds 5a and 5c were identified as more promising than sunitinib against most cancer cell lines. In silico study of compounds 5a and 5c exemplified the desired ADME properties for drug-likeness as well as tighter interactions with VEGFR-2.

We explored the mechanism of histone methyltransferase EZH2/EHMT2 during the transformation of MDS into AML. Expression of EZH2/EHMT2 in patients and NHD13 mice was detected. EZH2 and EHMT2 were silenced or overexpressed in SKM-1 cells. The cell proliferation and cycle were evaluated. Levels of DLX5, H3K27me3, and H3K9me2 in SKM-1 cells were detected. Binding of DLX5 promoter region to H3K27me3 and H3K9me2 was examined. Levels of H3K27me3/H3K9me2 were decreased by EZH2/EHMT2 inhibitor (EPZ-6438/BIX-01294), and changes of DLX5 expression and cell proliferation were observed. EZH2 was poorly expressed in MDS patients but highly expressed in MDS-AML patients. EHMT2 was promoted in both MDS and MDS-AML patients. EZH2 expression was reduced and EHMT2 expression was promoted in NHD13 mice. NHD13 mice with overexpressing EZH2 or EHMT2 transformed into AML more quickly. Intervention of EZH2 or EHMT2 inhibited SKM-1 cell proliferation and promoted DLX5 expression. When silencing EZH1 and EZH2 in SKM-1 cells, the H3K27me3 level was decreased. EZH2 silencing repressed the proliferation of SKM-1 cells. Transcription level of DLX5 in SKM-1 cells was inhibited by H3K27me3 and H3K9me2. Enhanced DLX5 repressed SKM-1 cell proliferation. In conclusion, EZH2/EHMT2 catalyzed H3K27me3/H3K9me2 to inhibit the transcription of DLX5, thus promoting the transformation from MDS to AML.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Zheng, Li, Li, Zhang, Dong, Ren, Chen and Ma.']","['Zheng, Zhuanzhen', 'Li, Ling', 'Li, Guoxia', 'Zhang, Yaofang', 'Dong, Chunxia', 'Ren, Fanggang', 'Chen, Wenliang', 'Ma, Yanping']","['Zheng Z', 'Li L', 'Li G', 'Zhang Y', 'Dong C', 'Ren F', 'Chen W', 'Ma Y']",,"['Department of Hemapathotology, Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Department of Hemapathotology, Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Department of Hemapathotology, Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Department of Hemapathotology, Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Department of Hemapathotology, Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Department of Hemapathotology, Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Department of Hemapathotology, Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Department of Hemapathotology, Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,['NOTNLM'],"['DLX5', 'EHMT2', 'EZH2', 'H3K27me3', 'H3K9me2', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'myelodysplastic syndromes']",2021/08/20 06:00,2021/08/20 06:01,['2021/08/19 06:44'],"['2020/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/19 06:44 [entrez]', '2021/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2021.619795 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Aug 2;9:619795. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.619795. eCollection 2021.,20210802,,,,PMC8365305,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most frequent cancer in pediatric age and the management of this disease with concomitant SARS-COV-2 infection represents a challenging situation. Case presentation: We present the case of a 6-year-old female newly diagnosed with ALL during a documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our patient was admitted 20 days after SARS-CoV-2 detection for evening-rise fever. Laboratory testing showed severe neutropenia while chest x-ray detected moderate pulmonary involvement. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia diagnosis was made through morphological and molecular analysis on bone marrow aspirate. Given the stability of the blood count and clinical conditions, antiviral therapy with Remdesivir and Convalescent Plasma was started before antileukemic treatment, obtaining a rapid resolution of the infection. Conclusion: In our experience, the treatment with Remdesivir and Convalescent Plasma led to a rapid resolution of Sars-Cov-2 infection. Our case did not present any adverse event to the therapy. Thus, this treatment could be considered in patients with malignancies, in order to accelerate the resolution of the infection and begin immunosuppressive treatment safely. Further studies are required to confirm this hypothesis.","[""Copyright (c) 2021 Dell'Isola, Felicioni, Ferraro, Capolsini, Cerri, Gurdo,"", 'Mastrodicasa, Massei, Perruccio, Brogna, Mercuri, Pasqua, Gorello, Caniglia,', 'Verrotti and Arcioni.']","[""Dell'Isola, Giovanni Battista"", 'Felicioni, Matteo', 'Ferraro, Luigi', 'Capolsini, Ilaria', 'Cerri, Carla', 'Gurdo, Grazia', 'Mastrodicasa, Elena', 'Massei, Maria Speranza', 'Perruccio, Katia', 'Brogna, Mariangela', 'Mercuri, Alessandra', 'Pasqua, Barbara Luciani', 'Gorello, Paolo', 'Caniglia, Maurizio', 'Verrotti, Alberto', 'Arcioni, Francesco']","[""Dell'Isola GB"", 'Felicioni M', 'Ferraro L', 'Capolsini I', 'Cerri C', 'Gurdo G', 'Mastrodicasa E', 'Massei MS', 'Perruccio K', 'Brogna M', 'Mercuri A', 'Pasqua BL', 'Gorello P', 'Caniglia M', 'Verrotti A', 'Arcioni F']",,"['Pediatric Clinic, Department of Surgical and Biomedical Sciences, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Pediatric Clinic, Department of Surgical and Biomedical Sciences, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Pediatric Clinic, Department of Surgical and Biomedical Sciences, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Pediatric Onco-Hematology With Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera di Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Pediatric Onco-Hematology With Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera di Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Pediatric Onco-Hematology With Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera di Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Pediatric Onco-Hematology With Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera di Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Pediatric Onco-Hematology With Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera di Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Pediatric Onco-Hematology With Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera di Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Pediatric Onco-Hematology With Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera di Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Clinic of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Azienda Ospedaliera di Perugia, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Immunohaematology, Transfusion Service and Apheresis, Azienda Ospedaliera di Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Department of Chemistry, Biology and Biotechnology, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Pediatric Onco-Hematology With Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera di Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Pediatric Clinic, Department of Surgical and Biomedical Sciences, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Pediatric Onco-Hematology With Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera di Perugia, Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],Switzerland,Front Pediatr,Frontiers in pediatrics,101615492,,['NOTNLM'],"['COVID-19', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'convalescent plasma', 'leukemia', 'remdesevir']",2021/08/20 06:00,2021/08/20 06:01,['2021/08/19 06:43'],"['2021/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/19 06:43 [entrez]', '2021/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fped.2021.712603 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pediatr. 2021 Aug 2;9:712603. doi: 10.3389/fped.2021.712603. eCollection 2021.,20210802,,,,PMC8365506,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LDT was defined as the time needed for the peripheral blood lymphocyte count to double the of the initial observed value. Herein, the LDT prognostic value for time to first treatment (TTFT) was explored in our prospective O-CLL cohort and validated in in two additional CLL cohorts. Specifically, newly diagnosed Binet stage A CLL patients from 40 Italian Institutions, representative of the whole country, were prospectively enrolled into the O-CLL1-GISL protocol (clinicaltrial.gov identifier: NCT00917540). Two independent cohorts of newly diagnosed CLL patients recruited respectively at the Division of Hematology in Novara, Italy, and at the Hospital Clinic in Barcelona, Spain, were utilized as validation cohorts. In the training cohort, TTFT of patients with LDT >12 months was significantly longer related to those with a shorter LDT. At Cox multivariate regression model, LDT </= 12 months maintained a significant independent relationship with shorter TTFT along with IGHV unmutated (IGHVunmut) status, 11q and 17p deletions, elevated beta2M, Rai stage I-II, and NOTCH1 mutations. Based on these statistics, two regression models were constructed including the same prognostic factors with or without the LDT. The model with the LTD provided a significantly better data fitting (chi(2) = 8.25, P=0.0041). The risk prediction developed including LDT had better prognostic accuracy than those without LDT. Moreover, the Harrell'C index for the scores including LDT were higher than those without LDT, although the accepted 0.70 threshold exceeded in both cases. These findings were also confirmed when the same analysis was carried out according to TTFT's explained variation. When data were further analyzed based on the combination between LDT and IGHV mutational status in the training and validation cohorts, IGHVunmut and LDT>12months group showed a predominant prognostic role over IGHVmut LTD </= 12 months (P=0.006) in the O-CLL validation cohort. However, this predominance was of borden-line significance (P=0.06) in the Barcelona group, while the significant prognostic impact was definitely lost in the Novara group. Overall, in this study, we demonstrated that LDT could be re-utilized together with the more sophisticated prognostic factors to manage the follow-up plans for Binet stage A CLL patients.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Morabito, Tripepi, Moia, Recchia, Boggione, Mauro, Bossio,', ""D'Arrigo, Martino, Vigna, Storino, Fronza, Di Raimondo, Rossi, Condoluci,"", 'Colombo, Fais, Fabris, Foa, Cutrona, Gentile, Montserrat, Gaidano, Ferrarini and', 'Neri.']","['Morabito, Fortunato', 'Tripepi, Giovanni', 'Moia, Riccardo', 'Recchia, Anna Grazia', 'Boggione, Paola', 'Mauro, Francesca Romana', 'Bossio, Sabrina', ""D'Arrigo, Graziella"", 'Martino, Enrica Antonia', 'Vigna, Ernesto', 'Storino, Francesca', 'Fronza, Gilberto', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'Rossi, Davide', 'Condoluci, Adalgisa', 'Colombo, Monica', 'Fais, Franco', 'Fabris, Sonia', 'Foa, Robin', 'Cutrona, Giovanna', 'Gentile, Massimo', 'Montserrat, Emili', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Ferrarini, Manlio', 'Neri, Antonino']","['Morabito F', 'Tripepi G', 'Moia R', 'Recchia AG', 'Boggione P', 'Mauro FR', 'Bossio S', ""D'Arrigo G"", 'Martino EA', 'Vigna E', 'Storino F', 'Fronza G', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Rossi D', 'Condoluci A', 'Colombo M', 'Fais F', 'Fabris S', 'Foa R', 'Cutrona G', 'Gentile M', 'Montserrat E', 'Gaidano G', 'Ferrarini M', 'Neri A']",,"['Department of Onco-Hematology Azienda Ospedaliera (AO) Cosenza, Biotechnology Research Unit, Cosenza, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Augusta Victoria Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Centro Nazionale Ricerca Istituto di Fisiologia Clinica (CNR-IFC), Research Unit of Reggio Calabria, Reggio Calabria, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy.', 'Department of Onco-Hematology Azienda Ospedaliera (AO) Cosenza, Biotechnology Research Unit, Cosenza, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy.', ""Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, 'Sapienza' University, Rome, Italy."", 'Department of Onco-Hematology Azienda Ospedaliera (AO) Cosenza, Biotechnology Research Unit, Cosenza, Italy.', 'Centro Nazionale Ricerca Istituto di Fisiologia Clinica (CNR-IFC), Research Unit of Reggio Calabria, Reggio Calabria, Italy.', 'Department of Onco-Hematology AO Cosenza, Hematology Unit AO of Cosenza, Cosenza, Italy.', 'Department of Onco-Hematology AO Cosenza, Hematology Unit AO of Cosenza, Cosenza, Italy.', 'Department of Onco-Hematology Azienda Ospedaliera (AO) Cosenza, Biotechnology Research Unit, Cosenza, Italy.', 'Mutagenesis and Cancer Prevention Unit, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Policlinico, Department of Surgery and Medical Specialties, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Hematology, Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Hematology, Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Molecular Pathology Unit, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genova, Italy.', 'Molecular Pathology Unit, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genova, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', ""Hematology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", ""Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, 'Sapienza' University, Rome, Italy."", 'Molecular Pathology Unit, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genova, Italy.', 'Department of Onco-Hematology AO Cosenza, Hematology Unit AO of Cosenza, Cosenza, Italy.', ""Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', ""Hematology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-Oncology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CLL', '*TTFT', '*early stage', '*lymphocyte doubling time', '*prognosis']",2021/08/20 06:00,2021/08/20 06:01,['2021/08/19 06:43'],"['2021/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/19 06:43 [entrez]', '2021/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.684621 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Aug 2;11:684621. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.684621. eCollection 2021.,20210802,,,,PMC8366564,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.

Eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding proteins (4E-BPs) are mTORC1 substrates with an integral role in oncogenic protein translation. Current pharmacological approaches to inhibit mTORC1 activity and 4E-BP phosphorylation have drawbacks. Recently we described a series of bi-steric compounds that are potent and selective inhibitors of mTORC1, inhibiting 4E-BP phosphorylation at lower concentrations than mTOR kinase inhibitors (TOR-KIs). Here we report the activity of the mTORC1-selective bi-steric inhibitor, RMC-4627, in BCR-ABL-driven models of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). RMC-4627 exhibited potent and selective inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in B-ALL cell lines without inhibiting mTOR-complex-2 (mTORC2) activity. RMC-4627 suppressed cell cycle progression, reduced survival, and enhanced dasatinib cytotoxicity. Compared to a TOR-KI compound, RMC-4627 was more potent, and its effects on cell viability were sustained after washout in vitro. Notably, a once-weekly, well tolerated dose reduced leukemic burden in a B-ALL xenograft model and enhanced the activity of dasatinib. These preclinical studies suggest that intermittent dosing of a bi-steric mTORC1-selective inhibitor has therapeutic potential as a component of leukemia regimens, and further study is warranted.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Lee, Mallya, Dinglasan, Fung, Nguyen, Herzog, Thao, Lorenzana,', 'Wildes, Singh, Smith and Fruman.']","['Lee, Bianca J', 'Mallya, Sharmila', 'Dinglasan, Nuntana', 'Fung, Amos', 'Nguyen, Tram', 'Herzog, Lee-Or', 'Thao, Joshua', 'Lorenzana, Edward G', 'Wildes, David', 'Singh, Mallika', 'Smith, Jacqueline A M', 'Fruman, David A']","['Lee BJ', 'Mallya S', 'Dinglasan N', 'Fung A', 'Nguyen T', 'Herzog LO', 'Thao J', 'Lorenzana EG', 'Wildes D', 'Singh M', 'Smith JAM', 'Fruman DA']",,"['Department of Biology, Revolution Medicines, Inc., Redwood City, CA, United States.', 'Department of Molecular Biology & Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine, CA, United States.', 'Department of Biology, Revolution Medicines, Inc., Redwood City, CA, United States.', 'Department of Molecular Biology & Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine, CA, United States.', 'Department of Biology, Revolution Medicines, Inc., Redwood City, CA, United States.', 'Department of Molecular Biology & Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine, CA, United States.', 'Department of Molecular Biology & Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine, CA, United States.', 'Department of Biology, Revolution Medicines, Inc., Redwood City, CA, United States.', 'Department of Biology, Revolution Medicines, Inc., Redwood City, CA, United States.', 'Department of Biology, Revolution Medicines, Inc., Redwood City, CA, United States.', 'Department of Biology, Revolution Medicines, Inc., Redwood City, CA, United States.', 'Department of Molecular Biology & Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine, CA, United States.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['4EBP1', 'Ph+ B-ALL', 'combination therapy', 'mTORC1', 'targeted (selective) treatment']",2021/08/20 06:00,2021/08/20 06:01,['2021/08/19 06:43'],"['2021/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/19 06:43 [entrez]', '2021/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.673213 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Aug 2;11:673213. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.673213. eCollection 2021.,20210802,,,,PMC8366290,"['DF has received research funding from Revolution Medicines.

The cause of death was identified as KMT2A-rearranged infantile acute lymphoblastic leukaemia based on cytogenetic tests. She had no abnormalities at the 4-week check-up; however, she developed a skin nodule on her abdomen thereafter, and the family did not consult a doctor for fear of contracting COVID-19.

The overall survival (OS) remains unsatisfactory. It is critical to identify potential prognostic biomarkers and develop a nomogram that predicts overall survival in patients with AML. Patients and Methods: We used gene expression dataset and clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) to identify differential expression analysis, survival analysis, and prognostic value of IGHD gene family (IGHDs) in AML patients. A risk score model was built through Lasso analysis and multivariate Cox regression. We also developed a nomogram and evaluated its accuracy with Harrell's Harmony Index (C-index) and calibration curve. Last, the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) database was used for external validation. Results: IGHD1-20 mRNA expression level was an independent prognostic factor for patients with AML by multivariate analysis. After Lasso analysis and multivariate Cox regression, we constructed a 3-gene model (IGHD1-1, IGHD1-20, IGHD3-16) associated with OS in AML. Risk score and age were validated as independent risk factors for prognosis and were used to build a nomogram. The C index and calibration curve results show that its ability to predict 1-year, 3-year and 5-year overall survival is accurate. Conclusion: The mRNA level of IGHDs was increased in AML patients. IGHD1-20 was an independent risk factor for OS in AML patients. The IGHDs risk model (IGHD1-1, IGHD1-20, IGHD3-16) relates to the OS of AML patients. The nomogram, including risk score and age, can conveniently and effectively predict the overall survival rate of patients.",['(c) 2021 Qiu et al.'],"['Qiu, Qunxiang', 'Zhang, Ping', 'Zhang, Nan', 'Shen, Yan', 'Lou, Shifeng', 'Deng, Jianchuan']","['Qiu Q', 'Zhang P', 'Zhang N', 'Shen Y', 'Lou S', 'Deng J']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7361-2396', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5877-1786']","[""Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400010, People's Republic of China."", ""Hematology Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400010, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400010, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400010, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400010, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400010, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Int J Gen Med,International journal of general medicine,101515487,,['NOTNLM'],"['IGHD gene family', 'IGHD1-20', 'acute myeloid leukaemia', 'prognosis']",2021/08/20 06:00,2021/08/20 06:01,['2021/08/19 06:37'],"['2021/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/19 06:37 [entrez]', '2021/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/IJGM.S317528 [doi]', '317528 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Gen Med. 2021 Aug 10;14:4303-4316. doi: 10.2147/IJGM.S317528. eCollection 2021.,20210810,,,,PMC8364394,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although CRNDE is highly expressed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), its mechanism of action remains unknown. In this study, GEPIA and qRT-PCR were performed to confirm the expression of CRNDE in AML samples and cell lines, respectively. CRNDE shRNA vectors were transfected to explore the biological functions of CRNDE. The cell proliferation was assessed by the CCK8 assay, while apoptosis and cell cycle distribution were measured by flow cytometry and Western blotting. The results showed that CRNDE was overexpressed in both AML samples and cell lines. CRNDE silencing inhibited proliferation and increased apoptotic rate and cell cycle arrest of KG-1a cells. The luciferase reporter assay coupled with RIP assay revealed that CRNDE act as a ceRNA. Rescue assays demonstrated that the effects of CRNDE silencing could be reversed by miR-136-5p inhibitors.

Previous studies suggest that the NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) has a dual role in hematologic malignancies, acting as a tumor suppressor or tumor promoter depending on the tumor type. However, little is known about the expression and functions of SIRT1 in T-ALL leukemogenesis. METHODS: Public RNA-seq data, a Notch1 driven T-ALL mouse model and gamma-secretase inhibitor were used to identify SIRT1 expression in T-ALL. We knocked down SIRT1 expression with ShRNAs and assessed the impacts of SIRT1 deficiency on cell proliferation, colony formation, the cell cycle and apoptosis. Transgenic SIRT1 knockout mice were used to determine the function of SIRT1 in vivo. RT-PCR, western blot, co-immunoprecipitation and ubiquitination analyses were used to detect SIRT1, p27 and CDK2 expression and their interactions. RESULTS: SIRT1 protein expression was positively correlated with the activation of Notch1. Downregulation of SIRT1 expression suppressed the proliferation and colony formation of T-ALL cell lines, which was reversed by SIRT1 overexpression. SIRT1 silencing prolonged the lifespan of T-ALL model mice. We demonstrated that p27 was involved in the downstream mechanism of cell cycle arrest induced by silencing SIRT1. SIRT1 increased the phosphorylation of p27 on Thr187 by deacetylating CDK2 and enhanced the interaction between p27 and SKP2 leading to the degradation of p27. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that SIRT1 is a promising target in T-ALL and offer a mechanistic link between the upregulation of SIRT1 and downregulation of p27.",['(c) 2021.

The long-term prognosis remains dismal given the high likelihood for primary refractory or relapsed disease. An essential component of relapse is resurgence from the bone marrow. To date, the murine hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche has been clearly defined, but the human HSC niche is less well understood. The design of niche-based targeted therapies for AML must account for which cellular subsets compete for stem cell occupancy within respective bone marrow microenvironments. In this review, we highlight the principles of stem cell niche biology and discuss translational insights into the AML microenvironment as of 2021. Optimization of competition for niche occupancy is important for the elimination of measurable residual disease (MRD).

Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) SNHG16 acts as an oncogene in a variety of tumors and promotes the occurrence of inflammation in many inflammatory diseases. The study aims to investigate the expression of SNHG16 and its potential biological functions in AR. RT-qPCR results showed that the expression of SNHG16 in AR was up-regulated. The AR cell model was constructed by stimulating primary nasal mucosal epithelial cells from AR patients with IL-13. After knocking down the expression of lncRNA SNHG16, cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry, and the expression of inflammatory factors was detected by ELISA. The results showed that SNHG16 promoted cell apoptosis and inflammation. Then, bioinformatics analysis was used to screen miRNAs bound with SNHG16. Luciferase reporter gene assay and RNA pull-down experiment were used to verify the relationship. We found that the expression of miR-106b-5p was down-regulated and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) expression was up-regulated in the AR cell model. The expression of phospho-Janus kinase 1 and p-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) were detected by Western blotting. Silencing the expression of LIF could inhibit the activity of JAK1/STAT3 pathway and further inhibit cell apoptosis and the occurrence of inflammation. Then transfected SNHG16 shRNA alone or together with miR-106b-5p antagomir into the AR cell model, we found that silencing the expression of SNHG16 down-regulated the expression of LIF and inhibited the activity of the JAK1/STAT3 pathway, cell apoptosis, and inflammation. However, miR-106b-5p antagomir weakened its inhibitory effects. The role of SNHG16 in AR was further verified by the ovalbumin-induced AR mouse model in vivo. In conclusion, SNHG16 up-regulates LIF expression by binding with miR-106b-5p, thus promoting the activity of JAK1/STAT3 pathway, and promoting the development of AR. These results provide new targets for the treatment of AR and may help reduce the damage caused by AR.",,"['Li, Huajing', 'Quan, Fang', 'Zhang, Pengfei', 'Shao, Yuan']","['Li H', 'Quan F', 'Zhang P', 'Shao Y']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9893-8360'],"[""Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery Department, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."", ""Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery Department, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."", ""Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery Department, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."", ""Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery Department, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Hum Exp Toxicol,Human & experimental toxicology,9004560,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Allergic rhinitis', 'apoptosis and inflammation', 'leukemia inhibitory factor', 'lncRNA SNHG16', 'miR-106b-5p', 'the JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway']",2021/08/20 06:00,2021/08/20 06:00,['2021/08/19 05:30'],"['2021/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/20 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/19 05:30 [entrez]']",['10.1177/09603271211035665 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Exp Toxicol. 2021 Dec;40(12_suppl):S233-S245. doi: 10.1177/09603271211035665.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress occurs when the protein folding capacity of the ER is oversaturated. How ER stress modulates tissue homeostasis in the context of alloimmunity is not well understood. We show that ER stress contributes to intestinal tissue injury during GVHD and can be targeted pharmacologically. We observed high levels of ER stress upon GVHD onset in a murine allo-HCT model and in human biopsies. These levels correlated with GVHD severity, underscoring a novel therapeutic potential. Elevated ER stress resulted in increased cell death of intestinal organoids. In a conditional knockout model, deletion of the ER stress regulator transcription factor Xbp1 in intestinal epithelial cells induced a general ER stress signaling disruption and aggravated GVHD lethality. This phenotype was mediated by changes in the production of anti-microbial peptides and the microbiome composition as well as activation of pro-apoptotic signaling. Inhibition of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 alpha (IRE1alpha), the most conserved signaling branch in ER stress, reduced GVHD development in mice. IRE1alpha blockade by the small molecule inhibitor 4micro8c improved intestinal cell viability, without impairing hematopoietic regeneration and T cell activity against tumor cells. Our findings in patient samples and mice indicate that excessive ER stress propagates tissue injury during GVHD. Reducing ER stress could improve the outcome of patients suffering from GVHD.",,"['Haring, Eileen', 'Andrieux, Geoffroy', 'Uhl, Franziska M', 'Krausz, Mate', 'Proietti, Michele', 'Sauer, Barbara', 'Esser, Philipp R', 'Martin, Stefan F', 'Pfeifer, Dietmar', 'Schmitt-Graeff, Annette', 'Duyster, Justus', 'Kohler, Natalie', 'Grimbacher, Bodo', 'Boerries, Melanie', 'Aumann, Konrad', 'Zeiser, Robert', 'Apostolova, Petya']","['Haring E', 'Andrieux G', 'Uhl FM', 'Krausz M', 'Proietti M', 'Sauer B', 'Esser PR', 'Martin SF', 'Pfeifer D', 'Schmitt-Graeff A', 'Duyster J', 'Kohler N', 'Grimbacher B', 'Boerries M', 'Aumann K', 'Zeiser R', 'Apostolova P']",,"['Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; Faculty of Biology, Albert-Ludwigs-University, Freiburg, Germany; German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner site Freiburg; and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner site Freiburg; and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany; Institute of Medical Bioinformatics and Systems Medicine, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; Faculty of Biology, Albert-Ludwigs-University, Freiburg.', 'Institute for Immunodeficiency, Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency (CCI), Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, Albert-Ludwigs-University, Freiburg.', 'Institute for Immunodeficiency, Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency (CCI), Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, Albert-Ludwigs-University, Freiburg.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg.', 'Allergy Research Group, Department of Dermatology, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg.', 'Allergy Research Group, Department of Dermatology, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg.', 'University of Freiburg.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; CIBSS - Centre for Integrative Biological Signalling Studies, University of Freiburg, Freiburg.', 'Institute for Immunodeficiency, Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency (CCI), Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, Albert-Ludwigs-University, Freiburg, Germany; CIBSS - Centre for Integrative Biological Signalling Studies, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; DZIF - German Center for Infection Research, Satellite Center Freiburg, Germany; RESIST - Cluster of Excellence 2155 to Hannover Medical School, Satellite Center Freiburg.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner site Freiburg; and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany; Institute of Medical Bioinformatics and Systems Medicine, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; Comprehensive Cancer Center Freiburg (CCCF), Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; Institute of Medical Bioinformatics and Systems Medicine, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; CIBSS - Centre for Integrative Biological Signalling Studies, University of Freiburg, Freiburg.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner site Freiburg; and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg. petya.apostolova@uniklinik-freiburg.de.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,,,2021/08/20 06:00,2021/08/20 06:00,['2021/08/19 04:51'],"['2021/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/19 04:51 [entrez]', '2021/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3324/haematol.2021.278387 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Haematologica. 2021 Aug 19. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2021.278387.,20210819,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Peripheral venous blood T cells from 8 healthy volunteers were collected and infected with humanized and murine CD19 CAR lentivirus. Human and murine CD19 CAR-T cells were prepared and cell proliferation was detected by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) method. The cytotoxicity of CD3(+) T cells, humanized and murine CD19 CAR-T cells to NALM-6 cells was detected by lactate dehydrogenase assay. Thirty BAL B/c nude mice transplanted with NALM-6 cells were randomly divided into 3 groups with 10 mice in each group and injected humanized CD19 CAR-T cells, mouse CD19 CAR-T cells and control CD3(+) T cell via tail vein, respectively. The proportion of NALM-6 cells in peripheral blood and the proportion of CD19 CAR-T cells in T cells from the vein of the inner canthus were detected by flow cytometry. The overall survival of BAL B/c nude mice was observed. Results: The proliferation of mouse and humanized CD19 CAR-T cells were (68.50+/-0.93)% and (80.63+/-1.41)%, respectively (t=20.353, P<0.001) after cultured in vitro for 24 hours, and were (91.38+/-1.41)% and (148.13+/-1.25)%, respectively (t=85.364, P<0.001) after cultured for 48 hours. When the effect to target ratio was 1ratio1, there was no difference between the humanized and murine CD19 CAR-T cell group after co-culture for 24 hours (P=0.169), while the killing activity of humanized CD19 CAR-T cells against NALM-6 cells was higher than that of murine CD19 CAR-T cells (P<0.01) after 48 hours of co-culture. When the effect to target ratio was 4ratio1, the cytotoxicity of humanized CD19 CAR-T cells against NALM-6 cells was higher than that of murine CD19 CAR-T cells in co-culture for 24 and 48 hours (P<0.01). On the seventh day of CD19 CAR-T cell therapy, the proportion of NALM-6 cells in the peripheral blood of BAL B/c nude mice decreased to the lowest level in the humanized CD19 CAR-T cell group and the murine CD19 CAR-T cell group. After 21 days, the proportion of NALM-6 cells in the murine CD19 CAR-T cell group was higher than that in the humanized CD19 CAR-T cell group (P(21 d)=0.001, P(28 d)<0.001, P(35 d)<0.001). The proportion of humanized and murine CD19 CAR-T cells in the peripheral blood reached the peaks after 7 days of therapy, and the proportion of humanized CD19 CAR-T cells was higher than that of murine CAR-T cells (P(7 d)=0.002). The CD19 CAR-T cells disappeared in the peripheral blood in the murine CD19 CAR-T cell group after 14 days of therapy, while in the humanized CD19 CAR-T cell group it disappeared after 21 days of therapy. The median survival of BAL B/c nude mice in the murine CD19 CAR-T cell group and the humanized CD19 CAR-T cell group was 42 days and 63 days, respectively (chi(2)=15.382, P<0.001). Conclusions: High affinity humanized CD19 CAR-T cells have stronger proliferation, higher cytotoxicity and longer survival time compared with those of murine CD19 CAR-T cells.

While most patients with TAM are asymptomatic and go into spontaneous remission without a need for therapy, around 20% of patients die within the first six months due to TAM-related complications. Another 20-30% of patients progress from TAM to ML-DS. ML-DS patients are particularly vulnerable to therapy-associated toxicity, but the prognosis of relapsed ML-DS is extremely poor - thus, ML-DS therapy schemata must strive for a balance between appropriate efficacy (to avoid relapses) and treatment-related toxicity. This guideline presents diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for TAM and ML-DS based on the experience and results of previous clinical studies from the BFM working group, which have helped reduce the risk of early death in symptomatic TAM patients using low-dose cytarabine, and which have achieved excellent cure rates for ML-DS using intensity-reduced treatment protocols.",['Thieme.

We describe measurable residual disease (MRD) levels in E1912 over time and correlate them with clinical outcome. Undetectable MRD rates (<1 CLL cell per 104 leukocytes) were 29.1%, 30.3%, 23.4%, and 8.6% at 3, 12, 24, and 36 months for FCR, and significantly lower at 7.9%, 4.2%, and 3.7% at 12, 24, and 36 months for IR, respectively. Undetectable MRD at 3, 12, 24, and 36 months was associated with longer progression-free survival (PFS) in the FCR arm, with hazard ratios (MRD detectable/MRD undetectable) of 4.29 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.89-9.71), 3.91 (95% CI, 1.39-11.03), 14.12 (95% CI, 1.78-111.73), and not estimable (no events among those with undetectable MRD), respectively. In the IR arm, patients with detectable MRD did not have significantly worse PFS compared with those in whom MRD was undetectable; however, PFS was longer in those with MRD levels <10-1 than in those with MRD levels above this threshold. Our observations provide additional support for the use of MRD as a surrogate end point for PFS in patients receiving FCR. In patients on indefinite ibrutinib-based therapy, PFS did not differ significantly by undetectable MRD status, whereas those with MRD <10-1 tended to have longer PFS, although continuation of ibrutinib would very likely be necessary to maintain treatment efficacy.",['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Wang, Xin Victoria', 'Hanson, Curtis A', 'Tschumper, Renee C', 'Lesnick, Connie E', 'Braggio, Esteban', 'Paietta, Elisabeth M', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Barrientos, Jacqueline C', 'Leis, Jose Francisco', 'Zhang, Cong Christine', 'Coutre, Steven E', 'Barr, Paul M', 'Cashen, Amanda F', 'Mato, Anthony R', 'Singh, Avina K', 'Mullane, Michael P', 'Erba, Harry', 'Stone, Richard', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Kay, Neil E']","['Wang XV', 'Hanson CA', 'Tschumper RC', 'Lesnick CE', 'Braggio E', 'Paietta EM', ""O'Brien S"", 'Barrientos JC', 'Leis JF', 'Zhang CC', 'Coutre SE', 'Barr PM', 'Cashen AF', 'Mato AR', 'Singh AK', 'Mullane MP', 'Erba H', 'Stone R', 'Litzow MR', 'Tallman MS', 'Shanafelt TD', 'Kay NE']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3860-4830', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9733-401X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1093-2189', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9816-6302', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5951-5055']","['Department of Data Science, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Harvard T.

Post hoc analyses indicated that AOEs are dose dependent. We assessed the benefit/risk ratio across 3 ponatinib starting doses in the first prospective study to evaluate a novel, response-based, dose-reduction strategy for TKI treatment. Adults with CP-CML resistant to or intolerant of at least 2 prior BCR-ABL1 TKIs or with a BCR-ABL1 T315I mutation were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to 3 cohorts receiving ponatinib 45, 30, or 15 mg once daily. In patients who received 45 or 30 mg daily the dose was reduced to 15 mg upon response (BCR-ABL1IS transcript levels </=1%). The primary end point was response at 12 months. From August 2015 through May 2019, 283 patients were randomly assigned to the cohorts: 282 (94 per dose group) received treatment (data cutoff, 31 May 2020).

Independently confirmed grade 3 or above treatment-emergent AOEs occurred in 5, 5, and 3 patients in the 45-, 30-, and 15-mg cohorts, respectively.

Asciminib, a first-in-class BCR-ABL1 inhibitor Specifically Targeting the ABL Myristoyl Pocket (STAMP), has the potential to overcome resistance/intolerance to approved TKIs. In this phase 3, open-label study, patients with CML-CP previously treated with >/=2 TKIs were randomized (2:1) to receive asciminib 40 mg twice daily vs bosutinib 500 mg once daily. Randomization was stratified by major cytogenetic response (MCyR) status at baseline. The primary objective was to compare the major molecular response (MMR) rate at week 24 for asciminib vs bosutinib. A total of 233 patients were randomized to asciminib (n = 157) or bosutinib (n = 76). Median follow-up was 14.9 months. The MMR rate at week 24 was 25.5% with asciminib and 13.2% with bosutinib. The difference in MMR rate between treatment arms, after adjusting for MCyR at baseline, was 12.2% (95% confidence interval, 2.19-22.30; 2-sided P = .029). Fewer grade >/=3 adverse events (50.6% vs 60.5%) and adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation (5.8% vs 21.1%) occurred with asciminib than with bosutinib. The study showed a superior efficacy of asciminib compared with that of bosutinib, together with a favorable safety profile.

However, whether NK cell determinants predict protection against relapse for JMML patients undergoing HCT is unknown. Therefore, we investigated NK cell-related donor and recipient immunogenetics as determinants of HCT outcomes in patients with JMML. Patients with JMML (age 0 to <19 years) who underwent a first allogeneic HCT from an unrelated donor between 2000 and 2017 and had available donor samples from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research Repository were included. Donor killer immunoglobulin receptor (KIR) typing was performed on pre-HCT samples. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS); secondary endpoints included relapse, grade II-IV acute graft versus-host-disease (aGVHD), chronic GVHD (cGVHD), GVHD-free relapse-free survival, transplantation-related mortality, and overall survival (OS). Donor KIR models tested included KIR genotype (AA versus Bx), B content (0-1 versus >/=2), centromeric and telomeric region score (AA versus AB versus BB), B content score (best, better, or neutral), composite score (2 versus 3 versus 4), activating KIR content, and the presence of KIR2DS4. Ligand-ligand and KIR-ligand mismatch effects on outcomes were analyzed in HLA-mismatched donors (</=7/8; n = 74) only. Univariate analyses were performed for primary and secondary outcomes of interest, with a P value <.05 considered significant. One hundred sixty-five patients (113 males), with a median follow-up of 85 months (range, 6 to 216 months) met the study criteria. Of these, 111 underwent an unrelated donor HCT and 54 underwent a UCB HCT. Almost all (n = 161; 98%) received a myeloablative conditioning regimen. After exclusion of recipients of reduced-intensity/nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens and ex vivo T cell-depleted grafts (n = 8), there were 42 AA donors and 115 Bx donors, respectively. Three-year DFS, OS, relapse, and GRFS for the entire cohort were 58% (95% confidence interval [CI], 50% to 66%), 67% (95% CI, 59% to 74%), 26% (95% CI, 19% to 33%), and 27% (95% CI, 19% to 35%), respectively. The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV aGVHD at 100 days was 36% (95% CI, 27% to 44%), and that of cGVHD at 1 year was 23% (95% CI, 17% to 30%). There were no differences between AA donors and Bx donors for any recipient survival outcomes. The risk of grade II-IV aGVHD was lower in patients with donors with a B content score of >/=2 (hazard ratio [HR], 0.46; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.83; P = .01), an activating KIR content score of >3 (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.95; P = .032), centromeric A/B score (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 033 to 0.98; P = .041), and telomeric A/B score (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.34 to 1.00; P = .048). To our knowledge, this is the first study analyzing the association of NK cell determinants and outcomes in JMML HCT recipients. This study identifies potential benefits of donor KIR-B genotypes in reducing aGVHD. Our findings warrant further study of the role of NK cells in enhancing the graft-versus-leukemia effect via recognition of JMML blasts.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'All rights reserved.']","['Rangarajan, Hemalatha G', 'Pereira, Marcelo S F', 'Brazauskas, Ruta', 'St Martin, Andrew', 'Kussman, Ashleigh', 'Elmas, Ezgi', 'Verneris, Michael R', 'Gadalla, Shahinaz M', 'Marsh, Steven G E', 'Paczesny, Sophie', 'Spellman, Stephen R', 'Lee, Stephanie J', 'Lee, Dean A']","['Rangarajan HG', 'Pereira MSF', 'Brazauskas R', 'St Martin A', 'Kussman A', 'Elmas E', 'Verneris MR', 'Gadalla SM', 'Marsh SGE', 'Paczesny S', 'Spellman SR', 'Lee SJ', 'Lee DA']",,"[""Division of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, Blood and Marrow Transplant, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio.

Here, we show that AML cells secrete the stem cell growth factor R-spondin 2 (RSPO2) to promote their self-renewal and prevent cell differentiation. Although RSPO2 is a well-known WNT agonist, we reveal that it maintains AML self-renewal WNT independently, by inhibiting BMP receptor signaling. Autocrine RSPO2 signaling is also required to prevent differentiation and to promote self-renewal in normal hematopoietic stem cells as well as primary AML cells. Comprehensive datamining reveals that RSPO2 expression is elevated in patients with AML of poor prognosis. Consistently, inhibiting RSPO2 prolongs survival in AML mouse xenograft models. Our study indicates that in AML, RSPO2 acts as an autocrine BMP antagonist to promote cancer cell renewal and may serve as a marker for poor prognosis.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s).

To overcome TKI resistance, an anti-c-Kit antibody-drug conjugate was developed in this study to treat wild-type and mutant c-Kit-positive cancers. NN2101, a fully human IgG1, was conjugated to DM1, a microtubule inhibitor, through N-succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC) (to give NN2101-DM1). The antitumor activity of NN2101-DM1 was evaluated in vitro and in vivo using various cancer cell lines. NN2101-DM1 exhibited potent growth-inhibitory activities against c-Kit-positive cancer cell lines. In a mouse xenograft model, NN2101-DM1 exhibited potent growth-inhibitory activities against imatinib-resistant GIST and SM cells. In addition, NN2101-DM1 exhibited a significantly higher anti-cancer effect than carboplatin/etoposide against SCLC cells where c-Kit does not mediate cancer pathogenesis. Furthermore, the combination of NN2101-DM1 with imatinib in imatinib-sensitive GIST cells induced complete remission compared with treatment with NN2101-DM1 or imatinib alone in mouse xenograft models.

An important mechanism of the activated NF-kappaB signaling pathway in ATLL is the activation of the macroautophagy (herafter referred to as autophagy in the remainder of this manuscript)-lysosomal degradation of p47 (NSFL1C), a negative regulator of the NF-kappaB pathway. Therefore, we considered the use of chloroquine (CQ) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) (CQ/HCQ) as an autophagy inhibitor to treat ATLL; these drugs were originally approved by the FDA as antimalarial drugs and have recently been used to treat autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In this paper, we determined the therapeutic efficacy of CQ/HCQ, as NF-kappaB inhibitors, in ATLL mediated by blockade of p47 degradation. Administration of CQ/HCQ to ATLL cell lines and primary ATLL cells induced cell growth inhibition in a dose-dependent manner, and the majority of cells underwent apoptosis after CQ administration. As to the molecular mechanism, autophagy was inhibited in CQ-treated ATLL cells, and activation of the NF-kappaB pathway was suppressed with the restoration of the p47 level. When the antitumor effect of CQ/HCQ was examined using immunodeficient mice transplanted with ATLL cell lines, CQ/HCQ significantly suppressed tumor growth and improved the survival rate in the ATLL xenograft mouse model. Importantly, HCQ selectively induced ATLL cell death in the ATLL xenograft mouse model at the dose used to treat SLE. Taken together, our results suggest that the inhibition of autophagy by CQ/HCQ may become a novel and effective strategy for the treatment of ATLL.",,"['Fauzi, Yanuar Rahmat', 'Nakahata, Shingo', 'Chilmi, Syahrul', 'Ichikawa, Tomonaga', 'Nueangphuet, Phawut', 'Yamaguchi, Ryoji', 'Nakamura, Tatsufumi', 'Shimoda, Kazuya', 'Morishita, Kazuhiro']","['Fauzi YR', 'Nakahata S', 'Chilmi S', 'Ichikawa T', 'Nueangphuet P', 'Yamaguchi R', 'Nakamura T', 'Shimoda K', 'Morishita K']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4605-2266', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4944-5807', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0821-9117', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8409-8505']","['Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki City, Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan.', 'Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki City, Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan.', 'Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki City, Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan.', 'Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki City, Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan.', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki City, Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan.', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki City, Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan.', 'Department of Social Work, Faculty of Human and Social Studies, Nagasaki International University, Sasebo City, Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Diabetes, and Endocrinology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki City, Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan.', 'Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki City, Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,,,2021/08/19 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/08/18 17:25'],"['2021/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/18 17:25 [entrez]', '2021/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0256320 [doi]', 'PONE-D-21-15148 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2021 Aug 18;16(8):e0256320. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0256320. eCollection 2021.,20210818,20211208,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nsfl1c protein, rat)', '0 (Soluble N-Ethylmaleimide-Sensitive Factor Attachment Proteins)', '4QWG6N8QKH (Hydroxychloroquine)', '886U3H6UFF (Chloroquine)']","['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Autophagy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chloroquine/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/growth & development/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Hydroxychloroquine/*pharmacology', 'Immunologic Factors/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology/mortality/virology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/immunology', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/genetics', 'Soluble N-Ethylmaleimide-Sensitive Factor Attachment Proteins/*genetics/immunology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC8372904,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of LINC00987 in bone marrow specimens of AML patients and cell lines was measured by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). Small interfering RNA targeting LINC00987 (si-LINC00987) was transfected into AML cell lines HL-60 and KG-1, and the proliferation, invasion and apoptosis were detected with Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), Transwell and flow cytometry, respectively. Moreover, the binding between LINC00987 and insulin like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) was validated with an RNA pull-down assay. Co-immunoprecipitation assay was used to verify the binding between IGF2BP2 and proliferation-associated 2G4 (PA2G4). Then rescue experiments were performed to explore the effects of LINC00987/IGF2BP2/PA2G4 axis on HL-60 and KG-1 cell functions. Additionally, HL-60 cells transfected with si-LINC00987 were injected into mice, followed by the evaluation of xenograft tumor growth. LINC00987 was upregulated in AML patient specimens and cell lines. LINC00987 knockdown inhibited proliferation and invasion and promoted apoptosis in AML cells. LINC00987 could bind with IGF2BP2 and promote its expression, and IGF2BP2 overexpression reversed the effects of LINC00987 knockdown on the proliferation, invasion and apoptosis in AML cells. Besides, IGF2BP2 could bind with PA2G4. IGF2BP2 knockdown inhibited proliferation and invasion, and promoted apoptosis in AML cells, whereas PA2G4 overexpression reversed these effects. Additionally, the LINC00987 knockdown inhibited the xenograft tumor growth of AML in vivo. Knockdown of LINC00987 inhibits AML cell proliferation and invasion, and promotes apoptosis in vitro and reduces tumor growth in vivo by suppressing IGF2BP2-mediated PA2G4 expression.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The article describes a case of polymorphic dermal angiitis, a combination of hemorrhagic and ulcerative-necrotic forms against the background of rituximab treatment in a 53-year-old woman suffering from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (b-CLL). During four hours after the 5th intravenous administration of rituximab, the appearance of painful rashes on the skin of both shins of a patient was observed. In the following few days, a progression of the pathological skin process was noted. The treatment with prednisolone in the amount of 50 mg/day, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid in the amount of 1000 mg twice per day and Diflucan in a dosage of 50 mg/day for 15 days was prescribed. In a local therapy, wet-drying bandages with antiseptic solutions, combined topic glucocorticosteroid preparations, drugs that improve trophic and tissue regeneration were recommended. After discharge, the patient continued to receive prednisolone in the amount of 50 mg/day for 14 days with a slow decrease in the dosage of the drug until the withdrawal under the supervision of a dermatologist.

Prognostic systems that incorporate advanced analytics of clinical, pathologic, and molecular data have the potential to more accurately and dynamically predict survival in patients receiving various therapies. METHODS: A total of 1,471 MDS patients with comprehensively annotated clinical and molecular data were included in a training cohort and analyzed using machine learning techniques. A random survival algorithm was used to build a prognostic model, which was then validated in external cohorts. The accuracy of the proposed model, compared with other established models, was assessed using a concordance (c)index. RESULTS: The median age for the training cohort was 71 years. Commonly mutated genes included SF3B1, TET2, and ASXL1. The algorithm identified chromosomal karyotype, platelet, hemoglobin levels, bone marrow blast percentage, age, other clinical variables, seven discrete gene mutations, and mutation number as having prognostic impact on overall and leukemia-free survivals. The model was validated in an independent external cohort of 465 patients, a cohort of patients with MDS treated in a prospective clinical trial, a cohort of patients with paired samples at different time points during the disease course, and a cohort of patients who underwent hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. CONCLUSION: A personalized prediction model on the basis of clinical and genomic data outperformed established prognostic models in MDS. The new model was dynamic, predicting survival and leukemia transformation probabilities at different time points that are unique for a given patient, and can upstage and downstage patients into more appropriate risk categories.",,"['Nazha, Aziz', 'Komrokji, Rami', 'Meggendorfer, Manja', 'Jia, Xuefei', 'Radakovich, Nathan', 'Shreve, Jacob', 'Hilton, C Beau', 'Nagata, Yasunubo', 'Hamilton, Betty K', 'Mukherjee, Sudipto', 'Al Ali, Najla', 'Walter, Wencke', 'Hutter, Stephan', 'Padron, Eric', 'Sallman, David', 'Kuzmanovic, Teodora', 'Kerr, Cassandra', 'Adema, Vera', 'Steensma, David P', 'Dezern, Amy', 'Roboz, Gail', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Erba, Harry', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A']","['Nazha A', 'Komrokji R', 'Meggendorfer M', 'Jia X', 'Radakovich N', 'Shreve J', 'Hilton CB', 'Nagata Y', 'Hamilton BK', 'Mukherjee S', 'Al Ali N', 'Walter W', 'Hutter S', 'Padron E', 'Sallman D', 'Kuzmanovic T', 'Kerr C', 'Adema V', 'Steensma DP', 'Dezern A', 'Roboz G', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Erba H', 'Haferlach C', 'Maciejewski JP', 'Haferlach T', 'Sekeres MA']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6695-7994', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1876-5269', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5712-1952', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4897-6961', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1363-7452', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5083-9838', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4707-7916', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0504-8233', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6051-4378', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5130-9284', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0384-3658', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3631-2482', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1093-2189', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2009-6524']","['Leukemia Program, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Center for Clinical Artificial Intelligence, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, H.

However, factors leading to BSI and progression to end-organ disease and death are understood only partially. The study analyzes host and microbial risk factors and assesses their impact on BSI development and mortality. A total of 96 patients with hematological malignancies and BSI were included in the study. Host-associated risk factors and all causes of mortality were analyzed by multivariable logistic regression at 30 days after BSI onset of the first neutropenic episode. The multidrug-resistant profile and biofilm production of bacterial isolates from primary BSI were included in the analysis. Median age was 60 years. The underlying diagnoses were acute leukemia (55%), lymphoma (31%), and myeloma (14%). A total of 96 bacterial isolates were isolated from BSIs. Escherichia coli was the most common isolate (29.2%). Multidrug-resistant bacteria caused 10.4% of bacteremia episodes. Weak biofilm producers (WBPs) were significantly (P < 0.0001) more abundant (72.2%) than strong biofilm producers (SBPs) (27.8%). Specifically, SBPs were 7.1% for E. coli, 93.7% for P. aeruginosa, 50% for K. pneumoniae, and 3.8% for coagulase-negative staphylococci. Mortality at day 30 was 8.3%, and all deaths were attributable to Gram-negative bacteria. About 22% of all BSIs were catheter-related BSIs (CRBSIs) and mostly caused by Gram-positive bacteria (79.0%). However, CRBSIs were not correlated with biofilm production levels (P = 0.75) and did not significantly impact the mortality rate (P = 0.62). Conversely, SBP bacteria were an independent risk factor (P = 0.018) for developing an end-organ disease. In addition, multivariate analysis indicated that SBPs (P = 0.013) and multidrug-resistant bacteria (P = 0.006) were independent risk factors associated with 30-day mortality. SBP and multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria caused a limited fraction of BSI in these patients. However, when present, SBPs raise the risk of end-organ disease and, together with an MDR phenotype, can independently and significantly concur at increasing the risk of death. IMPORTANCE Bacterial bloodstream infection (BSI) is a significant complication in hematologic patients and is associated with high mortality rates. Despite improvements in BSI management, factors leading to sepsis are understood only partially. This study analyzes the contribution of bacterial biofilm on BSI development and mortality in patients with hematological malignancies (HMs). In this work, weak biofilm producers (WBPs) were significantly more abundant than strong biofilm producers (SBPs). However, when present, SBP bacteria raised the risk of end-organ disease in HM patients developing a BSI. Besides, SBPs, together with a multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype, independently and significantly concur at increasing the risk of death in HM patients. The characterization of microbial biofilms may provide key information for the diagnosis and therapeutic management of BSI and may help develop novel strategies to either eradicate or control harmful microbial biofilms.",,"['Di Domenico, Enea Gino', 'Marchesi, Francesco', 'Cavallo, Ilaria', 'Toma, Luigi', 'Sivori, Francesca', 'Papa, Elena', 'Spadea, Antonio', 'Cafarella, Giuseppina', 'Terrenato, Irene', 'Prignano, Grazia', 'Pimpinelli, Fulvia', 'Mastrofrancesco, Arianna', ""D'Agosto, Giovanna"", 'Trento, Elisabetta', 'Morrone, Aldo', 'Mengarelli, Andrea', 'Ensoli, Fabrizio']","['Di Domenico EG', 'Marchesi F', 'Cavallo I', 'Toma L', 'Sivori F', 'Papa E', 'Spadea A', 'Cafarella G', 'Terrenato I', 'Prignano G', 'Pimpinelli F', 'Mastrofrancesco A', ""D'Agosto G"", 'Trento E', 'Morrone A', 'Mengarelli A', 'Ensoli F']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6295-6006'],"['Microbiology and Virology, San Gallicano Dermatological Institute, IRCCS, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology and Stem Cell Transplant Unit, IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Microbiology and Virology, San Gallicano Dermatological Institute, IRCCS, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Research, Advanced Diagnostics, and Technological Innovation, Translational Research Area, IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Microbiology and Virology, San Gallicano Dermatological Institute, IRCCS, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology and Stem Cell Transplant Unit, IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology and Stem Cell Transplant Unit, IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology and Stem Cell Transplant Unit, IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Biostatistics and Bioinformatic Unit, Scientific Direction, IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Microbiology and Virology, San Gallicano Dermatological Institute, IRCCS, Rome, Italy.', 'Microbiology and Virology, San Gallicano Dermatological Institute, IRCCS, Rome, Italy.', 'Microbiology and Virology, San Gallicano Dermatological Institute, IRCCS, Rome, Italy.', 'Microbiology and Virology, San Gallicano Dermatological Institute, IRCCS, Rome, Italy.', 'Microbiology and Virology, San Gallicano Dermatological Institute, IRCCS, Rome, Italy.', 'Scientific Direction, IRCCS San Gallicano Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology and Stem Cell Transplant Unit, IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Microbiology and Virology, San Gallicano Dermatological Institute, IRCCS, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Microbiol Spectr,Microbiology spectrum,101634614,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Escherichia coli', '*Klebsiella', '*Pseudomonas aeruginosa', '*Staphylococcus aureus', '*biofilm', '*bloodstream infections', '*coagulase-negative staphylococci', '*microbiology', '*mortality', '*multidrug resistance']",2021/08/19 06:00,2022/01/18 06:00,['2021/08/18 17:14'],"['2021/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/18 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/18 17:14 [entrez]']",['10.1128/Spectrum.00550-21 [doi]'],ppublish,Microbiol Spectr. 2021 Sep 3;9(1):e0055021. doi: 10.1128/Spectrum.00550-21.

A total of 137 patients carrying E2A-PBX1 among 3164 B-ALL patients between 2009 and 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. The 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates of the whole cohort were 68.6% and 61.0%, respectively. Age [DFS, p = 0.037; cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), p = 0.005] and the level of minimal residual disease (MRD) after induction chemotherapy (OS, p = 0.020; DFS, p = 0.002; CIR, p = 0.006) were independent risk factors. In adolescents/adults, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) at first complete remission (CR1) significantly improved the 5-year prognosis (OS, p < 0.001; DFS, p < 0.001; CIR, p < 0.001). Haploidentical HSCT decreased the CIR compared with human leukocyte antigen-matched HSCT in adolescents/adults (p = 0.017). Mutations in PBX1, PAX5, CTCF and SETD2, amplification of AKT3, and deletion of CDKN2A/B were common in the total cohort, while transcriptome differences were found in the cell cycle, nerve growth factor (NGF) signaling pathway and transcriptional regulation by TP53 between adolescents/adults and children. Patients with multiple subclones at diagnosis tended to have unfavorable 3-year prognoses (DFS, p = 0.010; CIR, p = 0.021). Leukemia clones with DNA repair gene mutations showed aggressive and treatment-refractory phenotypes in this subtype of ALL. Our study indicated that age, the level of MRD and DNA repair gene mutations were associated with E2A-PBX1-positive B-ALL outcomes.

Due to a lack of research, the importance of the pharmacokinetics (PK) of TKIs is currently unclear. We examined the PK of the third-generation TKI ponatinib to monitor side effects and efficacy during treatments for one patient with CML-chronic phase (CP-CML) and two who received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), one for CML-blastic crisis (BC-CML) and one for Ph + ALL. The patient with CP-CML was intolerant to multiple TKIs (dasatinib, nilotinib, imatinib, and bosutinib) and thus was switched to ponatinib (15 mg/day). The patients who received allo-HSCT for BC-CML and Ph + ALL received ponatinib (15 mg/day) as maintenance therapy. Notably, serial evaluation of the PK of ponatinib showed that the median trough values (ng/ml) were 17.2 (12.2-34.5), 33.1 (21.2-40.3) and 27.7 (13.6-29.9) in patients 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

To address limited supply, accelerator-produced (225)Ac has been recently made available. Accelerator-produced (225)Ac via (232)Th irradiation (denoted (225/7)Ac) contains a low percentage (0.1-0.3%) of (227)Ac (21.77-year half-life) activity at end of bombardment. Using pharmacokinetic modeling, we have examined the dosimetric impact of (227)Ac on the use of accelerator-produced (225)Ac for radiopharmaceutical therapy. We examine the contribution of (227)Ac and its daughters to tissue absorbed doses. The dosimetric analysis was performed for antibody-conjugated (225/7)Ac administered intravenously to treat patients with hematological cancers. Published pharmacokinetic models are used to obtain the distribution of (225/7)Ac-labeled antibody and also the distribution of either free or antibody-conjugated (227)Th. RESULTS: Based on our modeling, the tissue specific absorbed dose from (227)Ac would be negligible in the context of therapy, less than 0.02 mGy/MBq for the top 6 highest absorbed tissues and less than 0.007 mGy/MBq for all other tissues. Compared to that from (225)Ac, the absorbed dose from (227)Ac makes up a very small component (less than 0.04%) of the total absorbed dose delivered to the 6 highest dose tissues: red marrow, spleen, endosteal cells, liver, lungs and kidneys when accelerator produced (225/7)Ac-conjugated anti-CD33 antibody is used to treat leukemia patients. For all tissues, the dominant contributor to the absorbed dose arising from the (227)Ac is (227)Th, the first daughter of (227)Ac which has the potential to deliver absorbed dose both while it is antibody-bound and while it is free. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the absorbed dose arising from (227)Ac to normal organs would be negligible for an (225/7)Ac-labeled antibody that targets hematological cancer.",['(c) 2021.

To address this problem, we have designed a therapeutic CRISPR-Cas9 deletion system targeting BCR/ABL1. The system was efficiently electroporated to cell lines, LSCs from a CML murine model, and LSCs from CML patients at diagnosis, generating a specific ABL1 null mutation at high efficiency and allowing the edited leukemic cells to be detected and tracked. The CRISPR-Cas9 deletion system triggered cell proliferation arrest and apoptosis in murine and human CML cell lines. Patient and murine-derived xenografts with CRISPR-edited LSCs in NOD SCID gamma niches revealed that normal multipotency and repopulation ability of CRISPR edited LSCs were fully restored. Normal hematopoiesis was restored, avoiding myeloid bias. To the best of our knowledge, we show for the first time how a CRISPR-Cas9 deletion system efficiently interrupts BCR/ABL1 oncogene in primary LSCs to bestow a therapeutic benefit. This study is a proof of concept for genome editing in all those diseases, like CML, sustained by a single oncogenic event, opening up new therapeutic opportunities.",,"['Vuelta, Elena', 'Ordonez, Jose Luis', 'Alonso-Perez, Veronica', 'Mendez, Lucia', 'Hernandez-Carabias, Patricia', 'Saldana, Raquel', 'Sevilla, Julian', 'Sebastian, Elena', 'Muntion, Sandra', 'Sanchez-Guijo, Fermin', 'Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus Maria', 'Garcia-Tunon, Ignacio', 'Sanchez-Martin, Manuel']","['Vuelta E', 'Ordonez JL', 'Alonso-Perez V', 'Mendez L', 'Hernandez-Carabias P', 'Saldana R', 'Sevilla J', 'Sebastian E', 'Muntion S', 'Sanchez-Guijo F', 'Hernandez-Rivas JM', 'Garcia-Tunon I', 'Sanchez-Martin M']",,"['Unidad de Diagnostico Molecular y Celular del Cancer, Instituto Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer (USAL/CSIC), Salamanca, Spain;

We analyzed the outcomes and prognostic factors for CR to salvage therapy and overall survival (OS) of patients with R/R T-ALL included in two prospective measurable residual disease-oriented trials. Seventy-five patients (70 relapsed, 5 refractory) were identified. Relapses occurred in bone marrow, isolated or combined in 50 patients, and in the central nervous system (CNS; isolated or combined) in 20. Second CR was attained in 30/75 patients (40%). Treatment with FLAG-Ida and isolated CNS relapse were independently associated with a higher CR rate after first salvage therapy. The median OS was 6.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.9-8.6) months, with a 4-year OS probability of 18% (95% CI, 9%-27%). No differences in survival were observed according to the treatment with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients in CR after first salvage therapy. Multivariable analysis showed a >/=12-month interval between first CR and relapse, CR after first salvage therapy and isolated CNS relapse as favorable prognostic factors for OS with hazard ratios (HR) (95% CI) of 1.931 (1.109-3.362), 2.958 (1.640-5.334), and 2.976 (1.157-7.655), respectively. This study confirms the poor outcomes of adults with R/R T-ALL among whom FLAG-Ida was the best of the rescue therapies evaluated. Late relapse, CR after first rescue therapy and isolated CNS relapse showed prognostic impact on survival.

Both, cancer cells and immune cells participate in tumor initiation, growth and progression and might affect clinical outcomes. TIM-3 (T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 3), an immune checkpoint molecule, is expressed not only on immune cells but also on leukemic stem cells (LSCs) in AML. This prompted us to investigate the prognostic significance of TIM-3 in t(8;21) AML. A total of 47 t(8;21) AML patients were tested for TIM-3 expression by multi-parameter flow cytometry at diagnosis. 35 of these, who received chemotherapy alone or along with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation were followed up. The expression pattern of TIM-3 on T-cells and NK (natural killer) cells as a whole (T + NK) and LSCs were evaluated independently. High percentage of T + NK - TIM-3(+) and CD34(+)CD38(-)TIM-3(+) cells were significantly associated with a high 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) (p = 0.028, 0.016). Further, concurrent high frequencies of T + NK-TIM-3(+) and CD34(+)CD38(-)TIM-3(+) cells at diagnosis were significantly associated with a high 2-year CIR (p < 0.0001) and this together with c-KIT D816 mutation were the independent adverse prognostic factors for relapse (hazard ratio (HR)=2.5, [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-6.0], p = 0.04; HR = 46.5, [95% CI, 2.7-811.5], p = 0.009).

Therefore, measuring DNA breaks at rearrangement-participating regions can provide a unique tool to identify and characterize susceptible individuals. Here, we developed a highly sensitive and low-input DNA break mapping method, the first of its kind for patient samples. We then measured genome-wide DNA breakage in normal cells of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with KMT2A (previously MLL) rearrangements, compared to that of nonfusion AML individuals, as a means to evaluate individual susceptibility to gene rearrangements. DNA breakage at the KMT2A gene region was significantly greater in fusion-driven remission individuals, as compared to nonfusion individuals. Moreover, we identified select topoisomerase II (TOP2)-sensitive and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)/cohesin-binding sites with preferential DNA breakage in fusion-driven patients. Importantly, measuring DSBs at these sites, in addition to the KMT2A gene region, provided greater predictive power when assessing individual break susceptibility. We also demonstrated that low-dose etoposide exposure further elevated DNA breakage at these regions in fusion-driven AML patients, but not in nonfusion patients, indicating that these sites are preferentially sensitive to TOP2 activity in fusion-driven AML patients. These results support that mapping of DSBs in patients enables discovery of novel break-prone regions and monitoring of individuals susceptible to chromosomal abnormalities, and thus cancer. This will build the foundation for early detection of cancer-susceptible individuals, as well as those preferentially susceptible to therapy-related malignancies caused by treatment with TOP2 poisons.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Atkin, Naomi D', 'Raimer, Heather M', 'Wang, Zhenjia', 'Zang, Chongzhi', 'Wang, Yuh-Hwa']","['Atkin ND', 'Raimer HM', 'Wang Z', 'Zang C', 'Wang YH']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5983-0621', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7415-6011', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9804-9368']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.', 'Center for Public Health Genomics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.', 'Center for Public Health Genomics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.', 'Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 GM101192/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32GM008136/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA044579/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008136/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA009109/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RO1GM101192/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009109/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['CTCF', 'DNA fragility', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'cohesin', 'topoisomerase']",2021/08/19 06:00,2021/08/19 06:00,['2021/08/18 06:47'],"['2021/08/12 00:00 [revised]', '2021/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/12/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/19 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/18 06:47 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.22993 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2021 Dec;60(12):808-821. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22993.

The resulting signals from (2) H-labelled glucose, lactate, and water were quantified using a spectral fitting algorithm implemented on the Oxford Spectroscopy Analysis MATLAB toolbox. After scanning, the cells were processed for histological stains (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase UTP nick end labelling and haematoxylin and eosin) to assess apoptotic area fraction and cell morphology respectively, while a colorimetric assay was used to measure extracellular lactate concentrations in the supernatant. Significantly lower levels of (2) H-labelled lactate were observed in the 48 h treated cells compared with the untreated and 24 h treated cells, and these changes were significantly correlated with an increase in apoptotic fraction and a decrease in extracellular lactate. By establishing the biological processes associated with treatment-induced changes in the (2) H-labelled lactate signal, these findings suggest that (2) H MRS of lactate may be valuable in evaluating early tumour response.","['(c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Tan, Josephine L', 'Djayakarsana, Daniel', 'Wang, Hanzhi', 'Chan, Rachel W', 'Bailey, Colleen', 'Lau, Angus Z']","['Tan JL', 'Djayakarsana D', 'Wang H', 'Chan RW', 'Bailey C', 'Lau AZ']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2437-1044', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9604-394X']","['Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Physical Sciences Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Physical Sciences Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Physical Sciences Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Canada.', 'Physical Sciences Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Physical Sciences Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Physics, Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Physical Sciences Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,NMR Biomed,NMR in biomedicine,8915233,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Warburg effect', '*deuterium (2H) MRS', '*treatment response', '*tumour lactate']",2021/08/19 06:00,2021/08/19 06:00,['2021/08/18 06:46'],"['2021/07/20 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/19 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/18 06:46 [entrez]']",['10.1002/nbm.4599 [doi]'],ppublish,NMR Biomed. 2021 Dec;34(12):e4599. doi: 10.1002/nbm.4599.

Here, we investigated the impact of TP53 gene mutations on prognosis of ATL treated in different ways. Among 177 patients, we identified 47 single nucleotide variants or insertion-deletions (SNVs/indels) of the TP53 gene in 37 individuals. TP53 copy number variations (CNVs) were observed in 38 patients. Altogether, 67 of 177 patients harboured TP53 SNVs/indels or TP53 CNVs, and were categorized as having TP53 mutations. In the entire cohort, median survival of patients with and without TP53 mutations was 1.0 and 6.7 years respectively (P < 0.001). After allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), median survival of patients with (n = 16) and without (n = 29) TP53 mutations was 0.4 years and not reached respectively (P = 0.001). For patients receiving mogamulizumab without allogeneic HSCT, the median survival from the first dose of antibody in patients with TP53 mutations (n = 27) was only 0.9 years, but 5.1 years in those without (n = 42; P < 0.001). Thus, TP53 mutations are associated with unfavourable prognosis of ATL, regardless of treatment strategy. The establishment of alternative modalities to overcome the adverse impact of TP53 mutations in patients with ATL is required.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

However, the patterns and prognostic significance of the expression of RhoD subfamily in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remain unknown. Here, we detected the expressions of RhoD subfamily genes in AML on the basis of several published datasets and analyzed the survival of RhoD subfamily across the TCGA profiles and in a GEO series. We found that the expression of RhoF, but not RhoD, increased in AML patients in TCGA and GEO (all P<0.001); the survival analysis of two independent cohorts demonstrated that higher RhoF expression was significantly associated with poorer overall survival (OS) (P<0.001), whereas RhoD expression had no significant effect on OS in patients with AML (P>0.05); the subgroup analysis showed that high RhoF expression was correlated with poor 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS (P<0.05 for all); upregulated RhoF expression had a more significant prognostic value for OS in the younger patients (age<60), the intensive chemotherapy group, and wild-type groups (IDH1, NRAS, and TP53) (P<0.05 for all). Multivariate analysis indicated high RhoF expression as a strongly independent unfavorable prognostic factor for OS in patients without transplantation (P<0.05). Furthermore, a higher RhoF expression was closely associated with an older age, intermediate-/poor-risk cytogenetics and mutations in IDH1, NRAS, and TP53. RhoF expression was negatively correlated with BM blasts (P=0.020) and WBC (P=0.003).

Therefore, it is necessary to identify the unique features of LSCs in relapsing and drug-resistant leukemia and also to explore the drugs that directed at these features. Our clinical data have indicated that relapsed patients with acute myeloid leukemia have more abundant proportion of LSCs with enhanced breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression when compared to the untreated patients. The results showed that compared with LSCs derived from sensitive K562 cells, LSCs from drug-resistant K562/ADM cells have much higher chemotherapeutic resistance, and so we termed these cells as ""drug-resistant LSCs"". Subsequently, aberrant activation of NF-kappaB pathway in drug-resistant LSCs was further using gene chip analysis. Also, parthenolide (PTL), which is a specific NF-kappaB inhibitor, effectively eliminated drug-resistant LSCs and enhanced the sensitivity of K562/ADM cells to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis by down-regulating NF-kappaB pathway-mediated P-gp expression.

Mechanisms genomic variations serve an important function for the pathogenesis of many cancer types. Pleckstrin and sec7 domain-containing 3 (PSD3), also known as EFA6R, was shown to be associated with some cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia, breast cancer metastasis, and astrocytoma. But it was unknown that whether PSD3 took effect and how did it work in thyroid cancer. Methods: We guessed that PSD3 might play an important role in thyroid cancer by consulting previous literature. Then, we analyzed the level of PSD3 expression in thyroid malignancy and the connection with clinical manifestation in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). And RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRt-PCR) of 40 pairs of local samples were done to verify the result of TCGA. Then, PSD3 was knocked down by small interfering RNA (siRNA) for flowing functional experiments. Results: Bioinformatics and qRt-PCR analysis shown PSD3 was overexpressed in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and connected with the histological type (P=0.009) and risk of lymph node metastasis (P=0.016). In vitro assays, we confirmed that down-regulation PSD3 could not only suppress the cell proliferation, colony formation, cell migration, cell invasion, and G1/S cell cycle transition but also promote apoptosis in PTC cells.

We investigated frequency and factors associated with RTW in a cohort of patients younger than 66 years, with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM), uniformly treated with a bortezomib-based induction followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Socio-economic and working status data were collected by a self-administered questionnaire. One hundred and eighty-six patients entered the study.

Previous studies mainly focused on the role of protein-coding genes in cancer cell proliferation. Emerging evidence showed that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) also play critical roles in cancer cell proliferation and growth. LncRNA KCNQ1OT1 is found to contribute to carcinogenesis, but its role in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is unclear. In this study, by analyzing data from Gene Expression Omnibus, The Cancer Genome Atlas database and our clinical samples, we found that KCNQ1OT1 was selectively highly expressed in APL. Functional assays demonstrated that knockdown of KCNQ1OT1 reduced APL cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. Further evidence showed that KCNQ1OT1 was mainly located in the cytoplasm of APL patient-derived NB4 cells and APL patient bone marrow samples. Mechanistically, KCNQ1OT1 bound to RNA binding protein FUS, and silencing either KCNQ1OT1 or FUS reduced the expression level and stability of MAP3K1 mRNA. Whereas KCNQ1OT1 and FUS did not affect each other. Importantly, knockdown of MAP3K1 impaired APL cell proliferation. Finally, c-Myc transactivated KCNQ1OT1 in APL cells through binding to its promoter while knockdown of c-Myc decreased KCNQ1OT1 expression. Our results not only revealed that c-Myc transactivated KCNQ1OT1 and upregulated KCNQ1OT1 promoted APL cell proliferation, but also demonstrated that KCNQ1OT1 bound to FUS to synergistically stabilize MAP3K1 mRNA, thus facilitating APL cell proliferation. This study established a previously unidentified role of KCNQ1OT1 in the development of APL, and KCNQ1OT1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for APL.",['(c) 2021.

Herein, we harnessed a dietary molecule resveratrol (RES)-responsive transactivator and a transrepressor to develop a repressible transgene expression (RESrep) device and an inducible transgene expression (RESind) device, respectively. After optimization, these tools enabled the control of CAR expression and CAR-mediated antitumor function in engineered human cells. We demonstrated that a resveratrol-repressible CAR expression (RESrep-CAR) device can effectively inhibit T cell activation upon resveratrol administration in primary T cells and a xenograft tumor mouse model. Additionally, we exhibit how a resveratrol-inducible CAR expression (RESind-CAR) device can achieve fine-tuned and reversible control over T cell activation via a resveratrol-titratable mechanism. Furthermore, our results revealed that the presence of RES can activate RESind-CAR T cells with strong anticancer cytotoxicity against cells in vitro and in vivo.

To enhance analyses of survival trends, we present the joinpoint survival model webtool (JPSurv) that analyzes survival data by single year of diagnosis and estimates changes in survival trends and year-over-year trend measures. METHODS: We apply JPSurv to relative survival data for individuals diagnosed with female breast cancer, melanoma cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) between 1975 and 2015 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. We estimate the number and location of joinpoints and the trend measures and provide interpretation. RESULTS: In general, relative survival has substantially improved at least since the mid-1990s for all cancer sites. The largest improvements in 5-year relative survival were observed for distant-stage melanoma after 2009, which increased by almost 3 survival percentage points for each subsequent year of diagnosis, followed by CML in 1995-2010, and NHL in 1995-2003. The modeling also showed that for patients diagnosed with CML after 1995 (compared with before), there was a greater decrease in the probability of dying of the disease in the 4th and 5th years after diagnosis compared with the initial years since diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The greatest increases in trends for distant melanoma, NHL, and CML coincided with the introduction of novel treatments, demonstrating the value of JPSurv for estimating and interpreting cancer survival trends.

However, allo-HSCT is frequently accompanied by a serious side effect: graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The clinical use of allo-HSCT is limited by the inability of current immunosuppressive regimens to adequately control GvHD without impairing the graft-versus-leukemia effect (GvL) conferred by transplanted healthy immune cells. To address this, the authors have developed an engineered type 1 regulatory T-cell product called CD4(IL-10) cells. CD4(IL-10) cells are obtained through lentiviral transduction, which delivers the human IL10 gene into purified polyclonal CD4(+) T cells. CD4(IL-10) cells may provide an advantage over standard-of-care immunosuppressants because of the ability to suppress GvHD through continuous secretion of IL-10 and enhance the GvL effect in myeloid malignancies through targeted killing of malignant myeloid cells. METHODS: Here the authors established a production process aimed at current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) production for CD4(IL-10) cells. RESULTS: The authors demonstrated that the CD4(IL-10) cell product maintains the suppressive and cytotoxic functions of previously described CD4(IL-10) cells. In addition, RNA sequencing analysis of CD4(IL-10) identified novel transcriptome changes, indicating that CD4(IL-10) cells primarily upregulate cytotoxicity-related genes. These include four molecules with described roles in CD8(+) T and natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity: CD244, KLRD1, KLRC1 and FASLG. Finally, it was shown that CD4(IL-10) cells upregulate IL-22, which mediates wound healing and tissue repair, particularly in the gut. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these results pave the way toward clinical translation of the cGMP-optimized CD4(IL-10) cell product and uncover new molecules that have a role in the clinical application of CD4(IL-10) cells.","['Copyright (c) 2021 International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy.

The objective of this review is to provide a practical guide to address key aspects of performing and utilizing chimerism testing results. In developing this guide, we conducted a survey of testing practices among laboratories that are accredited for performing engraftment monitoring/chimerism analysis by either the American Society for Histocompatibility & Immunogenetics (ASHI) and/or the European Federation of Immunogenetics (EFI). We interpreted the survey results in the light of pertinent literature as well as the experience in the laboratories of the authors. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: In recent years there has been significant advances in high throughput molecular methods such as next generation sequencing (NGS) as well as growing access to these technologies in histocompatibility and immunogenetics laboratories. These methods have the potential to improve the performance of chimerism testing in terms of sensitivity, availability of informative genetic markers that distinguish donors from recipients as well as cost. SUMMARY: The results of the survey revealed a great deal of heterogeneity in chimerism testing practices among participating laboratories. The most consistent response indicated monitoring of engraftment within the first 30days. These responses are reflective of published literature. Additional clinical indications included early detection of impending relapse as well as identification of cases of HLA-loss relapse.","['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Different scores have been designed to predict the prognosis of these patients. The objective of this study was to assess which score or combination has better outcome predictive capacity. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients with AML and MDS who received a first peripheral blood allo-transplant in a single center, between December 2001 and October 2019. Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI), European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) and Disease Risk Index (DRI) scores were calculated. For each score and for the HCT-CI/DRI and HCT-CI/EBMT combinations, overall survival (OS), cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), non-relapse-related mortality (NRM), and graft versus host disease-free relapse-free survival (GRFS) were analyzed. RESULTS: 175 patients were evaluated. With a median (range) follow-up of 3.96 (0.32-17.22) years, the 5-year probabilities (95% CI) of OS, CIR, NRM, and GRFS were 36% (28%-44%), 28% (21%-35%), 38% (30%-46%) and 24% (17%-31%), respectively. For OS, only the DRI score selected two groups with statistically significant differences (DRI 0-1: 41% vs. DRI >/=2: 24%; p=0.011). The combination of DRI 0-1 and HCT-CI 0-2 showed OS probabilities of 45% vs. 26% for those with DRI 0-1 and HCT-CI >/=3; p=0.041. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with AML and MDS submitted to allo-transplant, the combination of HCT-CI and DRI scores provided the best stratification for OS.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

The quality of life (QoL) of transplanted children and their parents has been little studied and should help physicians better manage these patients. The objectives of the study were to assess: (1) the QoL of transplanted children and parents and compare it with that of children with other chronic conditions associated with long-term consequences, and (2) potential variables modulating the QoL. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed in a multidisciplinary paediatric unit (Timone Hospital, Marseille, France). Children were less than 18 years old; had a liver, kidney or heart transplant; and had a time since transplantation of 1-10 years. Socio-demographics and clinical data were recorded from medical forms. The QoL was assessed using the VSP-A (Vecu et Sante Percue de l'Adolescent et de l'Enfant) and the WhoQoL self-reported questionnaires. RESULTS: Forty-five families were included (response rate: 76%). The transplanted organs were the liver for 20 children, the kidney for 15 children, and the heart for 10 children. The QoL of transplanted children reported by their parents was better than that of children with inborn errors of metabolism and similar to that of childhood leukaemia survivors. The QoL of parents of transplanted children was better than that of parents of children with inborn errors of metabolism and did not differ from French norms. The QoL did not differ according to the nature of the transplanted organ, sex or the main sociodemographic data. The main modulators decreasing QoL were residual treatment level, medications switch and the presence of another regular treatment. CONCLUSION: Transplanted children and their families reported a fairly preserved QoL compared to children with other chronic health conditions.

A bite from this spider can cause a range of clinical manifestations, anywhere from a painless papular lesion to life-threatening reactions. We report a possible spider bite presenting as leukostasis initially suspected to be acute leukemia. A 22-year-old female patient presented to the emergency department with confusion and right upper arm pain, redness, and swelling after a suspected spider bite. Initial labs showed WBC count of 103.5x10e3/microL, hemoglobin of 3.3 g/dL, positive Direct Coombs' test, creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL, transaminitis, and lactic acid of 20 mmol/L. Acute leukemia with leukostasis was suspected. She was started emergently on hydroxyurea in conjunction with prophylaxis for tumor lysis syndrome. However, peripheral smear showed left-shifted granulocytosis with lymphocytosis, monocytosis, and no blast cells or evidence of myelodysplasia. Bone marrow aspirate showed mildly hypercellular marrow with myeloid hyperplasia and no myelodysplasia. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed a left-shifted myeloid maturation pattern with 0.3% myeloblasts. BCR-ABL1 and JAK2 testing was negative. Hence, she had no evidence of leukemia but rather had leukostasis from a spider bite. Hydroxyurea was stopped and follow-up labs normalized. Sphingomyelinase D in the brown recluse spider venom is unique to Loxosceles and Sicarius and may be responsible for the unique clinical presentation of loxoscelism. The presentation of hyperleukocytosis complicated by shock with an unclear history poses a diagnostic challenge.

Methods: The clinical data of adult patients with non-high-risk APL who were first diagnosed and admitted to the Henan Provincial People's Hospital from January 2009 to December 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients were divided into triple-induction group and double-induction group according to the treatment. The general data of patients, blood routine, coagulation function changes and blood transfusions during the induction period were collected, and the complete remission rate, early mortality and prognosis of two groups were analyzed. Results: A total of 164 patients were enrolled, including 86 males and 78 females, and the M(Q1,Q3) of their age was 41(18, 70) years. Among them, 75 were in triple-induction group and 89 in double-induction group. The white blood cell(WBC) counts of triple-induction group on day 7th and 14th after induction were (9.49+/-6.10)x10(9)/L and (5.43+/-3.97)x10(9)/L, while those in double-induction group were (15.17+/-17.06)x10(9)/L and (13.37+/-12.59)x10(9)/L, the differences were statistically significant (both P<0.05). In addition, the peak of WBC in the triple-induction group was lower than that in the double-induction group [13.8(6.3,89.7)x10(9)/L vs 19.2(3.8,112.8)x10(9)/L, P=0.019]. On day 7th after induction, the platelet(PLT) counts in the triple-induction group was lower than that in the double-induction group [27(11,147)x10(9)/L vs 45(8, 183)x10(9)/L, P=0.014]. However, the difference was not statistically significant in PLT counts between the two groups on day 14th, 21st and 28th, or in PLT transfusions during induction (all P>0.05). After treatment, it was observed only in a few patients of two groups that the prothrombin time(PT) elongation >/=3 s and/or activated partial thromboplastin time(APTT) elongation >/=10 s, and the difference was not statistically significant (all P>0.05). The incidence of induced differentiation syndrome in the triple-induction group was lower than that in the double-induction group (2.7% vs 12.4%, P=0.022) The early mortality rate was lower than that in the double-induction group (1.3% vs 5.6%), but the difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in the early complete remission rate, genetic remission rate, molecular remission rate, relapse rate, overall survival (OS) rate and disease-free survival (DFS) rate between the two groups.

As a regional referral center for patients with acute leukemia, those who are suspected of having APL are often transferred to our facility. However, many referring centers are unable to initiate treatment using ATRA. We conducted an exploratory analysis of the clinical availability of ATRA and the factors limiting access to this critical drug. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The United States was divided into 6 geographic regions: Northwest, Southwest, Central, Southeast, Northeast, and the Great Lakes. Twenty hospitals were randomly selected from states within each of these regions and were surveyed as to whether they typically treated patients with acute leukemia, the availability of ATRA at their institution, and reported reasons for not stocking ATRA (if not available). RESULTS: Less than one-third of hospitals queried (31%) had ATRA in stock. Neither the size of the hospital nor the hospital's status as academic versus nonacademic (53% vs 31%; P=.08) influenced ATRA availability. Of the hospitals that referred patients with APL, only 14% (7/49) had ATRA readily available. Hospitals that treated patients with APL were more likely to have ATRA available than referring centers (58% vs 14%; P=.000002). CONCLUSIONS: Nearly two-thirds of the hospitals surveyed that cared for patients with acute leukemia do not have ATRA immediately available. Moreover, the vast majority of hospitals that refer patients to other centers do not have ATRA. These findings should spur investigation into the impact of immediate ATRA availability on the morbidity and mortality of patients with APL. A call by hematologists nationwide to their formulary committees is warranted to ensure that this lifesaving medication is available to patients suspected of having APL.",,"['Geer, Marcus J', 'Foucar, Charles E', 'Devata, Sumana', 'Benitez, Lydia', 'Perissinotti, Anthony J', 'Marini, Bernard L', 'Bixby, Dale']","['Geer MJ', 'Foucar CE', 'Devata S', 'Benitez L', 'Perissinotti AJ', 'Marini BL', 'Bixby D']",,"['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Michigan Medicine and University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Michigan Medicine and University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and.', 'Department of Pharmacy Services and Clinical Science, Michigan Medicine, and University of Michigan College of Pharmacy, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Department of Pharmacy Services and Clinical Science, Michigan Medicine, and University of Michigan College of Pharmacy, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Department of Pharmacy Services and Clinical Science, Michigan Medicine, and University of Michigan College of Pharmacy, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Michigan Medicine and University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,101162515,IM,,,2021/08/18 06:00,2021/08/18 06:00,['2021/08/17 20:28'],"['2020/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2021/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/17 20:28 [entrez]', '2021/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.6004/jnccn.2021.7013 [doi]', 'jnccn20455 [pii]']",aheadofprint,J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2021 Aug 17. pii: jnccn20455. doi: 10.6004/jnccn.2021.7013.,20210817,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) of BCR-ABL1 have emerged as the predominant cause of acquired resistance. In approximately 30% of patients, the mechanism of resistance to TKIs remains elusive. This study aimed to investigate mechanisms of nonmutational resistance in Ph(+) ALL. Here we report the development of a nonmutational resistance cell line SupB15-RT; conferring resistance to approved ABL kinase inhibitors (AKIs) and allosteric inhibitors GNF-2, ABL001, and crizotinib, except for dasatinib (IC90 50nM), a multitarget kinase inhibitor. We found that the AKT/mTOR pathway is activated in these cells and their proliferation inhibited by Torin-1 with an IC50 of 24.7 nM. These observations were confirmed using 3 different ALL patient-derived long term cultures (PDLTCs): (1) HP (BCR-ABL1 negative), (2) PH (BCR-ABL1 positive and responsive to TKIs) and (3) BV (BCR-ABL1 positive and nonmutational resistant to TKIs). Furthermore, Torin-1 and NVP-BEZ235 induced apoptosis in PH and BV cells but not in HP cells. Our experiments provide evidence of the involvement of AKT/mTOR pathway in the evolution of nonmutational resistance in Ph(+) ALL which will assist in developing novel targeted therapy for Ph(+) ALL patients with BCR-ABL1 independent nonmutational resistance.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

Moreover, the Treg content in stem cells harvested from PB has been suggested to be correlated with acute graft versus-host-disease (aGVHD) and immunologic recovery after allogeneic PB stem cell transplantation (allo-PBSCT). This study aimed to investigate the impact of the graft content of Tregs, as graft CD3(+)/Tregs ratio (gCD3/TregsR), on acute GVHD and post-allo-PBSCT outcomes. We prospectively enrolled 94 consecutive patients at 9 Italian centers of the Gruppo Italiano Trapianto di Midollo Osseo (GITMO) with acute myelogenous (n = 71; 75%) or lymphoblastic (n = 23; 25%) leukemia in complete remission who underwent matched related donor (n = 35; 37%) or unrelated donor (n = 59; 63%) allo-PBSCT. The median graft CD3(+) cell, Treg, and gCD3/TregsR values were 196 x 10(6)/kg body weight (range, 17 to 666 x 10(6)/kg), 3 x 10(6)/kg (range, 0.1 to 35 x 10(6)/kg), and 71 (range, 1 to 1883), respectively. The discriminatory power of the gCD3/TregsR value to predict grade >/=II aGVHD was assessed by estimating the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Any grade and grade >/=II aGVHD occurred in 24 (26%) and 17 (18%) allo-PBSCT recipients, respectively. By ROC analysis, AUC (0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.608 to 0.866; P = .002) identified 70 as the optimal gCD3/TregsR cutoff value predicting the appearance of grade >/=II aGVHD with 76% sensitivity and 71% specificity. Patients were subdivided into a high (ROC curve value >/=70) gCD3/TregsR group (HR; n = 48) and a low (ROC curve value <70) gCD3/TregsR group (LR; n = 46). The incidence of grade II-IV aGVHD was lower in the LR group compared with the HR group (9% [4 of 46] versus 27% [13 of 48]) in both univariate analysis (odds ratio [OR], 4.8; 95% CI, 1.44 to 16.17; P = .015) and multivariate analysis (OR, 5.0; 95% CI, 1.34 to 18.93; P = .017), whereas no differences were documented taking into account aGVHD of any grade. The overall survival, disease-free survival, nonrelapse mortality, and relapse rates at 2 and 3 years were 61% and 54%, 62% and 55%, 15% and 23%, and 27% and 30%, respectively. Of note, gCD3/TregsR did not significantly correlate with relapse (P = .135). Taken together, our data from this prospective multicenter study confirm the value of Tregs in preventing aGVHD while maintaining the graft-versus-leukemia effect.

Because results of this therapy are poor, it has been progressively replaced with new specific regimens with better efficacy profiles (GELA protocol for MCL, BURKIMAB for BL, and PETHEMA for B-cell and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL]). The objective of this study was to analyze the response rates and survival of these therapeutic regimens. This retrospective and descriptive observational study of 81 patients compared 42 patients treated with hyper-CVAD/methotrexate-cytarabine (group A) with 39 patients treated with GELA/BURKIMAB/PETHEMA (group B). More patients in group B than in group A completed the treatment (89.7% vs. 47.6%, p < 0.001). In group A, 14.3% did not complete treatment because of death compared with 7.7% in group B, and 29% in group A had cycle delays versus 6.7% in group B (p < 0.001). In group A, 78.6% of group A achieved a complete response (CR) compared with 94.9% of group B (p = 0.050). Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were significantly higher in group B (p < 0.001 in both cases). Data for current therapeutic protocols have indicated superior efficacy, with higher complete response rates, as well as better disease-free survival and overall survival results. This article provides the best results in terms of the efficacy of treatment of four hematological malignancies (MCL, BL, B-cell ALL, and T-cell ALL) with the most current specific therapeutic regimens (GELA for MCL, BURKIMAB for BL, and PETHEMA for B-cell ALL and T-cell ALL) with respect to a classic general protocol (H-CVAD/MTX-AraC for all four). These results may represent a great advance in the treatment of these blood cancers, achieving an important long-term benefit for these hematological patients.","['Copyright (c) 2021 ISEH -- Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) activates signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) precursors via uterine LIF receptors (LIFRs), allowing successful blastocyst implantation. Our recent study revealed that the role of epithelial STAT3 is different from that of stromal STAT3. However, both are essential for blastocyst attachment, suggesting the different roles of epithelial and stromal LIFR in blastocyst implantation. However, how epithelial and stromal LIFR regulate the blastocyst implantation process remains unclear. To investigate the roles of LIFR in the uterine epithelium and stroma, we generated Lifr-floxed/lactoferrin (Ltf)-iCre (Lifr eKO) and Lifr-floxed/antimullerian hormone receptor type 2 (Amhr2)-Cre (Lifr sKO) mice with deleted epithelial and stromal LIFR, respectively. Surprisingly, fertility and blastocyst implantation in the Lifr sKO mice were normal despite stromal STAT3 inactivation. In contrast, blastocyst attachment failed, and no implantation chambers were formed in the Lifr eKO mice with epithelial inactivation of STAT3. In addition, normal responsiveness to ovarian hormones was observed in the peri-implantation uteri of the Lifr eKO mice. These results indicate that the epithelial LIFR-STAT3 pathway initiates the formation of implantation chambers, leading to complete blastocyst attachment, and that stromal STAT3 regulates blastocyst attachment without stromal LIFR control. Thus, uterine epithelial LIFR is critical to implantation chamber formation and blastocyst attachment.","['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

Determining the role of cell-extrinsic regulators of leukemic cells is vital to gain clinical insights into the biology of AML. Iron is a key extrinsic regulator of cancer, but its systemic regulation remains poorly explored in AML. To address this question, we studied iron metabolism in patients with AML at diagnosis and explored the mechanisms involved using the syngeneic MLL-AF9-induced AML mouse model. We found that AML is a disorder with a unique iron profile, not associated with inflammation or transfusion, characterized by high ferritin, low transferrin, high transferrin saturation (TSAT), and high hepcidin. The increased TSAT in particular, contrasts with observations in other cancer types and in anemia of inflammation. Using the MLL-AF9 mouse model of AML, we demonstrated that the AML-induced loss of erythroblasts is responsible for iron redistribution and increased TSAT. We also show that AML progression is delayed in mouse models of systemic iron overload and that elevated TSAT at diagnosis is independently associated with increased overall survival in AML. We suggest that TSAT may be a relevant prognostic marker in AML.",['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Lopes, Marta', 'Duarte, Tiago L', 'Teles, Maria J', 'Mosteo, Laura', 'Chacim, Sergio', 'Aguiar, Eliana', 'Pereira-Reis, Joana', 'Oliveira, Monica', 'Silva, Andre M N', 'Goncalves, Nuno', 'Martins, Gabriela', 'Kong, Isabella Y', 'Zethoven, Magnus', 'Vervoort, Stephin', 'Martins, Sandra', 'Quintela, Miguel', 'Hawkins, Edwin D', 'Trigo, Fernanda', 'Guimaraes, Joao T', 'Mariz, Jose M', 'Porto, Graca', 'Duarte, Delfim']","['Lopes M', 'Duarte TL', 'Teles MJ', 'Mosteo L', 'Chacim S', 'Aguiar E', 'Pereira-Reis J', 'Oliveira M', 'Silva AMN', 'Goncalves N', 'Martins G', 'Kong IY', 'Zethoven M', 'Vervoort S', 'Martins S', 'Quintela M', 'Hawkins ED', 'Trigo F', 'Guimaraes JT', 'Mariz JM', 'Porto G', 'Duarte D']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6762-4844', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4901-4580', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8281-1146', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6316-8789', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0823-4891', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5554-7714', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4174-9320', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1367-8852', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6528-891X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7459-126X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4836-6311', 'ORCID: 000-0003-0240-4749', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3476-0211']","['Instituto de Investigacao e Inovacao em Saude (i3S), Universidade do Porto, Porto, Portugal.', 'Instituto de Investigacao e Inovacao em Saude (i3S), Universidade do Porto, Porto, Portugal.', 'Instituto de Investigacao e Inovacao em Saude (i3S), Universidade do Porto, Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Centro Hospitalar Universitario Sao Joao, Porto, Portugal.', 'Instituto de Investigacao e Inovacao em Saude (i3S), Universidade do Porto, Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Onco-Hematology, Instituto Portugues de Oncologia (IPO)-Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Centro Hospitalar Universitario Sao Joao, Porto, Portugal.', 'Instituto de Investigacao e Inovacao em Saude (i3S), Universidade do Porto, Porto, Portugal.', 'Instituto de Investigacao e Inovacao em Saude (i3S), Universidade do Porto, Porto, Portugal.', 'REQUIMITE-LAQV, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Faculdade de Ciencias da Universidade do Porto (FCUP), Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, IPO, Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, IPO, Porto, Portugal.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Bioinformatics Core Facility, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, The University of Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Centro Hospitalar Universitario Sao Joao, Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Onco-Hematology, Instituto Portugues de Oncologia (IPO)-Porto, Portugal.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Centro Hospitalar Universitario Sao Joao, Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Centro Hospitalar Universitario Sao Joao, Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Biomedicine, Unit of Biochemistry, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade do Porto, Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Onco-Hematology, Instituto Portugues de Oncologia (IPO)-Porto, Portugal.', 'Instituto de Investigacao e Inovacao em Saude (i3S), Universidade do Porto, Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Molecular Pathology and Immunology, Instituto de Ciencias Biomedicas Abel Salazar, Universidade do Porto, Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Hematology, Centro Hospitalar Universitario do Porto, Porto, Portugal; and.', 'Instituto de Investigacao e Inovacao em Saude (i3S), Universidade do Porto, Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Onco-Hematology, Instituto Portugues de Oncologia (IPO)-Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Biomedicine, Unit of Biochemistry, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade do Porto, Porto, Portugal.', 'Porto Comprehensive Cancer Center, Porto, Portugal.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,,,2021/08/18 06:00,2021/09/14 06:00,['2021/08/17 12:21'],"['2021/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/17 12:21 [entrez]', '2021/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(21)00400-6 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2021004373 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2021 Aug 24;5(16):3102-3112. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2021004373.,,20210913,"['0 (Transferrin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']","['*Anemia', 'Animals', 'Erythroblasts', 'Humans', 'Iron', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Mice', 'Transferrin']",PMC8405200,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The investigation of BAG1 isoforms expression and intracellular localization in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) patient-derived specimens revealed that BAG1 levels decrease during disease remission, compared to diagnosis, but drastically increase at relapse. In particular, at diagnosis both BAG1-L and BAG1-M isoforms are mainly nuclear, while during remission the localization pattern changes, having BAG1-M almost exclusively in the cytosol indicating its potential cytoprotective role in B-ALL. In addition, knockdown of BAG1/BAG3 induces cell apoptosis and G1-phase cell cycle arrest and, more intriguingly, shapes cell response to chemotherapy. BAG1-depleted cells show an increased sensitivity to the common chemotherapeutic agents, dexamethasone or daunorubicin, and to the BCL2 inhibitor ABT-737. Moreover, the BAG1 inhibitor Thio-2 induces a cytotoxic effect on RS4;11 cells both in vitro and in a zebrafish xenograft model and strongly synergizes with pan-BCL inhibitors. Collectively, these data sustain BAG1 deregulation as a critical event in assuring survival advantage to B-ALL cells.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Currently, its evaluation is based on quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (Q-RT-PCR). Digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) was successfully applied to several haematological malignancies. We analyzed 98 samples from 40 Ph+ ALL cases, the majority enrolled in the GIMEMA LAL2116 trial: 10 diagnostic samples and 88 follow-up samples, mostly focusing on positive non-quantifiable (PNQ) or negative samples by Q-RT-PCR to investigate the value of ddPCR for MRD monitoring. DdPCR BCR/ABL1 assay showed good sensitivity and accuracy to detect low levels of transcripts, with a high rate of reproducibility. The analysis of PNQ or negative cases by Q-RT-PCR revealed that ddPCR increased the proportion of quantifiable samples (p < 0.0001). Indeed, 29/54 PNQ samples (53.7%) proved positive and quantifiable by ddPCR, whereas 13 (24.1%) were confirmed as PNQ by ddPCR and 12 (22.2%) proved negative. Among 24 Q-RT-PCR-negative samples, 13 (54.1%) were confirmed negative, four (16.7%) resulted PNQ and seven (29.2%) proved positive and quantifiable by ddPCR. Four of 5 patients, evaluated at different time points, who were negative by Q-RT-PCR and positive by ddPCR experienced a relapse.

However, little is known about these patients' perceptions of prognosis and how this relates to emotional well-being (EWB). METHODS: We conducted a prospective, observational study of 50 adult patients with AML initiating chemotherapy, and surveyed them longitudinally for 6 months about their prognosis, treatment goals, quality of life, and EWB (by FACT-G). We derived a prognostic estimate for each patient based on data from published trials summarized in National Comprehensive Care Network Guidelines. We used descriptive statistics and longitudinal modeling to test the hypothesis that more accurate prognostic awareness is associated with worse EWB. RESULTS: Most patients (n = 43; 86%) had an objectively poor prognosis attributable to relapsed disease, complex karyotype, or FLT3 mutation. Yet, 74% of patients reported expecting a 50% or greater chance of cure. Patients with a poor prognosis more often had discordant prognostic estimates, compared to those with favorable risk AML (OR = 7.25, 95% CI 1.21, 43.37). Patient-reported prognostic estimates did not vary significantly over time. At baseline, patients who better understood their prognosis had worse EWB and overall quality-of-life scores (EWB 12 vs. 19.5; p = 0.01; FACT-G 65 vs. 75.5; p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Patients with AML overestimate their prognosis, and awareness of a poor prognosis is associated with worse emotional well-being. Efforts are needed to improve patients' understanding of their prognosis, and to provide more psychosocial support and attention to well-being as part of high-quality leukemia care.","['(c) 2021.

Acute kidney injury is a complication of CAR T-cell therapy that can result in kidney failure. In most cases, it is thought to be related to hemodynamic changes due to cytokine release syndrome. Kidney biopsy in this clinical scenario is usually not performed. We report on a kidney transplant recipient in his 40s who developed a posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder of B-cell origin refractory to conventional treatments and received anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy as compassionate treatment. Beginning on day 12 after CAR T-cell infusion, in the absence of clinical symptoms, a progressive decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate of the kidney graft occurred. A subsequent allograft biopsy showed mild tubulointerstitial lymphocyte infiltrates, falling into a Banff borderline-changes category and resembling an acute immunoallergic tubulointerstitial nephritis. Neither CAR T cells nor lymphomatous B cells were detected within the graft cellular infiltrates, suggesting an indirect mechanism of kidney injury. Although kidney graft function partially recovered after steroid therapy, the posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder progressed and the patient died 7 months later.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.'],"['Melilli, Edoardo', 'Mussetti, Alberto', 'Linares, Gabriela Sanz', 'Ruella, Marco', 'La Salette, Charette', 'Savchenko, Alexandre', 'Taco, Maria Del Rosario', 'Montero, Nuria', 'Grinyo, Josep', 'Fava, Alex', 'Goma, Montse', 'Meneghini, Maria', 'Manonelles, Anna', 'Cruzado, Josepmaria', 'Sureda, Ana', 'Bestard, Oriol']","['Melilli E', 'Mussetti A', 'Linares GS', 'Ruella M', 'La Salette C', 'Savchenko A', 'Taco MDR', 'Montero N', 'Grinyo J', 'Fava A', 'Goma M', 'Meneghini M', 'Manonelles A', 'Cruzado J', 'Sureda A', 'Bestard O']",,"['Nephrology Department, Bellvitge University Hospital-Hospitale, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institut de Investigacio Biomedica de Bellvitge (IDIBELL)-Hospitalet, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institut de Investigacio Biomedica de Bellvitge (IDIBELL)-Hospitalet, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Clinical Hematology Department, Institut Catala d'Oncologia-Hospitalet, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Institut de Investigacio Biomedica de Bellvitge (IDIBELL)-Hospitalet, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Clinical Hematology Department, Institut Catala d'Oncologia-Hospitalet, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', 'IHC/ISH Oncology Precision Medicine, Novartis Group, Cambridge, MA.', 'IHC/ISH Oncology Precision Medicine, Novartis Group, Cambridge, MA.', 'Pathology Department, Bellvitge University Hospital-Hospitalet, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Nephrology Department, Bellvitge University Hospital-Hospitale, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Nephrology Department, Bellvitge University Hospital-Hospitale, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Nephrology Department, Bellvitge University Hospital-Hospitale, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Pathology Department, Bellvitge University Hospital-Hospitalet, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Nephrology Department, Bellvitge University Hospital-Hospitale, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Nephrology Department, Bellvitge University Hospital-Hospitale, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Nephrology Department, Bellvitge University Hospital-Hospitale, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institut de Investigacio Biomedica de Bellvitge (IDIBELL)-Hospitalet, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Clinical Hematology Department, Institut Catala d'Oncologia-Hospitalet, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Nephrology Department, Bellvitge University Hospital-Hospitale, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institut de Investigacio Biomedica de Bellvitge (IDIBELL)-Hospitalet, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['K99 CA212302/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 CA212302/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Case Reports'],United States,Kidney Med,Kidney medicine,101756300,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell lymphoma', 'PTLD', 'T-cell therapy', 'kidney transplant', 'posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder']",2021/08/18 06:00,2021/08/18 06:01,['2021/08/17 07:35'],"['2021/08/17 07:35 [entrez]', '2021/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/18 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.xkme.2021.03.011 [doi]', 'S2590-0595(21)00101-1 [pii]']",epublish,Kidney Med. 2021 May 28;3(4):665-668. doi: 10.1016/j.xkme.2021.03.011. eCollection 2021 Jul-Aug.,20210528,,,,PMC8350835,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High-risk neuroblastoma (HR-NBL) can be characterized by metastasis, age, and other tumor characteristics that result in an adverse outlook for this patient cohort. The standard of care includes induction chemotherapy, surgery, followed by stem cell autologous transplant (ASCT), and later, antidisialoganglioside (anti-GD2) antibodies. In this study, we provide the survival and toxicity data of our HR-NBL patients treated with a single ASCT. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed pediatric HR-NBL patients treated with single ASCT after a carboplatin, etoposide, and melphalan (CEM) regimen in our institution between January 1993 and December 2014. Results: There were 99 evaluable patients with male predominance. The median age at diagnosis was 3 years. Most of our HR-NBL patients were stage 4 (88%). All patients received ASCT. Peripheral blood was the graft source in 58% of the patients. Time for hematological count recovery with bone marrow as a graft source was prolonged but not statistically significant when compared with PBSCs. Of all the patients, 58% received radiation therapy to residual disease. Overt secondary leukemia was not seen in any of these patients. Three-year overall survival (OS) was 68.5% +/- 5.2% and the 3-year event-free survival (EFS) was (48.3% +/- 5.2%). Conclusion: Our HR-NBL patients tolerated high-dose chemotherapy well followed by single autologous stem cell transplant. Tandem transplant is a feasible option in our patient cohort. Apart from secondary solid tumors, there were no long-term complications seen.","['(c) 2021 Publishing services provided by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Faisal', 'Specialist Hospital & Research Centre (General Organization), Saudi Arabia.']","['Khan, Saadiya', 'AlSayyad, Khulood', 'Siddiqui, Khawar', 'AlAnazi, Awatif', 'AlSeraihy, Amal', 'AlAhmari, Ali', 'ElSolh, Hassan', 'Ghemlas, Ibrahim', 'AlSaedi, Hawazen', 'AlJefri, Abdullah', 'Ali, Afshan', 'AlFawaz, Ibrahim', 'AlKofide, Amani', 'Ayas, Mouhab']","['Khan S', 'AlSayyad K', 'Siddiqui K', 'AlAnazi A', 'AlSeraihy A', 'AlAhmari A', 'ElSolh H', 'Ghemlas I', 'AlSaedi H', 'AlJefri A', 'Ali A', 'AlFawaz I', 'AlKofide A', 'Ayas M']",,"['Department of Pediatric Hematology / Oncology, MBC 53, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology / Oncology, MBC 53, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology / Oncology, MBC 53, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology / Oncology, MBC 53, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology / Oncology, MBC 53, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology / Oncology, MBC 53, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology / Oncology, MBC 53, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology / Oncology, MBC 53, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology / Oncology, MBC 53, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology / Oncology, MBC 53, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology / Oncology, MBC 53, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology / Oncology, MBC 53, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology / Oncology, MBC 53, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology / Oncology, MBC 53, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Int J Pediatr Adolesc Med,International journal of pediatrics & adolescent medicine,101670718,,['NOTNLM'],"['Autologous stem cell transplant', 'High-risk neuroblastoma', 'Oncology', 'Pediatric']",2021/08/18 06:00,2021/08/18 06:01,['2021/08/17 07:32'],"['2020/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/02/04 00:00 [revised]', '2021/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/17 07:32 [entrez]', '2021/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/18 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.ijpam.2021.02.006 [doi]', 'S2352-6467(21)00023-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Pediatr Adolesc Med. 2021 Dec;8(4):253-257. doi: 10.1016/j.ijpam.2021.02.006.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expressions. Expression level of tumor suppressor-miRNAs, described as miRNAs that target the oncogens, can contribute to diagnosis and prognosis of some malignant disorders including CML. We theorized that according to the excessive proliferation and alteration in miRNA expressions, there could be a change in the expression of miRNAs in plasma carried by exosomes. Methods: We consequently decided to detect the differences between normal and aberrant miRNA expression in human plasma sample to find out the possibility of diagnosis by these alterations. The expression of candidate miRNAs were compared using RNA extracted from the plasma of 50 patients, as well as 30 healthy individuals. We analysed the plasma miR-16-1, miR-20, miR-106, miR-126, miR-155, miR-222, and miR-451 expression levels in CML patients by individual real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Results: All selected miRNAs were found to be upregulated in newly diagnosed CML patients compared to the control, while upregulation of only three (miR-20, 106 and 222) were significant (17.4, 19 and 74.95 fold change, respectively; p<0.0001). In conclusion: microRNAs have a potential use in treatment of CML, as they can target the genes involved in cell cycle, MAPK, growth inhibition, TGF beta, and p53 signaling pathways. Therefore, these miRNA signatures provide the basis for their utilization as biomarkers in CML.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

ATL is classified into four types-acute, lymphomatous, chronic, and smoldering. Opportunistic infections are known to occur in patients with acute or lymphomatous type ATL; however, whether patients with chronic or smoldering ATL also have a high risk of opportunistic infections is not yet known. Herein, we report a case of pneumocystis pneumonia in a patient with smoldering ATL. He was a 64-year-old man with primary complaints of cough and dyspnea on exertion. A chest radiograph showed infiltration shadows in the left lung field. He was prescribed antibiotics for pneumonia; however, his symptoms worsened, and he developed hypoxemia. White-blood cell count was 13000/muL, and 7% of atypical lymphocytes were found in the smears of peripheral blood cells. His serum beta-D glucan concentration was increased to 85.9 pg/mL, and his serum tested positive for anti-HTLV-1 antibody. Chest-computed tomography revealed diffuse ground-glass opacities in the bilateral lung fields. Pneumocystis-polymerase chain reaction performed on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid confirmed pneumocystis, but atypical lymphocytes were not detected via transbronchial lung biopsy. Therefore, he was diagnosed with pneumocystis pneumonia associated with smoldering ATL. Sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and corticosteroid therapies were administered to treat the pneumocystis pneumonia, and his symptoms and lung shadows improved rapidly. Thus, opportunistic infections, including pneumocystis pneumonia, may be caused by smoldering ATL.

In this case-control study, the expression of genes encoding Nrf2, Keap1, Bcl2, Bcl- XL and Bax in 40 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients were compared with 40 normal individuals in the Iranian population. We evaluated the mRNA expression of genes by using the real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The expression of Nrf2, Bcl2 and Bcl- XL genes in new AML patients were increased (p < 0.05). The patients treated with chemotherapy had a significantly more than four times higher expression level of Nrf2 than new case patients (P < 0.05), while there was a decrease in the expression level of Bcl2 and Bcl-XL, which was not statistically significant. In other hands in relapsed patients, the expressions of Nrf2, Bcl2 and Bcl- XL were higher level than new case patients (p < 0.05) but this was less than patients treated with chemotherapy (p > 0.05). The high levels of mentioned genes may be associated with poor treatment response, chemoresistance and disease recurrence.

Multidrug resistance (MDR) appears to be the major contributor of chemo-resistance, arising in some sub-clones of cancers and could be developed in others. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from AML patients on the transmission of chemo-resistance phenotype. Ultracentrifugation was employed to isolate EVs from healthy controls, new cases, and relapsed AML patients. The EVs size, morphology, and immunophenotype were determined by dynamic light scattering, TEM, and flow cytometry respectively. Bradford assay was performed to measure the protein content of EVs. MTT assay and flow cytometry analysis were also used to determine the viability index, induction of apoptosis, and ROS generation in U937 cells. The expression level of two efflux pumps was assessed using qRT-PCR analysis. Findings of TEM, DLS, and flow cytometry confirmed that EVs had a desirable shape, size, and surface markers. EVs derived from both new cases and relapsed AML patients significantly reduced idarubicin-induced apoptosis in the U937 cells. The analysis of drug efflux pumps gens revealed that EVs over-express MRD1 and MRP1 in the target cells. These findings suggested a novel role of EVs in mediating the acquired chemo-resistance in AML patients by inducing the expression of the drug efflux pumps; however, further investigations will be required to elucidate other underlying mechanisms of resistance that are mediated by EVs.",,"['Barzegar, Mohieddin', 'Allahbakhshian Farsan, Mehdi', 'Amiri, Vahid', 'Mohammadi, Saeed', 'Shahsavan, Shaghayegh', 'Mirzaeian, Amin', 'Mohammadi, Mohammad Hossein']","['Barzegar M', 'Allahbakhshian Farsan M', 'Amiri V', 'Mohammadi S', 'Shahsavan S', 'Mirzaeian A', 'Mohammadi MH']",,"['Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'HSCT Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'HSCT Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'HSCT Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'HSCT Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Iran,Iran J Pharm Res,Iranian journal of pharmaceutical research : IJPR,101208407,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'De novo', 'Extracellular vesicles', 'Multidrug resistance', 'Relapse']",2021/08/18 06:00,2021/08/18 06:01,['2021/08/17 07:28'],"['2021/08/17 07:28 [entrez]', '2021/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/18 06:01 [medline]']",['10.22037/ijpr.2020.113272.14199 [doi]'],ppublish,Iran J Pharm Res. 2021 Winter;20(1):384-397. doi: 10.22037/ijpr.2020.113272.14199.,,,,,PMC8170774,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, given that the regulation of NGAL gene expression by cytokines is tissue-specific, NGAL expression in relation to those of cytokine genes has not been analyzed in bone marrow (BM) tissue. The purpose of this study was to analyze the association between NGAL and 48 cytokine gene expression levels in mononuclear cells (MNCs) of BM at the time of diagnosis of hematological malignancy and to explore the expression pattern of NGAL and related cytokine genes in patients with hematological malignancies and controls. Methods: BM MNCs were isolated from 48 patients, who were classified as patients presenting myeloproliferative neoplasm, acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and as controls. NGAL and cytokine genes were analyzed using NanoString. Data on hematological parameters were collected from medical records. Single and multiple regression analyses were performed to analyze relationships. Results: Normalized counts of 26 cytokine genes were related to NGAL normalized counts, while STAT3 and TLR4 normalized counts had the highest explanatory power. The following multiple regression model was developed: NGAL normalized counts=4316.825 + 9.056 x STAT3 normalized counts + 844.226 x IL5 normalized counts + 17.540 x TLR1 normalized counts - 28.206 x TLR2 normalized counts - 42.524 x IRAK4 normalized counts. In the multiple regression analysis, STAT3 and TLR4 normalized counts showed multicollinearity. NGAL, STAT3, IL5, and TLR4 normalized counts showed similar intergroup patterns. Conclusions: NGAL normalized counts was predicted by a multiple regression model, while they showed similar intergroup patterns to STAT3, IL5, and TLR4 normalized counts.",['(c) The author(s).'],"['Mun, Sungchul', 'Park, Min-Chul', 'Cho, Chi-Hyun']","['Mun S', 'Park MC', 'Cho CH']",,"['Department of Industrial Engineering, Jeonju University, 303 Cheonjam-ro, Wansan-gu, Jeonju-si, 55069, Republic of Korea.', 'Center for Opto-Electronic materials and devices, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, Korea University Ansan Hospital, 123, Jeokgeum-ro, Danwon-gu, Ansan-si, Gyeonggi-do 15355, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",Australia,Int J Med Sci,International journal of medical sciences,101213954,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'bone marrow', 'cytokine', 'myelodysplastic syndrome', 'myeloproliferative neoplasm', 'neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin']",2021/08/18 06:00,2022/01/11 06:00,['2021/08/17 07:28'],"['2021/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/17 07:28 [entrez]', '2021/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.7150/ijms.62425 [doi]', 'ijmsv18p3290 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Med Sci. 2021 Jul 23;18(14):3290-3298. doi: 10.7150/ijms.62425. eCollection 2021.,20210723,20220110,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (LCN2 protein, human)', '0 (Lipocalin-2)']","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cytokines/analysis/*metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Lipocalin-2/analysis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",PMC8364451,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You are curious and want to know whether there is anything special about this 5 percent, specifically whether this risk corelates with any pretransplant clinical and laboratory co-variates. You have extensive clinical data and some typical laboratory data on all 1000 but you suspect the culprit is mutation topography. What to do? Fortunately you have bio-banked DNA from the 1000. If resources and monies are not limiting you can do targeted or next generation sequencing on all 1000 DNA samples and off you go. However, most of us lack unlimited resources and monies. How can you sensibly and efficiently tackle this research problem? The answer is a case-cohort design study. In the typescript which follows Profs. Cai and Kim explain how to accomplish this. If you follow their advice you may need only to analyze samples from < 300 recipients rather than 1000 to test your hypothesis. They explain how to design such a study and provide references to estimate sample size.Sadly, their typescript will not tell you how to get funding for the study, whish poor devil who will have to write the protocol, worse, who will shepherd it though endless committees for approval and the like. Help on these issues is outside the scope of our statistics series. In this context we suggest advice from Woody Allen's article in the New Yorker: The Kugelmass Episode (April 24, 1977). When Prof. Kugelmass (English, City College) tells his analyst Dr. Mandel he has fallen in love with Emma Bovary who died of arsenic poisoning near Rouen, France 120 years earlier the analyst says: After all, I'm an analyst, not a magician. Kugelmass' reply: Then perhaps what I need is a magician and is off to Coney Island to find one. Good luck, the magician may still be there! (Note: This typescript is R-rated.

Advanced-stage EC has limited treatment options with a poor prognosis. There is an unmet need for the identification of actionable drivers for the development of targeted therapies in EC. Leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) and its ligand LIF play a major role in cancer progression, metastasis, stemness, and therapy resistance. However, little is known about the functional significance of the LIF/LIFR axis in EC progression. In this study using endometrial tumor tissue arrays, we identified that expression of LIF, LIFR is upregulated in EC. Knockout of LIFR using CRISPR/Cas9 in two different EC cells resulted in a significant reduction of their cell viability and cell survival. In vivo studies demonstrated that LIFR-KO significantly reduced EC xenograft tumor growth. Treatment of established and primary patient-derived EC cells with a novel LIFR inhibitor, EC359 resulted in the reduction of cell viability with an IC50 in the range of 20-100 nM and induction of apoptosis. Further, treatment with EC359 reduced the spheroid formation of EC cancer stem cells and reduced the levels of cancer stem cell markers SOX2, OCT4, NANOG, and Axin2. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that EC359 treatment attenuated the activation of LIF-LIFR driven pathways, including STAT3 and AKT/mTOR signaling in EC cells. Importantly, EC359 treatment resulted in a significant reduction of the growth of EC patient-derived explants ex vivo, EC cell line-derived xenografts, and patient-derived xenografts in vivo. Collectively, our work revealed the oncogenic potential of the LIF/LIFR axis in EC and support the utility of LIFR inhibitor, EC359, as a novel targeted therapy for EC via the inhibition of LIF/LIFR oncogenic signaling.",['(c) 2021.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Herein, we compared the effect of dual FLT3/AXL-TKI gilteritinib with quizartinib through in vitro models mimicking hematopoietic niche conditions, ex vivo in primary AML blasts, and in vivo with dosing regimens allowing plasma concentration close to those used in clinical trials. RESULTS: We observed that gilteritinib maintained a stronger proapoptotic effect in hypoxia and coculture with bone marrow stromal cells compared with quizartinib, linked to a dose-dependent inhibition of AXL phosphorylation. In vivo, use of the MV4-11 cell line with hematopoietic engraftment demonstrated that gilteritinib was more effective than quizartinib at targeting leukemic cells in bone marrow. Finally, FLT3-ITD AML patient-derived xenografts revealed that this effect was particularly reproducible in FLT3-ITD AML with high allelic ratio in primary and secondary xenograft. Moreover, gilteritinib and quizartinib displayed close toxicity profile on normal murine hematopoiesis, particularly at steady state.

In the era of precision medicine, such cases are successfully managed with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) drugs. This study examined the features and long-term outcome of Ph+ve cases from a tertiary cancer care center from Eastern Indian subcontinent. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Reviewing retrospective case-records registered between 2005 and 2015, cases of CML and ALL were documented under Ph+ve category; while no instance of Ph+ve AML was found. RESULTS: In CML cohort, adult and juvenile incidences were 95.2% and 4.8% respectively; in ALL cohort, the same was found for 66.67% and 33.33% cases. Among the CML cases, 10-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were significantly affected upon the phase of disease at time of detection. Furthermore, both OS and PFS significantly dropped whenever non-TKI-based treatment was applied prior to TKI-commencement. Long-term (10-year) sensitivity to 1st generation TKI, imatinib, was noted 88.51% and 83.33% for adult and juvenile CML cohorts, respectively. For Ph+ ALL cohort, the OS was benefitted upon combinatorial TKI and chemotherapy. However, large fractions of affected individual from CML as well as ALL cohorts were found to discontinue follow-up. CONCLUSION: Together with differences in outcome on the basis of drug-use from onset, age (juvenile versus adult) and stage at diagnosis, our analyses bring forward the real-world scenario of Ph+ve leukemia managed with precision medicine.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

Many therapeutic strategies attempt to exploit this feature, often having unintended side effects on normal metabolic programs and limited efficacy due to integrative nature of metabolic substrate sourcing. Although the initiating oncogenic lesion may vary, tumor cells in lymphoid malignancies often share similar environments and potentially similar metabolic profiles. We examined cells from mouse models of MYC-, RAS-, and BCR-ABL-driven lymphoid malignancies and find a convergence on de novo lipogenesis. We explore the potential role of MYC in mediating lipogenesis by (13)C glucose tracing and untargeted metabolic profiling. Inhibition of lipogenesis leads to cell death both in vitro and in vivo and does not induce cell death of normal splenocytes. METHODS: We analyzed RNA-seq data sets for common metabolic convergence in lymphoma and leukemia. Using in vitro cell lines derived in from conditional MYC, RAS, and BCR-ABL transgenic murine models and oncogene-driven human cell lines, we determined gene regulation, metabolic profiles, and sensitivity to inhibition of lipogenesis in lymphoid malignancies. We utilize preclinical murine models and transgenic primary model of T-ALL to determine the effect of lipogenesis blockade across BCR-ABL-, RAS-, and c-MYC-driven lymphoid malignancies. Statistical significance was calculated using unpaired t-tests and one-way ANOVA. RESULTS: This study illustrates that de novo lipid biogenesis is a shared feature of several lymphoma subtypes. Using cell lines derived from conditional MYC, RAS, and BCR-ABL transgenic murine models, we demonstrate shared responses to inhibition of lipogenesis by the acetyl-coA carboxylase inhibitor 5-(tetradecloxy)-2-furic acid (TOFA), and other lipogenesis inhibitors. We performed metabolic tracing studies to confirm the influence of c-MYC and TOFA on lipogenesis. We identify specific cell death responses to TOFA in vitro and in vivo and demonstrate delayed engraftment and progression in vivo in transplanted lymphoma cell lines. We also observe delayed progression of T-ALL in a primary transgenic mouse model upon TOFA administration. In a panel of human cell lines, we demonstrate sensitivity to TOFA treatment as a metabolic liability due to the general convergence on de novo lipogenesis in lymphoid malignancies driven by MYC, RAS, or BCR-ABL. Importantly, cell death was not significantly observed in non-malignant cells in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest that de novo lipogenesis may be a common survival strategy for many lymphoid malignancies and may be a clinically exploitable metabolic liability.

METHODS: Differentially expressed miRNAs in pediatric patients with beta-thalassemia were determined using microRNA sequencing. RESULTS: Hsa-miR-483-3p, hsa-let-7f-1-3p, hsa-let-7a-3p, hsa-miR-543, hsa-miR-433-3p, hsa-miR-4435, hsa-miR-329-3p, hsa-miR-92b-5p, hsa-miR-6747-3p and hsa-miR-495-3p were significantly upregulated, whereas hsa-miR-4508, hsa-miR-20a-5p, hsa-let-7b-5p, hsa-miR-93-5p, hsa-let-7i-5p, hsa-miR-6501-5p, hsa-miR-221-3p, hsa-let-7g-5p, hsa-miR-106a-5p, and hsa-miR-17-5p were significantly downregulated in pediatric patients with beta-thalassemia. After integrating our data with a previously published dataset, we found that hsa-let-7b-5p and hsa-let-7i-5p expression levels were also lower in adolescent or adult patients with beta-thalassemia. The predicted target genes of hsa-let-7b-5p and hsa-let-7i-5p were associated with the transforming growth factor beta receptor, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT, FoxO, Hippo, and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways. We also identified 12 target genes of hsa-let-7a-3p and hsa-let-7f-1-3p and 21 target genes of hsa-let-7a-3p and hsa-let-7f-1-3p, which were differentially expressed in patients with beta-thalassemia. Finally, we found that hsa-miR-190-5p and hsa-miR-1278-5p may regulate hemoglobin switching by modulation of the B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A gene. CONCLUSION: The results of the study show that several microRNAs are dysregulated in pediatric beta-thalassemia. Further, the results also indicate toward a critical role of let7 miRNAs in the pathogenesis of pediatric beta-thalassemia, which needs to be investigated further.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in patients with CLL in 1 year was approximately 3% in the recent Italian CAMPUS CLL survey; large retrospective studies have documented a higher mortality in patients with CLL hospitalized for severe COVID-19 compared with the general population. Controversial results for CLL-directed treatment have been reported, with some studies suggesting a potential benefit for BTK inhibitors. Reducing the number of hospital visits, delaying treatment whenever possible, and using oral therapy have become the mainstay of management in these patients. Available results with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccines indicate an immune serological response in 40% of patients only, with a detrimental effect of recent therapy with or without anti-CD20 therapy, older age, and hypogammaglobulinemia. Further studies are needed to determine the best strategies in patients with CLL regarding (i) management of concomitant COVID-19, (ii) identification of patients in whom CLL therapy can be safely postponed, (iii) CLL treatment algorithms, and (iv) optimal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccination strategies.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Targeted agents have shown to be superior compared with chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) in terms of progression-free survival in high-risk CLL. In the majority of studies, however, continuous treatment was compared with fixed-duration CIT and no overall survival or progression-free survival-2 (time from randomization to second progression or death) advantage could be documented. Meanwhile, a substantial financial burden on both patients and payers has raised issues about affordability and adherence to treatment. Therefore, value-based pricing of new drugs has been used to set up price negotiation policies in several countries, and fixed-duration therapy has shown to be less costly than continuous treatment. Thus, CIT continues to have a role in the treatment of CLL patients with a favorable genetic profile, that is, with a mutated IGHV gene profile and a wild-type TP53. Targeted treatment represents the preferred choice in patients with an unmutated IGHV gene configuration and/or a TP53 disruption, provided that adherence to treatment is guaranteed and bearing in mind that should costly drugs not be available for frontline treatment, new agents can be very effective as first salvage treatment.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Although some of these countries display incidence rates of CLL that are lower than those of developed Western countries, a large number of patients are expected to be diagnosed with CLL in these regions every year. In this article, we review issues regarding management of CLL in some less-resourced countries, with a focus on the evidence basis for epidemiological and clinical information on this disease, the availability of diagnostic and therapeutic resources, and participation in clinical trials. Going forward, challenges that still need to be addressed include the development of unified countrywide registries, guidelines for management applicable to each country, wider availability of prognostic tools, access to new drugs, and policies that ensure these drugs are affordable to all patients worldwide.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The advent of therapies that can disrupt some of the stimulatory signaling afforded by the microenvironment has ushered in a new era of targeted therapy, which has dramatically improved clinical outcome and patient survival. Future advances are required for patients who develop intolerance or resistance to current targeted therapies. These may be found by investigating novel drugs that can inhibit identified targets, such as the pathways involved in B-cell receptor signaling, or by developing agents that inhibit additional targets of the leukemia microenvironment. This review describes some of the molecules involved in promoting the growth and/or survival of CLL cells and discusses targeting strategies that may become tomorrow's therapy for patients with CLL.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The emergence of these complications is related to an intertwined and complex relationship between patient, disease, and treatment characteristics. The prognostic repercussion of autoimmune cytopenia (AIC) in patients with CLL mainly depends on its response to therapy. For patients with AIC and nonactive CLL, treatment is as in primary, uncomplicated AIC, keeping in mind that no response is an indication for CLL therapy. The success of treating active CLL-related AIC widely relies on a flexible strategy that should include initial therapy with corticosteroids and a rapid shift to effective CLL therapy in nonresponding patients. Targeted therapies (e.g., ibrutinib) that have already demonstrated to be effective in CLL-related AIC will likely offer a unique possibility of treating both AIC and CLL as a single target.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

First, the transition from chemotherapy (alkylating agents, nucleoside analogs) to chemoimmunotherapy with the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies resulted in deeper and more complete remissions, with an improvement in progression-free and overall survival. Over the last few years, chemoimmunotherapy has gradually been replaced by new targeted agents, based on further improvement in survival, especially in patients with high-risk CLL, and fewer adverse effects, that is, a lack of myelosuppression and lack of DNA damage and associated risk of secondary acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome. The most active targeted treatments for CLL patients are the kinase inhibitors, which inhibit signaling of surface receptors, especially the B-cell antigen receptor, and the BCL-2 antagonist venetoclax. Among the kinase inhibitors, Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors are highly effective and generally well-tolerated and induce durable responses in the vast majority of patients. PI3 kinase inhibitors are alternatives for patients with intolerance to Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors. This review discusses the rationale for the transition from chemotherapy-based treatment to the novel agents, the activity, adverse effects, sequencing, and combinations of the novel agents and provides an outlook into future CLL therapy for the next decade.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Genetic studies have allowed to better understand CLL biology and to identify molecular biomarkers of clinical relevance. TP53 disruption represents the strongest prognosticator of chemorefractoriness and indicates the use of Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKis) and BCL2 inhibitors. Unmutated IGHV (immunoglobulin heavy variable) genes also predict refractoriness to chemoimmunotherapy; importantly, when treated with B-cell receptor inhibitors or BCL2 inhibitors, IGHV unmutated patients display an outcome similar to that of IGHV mutated CLL. Before choosing treatment, a comprehensive assessment of TP53 and IGHV status is recommended by all guidelines for CLL clinical management. In case of fixed-duration therapeutic strategies, monitoring of minimal residual disease may provide a tool to decide treatment duration. The current precision medicine management of CLL patients might be further improved by the adoption of novel biomarkers that are emerging as clinically meaningful for this disease.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Despite novel and promising anti-CD19 targeted immunotherapies such as chimeric antigen receptor T cells and bispecific anti-CD19/CD3 antibodies, relapse and resistance remain a major challenge in about 30% to 60% of patients. To investigate the potential role of the fully humanized bispecific antibody CD16 x CD33 (BiKE) in children with CD33(+) acute leukemia, we tested whether the reagent was able to boost NK cell effector functions against CD33(+) AML and biphenotypic ALL blasts. Stimulation of primary NK cells from healthy volunteers with 16 x 33 BiKE led to increased cytotoxicity, degranulation and cytokine production against CD33(+) cell lines. Moreover, BiKE treatment significantly increased degranulation, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha production against primary ALL and AML targets. Importantly, also NK cells from leukemic patients profited from restoration of effector functions by BiKE treatment, albeit to a lesser extent than NK cells from healthy donors. In particular, those patients with low perforin and granzyme expression showed compromised cytotoxic function even in the presence of BiKE. In patients with intrinsic NK cell deficiency, combination therapy of CD16xCD33 BiKE and allogeneic NK cells might thus be a promising therapeutic approach. Taken together, CD16xCD33 BiKE successfully increased NK cell effector functions against pediatric AML and biphenotypic ALL blasts and constitutes a promising new option for supporting maintenance therapy or ""bridging"" consolidation chemotherapy before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.",['(c) 2021.

BCR stimulation of CLL cells induces expression of eIF4A, an initiation factor important for translation of multiple oncoproteins, and reduces expression of PDCD4, a natural inhibitor of eIF4A, suggesting that eIF4A may be a critical nexus controlling protein expression downstream of the BCR in these cells. We, therefore, investigated the effect of eIF4A inhibitors (eIF4Ai) on BCR-induced responses. We demonstrated that eIF4Ai (silvestrol and rocaglamide A) reduced anti-IgM-induced global mRNA translation in CLL cells and also inhibited accumulation of MYC and MCL1, key drivers of proliferation and survival, respectively, without effects on upstream signaling responses (ERK1/2 and AKT phosphorylation). Analysis of normal naive and non-switched memory B cells, likely counterparts of the two main subsets of CLL, demonstrated that basal RNA translation was higher in memory B cells, but was similarly increased and susceptible to eIF4Ai-mediated inhibition in both. We probed the fate of MYC mRNA in eIF4Ai-treated CLL cells and found that eIF4Ai caused a profound accumulation of MYC mRNA in anti-IgM treated cells. This was mediated by MYC mRNA stabilization and was not observed for MCL1 mRNA. Following drug wash-out, MYC mRNA levels declined but without substantial MYC protein accumulation, indicating that stabilized MYC mRNA remained blocked from translation. In conclusion, BCR-induced regulation of eIF4A may be a critical signal-dependent nexus for therapeutic attack in CLL and other B-cell malignancies, especially those dependent on MYC and/or MCL1.",['(c) 2021.

This remarkable plasticity enables TAM to adapt to ongoing changes within the tumor microenvironment. Macrophages can have either primarily pro-inflammatory (M1-like) or anti-inflammatory (M2-like) attributes and can continually switch between these two main states. M2-like macrophages within the tumor environment are associated with cancer progression and poor prognosis in several types of cancer. Many different methods for inducing differentiation and polarization of THP-1 cells are used to investigate cellular and intercellular mechanisms and the effects of TAM within the microenvironment of tumors. Currently, there is no established model for M2-like macrophage polarization using the THP-1 cell line, and the results of expression and cytokine profiles of macrophages due to certain in vitro stimuli vary between studies.

A number of studies have suggested that Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms are significantly associated with risk of AL. Present study performs meta-analysis to evaluate the association between CYP2B6 c.516G>T variant and AL risk. METHODS: Databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang were searched for literatures to September 30, 2019, both in English and Chinese. Relative risk and its 95% confidence intervals were used to assess the associations. Statistical analyses of this meta-analysis were conducted by using STATA 13.0. software. RESULTS: A total of 7 studies, including 1038 cases and 1648 controls, were analyzed. Our results indicated that CYP2B6 c.516G>T variant was significantly related to an increased the risk of AL under dominant model, recessive model, homozygote model, and allelic model. In addition, subgroup analyses were also performed by disease classification, country, and study design. No significant associations were obtained between CYP2B6 c.516G>T variant and the risk of AL under the recessive model in the design of hospital-based (relative risk = 0.98; 95% confidence interval: 0.95-1.01; P = 0.118). CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis indicated that the CYP2B6 variant is significantly associated with AL risk, in which CYP2B6 c.516G>T is related to an increased risk of AL.","['Copyright (c) 2021 the Author(s).

Inclusion criteria were patients with hematological malignancy or they had undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and received at least 1 dose of posaconazole. The primary endpoints were the observation of breakthrough rates and the clinical efficacy of posaconazole prophylaxis. The secondary endpoint was the efficacy of posaconazole for the treatment of IFDs.Of the 762 enrolled patients, 456 (59.8%) were prescribed posaconazole prophylactically while 243 (31.9%) received posaconazole as an IFD treatment (12 proven, 61 probable, 109 possible, and 61 unclassified IFD cases) for >/=7 days. The overall IFD breakthrough rate (probable cases) for the >/=4 days prophylactic treatment (n = 445) group was 1.6% (95% Cl: 0.6%-3.2%), with breakthrough rates of 2.6% for acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome patients undergoing chemotherapy and 2.2% for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients. For primary antifungal prophylaxis, the breakthrough rate was 1.9% and for secondary antifungal prophylaxis 0%. The overall effective IFD remission rate of patients treated for >/=7 days with posaconazole was 56.0% and the effective remission rate of proven/probable/possible IFD cases was 59.3%. The effective remission rate of posaconazole as salvage therapy was 50% (95% CI: 32.4%-67.6%) including 75% (CI: 19.4%-99.4%) for Aspergillus infections.The present retrospective study confirmed posaconazole as IFD prophylaxis and medication for hematological malignancy patients undergoing various treatments in China.","['Copyright (c) 2021 the Author(s).

In this study, we identified AYNE as the most potent FAO inhibitor within the Avo-B mixture capable of inducing cell death in leukemia cells lines (IC50 : 3.10 +/- 0.14 microM in TEX cells; 11.53 +/- 3.32 microM in OCI-AML2) and patient-derived acute myeloid leukemia cells. When added individually, the two Avo-B constituents demonstrated antagonism (Combination Index values >1), highlighting the need for future studies to assess AYNE alone. Together, this work highlighted AYNE as the most potent FAO inhibitor within the Avo-B mixture. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This work identifies which of the two molecules in avocatin B (Avo-B), an avocado-derived mixture of two molecules with demonstrated human safety, utility against leukemia, insulin resistance and diabetes, is most useful.

Although the potentially lower PEG-ASP formulation immunogenicity, few studies with conflicting results have compared the allergy incidence between Escherichia coli-ASP and PEG-ASP in the same protocol. We aimed at comparing the allergy incidence in children receiving native E. coli-ASP versus PEG-ASP within the same clinical protocol (Spanish Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology ALL-SEHOP-PETHEMA 2013). One hundred and twenty-six children (1-19 years) diagnosed with ALL from 2013 to 2020 were included. Patients in group 1 received a sequential scheme of native E. coli-ASP 10,000 IU/m(2) intramuscularly (IM) followed by PEG-ASP 1000 IU/m(2) IM. Patients in group 2 received PEG-ASP 1000 IU/m(2) IM upfront. Clinical allergy incidence was compared between both groups. Serum ASP activity (SAA) was measured in a subgroup of patients, and silent inactivation was recorded. The cumulative incidence of clinical allergy was significantly higher in group 1 (native followed by PEG-ASP) than in group 2 (PEG-ASP upfront), 24.7% versus 4.1% (p = 0.0085). Adequate ASP activity was achieved with PEG-ASP 1000 IU/m(2) dose in most patients (median SAA 412.5 and 453.0 IU/L at days 7 and 14). The incidence of silent inactivation in PEG-ASP upfront patients was very low. PEG-ASP-used upfront was associated with a lower incidence of clinical allergy than that observed in the sequential use of native E. coli-ASP followed by PEG-ASP.

Some patients do not respond because of T cell deficiencies that hamper the expansion, persistence, and effector function of these cells. We used longitudinal immune profiling to identify phenotypic and pharmacodynamic changes in CD19-directed CAR T cells in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). CAR expression maintenance was also investigated because this can affect response durability. CAR T cell failure was accompanied by preexisting T cell-intrinsic defects or dysfunction acquired after infusion. In a small subset of patients, CAR silencing was observed coincident with leukemia relapse. Using a small molecule inhibitor, we demonstrated that the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family of chromatin adapters plays a role in downregulating CAR expression. BET protein blockade also ameliorated CAR T cell exhaustion as manifested by inhibitory receptor reduction, enhanced metabolic fitness, increased proliferative capacity, and enriched transcriptomic signatures of T cell reinvigoration. BET inhibition decreased levels of the TET2 methylcytosine dioxygenase, and forced expression of the TET2 catalytic domain eliminated the potency-enhancing effects of BET protein targeting in CAR T cells, providing a mechanism linking BET proteins and T cell dysfunction. Thus, modulating BET epigenetic readers may improve the efficacy of cell-based immunotherapies.",,"['Kong, Weimin', 'Dimitri, Alexander', 'Wang, Wenliang', 'Jung, In-Young', 'Ott, Christopher J',

In this issue of the JCI, Xueliang Gao, Shenghui Qin, et al. focus their mechanism-based investigation on the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling aspect of the PFK1 platelet isoform, PFKP. Functional nuclear export and localization sequences stimulated CXC chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) expression to promote T-ALL invasion that involved cyclin D3/CDK6, c-Myc, and importin-9. Since the presence of nuclear PFKP is associated with poor survival in T-ALL, nuclear PFKP-induced CXCR4 expression might serve as a prognostic marker for T-ALL.

This study aims to assess the efficacy and toxicity of floxuridine, actinomycin D, etoposide, and vincristine (FAEV) as a primary treatment for patients with GTN who had International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) scores >/=5. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 207 patients with GTN who had FIGO scores >/=5 were treated with FAEV as first-line chemotherapy at Peking Union Medical College Hospital between January 2002 and December 2017. Complete remission (CR), resistance, survival, toxicity, and reproductive outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 207 patients treated with FAEV, 9 (4.3%) required a change of chemotherapy owing to toxicity and 1 (0.5%) died of cerebral hernia 5 weeks after commencing treatment. The remaining 197 patients were assessable to determine the response to FAEV; among them, 168 (85.3%) achieved CR with FAEV and 29 (14.7%) developed resistance to FAEV. The 5-year overall survival rate of the entire cohort was 97.4%. Grade 3-4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia occurred in 28.4%, 6.8%, and 6.2% of cycles, respectively. No acute toxicity-related deaths occurred. Five patients developed acute myeloid leukemia 10-50 months after exposure to chemotherapy; another patient developed duodenal cancer 2 years after completing therapy. Sixty-one patients who preserved fertility wanted to become pregnant; 56 of them conceived. CONCLUSION: The FAEV regimen is an effective primary treatment for patients with GTN who have FIGO scores >/=5 and has predictable and manageable toxicity. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The most commonly used multiagent chemotherapy for high-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) is etoposide, methotrexate and actinomycin D/cyclophosphamide and vincristine (EMA/CO) worldwide. However, 5-fluorouracil-based multiagent chemotherapy has been used as a primary treatment for high-risk GTN in China for a few decades. This study evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of floxuridine, actinomycin D, etoposide, and vincristine (FAEV) as a primary treatment for patients with GTN who have International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) scores >/=5. The study's data demonstrated that FAEV as a primary treatment achieved favorable outcomes for patients with FIGO scores >/=5. Toxicities that result from the FAEV regimen are predictable and manageable. The FAEV regimen may provide another option for the treatment of GTN.",['(c) 2021 AlphaMed Press.'],"['Li, Yuan', 'Kong, Yujia', 'Wan, Xirun', 'Feng, Fengzhi', 'Ren, Tong', 'Zhao, Jun', 'Yang, Junjun', 'Xiang, Yang']","['Li Y', 'Kong Y', 'Wan X', 'Feng F', 'Ren T', 'Zhao J', 'Yang J', 'Xiang Y']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9112-1021'],"[""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, National Clinical Research Center for Obstetrics and Gynecologic Diseases, No. 1 Shuaifuyuan Wangfujing, Dongcheng District, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, National Clinical Research Center for Obstetrics and Gynecologic Diseases, No. 1 Shuaifuyuan Wangfujing, Dongcheng District, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, National Clinical Research Center for Obstetrics and Gynecologic Diseases, No. 1 Shuaifuyuan Wangfujing, Dongcheng District, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, National Clinical Research Center for Obstetrics and Gynecologic Diseases, No. 1 Shuaifuyuan Wangfujing, Dongcheng District, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, National Clinical Research Center for Obstetrics and Gynecologic Diseases, No. 1 Shuaifuyuan Wangfujing, Dongcheng District, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, National Clinical Research Center for Obstetrics and Gynecologic Diseases, No. 1 Shuaifuyuan Wangfujing, Dongcheng District, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, National Clinical Research Center for Obstetrics and Gynecologic Diseases, No. 1 Shuaifuyuan Wangfujing, Dongcheng District, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, National Clinical Research Center for Obstetrics and Gynecologic Diseases, No. 1 Shuaifuyuan Wangfujing, Dongcheng District, Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Actinomycin D', '*Etoposide', '*Floxuridine', '*Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia', '*Treatment efficacy', '*Vincristine']",2021/08/17 06:00,2021/12/22 06:00,['2021/08/16 06:26'],"['2021/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/22 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/16 06:26 [entrez]']",['10.1002/onco.13943 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncologist. 2021 Dec;26(12):e2209-e2216. doi: 10.1002/onco.13943.

However, data on cardiac events associated with PT-Cy are scarce. Objectives: This study sought to assess the incidence and clinical features of cardiac events associated with PT-Cy. Methods: The study compared clinical outcomes between patients who received PT-Cy (n = 136) and patients who did not (n = 195), with a focus on early cardiac events (ECE) occurring within the first 100 days after HSCT. All patients had the same systematic cardiac monitoring. Results: The cumulative incidence of ECE was 19% in the PT-Cy group and 6% in the no-PT-Cy group (p < 0.001). The main ECE occurring after PT-Cy were left ventricular systolic dysfunction (13%), acute pulmonary edema (7%), pericarditis (4%), arrhythmia (3%), and acute coronary syndrome (2%). Cardiovascular risk factors were not associated with ECE. In multivariable analysis, the use of PT-Cy was associated with ECE (hazard ratio: 2.7; 95% confidence interval: 1.4 to 4.9; p = 0.002]. Older age, sequential conditioning regimen, and Cy exposure before HSCT were also associated with a higher incidence of ECE. Finally, a history of cardiac events before HSCT and ECE had a detrimental impact on overall survival. Conclusions: PT-Cy is associated with a higher incidence of ECE occurring within the first 100 days after HSCT. Patients who have a cardiac event after HSCT have lower overall survival. These results may help to improve the selection of patients who are eligible to undergo HSCT with PT-Cy, especially older adult patients and patients with previous exposure to Cy.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.'],"['Dulery, Remy', 'Mohty, Razan', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Sestili, Simona', 'Malard, Florent', 'Brissot, Eolia', 'Battipaglia, Giorgia', 'Mediavilla, Clemence', 'Banet, Anne', 'Van de Wyngaert, Zoe', 'Paviglianiti, Annalisa', 'Belhocine, Ramdane', 'Isnard, Francoise', 'Lapusan, Simona', 'Adaeva, Rosa', 'Vekhoff, Anne', 'Ledraa, Tounes', 'Legrand, Ollivier', 'Cohen, Ariel', 'Bonnin, Agnes', 'Ederhy, Stephane', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Dulery R', 'Mohty R', 'Labopin M', 'Sestili S', 'Malard F', 'Brissot E', 'Battipaglia G', 'Mediavilla C', 'Banet A', 'Van de Wyngaert Z', 'Paviglianiti A', 'Belhocine R', 'Isnard F', 'Lapusan S', 'Adaeva R', 'Vekhoff A', 'Ledraa T', 'Legrand O', 'Cohen A', 'Bonnin A', 'Ederhy S', 'Mohty M']",,"['Department of Clinical Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Sorbonne University, Paris, France.', 'National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) Joint Research Units (UMRs) 938, Saint Antoine Research Center, Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Acute Leukemia Working Party, European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (Paris Study Office/CEREST-TC), Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Sorbonne University, Paris, France.', 'National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) Joint Research Units (UMRs) 938, Saint Antoine Research Center, Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Sorbonne University, Paris, France.', 'National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) Joint Research Units (UMRs) 938, Saint Antoine Research Center, Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Sorbonne University, Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Sorbonne University, Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Saint Antoine Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Sorbonne University, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Sorbonne University, Paris, France.', 'Department of Cardiology, UNICO-GRECO Cardio-oncology Program, Sorbonne University, Saint Antoine Hospital, Assistance Publique -

The majority of patients harbor the JAK2-activating mutation V617F. JAK2 inhibitors were shown to reduce symptom burden and splenomegaly in MPN patients. However, treatment options are limited after failure of JAK2 inhibitors. AXL, a member of the TAM family of receptor tyrosine kinases, mediates survival and therapy resistance of different myeloid cancers including acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia. We studied the relevance of AXL as a target in MPN using primary patient cells and preclinical disease models. We found that AXL is abundantly activated in MPN cells and that its ligand growth arrest-specific gene 6 is upregulated in MPN patients. Pharmacologic and genetic blockade of AXL impaired viability, decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of MPN cells. Interestingly, ruxolitinib treatment induced increased phosphorylation of AXL indicating that activation of AXL might mediate resistance to ruxolitinib. Consistently, the AXL inhibitor bemcentinib exerted additive effects with ruxolitinib via impaired STAT3, STAT5, and AKT signaling. Both agents had activity when employed alone and exerted an additive effect on survival and splenomegaly in vivo.

In this work, we constructed a new and highly efficient indigoid production system by optimizing a novel terpenoid cyclase, XiaI, from the xiamycin biosynthetic pathway. Through introducing the flavin-reducing enzyme Fre, tryptophan-lysing and -importing enzymes TnaA and TnaB, and H2O2-degrading enzyme KatE and optimizing the fermentation parameters including temperature, the concentration of isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and feeding of the l-tryptophan precursor, the final maximum productivity of indigoids by the recombinant strain Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (XiaI-Fre-TnaAB-KatE) was apparently improved to 101.9 mg/L, an approximately 60-fold improvement to that of the starting strain E. coli BL21(DE3) (XiaI) (1.7 mg/L). In addition, when the fermentation system was enlarged to 1 L in the flask (feeding with 5 mM tryptophan and 10 mM 2-hydroxyindole), the indigoid productivity further increased to 276.7 mg/L at 48 h, including an indigo productivity of 26.0 mg/L and an indirubin productivity of 250.7 mg/L, which has been the highest productivity of indirubin so far.

Methods: The cross-sectional study was conducted on 55 children who were treated with the Children Oncology Group (COG) protocol from September 2010 to February 2015 to evaluate the chemotherapeutic regimen results. Results: There was a complete recovery rate of 76.4% during the first week after treatment. Three-year overall survival was 85.5% and five-year overall survival was 81%. Relapse rate after first remission was 20% and death after relapse was 50%. Thirty percent of total deaths were at the induction period. All of the deceased cases died due to sepsis. Conclusion: Results showed that the survival rate increased.

Compromised stability can lead to premature core disassembly, exposure of replication intermediates to cytosolic nucleic acid sensors that can trigger innate antiviral responses, and failure to integrate the proviral genome into the host DNA. Thus, core stability is a critical feature of viral replicative fitness. While there are several well-described techniques to assess viral capsid core stability, most are generally time and labor intensive. Recently, our group compared the relative stability of murine leukemia virus capsid cores using an in vitro detergent-based approach combined with ultracentrifugation against the popular fate of capsid assay.

However, these techniques vary greatly in ease of use, purity, yield and impact on viral structural integrity. Most importantly, it is becoming evident that secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) co-purify with retroviruses using nearly all purification methods due to nearly indistinguishable biophysical characteristics such as size, buoyant density and nucleic acid content. Recently, our group has illustrated a means of isolating intact and highly enriched retroviral virions from EV-containing cell supernatants using an immunoprecipitation approach targeting the viral envelope glycoprotein of the Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus ( Renner et al., 2018 ). This technique, that we call intact virion immunoprecipitation (IVIP), enabled us to characterize the accessibility of epitopes on the surface of these retroviruses and assess the orientation of the virus-encoded integral membrane protein Glycogag (gPr80) in the viral envelope.

CADM1 is often involved in malignant tumors of multiple organ systems, such as the respiratory and digestive systems. Upregulated CADM1 promotes tumor cell apoptosis and inhibits malignant proliferation. Along with cell cycle-related proteins, it participates in regulating signaling pathways, such as EMT, STAT3, and AKT, and plays an important role in inhibiting invasion and migration. Considering clinical characteristics, low CADM1 expression is associated with aggressive tumors and poor prognosis. In addition, some long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) or miRNAs directly or indirectly act on CADM1 to regulate tumor growth and motility. Interestingly, CADM1 function differs in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), and NF-kappaB is thought to be involved in this process. Taken together, CADM1 could be a potential biomarker for early diagnosis and a target for cancer treatment in future clinical practices.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Li, Gao and Zhang.']","['Li, Hongxu', 'Gao, Jie', 'Zhang, Shuijun']","['Li H', 'Gao J', 'Zhang S']",,"['Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery and Digestive Organ Transplantation of Henan Province, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Open and Key Laboratory of Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Surgery and Digestive Organ, Transplantation at Henan Universities, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Henan Key Laboratory of Digestive Organ Transplantation, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery and Digestive Organ Transplantation of Henan Province, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Open and Key Laboratory of Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Surgery and Digestive Organ, Transplantation at Henan Universities, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Henan Key Laboratory of Digestive Organ Transplantation, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery and Digestive Organ Transplantation of Henan Province, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Open and Key Laboratory of Hepatobiliary & Pancreatic Surgery and Digestive Organ, Transplantation at Henan Universities, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Henan Key Laboratory of Digestive Organ Transplantation, Zhengzhou, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,['NOTNLM'],"['CADM1', 'biomarker', 'cancer', 'metastasis', 'proliferation']",2021/08/17 06:00,2021/08/17 06:01,['2021/08/16 06:02'],"['2021/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/16 06:02 [entrez]', '2021/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/17 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2021.714298 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Jul 30;9:714298. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.714298. eCollection 2021.,20210730,,,,PMC8361327,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) is a coronavirus that infects mice and shares some sequence identity to SARS-CoV-2. Both viruses belong to the Betacoronavirus genus, and MHV thus serves as a useful and safe surrogate model for SARS-CoV-2 infections. Clinical trials have indicated that remdesivir is a potentially promising antiviral drug against COVID-19. Using an in vitro model of MHV infection of RAW264.7 macrophages, the safety and efficacy of monotherapy of remdesivir, chloroquine, ivermectin, and doxycycline were investigated. Of the four drugs tested, remdesivir monotherapy exerted the strongest inhibition of live virus and viral RNA replication of about 2-log10 and 1-log10, respectively (at 6 microM). Ivermectin treatment showed the highest selectivity index. Combination drug therapy was also evaluated using remdesivir (6 microM) together with chloroquine (15 microM), ivermectin (2 microM) or doxycycline (15 microM) - above their IC50 values and at high macrophage cell viability of over 95%. The combination of remdesivir and ivermectin exhibited highly potent synergism by achieving significant reductions of about 7-log10 of live virus and 2.5-log10 of viral RNA in infected macrophages. This combination also resulted in the lowest cytokine levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha, and leukemia inhibitory factor. The next best synergistic combination was remdesivir with doxycycline, which decreased levels of live virus by ~3-log10 and viral RNA by ~1.5-log10. These results warrant further studies to explore the mechanisms of action of the combination therapy, as well as future in vivo experiments and clinical trials for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Tan, Tan, Chu and Chow.']","['Tan, Yu Ling', 'Tan, Kevin S W', 'Chu, Justin Jang Hann', 'Chow, Vincent T']","['Tan YL', 'Tan KSW', 'Chu JJH', 'Chow VT']",,"['Infectious Diseases Translational Research Program, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Healthy Longevity Translational Research Program, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Infectious Diseases Translational Research Program, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Infectious Diseases Translational Research Program, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Front Cell Infect Microbiol,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,101585359,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*RAW264.7 macrophage cells', '*chloroquine', '*combination treatment', '*coronavirus', '*doxycycline', '*ivermectin', '*murine hepatitis virus', '*remdesivir']",2021/08/17 06:00,2021/08/19 06:00,['2021/08/16 06:01'],"['2021/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/16 06:01 [entrez]', '2021/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcimb.2021.700502 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Infect Microbiol. 2021 Jul 30;11:700502. doi: 10.3389/fcimb.2021.700502. eCollection 2021.,20210730,20210818,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '3QKI37EEHE (remdesivir)', '415SHH325A (Adenosine Monophosphate)', '70288-86-7 (Ivermectin)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)', 'COVID-19 drug treatment']","['Adenosine Monophosphate/analogs & derivatives', 'Alanine/analogs & derivatives', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*COVID-19/drug therapy', '*Coronavirus Infections/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Ivermectin/pharmacology', 'Mice', '*Murine hepatitis virus', 'Pandemics', 'SARS-CoV-2']",PMC8362885,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ZNF384-rearranged B-ALL is prone to lineage conversion after chemotherapy. TCF3 is the second most common rearrangement partner of ZNF384 in B-ALL (27.5%) and the most common partner in B/M MPAL (53.3%). TCF3-ZNF384 fusion is related to a poor steroid response and a high frequency of relapse. It is mostly reported in children and adolescents but rarely seen in adults. Patients and Methods: Here, we report a rare case of adult common B-ALL with TCF3-ZNF384 fusion in which the patient relapsed after one cycle of consolidation chemotherapy. Relapsed leukemia cells from the bone marrow were cultured for 72 hours ex vivo, and a panel of 156 kinds of cytotoxic drugs, targeted therapy drugs, combination chemotherapy drugs, etc., was used for sensitivity screening. The literature on TCF3-ZNF384 fusion was reviewed, and reported cases with TCF3-ZNF384 fusion were summarized. Clinical characteristics were compared between B-ALL and MPAL with TCF3-ZNF384 fusion. Results: The relapsed lymphoblasts showed moderate sensitivity to both acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) - and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)-directed combination chemotherapy schemes, as well as to multiple targeted therapeutic drugs. The hyper-CVAD (B) scheme showed synergistic effects with multiple targeted compounds and had the highest sensitivity. The patient chose the hyper-CVAD (B) scheme combined with sorafenib and achieved complete remission (CR), then consolidated with myeloid-directed homoharringtonine+cytarabine+daunorubicin (HAD) scheme and gained molecular CR. By reviewing the literature, we found that both the genomic landscapes and gene expression profiles of ZNF384-rearranged B-ALL and MPAL are similar and that both diseases have lineage plasticity. The gene expression profile in TCF3-ZNF384-positive patients shows enrichment of hematopoietic stem cell features. No significant differences in clinical characteristics were found between TCF3-ZNF384-positive ALL and MPAL. Conclusion: TCF3-ZNF384-positive leukemia may be a distinct subtype of leukemia regardless of immunophenotype. Considering the frequent lineage switches and sensitivity to both ALL- and AML-directed schemes, a uniform strategy directed at both lymphoid and myeloid lineages or at hematopoietic stem cells may be better for TCF3-ZNF384-positive leukemia. Small molecule targeted therapies may be promising treatment options and deserve further investigation.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Lin, Yan, Cai and Wang.']","['Lin, Na', 'Yan, Xiaojing', 'Cai, Dali', 'Wang, Lei']","['Lin N', 'Yan X', 'Cai D', 'Wang L']",,"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['TCF3-ZNF384 fusion', 'ZNF384 rearrangement', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', 'mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL)', 'treatment']",2021/08/17 06:00,2021/08/17 06:01,['2021/08/16 06:01'],"['2021/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/16 06:01 [entrez]', '2021/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/17 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.709036 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Jul 28;11:709036. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.709036. eCollection 2021.,20210728,,,,PMC8357369,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) and its receptor (LIFR), part of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) cytokine family, make up one such ill-defined piece of the puzzle connecting inflammation to cancer. Although other members of the IL-6 family have been shown to be involved in the metastasis of multiple types of cancer, the role of LIF and LIFR has been challenging to determine. Described by others in the past as enigmatic and paradoxical, LIF and LIFR are expressed in a diverse array of cells in the body, and the narrative surrounding them in cancer-related processes has been vague, and at times even contradictory. Despite this, recent insights into their functional roles in cancer have highlighted interesting patterns that may allude to a broader understanding of LIF and LIFR within tumor growth and metastasis. This review will discuss in depth the signaling pathways activated by LIF and LIFR specifically in the context of cancer-the purpose being to summarize recent literature concerning the downstream effects of LIF/LIFR signaling in a variety of cancer-related circumstances in an effort to begin teasing out the intricate web of contradictions that have made this pair so challenging to define.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Christianson, Oxford and Jorcyk.']","['Christianson, Joe', 'Oxford, Julia Thom', 'Jorcyk, Cheryl L']","['Christianson J', 'Oxford JT', 'Jorcyk CL']",,"['Department of Biological Sciences, Boise State University, Boise, ID, United States.', 'Biomolecular Sciences Program, Boise State University, Boise, ID, United States.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Boise State University, Boise, ID, United States.', 'Biomolecular Sciences Program, Boise State University, Boise, ID, United States.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Boise State University, Boise, ID, United States.', 'Biomolecular Sciences Program, Boise State University, Boise, ID, United States.']",['eng'],"['P20 GM103408/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 GM109095/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['IL-6 cytokine family', 'LIF', 'LIFR', 'cancer stem cell', 'hippo signaling pathway', 'interleukin like EMT inducer', 'metastasis', 'tumor progression']",2021/08/17 06:00,2021/08/17 06:01,['2021/08/16 06:01'],"['2021/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/16 06:01 [entrez]', '2021/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/17 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.693724 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Jul 29;11:693724. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.693724. eCollection 2021.,20210729,,,,PMC8358831,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mortality in thew first 30-days ranges from 6% to 43%, while infections account for 30-66% of early deaths. We aim to present our experience of infections in newly-diagnosed AML. Method: This prospective, observational study, was undertaken at a tertiary care hospital in Northern India. Patients with confirmed AML (bone marrow morphology and flow cytometry) and who had developed febrile neutropenia (FN), were included. Result: A total of fifty-five patients were included in the study. The median age of the patients was 47.1 years (12-71) and 28 (50.9%) were males. Fever (33, 60%) was the commonest presentation at the time of diagnosis. One or more comorbid conditions were present in 20 patients (36.36%). Infection at presentation was detected in 17 patients (30.9%). The mean duration to develop febrile neutropenia since the start of therapy was 11.24 days. With each ten-thousand increase in white blood cell (WBC) count, the mean number of days of FN development decreased by 0.35 days (p = 0.029). Clinical and/or radiological localization was possible in 23 patients (41.81%). Thirty-four blood samples (34/242, 14.04%) from 26 patients (26/55, 47.3%) isolated one or more organisms. Gram negative bacilli (GNB) were isolated in 24 (70.58%) samples. Burkholderia cepacia (8/34, 23.52%) was the commonest organism. The number of days required to develop febrile neutropenia was inversely associated with overall survival (OS). However, when compared, there was no statistically significant difference in OS between patients developing fever on day-10 and day-25 (p = 0.063). Thirteen patients (23.63%) died during the study period. Discussion: Low percentage of blood culture positivity and high incidence of MDR organisms are a matter of concern. Days to develop febrile neutropenia were inversely associated with overall survival (OS), emphasizing the importance of preventive measures against infections. Conclusion: Infections continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality among AML patients.","['(c) The Author(s), 2021.']","['Mishra, Kundan', 'Kumar, Suman', 'Ninawe, Sandeep', 'Bahl, Rajat', 'Meshram, Ashok', 'Singh, Kanwaljeet', 'Jandial, Aditya', 'Sahu, Kamal Kant', 'Sandal, Rajeev', 'Khera, Sanjeev', 'Yanamandra, Uday', 'Khurana, Harshit', 'Kumar, Rajiv', 'Kapoor, Rajan', 'Sharma, Sanjeevan', 'Singh, Jasjit', 'Das, Satyaranjan', 'Ahuja, Ankur', 'Somasundaram, Venkateshan', 'Chaterjee, Tathagat']","['Mishra K', 'Kumar S', 'Ninawe S', 'Bahl R', 'Meshram A', 'Singh K', 'Jandial A', 'Sahu KK', 'Sandal R', 'Khera S', 'Yanamandra U', 'Khurana H', 'Kumar R', 'Kapoor R', 'Sharma S', 'Singh J', 'Das S', 'Ahuja A', 'Somasundaram V', 'Chaterjee T']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6325-2972', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0382-6882']","['Department of Clinical Hematology and Stem Cell Transplant, Army Hospital (Research & Referral) Delhi, India.', 'DM (Clinical Hematology), Prof & Head of the Department, Department of Clinical Hematology & Stem Cell Transplant, Army Hospital (Research & Referral), Delhi, 110010, India.', 'Department of Microbiology, Army Hospital (Research & Referral) Delhi, India.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology and Stem Cell Transplant, Army Hospital (Research & Referral) Delhi, India.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, INHS Asvini, Mumbai, MH, India.', 'Department of Lab Sciences and Molecular Medicine, Army Hospital (Research & Referral) Delhi, India.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, PGIMER, Chandigarh, CH, India.', 'Hematology & Medical Oncology Fellow (PGY 4), Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, 84112, Utah, USA.', 'Department of Radiotherapy and Oncology, Indira Gandhi Medical College, Shimla, Himachal Pradesh, India.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Army Hospital (Research & Referral) Delhi, India.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology and Stem Cell Transplant, Army Hospital (Research & Referral) Delhi, India.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Command Hospital (Air Force), Bangaluru, KA, India.', 'Department of Clinical hematology and Stem Cell Transplant, Army Hospital (Research & Referral) Delhi.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology and Stem Cell Transplant, Army Hospital (Research & Referral) Delhi.', 'Department of Clinical hematology and Stem Cell Transplant, Army Hospital (Research & Referral) Delhi.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology and Stem Cell Transplant, Army Hospital (Research & Referral) Delhi.', 'Department of Clinical hematology and Stem Cell Transplant, Army Hospital (Research & Referral) Delhi.', 'Department of Lab Sciences and Molecular Medicine, Army Hospital (Research & Referral) Delhi, India.', 'Department of Lab Sciences and Molecular Medicine, Army Hospital (Research & Referral) Delhi, India.', 'Department of Lab Sciences and Molecular Medicine, Army Hospital (Research & Referral) Delhi, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Ther Adv Infect Dis,Therapeutic advances in infectious disease,101606715,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'febrile neutropenia', 'resource constraint settings']",2021/08/17 06:00,2021/08/17 06:01,['2021/08/16 05:55'],"['2021/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/16 05:55 [entrez]', '2021/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/20499361211036592 [doi]', '10.1177_20499361211036592 [pii]']",epublish,Ther Adv Infect Dis. 2021 Aug 4;8:20499361211036592. doi: 10.1177/20499361211036592. eCollection 2021 Jan-Dec.,20210804,,,,PMC8358573,"['Conflict of interest statement: The authors declare that there is no conflict of', 'interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism of KDM4C-dependent MALAT1/miR-328-3p/CCND2 axis in cytarabine (Ara-C) resistance in the context of AML. Methods: Bioinformatics analysis was performed to predict the targeting relationships among KDM4C, MALAT1, miR-328-3p, and CCND2 in AML, which were validated with chromatin immunoprecipitation and dual-luciferase reporter assay. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction was conducted to detect the methylation of MALAT1 promoter. After conducting gain- and loss-of-function assays, we investigated the effect of KDM4C on cell Ara-C resistance. A NOD/SCID mouse model was established to further investigate the roles of KDM4C/MALAT1/miR-328-3p/CCND2 in Ara-C resistant AML cells. Results: KDM4C expression was upregulated in AML. KDM4C upregulation promoted the demethylation in the promoter region of MALAT1 to increase its expression, MALAT1 targeted and inhibited miR-328-3p expression, enhancing the Ara-C resistance of HL-60/A. miR-328-3p targeted and suppressed the expression of CCND2 in HL-60/A to inhibit the Ara-C resistance. Mechanistically, KDM4C regulated miR-328-3p/CCND2 through MALAT1, resulting in Ara-C resistance in AML. Findings in an in vivo xenograft NOD/SCID mouse model further confirmed the contribution of KDM4C/MALAT1/miR-328-3p/CCND2 in the Ara-C resistant AML. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that KDM4C may up-regulate MALAT1 expression, which decreases the expression of miR-328-3p. The downregulation of miR-328-3p increased the level of CCND2, which induced the Ara-C resistance in AML.","['(c) The Author(s), 2021.']","['Xue, Lu', 'Li, Chunhuai', 'Ren, Jin', 'Wang, Yue']","['Xue L', 'Li C', 'Ren J', 'Wang Y']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7956-106X'],"['Department of Pediatrics Hematology, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, P.R.

The BM microenvironment is inherently complex and extensive studies have been devoted to identifying the niche that maintains HSPC homeostasis and supports hematopoietic potential. The Notch signaling pathway is required for the emergence of the definitive Hematopoietic Stem Cell (HSC) during embryonic development, but its role in BM HSC homeostasis is convoluted. Recent work has begun to explore novel roles for the Notch signaling pathway in downstream progenitor populations. In this review, we will focus an important role for Notch signaling in the establishment of a T cell primed sub-population of Common Lymphoid Progenitors (CLPs). Given that its activation mechanism relies primarily on cell-to-cell contact, Notch signaling is an ideal means to investigate and define a novel BM lymphopoietic niche. We will discuss how new genetic model systems indicate a pre-thymic, BM-specific role for Notch activation in early T cell development and what this means to the paradigm of lymphoid lineage commitment. Lastly, we will examine how leukemic T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) blasts take advantage of Notch and downstream lymphoid signals in the pathological BM niche.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Sottoriva and Pajcini.'],"['Sottoriva, Kilian', 'Pajcini, Kostandin V']","['Sottoriva K', 'Pajcini KV']",,"['Department of Pharmacology and Regenerative Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine, Chicago, IL, United States.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Regenerative Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine, Chicago, IL, United States.']",['eng'],"['R01 HL134971/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007829/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*Notch signaling', '*T cell development', '*bone marrow niches', '*hematopoieisis', '*lymphopoiesis']",2021/08/17 06:00,2021/12/22 06:00,['2021/08/16 05:49'],"['2021/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/16 05:49 [entrez]', '2021/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2021.723055 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2021 Jul 28;12:723055. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.723055. eCollection 2021.,20210728,20211221,,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Lymphopoiesis/*physiology', 'Osteoblasts/*metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",PMC8355626,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This hematologic disorder constitutes about 25% of cancer prognosis among children and adolescents. D-Carvone, a monocyclic monoterpene obtained from the essential oils extracted from plants is reported to possess the various biological activities. The present study was aimed to investigate the anticancer potential of D-Carvone against the human leukemic Molt-4 cells. The cytotoxicity of DCarvone was analyzed by MTT assay. The level of lipid peroxidation and antioxidants were determined. The intracellular ROS, MMP and apoptosis were demonstrated by fluorescent staining techniques. The MTT assay revealed that the D-Carvone treatment suppressed the viability of Molt-4 cells and the IC50 was determined at 20 microM/ml. The D-Carvone treatment was increased the oxidative stress and reduced the level of antioxidants in the Molt-4 cell lines. The increased intracellular ROS, apoptotic cell death, and diminished MMP was noted in the D-Carvone treatment. In the Molt-4 cells, D-carvone induced the apoptosis in a time and dose dependent manner by the activation of caspases-8, -9 and -3. Thus, data provide insights for the clinical application of D-Carvone in the treatment of blood cancer Molt-4 cells.

Traditional elements and treatment responses at different time points (TPs) were evaluated to classify risk groups and adjust the treatment strategy. Treatment-related mortality was found in 11 (3.89%) patients, 49 (17.31%) patients relapsed, and the ten-year prospective event-free survival (pEFS) was 78.2+/-2.5%. Univariate analysis revealed that significant differences were not found in the pEFS of traditional risk factors, including sex, age, WBC count or chromosome status; good responses of BM smears at TP1 and minimal residual disease (MRD) levels at TP2 and TP3 were strongly associated with prolonged pEFS. Compared with the IR or the HR group, patients in the SR group presented with longer pEFS and a lower relapse rate. Multivariable analysis of outcomes and hazard ratios revealed that a positive MRD level was a key risk factor. WES or RNAseq was performed for BM relapse patients, and adverse and unreported genetic abnormalities were discovered. Favorable outcomes were acquired in the cohort.

Because of its potency for expanding stem cell populations, delivery of exogenous LIF to diseased tissue could have therapeutic value. However, systemic elevations of LIF can have negative, off-target effects. We tested whether inflammatory cells expressing a LIF transgene under control of a leukocyte-specific, CD11b promoter provide a strategy to target LIF to sites of damage in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, leading to increased numbers of muscle stem cells and improved muscle regeneration. However, transgene expression in inflammatory cells did not increase muscle growth or increase numbers of stem cells required for regeneration. Instead, transgene expression disrupted the normal dispersion of macrophages in dystrophic muscles, leading to transient increases in muscle damage in foci where macrophages were highly concentrated during early stages of pathology. The defect in inflammatory cell dispersion reflected impaired chemotaxis of macrophages to C-C motif chemokine ligand-2 and local increases of LIF production that produced large aggregations of cytolytic macrophages. Transgene expression also induced a shift in macrophage phenotype away from a CD206+, M2-biased phenotype that supports regeneration. However, at later stages of the disease when macrophage numbers declined, they dispersed in the muscle, leading to reductions in muscle fiber damage, compared to non-transgenic mdx mice. Together, the findings show that macrophage-mediated delivery of transgenic LIF exerts differential effects on macrophage dispersion and muscle damage depending on the stage of dystrophic pathology.",['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

In our previous study, we found that interleukin-10 receptor (IL-10R) was overexpressed in most AML cells, and played an important role in promoting the stemness of leukemia cells. In this study, we developed a novel ligand-based CAR-T cell targeting IL-10R, which displayed striking cytotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo against AML cells. Except for monocytes, it had no significant adverse effects on the normal hematopoietic system, including CD34(+) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs).

The frequency of TdT+ LBCL, how to best categorize these cases, and their clinicopathologic features, molecular landscape, and relationship to classic B-LBL remain to be better defined. TdT expression was therefore assessed in 258 LBCL and the results correlated with the cytologic, phenotypic, and cytogenetic findings. Targeted mutational analysis, review of prior biopsies, and assessment of clinical associations was performed in the 6 cases with >10% TdT+ cells. All 6 TdT+ LBCL were blastoid-appearing, CD34-, MYC+, BCL2+, and had MYC rearrangements (R) (5/6 with BCL2 and/or BCL6-R). 5/6 had a prior TdT- LBCL and/or follicular lymphoma and all had an aggressive course. Fifteen nonsynonymous variants in 11 genes were seen in the 4/5 tested cases with mutations. TdT+ and TdT- areas in 1 case showed identical mutations. The mutational profiles were more like those reported in germinal center B-cell type-diffuse LBCL rather than B-LBL. Evolution from preceding TdT- lymphomas was nondivergent in 1/3 tested cases and partially divergent in 2. The clinicopathologic and cytogenetic features of these 6 cases were similar to those found in a meta-analysis that included additional cases of TdT+ LBCL or B-LBL following follicular lymphoma. Thus, TdT+, CD34- large B-cell neoplasms with MYC rearrangements and often a ""double hit"" are rare, frequently a transformational event and aggressive but are distinct from classic B-LBL.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

However, small studies have shown conflicting results regarding the additive humoral dysfunction with their use. METHODS: We prospectively compared vaccine responses in patients on ibrutinib (n = 10) with matched controls (n = 16) and analyzed whether a protein-based (tetanus-diphtheria toxoid) or a carbohydrate (Pneumovax) moiety will result in an improved immunological response. RESULTS: An appropriate serological response in IgG titers for diphtheria was seen in 40% of patients on ibrutinib and 31% of patients in the control group. About 30% of patients on ibrutinib and 44% of patients in the control group had an adequate response to tetanus toxoid. None of the patients on ibrutinib mounted an adequate response to Pneumovax, while 31% of patients in the control arm responded appropriately. These differences in the results were considered insignificant as all p values were greater than the cut-off of 0.05. CONCLUSION: Our study did not show significant detrimental vaccine responses with ibrutinib and calls for larger multicenter studies to elucidate long-term effects, especially in patients with prior exposure to anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

However, the precise molecular mechanism underlying its cytotoxic effects has not yet been completely elucidated. Here, we clarify the mechanism via which the ethanol extract of P. kaempferi (EEPK) leads to cytotoxicity mediated by apoptosis in mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) originating from the salivary glands. METHODS: We investigated the mechanism underlying the anticancer efficacy of EEPK in human MEC in vitro by assessing mitochondrial dysfunction, mRNA levels, and morphological changes in apoptotic cell nuclei as well as by using a cytotoxicity assay, flow cytometric analysis, and western blotting. RESULTS: EEPK inhibited the growth of two human MEC cells and stimulated the induction of caspase-mediated apoptosis that was accompanied by mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Compared with the vehicle control groups, EEPK decreased myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) expression in both cells whereas it significantly decreased B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) expression in MC3 cells only. The EEPK-induced altered Mcl-1 expression was caused by translational inhibition and proteasomal degradation. Additionally, EEPK significantly increased p-Bcl-2 (Ser(70)) expression regardless of its total forms by facilitating the activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway, which exhibited cell context dependency. Nevertheless, JNK activation following EEPK treatment was, at least in part, required for the proapoptotic efficacy of EEPK in both cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that EEPK-induced alterations of Mcl-1 inhibition and JNK/Bcl-2 phosphorylation cause apoptosis and provided basic preclinical data for future clinical trials regarding therapy for patients with MEC.",['(c) 2021.

We measured ALV-J viremia and PRL levels in the plasma of two groups of ALV-J-infected adult chickens. Furthermore, recombinant chicken PRL (cPRL) was used to assess how cPRL affects ALV-J virus replication both in vivo and in vitro. The results showed that PRL levels in the plasma of adult chickens infected with ALV-J were lower than those of uninfected chickens, and that the difference was more significant in the avian leukemia pathological apparent changes. Notably, the fluctuations in PRL levels might influence the disappearance of ALV-J viremia in chickens. The in vitro results showed that preincubating DF-1 cells with cPRL before ALV-J infection elicited the best antiviral effects. Moreover, these effects were not dose-dependent. in vivo, injection of cPRL into ALV-J-infected chicks could reduce the levels of viremia at the 14 days post infection (dpi). Additionally, the expression of the interferon-stimulated genes oligoadenylate synthetase-like (OSAL) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) increased, and that of the proinflammatory cytokine-encoding TNTalpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 genes decreased in the spleens of ALV-J-infected chicks injected with cPRL, leading to inhibition of viral replication at the 7 dpi. Collectively, our data demonstrated that PRL plays an important antiviral role in the immune response to ALV-J infection. This is the first report of the relationship between ALV-J infection and PRL.

Currently, conventional DNA-damage-based chemotherapy drugs are approved as standard therapeutic regimens for these malignancies. Although many improvements have been made, patients with relapsed or refractory hematological malignancies have a poor prognosis. Therefore, novel and practical therapeutic approaches are required for the treatment of these diseases. Interestingly several studies have shown that targeting Wee1 kinase in the Hematological malignancies, including AML, ALL, CML, CLL, DLBCL, BL, MCL, etc., can be an effective therapeutic strategy. It plays an essential role in regulating the cell cycle process by abrogating the G2-M cell-cycle checkpoint, which provides time for DNA damage repair before mitotic entry. Consistently, Wee1 overexpression is observed in various Hematological malignancies. Also, in healthy normal cells, repairing DNA damages occurs due to G1-S checkpoint function; however, in the cancer cells, which have an impaired G1-S checkpoint, the damaged DNA repair process depends on the G2-M checkpoint function. Thus, Wee1 inhibition could be a promising target in the presence of DNA damage in order to potentiate multiple therapeutic drugs. This review summarized the potentials and challenges of Wee1 inhibition combined with other therapies as a novel effective therapeutic strategy in Hematological malignancies.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

In the setting of transplantation from an HLA-matched sibling (MSD-T), few randomized studies have been conducted. We conducted a prospective, single-center, open-label, randomized study of low-dose thymoglobulin (2.5 mg/kg) for chronic GVHD prevention. A total of 120 patients with acute leukemia were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio. After a median follow-up of 27 months, the cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD in the ATG and non-ATG groups was 25.0% and 65.4% (p < 0.001), respectively. The ATG group had an increased relapse rate compared with the non-ATG-group (20.0% vs. 9.3%; p = 0.055), with risks that differed according to cytogenetic subgroup (high-risk, 29.6% vs. 9.3%, p = 0.042; non-high-risk, 12.2% vs. 9.2%, p = 0.596). Chronic GVHD-free and relapse-free survival (cGRFS) was higher in the ATG group (46.7% vs. 19.4%; p = 0.070), and the difference was significant in a cytogenetic non-high-risk subgroup (45.5% vs. 0%; p = 0.038). No differences were observed in other survival outcomes. Improved physical components in quality-of-life scores were observed in the ATG group at 12 months after transplantation. A higher rate of Epstein-Barr virus reactivation was observed in the ATG group (21.8% vs. 5.1%; p = 0.013), whereas no between-group differences for other complications. In conclusion, the low-dose thymoglobulin effectively prevented chronic GVHD in MSD-T, resulting in improvement in quality-of-life and cGRFS, whereas the necessity of caution for high-risk acute

However, the traditional manufacture of CAR-T cells requires leukapheresis to isolate large amounts of peripheral blood T cells, thus making some patients ineligible for the procedure. METHODS: We developed a simple method for CAR-T cell preparation requiring small volumes of peripheral blood. First, CD3(+) T cells isolated from 50 mL peripheral blood from patients (B-cell malignancies) were stimulated with immobilized anti-CD3/RetroNectin in 6-well plates and then transduced with CAR-expressing lentiviral vector. After 4 d, the T cells were transferred to culture bags for large-scale CAR-T cell expansion. In vitro and animal experiments were performed to evaluate the activity of the manufactured CAR-T cells. Finally, 29 patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and 9 patients with B-cell lymphoma were treated with the CAR-T cells. RESULTS: The CAR-T cells were expanded to 1-3 x 10(8) cells in 8-10 d and successfully killed B cell-derived malignant tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. For patients with B-ALL, the complete remission rate was 93% 1 month after CAR-T cell infusion; after 12 months, the overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival rates were 69% and 31%, respectively. For patients with lymphoma, the objective response rate (including complete and partial remission) was 78% 2 months after CAR-T cell infusion, and after 12 months, the OS and progression-free survival rates were 71% and 43%, respectively. Cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) occurred in 65.51% and 55.56% of patients with B-ALL and B-cell lymphoma, respectively; severe CRS developed in 20.69% of patients with B-ALL and in no patients with lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel method can generate sufficient numbers of CAR-T cells for clinical use from 50-100 mL peripheral blood, thus providing an alternative means of CAR-T cell generation for patients ineligible for leukapheresis.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Cancer Biology & Medicine.'],"['Han, Lu', 'Zhou, Jian', 'Li, Linlin', 'Zhou, Keshu', 'Zhao, Lingdi', 'Zhu, Xinghu', 'Yin, Qingsong', 'Li, Yufu', 'You, Hongqin', 'Zhang, Jishuai', 'Song, Yongping', 'Gao, Quanli']","['Han L', 'Zhou J', 'Li L', 'Zhou K', 'Zhao L', 'Zhu X', 'Yin Q', 'Li Y', 'You H', 'Zhang J', 'Song Y', 'Gao Q']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9232-1623'],"['Department of Immunology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University and Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou 450008, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University and Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou 450008, China.', 'Department of Medical Microbiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang 453003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University and Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou 450008, China.', 'Department of Immunology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University and Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou 450008, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University and Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou 450008, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University and Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou 450008, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University and Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou 450008, China.', 'Department of Immunology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University and Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou 450008, China.', 'The Shenzhen Pregene Biopharma Company, Ltd., Shenzhen 518118, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University and Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou 450008, China.', 'Department of Immunology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University and Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou 450008, China.']",['eng'],"['LHGJ2020173/Henan Medical Science and Technique Foundation', 'SBGJ20180850/Henan Medical Science and Technique Foundation', '182300410344/Natural Science Foundation of Henan']",['Journal Article'],China,Cancer Biol Med,Cancer biology & medicine,101588850,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell malignancy', 'CAR-T cells', 'Fewer initial lymphocytes', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'peripheral blood']",2021/08/15 06:00,2021/08/15 06:00,['2021/08/14 06:44'],"['2021/08/14 06:44 [entrez]', '2021/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/15 06:00 [medline]']","['j.issn.2095-3941.2021.0040 [pii]', '10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2021.0040 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Cancer Biol Med. 2021 Aug 14. pii: j.issn.2095-3941.2021.0040. doi: 10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2021.0040.,20210814,,,,PMC8610157,['No potential conflicts of interest are disclosed.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We retrospectively explored the association between three circulating biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction (thrombomodulin, syndecan-1, VEGFR-1) measured in prospectively collected blood samples and risk of thromboembolism in 55 cases and 165 time-matched controls, treated according to the NOPHO ALL2008 protocol. In age-, sex-, and risk group-adjusted analysis, increasing levels of thrombomodulin and VEGFR-1 were independently associated with increased odds of developing thromboembolism (OR 1.37 per 1 ng/mL [95% CI 1.201.56, P < 0.0001] and OR 1.21 per 100 pg/mL [95% CI 1.021.21, P = 0.005], respectively). These associations remained significant when including only samples drawn >30 days before thromboembolic diagnosis. Thrombomodulin levels were on average 3.2 ng/mL (95% CI 2.6-8.2 ng/mL) higher in samples with measurable asparaginase activity (P < 0.0001). Among single nucleotide variants located in or neighboring coding genes for the three biomarkers, none were significantly associated with odds of thromboembolism. If results are validated in another cohort, thrombomodulin and VEGFR-1 could serve as predictive biomarkers, identifying patients in need of preemptive antithrombotic prophylaxis.","['(c) 2021.

HSCs harboring driver mutations will be positively selected and cells carrying these mutations will rise in frequency. While ARCH is a known risk factor for blood malignancies, such as Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), why some people who harbor ARCH driver mutations do not progress to AML remains unclear. Here, we model the interaction of positive and negative selection in deeply sequenced blood samples from individuals who subsequently progressed to AML, compared to healthy controls, using deep learning and population genetics. Our modeling allows us to discriminate amongst evolutionary classes with high accuracy and captures signatures of purifying selection in most individuals. Purifying selection, acting on benign or mildly damaging passenger mutations, appears to play a critical role in preventing disease-predisposing clones from rising to dominance and is associated with longer disease-free survival. Through exploring a range of evolutionary models, we show how different classes of selection shape clonal dynamics and health outcomes thus enabling us to better identify individuals at a high risk of malignancy.",['(c) 2021.

This success has led to multiple exciting follow-up studies, including investigations related to the discovery of predictors of response, relapse, and the mechanism of action of this therapy. While venetoclax + HMA has shown significant benefit in elderly patients unfit for chemotherapy, further questions remain as to how this therapy can be expanded into other populations including relapsed or refractory patients and younger newly diagnosed patients with adverse risk features.

There have been numerous reports of increased frequency of serious infections including invasive fungal infections (IFI) in patients on ibrutinib. METHODS: Demographic and clinical features of all patients receiving ibrutinib at a single tertiary care center were collected from electronic medical records. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed to find out the factors associated with infection. RESULTS: A total of 244 patients received ibrutinib for hematologic malignancies, of which 44 (18.0%) experienced >/= 1 serious infection including 5 (2.0%) with IFI (1 pulmonary cryptococcosis, 4 pulmonary aspergillosis), 39 (16.0%) with bacterial infections and 8 (3.3%) with viral infections. Ten patients (4.1%) experienced multiple infections or co-infections while on ibrutinib and 10 (4.1%) expired or were transferred to hospice as a result of infection. In multivariate analysis risk factors that were less common in uninfected versus infected patients included advanced age (73 years vs. 77 years), Eastern Cooperative Oncologic Grade (ECOG) performance score >/= 2 (6.5% vs. 31.8%) and concurrent use of steroids (4.5% vs. 20.5%) or other cytotoxic agents (0% vs. 4.6%). CONCLUSIONS: There was a high rate of serious infection but relatively few IFI in patients receiving ibrutinib. Most patients who developed serious infections while on ibrutinib had additional predisposing risk factors including concurrent use of steroids or other cytotoxic agents, advanced age and frailty.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association', 'for Infectious Diseases.

Summarizing the results of previous studies, we infer that low- and medium-concentration arsenic cause lung diseases in a dose-dependent manner. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is recognized as a chemotherapeutic drug for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), also having a significant effect on lung cancer. The anti-lung cancer mechanisms of ATO include inhibition of proliferation, promotion of apoptosis, anti-angiogenesis, and inhibition of tumor metastasis. In this review, we summarized the role of arsenic in lung disease from both pathogenic and therapeutic perspectives. Understanding the paradoxical effects of arsenic in the lungs may provide some ideas for further research on the occurrence and treatment of lung diseases.",['(c) 2021.

METHODS: We developed a 51-gene (151.5kB) low-cost targeted myeloid panel based on single-molecule molecular inversion probes to comprehensively evaluate the genomic profile of Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). RESULTS: A total of 50 children with clinical and pathological features of JMML were sequenced at high coverage. Among the 50 patients, 44(88%) harbored mutations in one of the RAS/MAPK-pathway genes, most frequently in NRAS (32%), followed by PTPN11 (28%) and NF1 (22%). One-fifth of children had more than one mutation, with 5 cases harboring two RAS pathway mutations. Monosomy 7 was detected in 32% (16) patients, and five of these did not harbor any RAS pathway mutations. Children with monosomy 7 showed shorter overall survival compared with their wild-type counterparts (P = .02). CONCLUSION: Our study highlights that comprehensive genomic profiling identifies at least one mutation in almost 90% of JMML patients.

In the last decade since it was first reported, there have been over 480 individuals identified carrying a pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline GATA2 variant with symptoms of G2DS, with 240 of these confirmed to be familial and 24 de novo. For those that develop myeloid malignancy (75% of all carriers with G2DS disease symptoms), the median age of onset is 17 years (range 0-78 years) and myelodysplastic syndrome is the first diagnosis in 75% of these cases with acute myeloid leukemia in a further 9%. All variant types appear to predispose to myeloid malignancy and immunodeficiency. Apart from lymphedema in which haploinsufficiency seems necessary, the mutational requirements of the other less common G2DS phenotypes is still unclear. These predominantly loss-of-function variants impact GATA2 expression and function in numerous ways including perturbations to DNA binding, protein structure, protein:protein interactions, and gene transcription, splicing, and expression.

This study applied network analyses in a balanced sample of cancer survivors to 1) explore the clustering of symptoms and 2) assess differences in symptom clustering between cancer types, treatment regimens, and short-term and long-term survivors. METHODS: This study used cross-sectional survey data, collected between 2008 and 2018, from the population-based Patient Reported Outcomes Following Initial Treatment and Long Term Evaluation of Survivorship registry, which included survivors of 7 cancer types (colorectal cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, thyroid cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma). Regularized partial correlation network analysis was used to explore and visualize the associations between self-reported symptoms (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire) and the centrality of these symptoms in the network (ie, how strongly a symptom was connected to other symptoms) for the total sample and for subgroups separately. RESULTS: In the total sample (n = 1330), fatigue was the most central symptom in the network with moderate direct relationships with emotional symptoms, cognitive symptoms, appetite loss, dyspnea, and pain. These relationships persisted after adjustments for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Connections between fatigue and emotional symptoms, appetite loss, dyspnea, and pain were consistently found across all cancer types (190 for each), treatment regimens, and short-term and long-term survivors. CONCLUSIONS: In a heterogenous sample of cancer survivors, fatigue was consistently the most central symptom in all networks. Although longitudinal data are needed to build a case for the causal nature of these symptoms, cancer survivorship rehabilitation programs could focus on fatigue to reduce the overall symptom burden.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

As the French reference center for ATL, we retrospectively analyzed 47 consecutive ATL (acute, n = 23; lymphoma, n = 14; chronic, n = 8; smoldering, n = 2) patients between 2006 and 2016 (median age 51 years, 96% Afro-Caribbean origin). The 3-year overall survival (OS) was 15.8%, 11.3%, and 85.7% for acute, lymphoma, and indolent (chronic and smoldering) forms respectively. Among aggressive subtypes, 20 patients received, as frontline therapy, high dose of zidovudine and interferon alfa (AZT-IFN) resulting in an overall response rate (ORR) of 39% (complete response [CR] 33%) and 17 chemotherapy resulting of an ORR of 59% (CR 50%). Ninety-five infections occurred in 38 patients, most of whom had an acute subtype (n = 73/95; 77%). During their follow-up, patients receiving frontline chemotherapy or frontline AZT-IFNalpha developed infections in 74% (n = 14/19) and 89% (n = 24/27) of the cases respectively. Sixty-four (67%) of infections were microbiologically documented. Among them, invasive fungal infections (IFI, n = 11) included 2 Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, 5 invasive aspergillosis, and 4 yeast fungemia. IFI exclusively occurred in patients with acute subtype mostly exposed to AZT-IFNalpha (n = 10/11) and experiencing prolonged (> 10 days) grade 4 neutropenia. Patients with aggressive subtype experiencing IFI had a lower OS than those who did not (median OS 5.4 months versus 18.4 months, p = 0.0048). ATL patients have a poor prognosis even in the modern era. Moreover, the high rate of infections impacts their management especially those exposed to AZT-IFNalpha.","['(c) 2021.

This study was performed to investigate the frequency of reactivation and risk factors of infection acquired at an early age of nontransplant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy with weekly monitoring of CMV levels in Turkey. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-center study of 172 pediatric patients (102 boys and 70 girls) with ALL. All patients were monitored routinely for CMV-DNA at the initial presentation of leukemia and twice a week during chemotherapy. The CMV immunoglobulin (Ig)M/IgG titers were measured at admission. RESULTS: CMV seropositivity at baseline was 90,11%. The overall prevalence of CMV infection (viremia) was 70.34%, 116 of whom were seropositive for CMV IgG and 5 of whom were negative for CMV at the time of ALL diagnosis. Reactivation was more common than de novo CMV infections (P=0.000). CMV seropositivity at the beginning of the leukemia diagnosis was found to be an independent predictor for developing CMV infection (P=0.001). A total of 60 CMV infection episodes were treated with antivirals. Four of these included organ involvement. The duration of CMV-DNA viremia episodes was longer in patients with CMV-DNA >/=1000 copies/mL (n=45) than in those with lower CMV-DNA levels (P=0.002). Infection was shown not to be associated with chemotherapy phase. CONCLUSION: This study suggests the importance of monitoring for CMV infections in developing countries because of frequent reactivations in seropositive ALL patients.

Because of high-intensive therapy, up to 5% of patients suffer from treatment-related mortality (TRM). Abdominal complications are frequent, however, literature on this subject is sparse. We aimed to characterize severe abdominal pain (AP) and hyperbilirubinemia experienced by pediatric AML patients treated according to the Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (NOPHO)-AML 2004 protocol (n=313). Patients were censored at hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and relapse. Toxicity information was collected prospectively. Additional information was requested retrospectively from the treating centers. Sixteen episodes of hyperbilirubinemia and 107 episodes of AP were reported. The treating centers deemed infection (30%) and typhlitis (18%) as the most frequent causes of AP. Six patients developed appendicitis (2%). Patients experiencing concurrent AP and sepsis had a high risk of TRM (36%, n=4). Eighty percent of episodes with hyperbilirubinemia fulfilled the European Society for Bone and Marrow Transplantation criteria for sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. In conclusion, abdominal complications were frequent with infection considered the predominate cause. Most patients with hyperbilirubinemia fulfilled the criteria for sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. AML treatment might be associated with appendicitis. Patients suffering from concurrent AP and sepsis had a high risk of TRM indicating that high awareness of abdominal complications is essential to reduce mortality, especially during sepsis.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

This monoclonal antibody provides favorable results for MS by reducing the frequency of exacerbations and the risk of disability progression, significantly more pronounced when compared with teriflunomide. The drug can be used in patients with active relapsing MS and SPMS with exacerbations, with the ineffectiveness of first-line drugs as one of the options for second-line therapy, in patients with highly active MS, especially with a high risk of PML (transfer from natalizumab), as well as if there are difficulties in organizing intravenous courses in day hospitals (produced as outpatient injections).",,"['Boyko, A N', 'Smirnova, N F', 'Shchukin, I A', 'Guseva, M E', 'Volkov, A I']","['Boyko AN', 'Smirnova NF', 'Shchukin IA', 'Guseva ME', 'Volkov AI']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2975-4151', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2506-0371', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6308-9706', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3778-5206', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2676-452X']","['Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University, Moscow, Russia.', 'Federal Center for Brain and Neurotechnology of the FMBA, Moscow, Russia.', 'Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University, Moscow, Russia.', 'Federal Center for Brain and Neurotechnology of the FMBA, Moscow, Russia.', 'Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University, Moscow, Russia.', 'Federal Center for Brain and Neurotechnology of the FMBA, Moscow, Russia.', 'Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University, Moscow, Russia.', 'Federal Center for Brain and Neurotechnology of the FMBA, Moscow, Russia.']",['rus'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Russia (Federation),Zh Nevrol Psikhiatr Im S S Korsakova,Zhurnal nevrologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S.

Physical activity (PA) may influence symptom severity and quality of life (QOL). OBJECTIVES: This study examined changes in symptoms and QOL during ALL maintenance in children categorized by symptom cluster and explored the influence of PA and symptoms on QOL. METHODS: Self-report of fatigue, sleep disturbance, and depression; QOL; and PA were measured at the beginning and end of maintenance in 42 children aged 3 to 18 years with ALL. Children were categorized into symptom cluster groups based on measurements at the beginning of maintenance. RESULTS: Two latent classes of symptom clusters (low and high) were identified with significant differences between groups in symptoms at both the beginning and end maintenance (P < .01). Each group's symptom levels did not change during maintenance. Quality-of-life was different between groups at both time points (P < .01) and did not improve. Children with low symptoms and high PA at the beginning of maintenance had better QOL as treatment ended compared with the physically active high-symptom group and the inactive high-symptom group (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Children with higher symptoms did not experience an improvement with time. Symptom and PA levels may influence QOL at the end of treatment. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Maintenance therapy is a long time (1.5 years) in a child's life. Symptom assessment is needed early in maintenance; interventions are needed for children with high levels.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: nCRT with CP is a standard treatment for locally advanced EAC. The results of Cancer and Leukemia Group B 80803 support the use of induction chemotherapy followed by PET-directed chemoradiation therapy. METHODS: We retrospectively identified all patients with EAC who underwent the treatments above followed by esophagectomy. We assessed incidences of pathologic complete response (pCR), near-pCR (ypN0 with >/=90% response), and surgical complications between treatment groups using Fisher's exact test and logistic regression; disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and evaluated using the log-rank test and extended Cox regression. RESULTS: In total, 451 patients were included: 309 (69%) received induction chemotherapy before nCRT (FOLFOX, n=70; CP, n=239); 142 (31%) received nCRT with CP. Rates of pCR (33% vs 16%, P=0.004), near-pCR (57% vs 33%, P<0.001), and 2-year DFS (68% vs 50%, P=0.01) were higher in the induction FOLFOX group than in the induction CP group. Similarly, the rate of near-pCR (57% vs 42%, P=0.04) and 2-year DFS (68% vs 44%, P<0.001) were significantly higher in the FOLFOX group than in the no-induction group. CONCLUSIONS: Induction FOLFOX followed by PET-directed nCRT may result in better histopathologic response rates and DFS than either induction CP plus PET-directed nCRT or nCRT with CP alone.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

MEK1 and MEK2 phosphorylate and activate ERK1 and ERK2. However, whether MEK1 and MEK2 differentially regulate these processes is unknown. To define the function of Mek genes in the activation of the ERK pathway during hematopoiesis, we generated a mutant mouse line carrying a hematopoietic-specific deletion of the Mek1 gene function in a Mek2 null background. Inactivation of both Mek1 and Mek2 genes resulted in death shortly after birth with a severe anemia revealing the essential role of the ERK pathway in erythropoiesis. Mek1 and Mek2 functional ablation also affected lymphopoiesis and myelopoiesis. In contrast, mice that retained one functional Mek1 (1Mek1) or Mek2 (1Mek2) allele in hematopoietic cells were viable and fertile. 1Mek1 and 1Mek2 mutants showed mild signs of anemia and splenomegaly, but the half-life of their red blood cells and the response to erythropoietic stress were not altered, suggesting a certain level of Mek redundancy for sustaining functional erythropoiesis. However, subtle differences in multipotent progenitor distribution in the bone marrow were observed in 1Mek1 mice, suggesting that the two Mek genes might differentially regulate early hematopoiesis.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Beuret, Fortier-Beaulieu, Rondeau, Roy, Houde, Balabanian,', 'Espeli and Charron.']","['Beuret, Laurent', 'Fortier-Beaulieu, Simon-Pierre', 'Rondeau, Vincent', 'Roy, Sophie', 'Houde, Nicolas', 'Balabanian, Karl', 'Espeli, Marion', 'Charron, Jean']","['Beuret L', 'Fortier-Beaulieu SP', 'Rondeau V', 'Roy S', 'Houde N', 'Balabanian K', 'Espeli M', 'Charron J']",,"[""Centre de Recherche sur le Cancer de l'Universite Laval, Centre de Recherche du CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval (Oncology), Quebec, QC, Canada."", ""Centre de Recherche sur le Cancer de l'Universite Laval, Centre de Recherche du CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval (Oncology), Quebec, QC, Canada."", 'Universite de Paris, Institut de Recherche Saint Louis, EMiLy, Inserm U1160, Paris, France.', 'OPALE Carnot Institute, The Organization for Partnerships in Leukemia, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', ""Centre de Recherche sur le Cancer de l'Universite Laval, Centre de Recherche du CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval (Oncology), Quebec, QC, Canada."", ""Centre de Recherche sur le Cancer de l'Universite Laval, Centre de Recherche du CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval (Oncology), Quebec, QC, Canada."", 'Universite de Paris, Institut de Recherche Saint Louis, EMiLy, Inserm U1160, Paris, France.', 'OPALE Carnot Institute, The Organization for Partnerships in Leukemia, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'Universite de Paris, Institut de Recherche Saint Louis, EMiLy, Inserm U1160, Paris, France.', 'OPALE Carnot Institute, The Organization for Partnerships in Leukemia, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', ""Centre de Recherche sur le Cancer de l'Universite Laval, Centre de Recherche du CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval (Oncology), Quebec, QC, Canada."", 'Department of Molecular Biology, Medical Biochemistry and Pathology, Universite Laval, Quebec, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,['NOTNLM'],"['ERK/MAP kinase pathway', 'Mek genes', 'erythropoiesis', 'gene inactivation', 'hematopoiesis']",2021/08/14 06:00,2021/08/14 06:01,['2021/08/13 07:12'],"['2020/12/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/13 07:12 [entrez]', '2021/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/14 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2021.639022 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Jul 27;9:639022. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.639022. eCollection 2021.,20210727,,,,PMC8353236,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the inherent regulation of LSCs remains largely obscure. Herein, we integratedly analyzed miRNA and gene expression alterations in bone marrow (BM) Lin(-)Sca1(+)c-Kit(+) cells (LSKs) of a tet-off inducible CML mouse model, Scl/tTA-BCR/ABL (BA). Methods: Scl/tTA and TRE-BA transgenic mice were crossed in the presence of doxycycline to get double transgenic mice. Both miRNA and mRNA expression profiles were generated from BM LSKs at 0 and 3 weeks after doxycycline withdrawal. The target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs were predicted, followed by the miRNA-mRNA network construction. In vitro and in vivo experiments were further performed to elucidate their regulation and function in CML progression. Results: As a result of the integrated analysis and experimental validation, an anti-apoptotic pathway emerged from the fog. miR-142a was identified to be downregulated by enhanced ERK-phosphorylation in BA-harboring cells, thereby relieving its repression on Ciapin1, an apoptosis inhibitor. Moreover, miR-142a overexpression could partially rescue the abnormal anti-apoptotic phenotype and attenuate CML progression. Conclusion: Taken together, this study explored the miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks in murine CML LSKs and demonstrated that ERK-miR-142a-Ciapin1 axis played an essential role in CML pathogenesis.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Chen, Xie, Liu, Liu, Li, Zhang, Zhang, Wang, Zhang, Sun and', 'Huang.']","['Chen, Zhiwei', 'Xie, Yinyin', 'Liu, Dan', 'Liu, Ping', 'Li, Fei', 'Zhang, Zhanglin', 'Zhang, Mengmeng', 'Wang, Xiaolin', 'Zhang, Yuanliang', 'Sun, Xiaojian', 'Huang, Qiuhua']","['Chen Z', 'Xie Y', 'Liu D', 'Liu P', 'Li F', 'Zhang Z', 'Zhang M', 'Wang X', 'Zhang Y', 'Sun X', 'Huang Q']",,"['Shanghai Institute of Hematology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, National Research Center for Translational Medicine at Shanghai, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, National Research Center for Translational Medicine at Shanghai, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Systems Biomedicine, Ministry of Education, Shanghai Center for Systems Biomedicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, National Research Center for Translational Medicine at Shanghai, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Jiangxi Academy of Clinical Medical Sciences, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Transfusion, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, National Research Center for Translational Medicine at Shanghai, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, National Research Center for Translational Medicine at Shanghai, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, National Research Center for Translational Medicine at Shanghai, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, National Research Center for Translational Medicine at Shanghai, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, National Research Center for Translational Medicine at Shanghai, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['Ciapin1', 'apoptosis', 'chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'miR-142a', 'miRNA-mRNA network']",2021/08/14 06:00,2021/08/14 06:01,['2021/08/13 07:11'],"['2021/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/13 07:11 [entrez]', '2021/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/14 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.718731 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Jul 27;11:718731. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.718731. eCollection 2021.,20210727,,,,PMC8354203,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the role of LIF in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains to be explored. The present study explored the hypothesis that LIF is important for NSCLC development by measuring LIF expression and its downstream signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation in tumor samples derived from patients with NSCLC. The association between LIF expression and clinical features was analyzed in two cancer subtypes. The effects of LIF on cell proliferation, migration and invasion were also evaluated in a NSCLC-derived cell line, A549. LIF mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly higher in tumor tissues compared with those in the corresponding adjacent and normal lung tissues. Regarding NSCLC subtypes, LIF expression was significantly higher in adenocarcinoma than in squamous cell carcinoma tissues. It was also found that phosphorylated-STAT3 levels were higher in tumor tissues compared with those in the corresponding adjacent and normal lung tissues, which was in agreement with the LIF expression levels in NSCLC tissues. Clinically, overexpression of LIF was positively correlated with aggressive tumor characteristics, including lymph node metastasis and advanced tumor stage. In A549 cells, LIF treatment enhanced cell proliferation, migration and invasion. LIF also increased STAT3 phosphorylation in A549 cells, and the STAT3 inhibitor Stattic decreased A549 cell migration and invasion following LIF stimulation. The present results demonstrate that LIF is overexpressed in NSCLC, and that LIF can promote NSCLC development through activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway.

Epidemiological studies have shown that various genetic factors play a crucial role in leukemogenesis. Recent genetic association studies on cancer risk have focused on the effects of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes that regulate inflammation and tumor suppression, such as chemokines, TP53 and cytochrome P450s (CYPs). Genetic polymorphisms in the 3' untranslated region of the C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12; rs1801157) and TP53 (rs1042522) genes have been suggested to influence the risk of ALL in children, while other studies have indicated an association between the CYP1 subfamily A member 1 (CYP1A1)*2C (rs1048943) allele and leukemia risk. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible association of rs1801157 (CXCL12), rs1042522 (TP53) and rs1048943 (CYP1A1*2C) SNPs with an increased susceptibility of developing ALL. These SNPs were analyzed in 86 children or adolescent patients with ALL and 125 control subjects by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism and allelic-specific chain reaction techniques. A higher frequency of CYP1A1*2C heterozygotes and TP53 rare homozygotes, which include the proline (Pro)/Pro genotype, was observed among children with ALL and control subjects, whereas no significant differences were observed for the CXCL12 SNP. Furthermore, the analysis of various allelic combinations of the aforementioned gene polymorphisms demonstrated a markedly increased risk of developing ALL in children. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that there was a strong association between CYP1A1*2C heterozygotes, as well as the TP53 Pro/Pro genotype, and an increased susceptibility for pediatric ALL in Caucasians.","['Copyright (c) 2021, Spandidos Publications.']","['Kampouraki, Eleni', 'Lourou, Marilena', 'Zervou, Maria I', 'Ampazoglou, Evangelia-Dimitra', 'Yachnakis, Emmanuel', 'Katzilakis, Nikolaos', 'Goulielmos, George N', 'Stiakaki, Eftichia']","['Kampouraki E', 'Lourou M', 'Zervou MI', 'Ampazoglou ED', 'Yachnakis E', 'Katzilakis N', 'Goulielmos GN', 'Stiakaki E']",,"['Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University Hospital of Heraklion and Laboratory of Blood Diseases and Childhood Cancer Biology, Medical School, University of Crete, 71003 Heraklion, Greece.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University Hospital of Heraklion and Laboratory of Blood Diseases and Childhood Cancer Biology, Medical School, University of Crete, 71003 Heraklion, Greece.', 'Section of Molecular Pathology and Human Genetics, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Crete, University of Crete, 71003 Heraklion, Greece.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University Hospital of Heraklion and Laboratory of Blood Diseases and Childhood Cancer Biology, Medical School, University of Crete, 71003 Heraklion, Greece.', 'Laboratory of Bio-Medical Data Analyses, Digital Applications and Interdisciplinary Approaches, University of Crete, 71003 Heraklion, Greece.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University Hospital of Heraklion and Laboratory of Blood Diseases and Childhood Cancer Biology, Medical School, University of Crete, 71003 Heraklion, Greece.', 'Section of Molecular Pathology and Human Genetics, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Crete, University of Crete, 71003 Heraklion, Greece.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University Hospital of Heraklion and Laboratory of Blood Diseases and Childhood Cancer Biology, Medical School, University of Crete, 71003 Heraklion, Greece.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Greece,Oncol Lett,Oncology letters,101531236,,['NOTNLM'],"['CXCL12', 'CYP1A1', 'TP53', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'pediatric', 'polymorphisms']",2021/08/14 06:00,2021/08/14 06:01,['2021/08/13 07:07'],"['2021/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2021/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/13 07:07 [entrez]', '2021/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/ol.2021.12920 [doi]', 'OL-0-0-12920 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Lett. 2021 Sep;22(3):659. doi: 10.3892/ol.2021.12920.

In the current study, CAR T cells were designed using a ligand binding domain instead of an scFv to target stem-like leukemia cells. Thrombopoietin (TPO), the natural ligand to the myeloproliferative leukemia protein (MPL) receptor, was used as the antigen binding domain to engage MPL expressed on hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and erythropoietic and megakaryocytic acute myeloid leukemias (AML). TPO-CAR T cells were tested in vitro against AML cell lines with varied MPL expression to test specificity. TPO-CAR T cells were specifically activating and cytotoxic against MPL+ leukemia cell lines. Though the TPO-CAR T cells did not extend survival in vivo, it successfully cleared the MPL+ fraction of leukemia cells. As expected, we also show the TPO-CAR is cytotoxic against MPL expressing bone marrow compartment in AML xenograft models.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening complication of COVID-19 and has been linked with severe hyperinflammation. Dexamethasone has emerged as standard of care for COVID-19 associated respiratory failure. In a non-randomized prospective phase II multi-center study, we asked whether targeted inhibition of Janus kinase-mediated cytokine signaling using ruxolitinib is feasible and efficacious in SARS-CoV-2- induced ARDS with hyperinflammation. Sixteen SARS-CoV-2 infected patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation for ARDS were treated with ruxolitinib in addition to standard treatment. Ruxolitinib treatment was well tolerated and 13 patients survived at least the first 28 days on treatment, which was the primary endpoint of the trial. Immediate start of ruxolitinib after deterioration was associated with improved outcome, as was a lymphocyte-to-neutrophils ratio above 0.07. Together, treatment with the janus-kinase inhibitor ruxolitinib is feasible and might be efficacious in COVID-19 induced ARDS patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.

An economic evaluation conducted at an early stage of development of CAR-T therapy for treatment of adult relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemia could provide insight into factors contributing to the cost of treatment, the potential clinical benefits, and what the health system can afford. Traditionally, stakeholders are engaged in certain parts of health technology assessment processes, such as in the identification and selection of technologies, formulation of recommendations, and implementation of recommendations; however, little is known about processes for stakeholder engagement during the conduct of the assessment. This is especially the case for economic evaluations. Stakeholders, such as clinicians, policy-makers, patients, and their support networks, have insight into factors that can enhance the validity of an economic evaluation model. This research outlines a specific methodology for stakeholder engagement and represents an avenue to enhance health economic evaluations and support the use of these models to inform decision making for resource allocation. This protocol may inform a tailored framework for stakeholder engagement processes in future economic evaluation model development. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will involve clinicians, healthcare researchers, payers, and policy-makers, as well as patients and their support networks in the conduct and verification of an early economic evaluation of a novel health technology to incorporate stakeholder-generated knowledge. Three stakeholder-specific focus groups will be conducted using an online adaptation of the nominal group technique to elicit considerations from each. This study will use CAR-T therapy for adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia as a basis for investigating broader stakeholder engagement processes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study received ethics approval from the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute Research Ethics Board (REB 20200320-01HT) and the results will be shared via conference presentations, peer-reviewed publications, and ongoing stakeholder engagement.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

Accurate and rapid detection of KMT2A-PTD is important for outcome prediction and clinical management, but next-generation sequencing-based quantitative research is still lacking. In this study, we developed a targeted RNA-based next-generation sequencing panel, together with single primer enrichment and unique molecular identifiers, to identify KMT2A-PTD as well as AML-related gene fusions and other driver mutations. Our panel showed high sensitivity, accuracy, and reproducibility in detecting the fusion ratio of KMT2A-PTD. The mutation profile of KMT2A-PTD-positive patients with AML was characterized and different distribution patterns of driver mutations were found according to KMT2A-PTD fusion ratio level. Survival analyses revealed that the fusion ratio of KMT2A-PTD did not affect clinical outcome, but a novel molecular combination, namely, KMT2A-PTD/DNMT3A/FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication, was associated with poor prognosis. Finally, it was shown that the dynamic changes in the KMT2A-PTD fusion ratio were consistent with the overall process of disease progression. In summary, we applied the unique molecular identifier-based RNA panel to quantitatively detect KMT2A-PTD and elucidate its clinical relevance, which complemented the integrative network of various genetic alterations in AML.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Association for Molecular Pathology and American Society for', 'Investigative Pathology.

For chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) the existence of more than 200 subgroups of tumor IGHV antigen-binding sites, so called ""stereotypical"" antigen receptors (SAR) has been shown. For others lymphomas the possibility of SARs is also suggested. The aim of this study is to compare the tumor IGHVs and possible SARs in various B-cell malignancies in Russia and other countries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included samples of 1800 CLL patients, 52 patients with mantle cell lymphoma, 48 patients with hairy cell lymphoma and 37 patients with splenic marginal cell lymphoma. The nucleotide sequences of the IGHV genes were determined according to ERIC protocol. RESULTS: In CLL most common IGHV genes were IGHV1-69, IGHV1-2, IGHV3-30 and IGHV4-34. The most common SARs were CLL#1, CLL#6, CLL#2, CLL#3. In MCL the most common genes were IGHV4-34, IGHV3-21, IGHV3-23. In 5 MCL patients CDR3 sequences were identified matching definitions of a stereotyped. In the half of SMZL patients was identified gene IGHV1-2. Other IGHV genes were much less common. Two pairs of SMZL patients have motives similar to each other. In HCL IGHV repertoire was the most variable, no trends for antigen receptor stereotypy were observed. It was found that SARs are highly disease-specific both at the level of nucleotide and amino acid sequences. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that antigens crucial for the pathogenesis of B-cell malignancies could be disease-specific. Further studies on extended samples of non-CLL patients concerning the role of SARs in pathogenesis of these diseases may also contribute to the development of new diagnostic and prognostic markers.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

However, whether excess body weight is independently associated with adverse outcomes following initial pediatric acute leukemia (AL) treatment is still unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the impact of overweight/obesity at diagnosis on pediatric AL prognosis following initial treatment by performing an extensive database search up to January 22, 2021. Twenty-three studies were included, providing data for 15689 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 2506 children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Data from 12 studies were pooled in the meta-analysis. Children with overweight/obesity at diagnosis of ALL had poorer event free-survival (random-effects hazard ratio of 1.44, 95%CI 1.16-1.79, p = 0.0008), but no difference in overall survival (random-effects hazard ratio 1.33, 95%CI 0.77-2.29, p = 0.31) when compared with healthy-weight children. Children with overweight/obesity at diagnosis of AML had no difference in event-free survival (random-effects hazard ratio of 0.88, 95%CI 0.48-1.59, p = 0.66) or overall survival (random-effects hazard ratio 1.40, 95%CI 0.78-2.49, p = 0.26), when compared with healthy-weight children. This systematic review and meta-analysis indicates that overweight/obesity negatively affects the prognosis of children with ALL.

Stanniocalcin 1 (STC1) secreted by MSC has been demonstrated to promote the survival of neoplastic cells and was suggested a marker for minimal residual disease of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Therefore, we evaluated the expression of STC1 in MSC from AML patients (MSCAML) compared to MSC from healthy donors (MSCHD).Methods: Liquid culture assays of MSCAML and MSCHD were performed to compare expansion capacity. Gene expression profiles of MSCAML vs. MSCHD were established. Secretion of STC1 was tested by ELISA in MSCAML vs. MSCHD and expression of STC1 in AML- vs. HD-BM by immunohistochemistry. In addition, co-cultures of AML cells on MSC were initiated and ultrastructural intercellular communication patterns were investigated. Finally, the effect of blocking STC1 on AML cells was evaluated.Results: MSCAML showed significant decreased expansion capacity compared to MSCHD. Gene analysis revealed marked overexpression of STC1 in MSCAML. ELISA and immunohistochemical findings confirmed this observation. Electron microscopy analysis showed reciprocal stimulation between AML cells and MSC. Blockade of STC1 did not significantly affect AML cell proliferation and apoptosis.Discussion: Characteristics of MSC differ depending on whether they originate from AML patients or from HD. STC1 was mostly overexpressed in MSCAML compared to MSCHD. In vitro blockade of STC1, however, was not associated with AML cell proliferation and apoptosis.Conclusion: Differences in expression levels of glycoproteins from MSCAML compared to MSCHD not necessarily assume that these molecules are niche-relevant in leukemic disease.",,"['Schelker, Roland Christian', 'Kratzer, Andrea', 'Muller, Gunnar', 'Brochhausen, Christoph', 'Hart, Christina', 'Stempfl, Thomas', 'Heudobler, Daniel', 'Moehle, Christoph', 'Herr, Wolfgang', 'Iberl, Sabine', 'Grassinger, Jochen']","['Schelker RC', 'Kratzer A', 'Muller G', 'Brochhausen C', 'Hart C', 'Stempfl T', 'Heudobler D', 'Moehle C', 'Herr W', 'Iberl S', 'Grassinger J']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology & Oncology, University Hospital of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology & Oncology, University Hospital of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology & Oncology, University Hospital of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology & Oncology, University Hospital of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Center of Excellence for Fluorescent Bioanalytics (KFB), University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology & Oncology, University Hospital of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Center of Excellence for Fluorescent Bioanalytics (KFB), University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology & Oncology, University Hospital of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology & Oncology, University Hospital of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology & Oncology, University Hospital of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'St. Elisabeth Hospital, Straubing, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cell', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'stanniocalcin 1']",2021/08/14 06:00,2021/08/31 06:00,['2021/08/13 05:35'],"['2021/08/13 05:35 [entrez]', '2021/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/16078454.2021.1962048 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2021 Dec;26(1):565-576. doi: 10.1080/16078454.2021.1962048.,,20210830,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '76687-96-2 (teleocalcin)']","['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Glycoproteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Up-Regulation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the overall efficacy and safety of cladribine-containing regimens in the induction treatment of newly diagnosed AML patients. METHODS: Eligible studies were identified from the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases. Efficacy was assessed by CR rate, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). Safety was evaluated based on the early death (ED) rate, days for neutrophils<0.5 x 10(9)/L, days for platelets<50 x 10(9)/L, and duration of hospital stay after treatment. RESULTS: A total of 14 clinical trials were included in this meta-analysis, enrolling a total of 1058 newly diagnosed AML patients. The pooled estimate with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for CR was 64% (95% CI: 58-70%). Compared with the control group, the CR rate of the cladribine-containing regimen was higher (OR was 1.92 (95% CI: 1.55-2.38)). The combined ED rate was estimated to be 10% (95% CI: 5-14%). Compared with the control group, the ED rate of the cladribine-containing regimen was not increased (OR was 1.09 (95% CI: 0.78-1.53)). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests that cladribine-containing regimens are likely to be effective and safe for induction treatment of newly diagnosed AML patients.

Clinical outcome discrepancies reported in clinical trials and real-life settings stimulate the search for new prognostic factors. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 315 MDS, 20-30% blast acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) patients treated with azacitidine in 12 centers cooperating within the Polish Adult Leukemia Group (PALG). RESULTS: The median number of AZA cycles was 7 (1-69) and 24% patients received fewer than 4 cycles (early failure, EF). Serum albumin level was an independent predictor of EF occurrence. Complete remission (CR) was obtained in 20% and partial remission (PR) in 12% of patients. Hematologic improvement - erythroid (HI-E), neutrophil (HI-N), or platelet (HI-P) was achieved in 51%, 36%, and 48% of patients, respectively. No factors significantly predicted CR or PR in the multivariate analysis. For HI-E and HI-P, lower LDH level predicted response. Median survival was 15 (13-19) months. Lower serum albumin level, serious infection and receiving <4 AZA cycles independently predicted a worse overall survival (OS) (p < 0.05).

All therapies for these neoplasms have peculiar effects on the bone marrow, but little evidence has been described in the literature.Areas covered This review examines BM morphological changes following the main treatments in Philadelphia-negative MPNs. Hydroxyurea can reduce the cellularity of the erythroid and megakaryocyte lineages but has minimal impact on fibrotic evolution. There is general agreement on its dysplastic effects, with a high incidence of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. Interferon treatment can reduce or normalize BM cellularity, improve erythropoiesis, and reduce the number and atypicality of megakaryocytes. Most data describe reduction or complete resolution of marrow fibrosis; dysplastic effects are not reported. Anagrelide may induce an increase in the number of BM megakaryocytes, especially immature megakaryocytes or precursors, and a worsening of marrow fibrosis or increased transformation of essential thrombocythemia into myelofibrosis. Ruxolitinib can improve or stabilize BM fibrosis and reduces the frequency and dense clustering of megakaryocytes.Expert opinion Since previous therapy can modify BM features, it is essential to obtain information on previous or current therapies and to collect complete clinical information.",,"['Pich, Achille', 'Beggiato, Eloise', 'Godio, Laura', 'Riera, Ludovica', 'Francia di Celle, Paola', 'Lanzarone, Giuseppe', 'Benevolo, Giulia']","['Pich A', 'Beggiato E', 'Godio L', 'Riera L', 'Francia di Celle P', 'Lanzarone G', 'Benevolo G']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3175-7797', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3200-9654']","['Section of Pathology, Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Hematology, AOU Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino-Presidio Ospedaliero Molinette, Turin, Italy.', 'Pathology, AOU Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino-Presidio Ospedaliero Molinette, Turin, Italy.', 'Pathology, AOU Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino-Presidio Ospedaliero Molinette, Turin, Italy.', 'Pathology, AOU Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino-Presidio Ospedaliero Molinette, Turin, Italy.', 'Hematology, AOU Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino-Presidio Ospedaliero Molinette, Turin, Italy.', 'Hematology, AOU Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino-Presidio Ospedaliero Molinette, Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm', 'anagrelide', 'bone marrow', 'hydroxyurea', 'interferon', 'ruxolitinib']",2021/08/14 06:00,2021/08/14 06:00,['2021/08/13 05:34'],"['2021/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/14 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/13 05:34 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2021.1967138 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2021 Sep;14(9):841-850. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2021.1967138.

Methods: The clinical data of T-LGLL patients between 2009 and 2019 in Jiangsu Province Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Differences in baseline clinical data, treatment responses, and survival outcomes in patients with STAT3 mutations or with no mutations were compared. Results: A total of 80 patients were included, including 66 patients without STAT3 mutation and 14 patients (17.5%) with STAT3 mutation. The frequency of Y640F mutation was the highest (42.9%) . Compared with non STAT3 mutation group, STAT3 mutation group had lower HGB (67.5 g/L vs 82.5 g/L, P=0.018) , lower neutrophil count (0.665x10(9)/L vs 1.465x10(9)/L, P<0.001) , higher LDH (229 U/L vs 198 U/L, P=0.041) , higher ferritin (402.5 g/L vs 236.0 g/L, P=0.029) , higher expression rate of TCR Vbeta subfamily (89.2% vs 65.4%, P=0.014) and higher proportion of patients with treatment indications (100% vs 74%, P=0.033) . The complete remission rates of STAT3 mutation group and non mutation group were 38.5% and 32.7%, respectively, with no significant difference (P=0.748) . The overall response rate of first-line immunosuppressive therapy in STAT3 mutation group and non mutation group were 69.2% and 69.4%, respectively, with no significant difference (P=1.000) . The median follow-up time was 63 (2-121) months. There was no significant difference in the overall survival time between the two groups (P=0.170) . Conclusions: T-LGLL patients with STAT3 mutations seems to be correlated with an increased tumor burden and high treatment demand, and had a good response to first-line immunotherapies.

In this study, we investigated the nationwide incidence of acute leukemia among children with DS and compared their epidemiologic characteristics with those of children with acute leukemia but without DS. Materials and Methods: Using the National Health Insurance Service database, we selected patients with acute leukemia aged 0-19 years at diagnosis between 2007 and 2016. Results: Among the 4,697 children with acute leukemia, 54 (1.1%) had DS. The median incidence rate of leukemia with DS by year was 1.3% (range, 0.2%-2.0%). Sixteen patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; 29.6%) and 36 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML; 66.7%) had DS. The DS group showed younger age at diagnosis than the non-DS group, and diagnosis of AML was more frequent in the DS group than in the non-DS group (3 years vs. 9 years, p<0.001; 66.7% vs. 32.4%, P<0.001, respectively). The 5-year overall survival was comparable between the DS and non-DS groups (88.0% vs. 81.9%, p=0.375). Among all the Koreans born between 2007 and 2008, the incidences of acute leukemia, ALL, and AML were 49.25, 20.75, and 163.38 times higher, respectively, in the DS group than in the non-DS group. Conclusion: Our findings support the fact that the incidence of acute leukemia is higher among patients with DS than among those without DS in Korea. However, the DS and non-DS groups in this study had a comparable overall survival rate.",,"['Choi, Young Bae', 'Yoo, Keon Hee']","['Choi YB', 'Yoo KH']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Ajou University Hospital, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Health Science and Technology, SAIHST, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Stem Cell & Regenerative Medicine Institute, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Korea (South),Cancer Res Treat,Cancer research and treatment,101155137,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Childhood', 'Down syndrome Lymphoma', 'Precursor cell lymphoblastic leukemia-lymphoma']",2021/08/13 06:00,2021/08/13 06:00,['2021/08/12 19:17'],"['2021/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/12 19:17 [entrez]', '2021/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['crt.2021.368 [pii]', '10.4143/crt.2021.368 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Cancer Res Treat. 2021 Aug 10. pii: crt.2021.368. doi: 10.4143/crt.2021.368.,20210810,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results from long-term follow-up with brain magnetic resonance imaging of childhood cancer survivors.,274-283,10.2478/raon-2021-0032 [doi],"INTRODUCTION: Radiation-induced cavernomas (RIC) after cranial radiotherapy have an unknown risk of hemorrhage. Zabramski magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) classification is touted as being able to indicate non-radiation-induced cavernomas hemorrhage risk. The aim of our study was to assess the hemorrhage risk of RIC during long-term follow-up of childhood cancer survivors based on brain MRI examinations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed retrospectively long-term follow-up data of 36 childhood cancer survivors after initial diagnosis with acute leukemia (n = 18) or brain tumor (n = 18), all treated with cranial radiotherapy. Detected RIC in long-term follow-up brain MRI (1.5 or 3 Tesla) were classified following the Zabramski MRI classification and were categorized into ""high"" (Zabramski type I, II or V) or ""low"" (type III or IV) risk of hemorrhage. RESULTS: 18 patients (50%) showed RIC with a significant relation to the original tumor entity (p = 0.023) and the cumulative radiation dose to the brain (p = 0.016): all 9 childhood cancer survivors diagnosed with medulloblastoma developed RIC. We classified RIC in only 3/36 childhood cancer survivors (8%) (1 patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia [Zabramski type II] and 2 patients with medulloblastoma [type I and type II]) as high risk for hemorrhage, the remaining RIC were classified as Zabramski type IV with low risk for hemorrhage. None of the childhood cancer survivors with RIC showed symptomatic hemorrhages. CONCLUSIONS: RIC are common late effects in childhood cancer survivors treated with cranial radiotherapy affecting half of these patients. However, only a few RIC (occurring in 8% of all reviewed childhood cancer survivors) were classified as high risk for hemorrhage and none of the childhood cancer survivors with RIC developed symptomatic hemorrhages. Thus, we conclude that RIC are low-risk findings in brain MRI and the course is mainly benign.","['(c) 2021 Lucas Becker, Judith Gebauer, Jan Kuchler, Christian Staackmann, Hannes', 'Schacht, Melchior Lauten, Ulf Jensen-Kondering, Peter Schramm, Thorsten Langer,', 'Alexander Neumann, published by Sciendo.']","['Becker, Lucas', 'Gebauer, Judith', 'Kuchler, Jan', 'Staackmann, Christian', 'Schacht, Hannes', 'Lauten, Melchior', 'Jensen-Kondering, Ulf', 'Schramm, Peter', 'Langer, Thorsten', 'Neumann, Alexander']","['Becker L', 'Gebauer J', 'Kuchler J', 'Staackmann C', 'Schacht H', 'Lauten M', 'Jensen-Kondering U', 'Schramm P', 'Langer T', 'Neumann A']",,"['Department of Neuroradiology, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Luebeck, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Luebeck, Germany.', 'Institute for Endocrinology and Diabetes, University of Luebeck, Luebeck Germany.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Luebeck, Germany.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Luebeck, Germany.', 'Department of Neuroradiology, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Luebeck, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Luebeck, Germany.', 'Department of Radiology and Neuroradiology, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Neuroradiology, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Luebeck, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Luebeck, Germany.', 'Department of Neuroradiology, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Luebeck, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Poland,Radiol Oncol,Radiology and oncology,9317213,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['brain magnetic resonance imaging', 'cavernomas', 'childhood cancer survivors', 'cranial radiotherapy', 'hemorrhage']",2021/08/13 06:00,2021/09/21 06:00,['2021/08/12 17:38'],"['2021/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/12 17:38 [entrez]', '2021/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['raon-2021-0032 [pii]', '10.2478/raon-2021-0032 [doi]']",epublish,Radiol Oncol. 2021 Aug 10;55(3):274-283. doi: 10.2478/raon-2021-0032.,20210810,20210920,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Brain Neoplasms/radiotherapy', '*Cancer Survivors', 'Cerebral Hemorrhage/classification/diagnostic imaging/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hemangioma, Cavernous, Central Nervous System/classification/*diagnostic imaging/etiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/radiotherapy', '*Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Medulloblastoma/radiotherapy', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/etiology', 'Meningioma/diagnostic imaging/etiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/classification/*diagnostic imaging/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/radiotherapy', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",PMC8366727,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several cytogenetic abnormalities have been associated with AML. Among these is the NUP98-HOXA9 (NA9) translocation that fuses the Phe-Gly repeats of nucleoporin NUP98 to the homeodomain of the transcription factor HOXA9. The mechanisms enabling NA9-induced leukemia are poorly understood. Here, we conducted a genetic screen in Drosophila for modifiers of NA9. The screen uncovered 29 complementation groups, including genes with mammalian homologs known to impinge on NA9 activity. Markedly, the modifiers encompassed a diversity of functional categories, suggesting that NA9 perturbs multiple intracellular events. Unexpectedly, we discovered that NA9 promotes cell fate transdetermination and that this phenomenon is greatly influenced by NA9 modifiers involved in epigenetic regulation. Together, our work reveals a network of genes functionally connected to NA9 that not only provides insights into its mechanism of action, but also represents potential therapeutic targets.",,"['Gavory, Gwenaelle', 'Baril, Caroline', 'Laberge, Gino', 'Bidla, Gawa', 'Koonpaew, Surapong', 'Sonea, Thomas', 'Sauvageau, Guy', 'Therrien, Marc']","['Gavory G', 'Baril C', 'Laberge G', 'Bidla G', 'Koonpaew S', 'Sonea T', 'Sauvageau G', 'Therrien M']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2226-5988', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3817-2118', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4333-7266', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2047-7650']","['Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Departement de medecine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Departement de pathologie et de biologie cellulaire, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS Genet,PLoS genetics,101239074,IM,,,2021/08/13 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/08/12 17:22'],"['2021/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/24 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/12 17:22 [entrez]']","['10.1371/journal.pgen.1009730 [doi]', 'PGENETICS-D-21-00368 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Genet. 2021 Aug 12;17(8):e1009730. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1009730. eCollection 2021 Aug.,20210812,20211207,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (NUP98-HOXA9 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '0 (nuclear pore complex protein 98)']","['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Drosophila melanogaster/genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/genetics', 'Gene Expression/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics', 'Gene Regulatory Networks/genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism/physiology', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogenes/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",PMC8384169,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Supporting the staff who interpret blood film morphology is therefore essential for a safe laboratory service. This paper describes an open-access, web-based decision support tool, developed by the authors to support morphological diagnosis, arising from earlier studies identifying mechanisms of error in blood film reporting. The effectiveness of this intervention was assessed using the unique resource offered by the online digital morphology Continuing Professional Development scheme (DM scheme) offered by the UK National External Quality Assessment Service for Haematology, with more than 3000 registered users. This allowed the effectiveness of decision support to be tested within a defined user group, each of whom viewed and interpreted the morphology of identical digital blood films. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of the study was to test the effectiveness of the decision support system in supporting users to identify and interpret abnormal morphological features. The secondary objective was to determine the pattern and frequency of use of the system for different case types, and to determine how users perceived the support in terms of their confidence in decision-making. METHODS: This was a comparative study of identical blood films evaluated either with or without decision support. Selected earlier cases from the DM scheme were rereleased as new cases but with decision support made available; this allowed a comparison of data sets for identical cases with or without decision support. To address the primary objectives, the study used quantitative evaluation and statistical comparisons of the identification and interpretation of morphological features between the two different case releases. To address the secondary objective, the use of decision support was assessed using web analytical tools, while a questionnaire was used to assess user perceptions of the system. RESULTS: Cases evaluated with the aid of decision support had significantly improved accuracy of identification for relevant morphological features (mean improvement 9.8%) and the interpretation of those features (mean improvement 11%). The improvement was particularly significant for cases with higher complexity or for rarer diagnoses. Analysis of website usage demonstrated a high frequency of access for web pages relevant to each case (mean 9298 for each case, range 2661-24,276). Users reported that the decision support website increased their confidence for feature identification (4.8/5) and interpretation (4.3/5), both within the context of training (4.6/5) and also in their wider laboratory practice (4.4/5). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study demonstrate that directed online decision support for blood morphology evaluation improves accuracy and confidence in the context of educational evaluation of digital films, with effectiveness potentially extending to wider laboratory use.","['(c)Claire Hutchinson, Michelle Brereton, Julie Adams, Barbara De La Salle, Jon', 'Sims, Keith Hyde, Richard Chasty, Rachel Brown, Karen Rees-Unwin, John Burthem.', 'Originally published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research', '(https://www.jmir.org), 09.08.2021.']","['Hutchinson, Claire', 'Brereton, Michelle', 'Adams, Julie', 'De La Salle, Barbara', 'Sims, Jon', 'Hyde, Keith', 'Chasty, Richard', 'Brown, Rachel', 'Rees-Unwin, Karen', 'Burthem, John']","['Hutchinson C', 'Brereton M', 'Adams J', 'De La Salle B', 'Sims J', 'Hyde K', 'Chasty R', 'Brown R', 'Rees-Unwin K', 'Burthem J']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2314-6558', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0584-909X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5953-5622', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2926-7441', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3172-5173', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2137-5955', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5388-4565', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8956-8724', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3088-2695', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7361-9328']","['Medicine, Dentistry and Human Sciences, Faculty of Health, University of Plymouth, Plymouth, United Kingdom.', 'University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust, Plymouth, United Kingdom.', 'Manchester Foundation Trust, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'Manchester Foundation Trust, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'UK NEQAS Haematology, Watford, United Kingdom.', 'UK NEQAS Haematology, Watford, United Kingdom.', 'Manchester Foundation Trust, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'Manchester Foundation Trust, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Cancer Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'Manchester Foundation Trust, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Cancer Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Canada,J Med Internet Res,Journal of medical Internet research,100959882,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*blood cell morphology', '*decision support', '*diagnosis', '*digital morphology', '*external quality assessment in hematology', '*morphology education']",2021/08/13 06:00,2021/10/27 06:00,['2021/08/12 17:19'],"['2020/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/28 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/12 17:19 [entrez]', '2021/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/27 06:00 [medline]']","['v23i8e20815 [pii]', '10.2196/20815 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Internet Res. 2021 Aug 9;23(8):e20815. doi: 10.2196/20815.,20210809,20211026,,"['Humans', '*Online Systems', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",PMC8386359,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These alterations most commonly involve reciprocal translocations at specific breakpoint regions within KMT2A. To date, more than 100 translocation partner genes of KMT2A have been identified, with different effects on risk stratification. METHODS AND RESULTS: We report the case of a mature plasmacytoid dendritic cells proliferation associated with B lymphoblasts harboring a KMT2A-ARHGEF12 fusion. This rare rearrangement, resulting from a cryptic deletion on the long arm of chromosome 11, is located outside the known major and minor breakpoint regions of KMT2A, not reported to date. The review of the few cases of KMT2A-ARHGEF12 reveals the tendency of this deletion to occur in therapy related hematologic neoplasm and confer unfavorable prognosis. CONCLUSION: This review sheds light into the rare KMT2A-ARHGEF12 fusion in leukemia.

According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), new cancer diagnoses increased to 18.1 million in 2018, with 9.6 million deaths, bringing the global cancer rate to 23.6 million by 2030. In 1942, the discovery of nitrogen mustard as an alkylating agent was a tremendous breakthrough in cancer chemotherapy. It acts by binding to the DNA, and creating cross linkages between the two strands, leading to arrest of DNA replication and eventual cell death. Nitrogen lone pairs of 'nitrogen mustard' produce an intermediate 'aziridinium ion' at molecular level, which is very reactive towards DNA of tumour cells, resulting in multiple side effects with therapeutic consequences. Owing to its high reactivity and peripheral cytotoxicity, several improvements have been made with structural modifications for the past 75 years to enhance its efficacy and improve the direct transport of drugs to the tumour cells. Alkylating agents were among the first non-hormonal substances proven to be active against malignant cells and also, the most valuable cytotoxic therapies available for the treatment of leukaemia and lymphoma patients. This review focus on the versatile use of alkylating agents and the structure activity relationship (SAR) of each class of these compounds. This could provide an understanding for design and synthesis of new alkylating agents having enhanced target specificity and adequate bioavailability.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Karati, Dipanjan', 'Mahadik, Kakasaheb Ramoo', 'Trivedi, Piyush', 'Kumar, Dileep']","['Karati D', 'Mahadik KR', 'Trivedi P', 'Kumar D']",,"['Poona college of Pharmacy, Bharati Vidyapeeth (Deemed to be University) Erandwane, Pune- 411038, Maharashtra.

Hematotoxicity of VPA is particularly important in pediatrics because patients at this age are at a growing risk of leukemia. For a conclusive agreement about the toxicity of VPA, in this study, we systematically reviewed the literature in which the hematological consequences of VPA had been emphasized. <P> Methods: A systematic literature search was performed in June 2021 on electronic databases to find original research on the association between VPA therapy and hematotoxicity in pediatric patients. For this purpose, the following search terms ""hematotoxicity"", ""valproic acid"" and ""pediatrics"" with different spellings and similar terms, were searched in the title, keywords, and abstracts of articles. The data were collected and used for qualitative data description. <P> Results: A total of 36 relevant articles with an overall 1381 study population were included. The results showed that VPA could cause severe hematotoxicity in children even at therapeutic doses. Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and bone marrow depression are the most common complications associated with VPA therapy. Also, findings showed that after discontinuation of VPA and starting other antiepileptic drugs or reducing the administered VPA dose, hematologic damages were entirely resolved, and all the hematological parameters improved during two weeks. <P> Conclusions: This review showed that VPA therapy could cause hematotoxicity in children; hence, it is recommended to monitor hematological indices during VPA therapy. Also, according to the suggested mechanistic pathways of VPA side effects, a combination of VPA with antioxidants may reduce hematological side effects.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Riahi-Zanjani, Bamdad', 'Delirrad, Mohammad', 'Fazeli-Bakhtiyari, Rana', 'Sadeghi, Mahood', 'Zare-Zardini, Hadi', 'Jafari, Abbas', 'Ghorani-Azam, Adel']","['Riahi-Zanjani B', 'Delirrad M', 'Fazeli-Bakhtiyari R', 'Sadeghi M', 'Zare-Zardini H', 'Jafari A', 'Ghorani-Azam A']",,"['Medical Toxicology Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad.

However, whether and how CYP enzymes are regulated by miR-199a-5p are unknown. Here, we aimed to investigate the potential role of mmu-miR-199a-5p in regulating CYP2 enzymes.Regulatory effects of mmu-miR-199a-5p on CYP expression were assessed in mouse AML-12 hepatocytes. The metabolic activity of CYP2B10 was probed using cyclophosphamide (CPA) as a specific substrate. The regulatory mechanism was investigated using combined luciferase reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation.Of several important drug-metabolizing CYPs, mmu-miR-199a-5p significantly increased the mRNA levels of Cyp2a10, Cyp2c29, and Cyp2j5 in AML-12 cells with Cyp2a10 altered the most. Consistently, mmu-miR-199a-5p enhanced the expression of CYP2B10 protein and cellular metabolism of CPA. Based on database analysis, Cyp2b10 was not a direct target gene of mmu-miR-199a-5p. Thus, a mediator is necessary for the miRNA regulation of CYP2B10. We found that E4BP4 repressed Cyp2b10 transcription and expression through specific binding to a D-box element in the gene promoter. Moreover, mmu-miR-199a-5p inhibited the expression of E4bp4 at the posttranscriptional level by directly targeting the 59-65 nt segment in its 3'-UTR.In conclusion, mmu-miR-199a-5p positively regulates CYP2B10 expression through inhibiting its repressor E4BP4.

Because of its rarity and early onset in infancy underlying genetic predisposition is potentially relevant in disease initiation. METHODS AND RESULTS: We report an oncologic emergency in an infant with thoracic and intraspinal aleukaemic myeloid sarcoma causing acute myelon compression and lower leg palsy. Whole-exome sequencing of the patient's germline DNA identified a rare PALB2 (OMIM 610355) variant (p.A1079S), which is located in a domain critical for the gene's proper function within the homology-directed repair pathway. In line with potential DNA damage repair defects mediated by the PALB2 deregulation, the patient's fibroblasts showed increased sensitivity towards radiation and DNA intercalating agents. CONCLUSION: Therefore, we suggest PALB2 p.A1079S as a pathogenic variant potentially contributing to the here observed patient phenotype.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Keeping abreast of these genes is therefore of paramount importance in the field of hematology. This review focuses on PHF6, a highly conserved epigenetic transcriptional regulator that is important for neurodevelopment and hematopoiesis. PHF6 serves as a tumor suppressor protein, with PHF6 mutations and deletions often implicated in the development of T-lymphoblastic leukemia and less frequently in acute myeloid leukemia and other myeloid neoplasms. PHF6 inactivation appears to be an early event in T-lymphoblastic leukemogenesis, requiring cooperating events, including NOTCH1 mutations or overexpression of TLX1 and TLX3 for full disease development. In contrast, PHF6 mutations tend to occur later in myeloid malignancies, are frequently accompanied by RUNX1 mutations, and are often associated with disease progression. Moreover, PHF6 appears to play a role in lineage plasticity within hematopoietic malignancies, with PHF6 mutations commonly present in mixed phenotype acute leukemias with a predilection for T-lineage marker expression. Due to conflicting data, the prognostic significance of PHF6 mutations remains unclear, with a subset of studies showing no significant difference in outcomes compared to malignancies with wild-type PHF6, and other studies showing inferior outcomes in certain patients with mutated PHF6. Future studies are necessary to elucidate the role PHF6 plays in development of T-lymphoblastic leukemia, progression of myeloid malignancies, and its overall prognostic significance in hematopoietic neoplasms.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Kurzer and Weinberg.'],"['Kurzer, Jason H', 'Weinberg, Olga K']","['Kurzer JH', 'Weinberg OK']",,"['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, United States.', 'Department of Pathology, UT Southwestern, Dallas, TX, United States.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'PHF6', 'T-ALL', 'leukemia', 'tumor suppressor']",2021/08/13 06:00,2021/08/13 06:01,['2021/08/12 06:36'],"['2021/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/12 06:36 [entrez]', '2021/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.704471 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Jul 26;11:704471. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.704471. eCollection 2021.,20210726,,,,PMC8350393,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, it is pertinent to describe the efficacy and safety profile of the three products available by summarizing the current evidence. Methods: Two reviewers independently searched the Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library, to identify studies related to the use of the three CAR-T cell products for treating hematologic malignancies published up to October 5, 2020. We pooled the overall response rate, complete response rate, cytokine release syndrome, and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome of three products, and then performed subgroup analysis based on the type of product and type of tumor. Results: Thirty-three studies involving 2,172 patients were included in the analysis. All three products showed promising results in patients with different pathological subtypes and clinical characteristics that included those who did not meet the eligibility criteria of licensing trials, with overall response rates of nearly 70% or above and complete response rates of more than 50%. However, high rates of severe immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome in patients undergoing axicabtagene ciloleucel treatment and life-threatening cytokine release syndrome in patients with leukemia undergoing tisagenlecleucel treatment required special attention in practice (31%; 95% CI: 0.27-0.35 and 55%; 95% CI: 0.45-0.64, respectively). Moreover, lisocabtagene maraleucel that showed a favorable efficacy and safety in the licensing trial lacked corresponding real-world data. Conclusion: Both axicabtagene ciloleucel and tisagenlecleucel showed considerable efficacy in practice, but need special attention with respect to life-threatening toxicity that can occur in certain situations. Lisocabtagene maraleucel demonstrated excellent efficacy and safety profiles in the licensing trial, but lacked corresponding real-world data. Additional data on the three products are needed in rare histological subtypes to benefit a broader patient population.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Meng, Wu, Sun, Xun, Liu, Hu and Huang.']","['Meng, Jun', 'Wu, XiaoQin', 'Sun, Zhen', 'Xun, RenDe', 'Liu, MengSi', 'Hu, Rui', 'Huang, JianChao']","['Meng J', 'Wu X', 'Sun Z', 'Xun R', 'Liu M', 'Hu R', 'Huang J']",,"['Molecular Genetics Laboratory, Suining Central Hospital, Suining, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital, University of South China, Hengyang, China.', 'Hengyang Medical College, University of South China, Hengyang, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital, University of South China, Hengyang, China.', 'Hengyang Medical College, University of South China, Hengyang, China.', 'Hengyang Medical College, University of South China, Hengyang, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital, University of South China, Hengyang, China.']",['eng'],,['Systematic Review'],Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['CAR-T cell therapy', 'chimeric antigen receptor T-cell product', 'efficacy', 'hematologic malignancy', 'immunotherapy', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'safety']",2021/08/13 06:00,2021/08/13 06:01,['2021/08/12 06:36'],"['2021/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/12 06:36 [entrez]', '2021/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.698607 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Jul 26;11:698607. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.698607. eCollection 2021.,20210726,,,,PMC8350577,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,['Front Oncol. 2021 Oct 07;11:768128.

It is often overexpressed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is associated with poor survival and reduced efficacy of cytarabine therapy. Molecular mechanisms underlying high FOXM1 expression levels in malignant cells are still unclear. Here we demonstrate that AKT and FOXM1 constitute a positive autoregulatory loop in AML cells that sustains high activity of both pro-oncogenic regulators. Inactivation of either AKT or FOXM1 signaling results in disruption of whole loop, coordinated suppression of FOXM1 or AKT, respectively, and similar transcriptomic changes. AML cells with inhibited AKT activity or stable FOXM1 knockdown display increase in HOXA genes expression and BCL2L1 suppression that are associated with prominent sensitization to treatment with Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax. Taken together, our data indicate that AKT and FOXM1 in AML cells should not be evaluated as single independent regulators but as two parts of a common FOXM1-AKT positive feedback circuit. We also report for the first time that FOXM1 inactivation can overcome AML venetoclax resistance. Thus, targeting FOXM1-AKT loop may open new possibilities in overcoming AML drug resistance and improving outcomes for AML patients.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Chesnokov, Borhani, Halasi, Arbieva, Khan and Gartel.']","['Chesnokov, Mikhail S', 'Borhani, Soheila', 'Halasi, Marianna', 'Arbieva, Zarema', 'Khan, Irum', 'Gartel, Andrei L']","['Chesnokov MS', 'Borhani S', 'Halasi M', 'Arbieva Z', 'Khan I', 'Gartel AL']",,"['Department of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States.', 'Department of Surgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States.', 'Genome Research Core, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['AKT pathway', 'FOXM1', 'HOXA gene family', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'drug resistance', 'positive feedback loop', 'venetoclax']",2021/08/13 06:00,2021/08/13 06:01,['2021/08/12 06:36'],"['2021/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/12 06:36 [entrez]', '2021/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.696532 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Jul 26;11:696532. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.696532. eCollection 2021.,20210726,,,,PMC8350342,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This chemotherapy approach shows satisfactory responses, but the disease relapses, often repeatedly. Venetoclax (ABT-199) is a Bcl-2 inhibitor currently approved for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in adult patients ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. Given that HCL cells express Bcl-2, our aim was to evaluate venetoclax as a potential therapy for HCL. We found that clinically relevant concentrations of venetoclax (0.1 and 1 microM) induced primary HCL cell apoptosis in vitro as measured by flow cytometry using Annexin V staining. As microenvironment induces resistance to venetoclax in CLL, we also evaluated its effect in HCL by testing the following stimuli: activated T lymphocytes, stromal cells, TLR-9 agonist CpG, and TLR-2 agonist PAM3. We found decreased levels of venetoclax-induced cytotoxicity in HCL cells exposed for 48 h to any of these stimuli, suggesting that leukemic B cells from HCL patients are sensitive to venetoclax, but this sensitivity can be overcome by signals from the microenvironment. We propose that the combination of venetoclax with drugs that target the microenvironment might improve its efficacy in HCL.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Vereertbrugghen, Colado, Gargiulo, Bezares, Fernandez Grecco,', 'Cordini, Custidiano, Francois, Berchem, Borge, Paggetti, Moussay, Gamberale,', 'Giordano and Morande.']","['Vereertbrugghen, Alexia', 'Colado, Ana', 'Gargiulo, Ernesto', 'Bezares, Raimundo Fernando', 'Fernandez Grecco, Horacio', 'Cordini, Gregorio', 'Custidiano, Maria Del Rosario', 'Francois, Jean-Hugues', 'Berchem, Guy', 'Borge, Mercedes', 'Paggetti, Jerome', 'Moussay, Etienne', 'Gamberale, Romina', 'Giordano, Mirta', 'Morande, Pablo Elias']","['Vereertbrugghen A', 'Colado A', 'Gargiulo E', 'Bezares RF', 'Fernandez Grecco H', 'Cordini G', 'Custidiano MDR', 'Francois JH', 'Berchem G', 'Borge M', 'Paggetti J', 'Moussay E', 'Gamberale R', 'Giordano M', 'Morande PE']",,"['Instituto de Medicina Experimental (IMEX)-CONICET-Academia Nacional de Medicina (ANM), Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Instituto de Medicina Experimental (IMEX)-CONICET-Academia Nacional de Medicina (ANM), Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Tumor Stroma Interactions, Department of Oncology, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Seccion Hematologia, Hospital General de Agudos Dr. Teodoro Alvarez, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Seccion Hematologia, Sanatorio Municipal Dr. Julio Mendez, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Instituto de Medicina Experimental (IMEX)-CONICET-Academia Nacional de Medicina (ANM), Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Hospital de Clinicas Jose de San Martin, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Servicio de Hematologia y Transplante de Medula Osea, Instituto Alexander Fleming, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier de Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Tumor Stroma Interactions, Department of Oncology, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology, Centre Hospitalier de Luxembourg, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Instituto de Medicina Experimental (IMEX)-CONICET-Academia Nacional de Medicina (ANM), Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Departamento de Microbiologia, Parasitologia e Inmunologia, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Tumor Stroma Interactions, Department of Oncology, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Tumor Stroma Interactions, Department of Oncology, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Instituto de Medicina Experimental (IMEX)-CONICET-Academia Nacional de Medicina (ANM), Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Departamento de Microbiologia, Parasitologia e Inmunologia, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Instituto de Medicina Experimental (IMEX)-CONICET-Academia Nacional de Medicina (ANM), Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Departamento de Microbiologia, Parasitologia e Inmunologia, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Instituto de Medicina Experimental (IMEX)-CONICET-Academia Nacional de Medicina (ANM), Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Tumor Stroma Interactions, Department of Oncology, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,['NOTNLM'],"['ABT-199', 'cell death', 'hairy cell leukemia', 'leukemia microenvironment', 'venetoclax']",2021/08/13 06:00,2021/08/13 06:01,['2021/08/12 06:36'],"['2020/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/12 06:36 [entrez]', '2021/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.598319 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Jul 26;11:598319. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.598319. eCollection 2021.,20210726,,,,PMC8350736,"['RB receives payment from Microsules and Varifarma.

Recent studies have shown that Tregs, as an important component of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) microenvironments, can help AML cells to evade immune surveillance. However, their function in directly regulating the stemness of AML cells remains elusive. In this study, the increased stemness of AML cells promoted by Tregs was verified in vitro and in vivo. The cytokines released by Tregs were explored, the highly expressed anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 was found, which could promote the stemness of AML cells through the activation of PI3K/AKT signal pathway. Moreover, disrupting the IL10/IL10R/PI3K/AKT signal in AML/ETO c-kit(mut) (A/Ec) leukemia mice could prolong the mice survival and reduce the stemness of A/Ec leukemia cells. Finally, it was confirmed in patient samples that the proportion of Tregs to leukemia stem cells (LSCs) was positively correlated, and in CD34(+) primary AML cells, the activation of PI3K/AKT was stronger in patients with high Tregs' infiltration. After rhIL10 treatment, primary AML cells showed increased activation of PI3K/AKT signaling. Therefore, blocking the interaction between Tregs and AML cells may be a new approach to target LSCs in AML treatment.","['(c) 2021.

Incidences of febrile neutropenia (FN) in these patients are common, contributing to high mortality and morbidity. Lack of diagnosis of pathogens responsible for infections in these patients is a major healthcare challenge. Newer molecular diagnostics are increasingly becoming relevant. The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the effectiveness of Syndrome Evaluation System (SES), a multiplex molecular diagnostic platform for diagnosis of pathogens, and its impact on the management of FN. Methods: In total, 34 neutropenic episodes from 21 patients admitted during September 2013 to April 2015 were analyzed in this study. Clinical samples from patients were tested on SES and routine culture. Treatment was as per standard of care. Results: SES showed a 5-fold higher clinical sensitivity (55.9%) as compared to automated culture (11.1%). SES results were available within 14 hours as compared to >72 hours for culture, and elucidated change in antimicrobial therapy in 50% of episodes. Mortality rates were lower when SES was used early in the episode. De-escalation of antimicrobials according to SES results was possible, which translated into substantial cost saving. Conclusion: Newer non-culture-based molecular technologies like SES are changing the way we manage FN. It is faster, has a higher diagnostic yield as compared to traditional culture, and helps in making rapid, evidence-based therapeutic decision-making including de-escalation of antimicrobials. It would potentially lead to a reduction in mortality and healthcare cost in the long run.",,"['Jadhav, Sachin', 'Rajashekaraiah, Mahesh', 'Chakraborty, Dipanjan', 'Bharath, N', 'Sharieff, Safeer Ulla', 'Vignesh, G', 'Gandhamaneni, Keerthi', 'Pasupuleti, Bashwanth', 'Thomas, Priya', 'Balawardhana, Jayantha']","['Jadhav S', 'Rajashekaraiah M', 'Chakraborty D', 'Bharath N', 'Sharieff SU', 'Vignesh G', 'Gandhamaneni K', 'Pasupuleti B', 'Thomas P', 'Balawardhana J']",,"['Department of Hemato Oncology, BGS Global Gleneagles Hospital, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Hemato Oncology, BGS Global Gleneagles Hospital, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.', 'Department of Clinical Research, XCyton Diagnostics Pvt.

Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop a noninvasive and accurate imaging method to evaluate bone marrow changes in patients with AL. This study aimed to compare the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values obtained from fluid-attenuated inversion recovery diffusion-weighted imaging (FLAIR-DWI) and conventional DWI in the lumbar bone marrow of patients with AL and to investigate their performance for evaluating response to induction chemotherapy. Methods: A total of 28 patients with newly diagnosed AL and 25 patients with AL after induction chemotherapy underwent MRI scans at 1.5 Tesla using a conventional DWI and a FLAIR-DWI sequence on sagittal planes covering the lumbar bone marrow. Further, the ADC values from these two sequences, denoted as ADCCON and ADCFLAIR, were measured on multiple vertebrae. The percentage of leukemia cells in bone marrow was recorded, and bone marrow aspiration was performed on treated patients to determine complete remission (CR) and nonremission (NR). Results: ADCFLAIR [(0.453 +/- 0.103) x 10(-3) mm(2)/s] was significantly lower than ADCCON [(0.486 +/- 0.096) x 10(-3) mm(2)/s] in the 28 untreated patients (t = 3.051, P = 0.005). In the 25 treated patients, ADCFLAIR and ADCCON values [(0.566 +/- 0.239) x 10(-3) mm(2)/s] and [(0.716 +/- 0.235) x 10(-3) mm(2)/s], respectively, were higher compared with the untreated patients. The ADCCON values showed a nonsignificant difference between the CR (n = 18) and NR (n = 7) groups (t = 1.409, P = 0.305). However, the ADCFLAIR values exhibited statistically significant difference (t = 2.542, P = 0.018) between the two groups. In a receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis, the area under the curve (AUC) using ADCFLAIR (0.770) was larger than that of ADCCON (0.611) in distinguishing the CR and NR patients following the chemotherapy. Conclusion: Although both ADCCON and ADCFLAIR are sensitive to tissue changes induced by chemotherapy, FLAIR-DWI outperformed conventional DWI in separating AL patients with CR from NR after chemotherapy. A possible mechanism is that FLAIR-DWI suppresses signals from free water, making the ADC measurement more sensitive to structural changes in the bone marrow.",,"['Tian, Xue', 'Niu, Jinliang', 'Li, Wenjin', 'Zhou, Xiaohong Joe', 'Wu, Wenqi', 'Li, Xiaojun', 'Wang, Jun', 'Wang, Hongwei']","['Tian X', 'Niu J', 'Li W', 'Zhou XJ', 'Wu W', 'Li X', 'Wang J', 'Wang H']",,"['Department of Radiology, Shanxi cardiovascular hospital, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China.', 'Department of Radiology, the Second Hospital, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China.', 'Department of Stomatology, the Second Hospital, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China.', 'Department of Radiology, Neurosurgery, and Bioengineering, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA; Department of Clinical Molecular Biology Lab, the Second Hospital, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China.', 'Department of Radiology, the Second Hospital, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China.', 'Department of Radiology, the Second Hospital, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China.', 'Department of Radiology, the Second Hospital, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China.', 'Center for Magnetic Resonance Research, Chicago, Illinois, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],India,Indian J Cancer,Indian journal of cancer,0112040,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia (AL)', 'bone marrow', 'chemotherapy response', 'diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)', 'fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)']",2021/08/13 06:00,2021/08/13 06:00,['2021/08/12 05:43'],"['2021/08/12 05:43 [entrez]', '2021/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['321674 [pii]', '10.4103/ijc.IJC_765_19 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Indian J Cancer. 2021 Jul 16. pii: 321674. doi: 10.4103/ijc.IJC_765_19.,20210716,,,,,['None'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specific chromosomal and genetic aberrations are used clinically to predict prognosis, independent from conventional clinical markers. Molecular cytogenetic methods such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) detect aberrations in up to 80 per cent B-CLL patients. This study was conducted to score the frequencies of recurrent aberrations, i.e., del(13q14), trisomy 12, del(11q22), del(17p13), del(6q21) and IgH (immunoglobulin heavy chain) translocations and to understand their role in prognostication and risk stratification. Methods: FISH studies were performed on bone marrow aspirate or peripheral blood of 280 patients using commercially available disease-specific probe set. The data were correlated with clinical and haematological parameters such as low haemoglobin, splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy. Results: Chromosomal aberrations were detected in 79 per cent of patients, with del(13q14) (57%) as the most common cytogenetic aberration, followed by trisomy 12 (27%), del(11q22) (22%), t(14q32) (19%), del(17p13) (18%) and del(6q21) (9%). Single or in coexistence with other aberration del(13q14) had a favourable outcome in comparison to del(11q22), t(14q32), del(17p13) and del(6q21) which were associated with advanced stages of the disease. Trisomy 12 had a variable clinical course. Interpretation & conclusions: FISH was found to be a sensitive and efficient technique in detecting the prevalence of recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities. Each of these aberrations is an important independent predictor of disease progression and survival which aids in designing risk-adapted treatment strategies for better disease management.",,"['Shetty, Dhanlaxmi', 'Jain, Hemani', 'Rohil, Yogita', 'Khattry, Navin', 'Sengar, Manju', 'Bagal, Bhausaheb', 'Jain, Hasmukh', 'Gokarn, Anant', 'Punatar, Sachin', 'Avinash Bonda, Venkata Naga', 'Subramanian, P G']","['Shetty D', 'Jain H', 'Rohil Y', 'Khattry N', 'Sengar M', 'Bagal B', 'Jain H', 'Gokarn A', 'Punatar S', 'Avinash Bonda VN', 'Subramanian PG']",,"['Department of Cancer Cytogenetics, Advanced Centre for Training, Research & Education in Cancer, Tata Memorial Centre, Kharghar, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Cancer Cytogenetics, Advanced Centre for Training, Research & Education in Cancer, Tata Memorial Centre, Kharghar, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Cancer Cytogenetics, Advanced Centre for Training, Research & Education in Cancer, Tata Memorial Centre, Kharghar, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Advanced Centre for Training, Research & Education in Cancer, Tata Memorial Centre, Kharghar; Homi Bhabha National Institute (HBNI), Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Hospital, Tata Memorial Centre, Parel; Homi Bhabha National Institute (HBNI), Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Hospital, Tata Memorial Centre, Parel; Homi Bhabha National Institute (HBNI), Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Hospital, Tata Memorial Centre, Parel; Homi Bhabha National Institute (HBNI), Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Advanced Centre for Training, Research & Education in Cancer, Tata Memorial Centre, Kharghar; Homi Bhabha National Institute (HBNI), Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Advanced Centre for Training, Research & Education in Cancer, Tata Memorial Centre, Kharghar; Homi Bhabha National Institute (HBNI), Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Hospital, Tata Memorial Centre, Parel; Homi Bhabha National Institute (HBNI), Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Hematopathology, Advanced Centre for Training, Research & Education in Cancer, Tata Memorial Centre, Kharghar; Homi Bhabha National Institute (HBNI), Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],India,Indian J Med Res,The Indian journal of medical research,0374701,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', 'chromosomal aberration', 'fluorescence in situ', 'hybridization', 'lactate dehydrogenase', 'prognosis', 'time-to-first treatment', 'treatment-free survival']",2021/08/13 06:00,2021/08/21 06:00,['2021/08/12 05:43'],"['2021/08/12 05:43 [entrez]', '2021/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/21 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJMedRes_2021_153_4_475_322936 [pii]', '10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_2257_18 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Med Res. 2021 Apr;153(4):475-483. doi: 10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_2257_18.,,20210820,,"['Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/genetics', 'Prognosis']",PMC8354055,['None'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although vital, understanding of the wider signaling network associated with malignant BCR stimulation is poor. This is relevant with respect to potential changes in response to therapy, particularly involving kinase inhibitors. In the current study, we describe a novel high-resolution approach to investigate BCR signaling in primary CLL cells and track the influence of therapy on signaling response. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A kinobead/mass spectrometry-based protocol was used to study BCR signaling in primary CLL cells. Longitudinal analysis of samples donated by clinical trial patients was used to investigate the impact of chemoimmunotherapy and ibrutinib on signaling following surface IgM engagement. Complementary Nanostring and immunoblotting analysis was used to verify our findings. RESULTS: Our protocol isolated a unique, patient-specific signature of over 30 kinases from BCR-stimulated CLL cells. This signature was associated with 13 distinct Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways and showed significant change in cells from treatment-naive patients compared with those from patients who had previously undergone therapy. This change was validated by longitudinal analysis of clinical trials samples where BCR-induced kinome responses in CLL cells altered between baseline and disease progression in patients failing chemoimmunotherapy and between baseline and treatment in patients taking ibrutinib. CONCLUSIONS: These data comprise the first comprehensive proteomic investigation of the BCR signaling response within CLL cells and reveal unique evidence that these cells undergo adaptive reprogramming of this signaling in response to therapy.",['(c)2021 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Linley, Adam J', 'Karydis, Laura I', 'Mondru, Anil K', ""D'Avola, Annalisa"", 'Al Shmrany, Humood', 'Cicconi, Silvia', 'Griffin, Rebecca', 'Forconi, Francesco', 'Pettitt, Andrew R', 'Kalakonda, Nagesh', 'Rawstron, Andrew C', 'Hillmen, Peter', 'Steele, Andrew J', 'MacEwan, David J', 'Packham, Graham', 'Prior, Ian A', 'Slupsky, Joseph R']","['Linley AJ', 'Karydis LI', 'Mondru AK', ""D'Avola A"", 'Al Shmrany H', 'Cicconi S', 'Griffin R', 'Forconi F', 'Pettitt AR', 'Kalakonda N', 'Rawstron AC', 'Hillmen P', 'Steele AJ', 'MacEwan DJ', 'Packham G', 'Prior IA', 'Slupsky JR']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0031-6334', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4691-3131', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2211-1831', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5617-4403', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0667-1596', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7410-9004']","['Department of Molecular Physiology and Cell Signaling, Institute of Systems, Molecular and Integrative Biology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom. a.linley@liverpool.ac.uk.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, Cancer Research UK Centre, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, Institute of Systems, Molecular and Integrative Biology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, Cancer Research UK Centre, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, Institute of Systems, Molecular and Integrative Biology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University, Al-Kharj, Saudi Arabia.', 'Cancer Research Clinical Trials Unit, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Research Clinical Trials Unit, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, Cancer Research UK Centre, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, Institute of Systems, Molecular and Integrative Biology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, Institute of Systems, Molecular and Integrative Biology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Leeds, United Kingdom.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Health, School of Medicine, University of Leeds, Wellcome Trust Brenner Building, Leeds, United Kingdom.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, Cancer Research UK Centre, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Institute of Systems, Molecular and Integrative Biology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, Cancer Research UK Centre, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Molecular Physiology and Cell Signaling, Institute of Systems, Molecular and Integrative Biology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, Institute of Systems, Molecular and Integrative Biology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['A23669/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,,,2021/08/13 06:00,2021/08/13 06:00,['2021/08/12 05:41'],"['2021/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/15 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/13 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/12 05:41 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-21-0161 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-21-0161 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2021 Oct 15;27(20):5647-5659. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-21-0161.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated 194 patients with follicular lymphoma who received an alloSCT (n = 98) or autoSCT (n = 96) at MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX). The transplant type used was based on donor availability and by Medicare reimbursement guidelines. Patients who received an alloSCT were enrolled in four consecutive trials in which they received fludarabine, cyclophosphamide (or bendamustine), and rituximab conditioning. autoSCT patients received R-BEAM (rituximab, carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan). RESULTS: The median follow-up of survivors was 108 months for the alloSCT group and 102 months for the autoSCT group. Overall survival was significantly better for patients who received an alloSCT compared with those who received an autoSCT (62% vs. 46%; P = 0.048). Similarly, progression-free survival rates were 52% in patients who received an alloSCT and 31% in those who received an autoSCT (P < 0.001), and the 8-year relapse rates were 11% and 43%, respectively (P < 0.0001). Only three patients in the alloSCT group relapsed beyond 3.5 years. In the alloSCT group, the rates for grade 2 to 4 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD, and extensive chronic GVHD were 22%, 9%, and 38%, respectively. In the autoSCT group, the 8-year incidence of secondary myelodysplasia was 11%. Nonrelapse mortality was similar between the two groups (15% vs. 11% at 8 years; P = 0.27). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that alloSCT is curative and confers superior survival compared with autoSCT in patients with follicular lymphoma.",['(c)2021 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Khouri, Issa F', 'Milton, Denai R', 'Gulbis, Alison M', 'Jabbour, Elias J', 'Nastoupil, Loretta', 'Ledesma, Celina', 'Anderlini, Paolo', 'Bashir, Qaiser', 'Daher, May', 'Im, Jin S', 'Iyer, Swaminathan P', 'Marin, David', 'Mehta, Rohtesh S', 'Olson, Amanda L', 'Popat, Uday R', 'Qazilbash, Muzaffar', 'Saini, Neeraj', 'Samaniego, Felipe', 'Rondon, Gabriela', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Champlin, Richard E']","['Khouri IF', 'Milton DR', 'Gulbis AM', 'Jabbour EJ', 'Nastoupil L', 'Ledesma C', 'Anderlini P', 'Bashir Q', 'Daher M', 'Im JS', 'Iyer SP', 'Marin D', 'Mehta RS', 'Olson AL', 'Popat UR', 'Qazilbash M', 'Saini N', 'Samaniego F', 'Rondon G', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Champlin RE']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7592-2224', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6931-4583', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6577-8006']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas. ikhouri@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Division of Pharmacy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,,,2021/08/13 06:00,2021/08/13 06:00,['2021/08/12 05:41'],"['2021/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/27 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/13 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/12 05:41 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-21-1377 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-21-1377 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2021 Nov 1;27(21):5847-5856. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-21-1377.

Given that T cells genetically modified to express chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) are effective at eradicating relapsed/refractory acute lymphocytic leukemia, we developed MSLN-directed CAR T cells for preclinical evaluation in AML. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The variable light (VL) and heavy (VH) sequences from the MSLN-targeting SS1P immunotoxin were used to construct the single-chain variable fragment of the standard CAR containing 41-BB costimulatory and CD3Zeta stimulatory domains. The preclinical efficacy of MSLN CAR T cells was evaluated against AML cell lines and patient samples expressing various levels of MSLN in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: We demonstrate that MSLN is expressed on the cell surface of AML blasts and leukemic stem cell-enriched CD34(+)CD38(-) subset, but not on normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC). We further establish that MSLN CAR T cells are highly effective in eliminating MSLN-positive AML cells in cell line- and patient-derived xenograft models. Importantly, MSLN CAR T cells can target and eradicate CD34(+)CD38(-) cells without impacting the viability of normal HSPCs. Finally, we show that CAR T-cell functionality can be improved by inhibition of the ADAM17 metalloprotease that promotes shedding of MSLN. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that MSLN is a viable target for CAR T-cell therapy in AML and that inhibiting MSLN shedding is a promising approach to improve CAR T-cell efficacy.",['(c)2021 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Le, Quy', 'Castro, Sommer', 'Tang, Thao', 'Loeb, Anisha M', 'Hylkema, Tiffany', 'McKay, Cyd Nourigat', 'Perkins, LaKeisha', 'Srivastava, Shivani', 'Call, Lindsey', 'Smith, Jenny', 'Leonti, Amanda', 'Ries, Rhonda', 'Pardo, Laura', 'Loken, Michael R', 'Correnti, Colin', 'Fiorenza, Salvatore', 'Turtle, Cameron J', 'Riddell, Stanley', 'Tarlock, Katherine', 'Meshinchi, Soheil']","['Le Q', 'Castro S', 'Tang T', 'Loeb AM', 'Hylkema T', 'McKay CN', 'Perkins L', 'Srivastava S', 'Call L', 'Smith J', 'Leonti A', 'Ries R', 'Pardo L', 'Loken MR', 'Correnti C', 'Fiorenza S', 'Turtle CJ', 'Riddell S', 'Tarlock K', 'Meshinchi S']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0059-5107', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3702-7923', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4432-2215']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington. quyl@fredhutch.org.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Hematologics, Inc, Seattle, Washington.', 'Hematologics, Inc, Seattle, Washington.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', ""Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, California.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,,,2021/08/13 06:00,2021/08/13 06:00,['2021/08/12 05:41'],"['2021/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/26 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/13 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/12 05:41 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-21-1546 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-21-1546 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2021 Oct 15;27(20):5718-5730. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-21-1546.

The prevalence of MS without medullary AML was 1.4% among all newly diagnosed AML patients. The majority (75%) of patients had a single known anatomic site involved, with the skin (34%) being the most frequent. The most common histologic subtype was monocytic, and 11% of patients had a known history of an antecedent hematologic disorder. The majority of patients (70%) received frontline intensive chemotherapy induction, with 75% of those evaluable attaining complete or partial responses.

We performed a literature search of peer-reviewed studies, published until January 2021, without language restrictions. Summary odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were derived from stratified random-effects meta-analyses by type of exposure and outcome, exposed populations and window of exposure to address the large heterogeneity of existing literature. Heterogeneity and small-study effects were also assessed. We identified 55 eligible studies (n = 48 case-control and n = 7 cohorts) from over 30 countries assessing >200 different exposures of pesticides (n = 160,924 participants). The summary OR for maternal environmental exposure to pesticides (broad term) during pregnancy and AL was 1.88 (95%CI: 1.15-3.08), reaching 2.51 for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; 95%CI: 1.39-4.55). Analysis by pesticide subtype yielded an increased risk for maternal herbicide (OR: 1.41, 95%CI: 1.00-1.99) and insecticide (OR: 1.60, 95%CI: 1.11-2.29) exposure during pregnancy and AL without heterogeneity (p = 0.12-0.34). Meta-analyses of infant leukemia were only feasible for maternal exposure to pesticides during pregnancy. Higher magnitude risks were observed for maternal pesticide exposure and infant ALL (OR: 2.18, 95%CI: 1.44-3.29), and the highest for infant acute myeloid leukemia (OR: 3.42, 95%CI: 1.98-5.91). Overall, the associations were stronger for maternal exposure during pregnancy compared to childhood exposure. For occupational or mixed exposures, parental, and specifically paternal, pesticide exposure was significantly associated with increased risk of AL (ORparental: 1.75, 95%CI: 1.08-2.85; ORpaternal: 1.20, 95%CI: 1.07-1.35).

As a result, we investigated the importance of lnc-MAF4 and IFNG-AS1 expression levels in aGVHD patients versus non-aGVHD patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This research included 38 patients with hematological disorders who were undergoing primary allo-HSCT. Human identical siblings or unrelated donors were used to collect stem cell. Samples were taken within days 0, 7, 14, 28, and 52+/-8 after transplantation. The expression of lncRNA levels was measured using the QRT-PCR technique. And the data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 6 RESULTS: Our data revealed that LncRNA MAF4 and INFG-AS1 expression levels in aGVHD were not significantly different compared to the non-GVHD group immediately after transplantation, nor at day 7 or 14. However, the aGVHD group showed an overt up-regulation of the two lncRNAs on samples taken at day 28 and 52+/-8 compared to non-GVHD patients. DISCUSSION: Since the intracellular pathway of these lncRNAs shows a direct relationship with the IFNgamma cytokine production resulting in differentiation to TH1 cells and inhibition of differentiation to TH2 cells, they can be, therefore, considered as suitable molecular candidates for the prediction of aGVHD in patients receiving HSCT.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Various models of NK cell alloreactivity have been associated with outcomes after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (alloHCT), but results have varied widely. We hypothesized that somatic mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in the context of KIR profiles may further refine their association with transplant outcomes. In this single-center, retrospective, observational study, 81 AML patients who underwent matched-related donor alloHCT were included. Post-HCT outcomes were assessed based on mutational status and KIR profiles with the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. On multivariable analysis those with any somatic mutations and C1/C2 heterozygosity had less acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.14-0.75; P = .009), more relapse (HR, 3.02; 95% CI, 1.30-7.01; P = .010), inferior relapse-free survival (RFS; HR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.17-4.20; P = .014), and overall survival (OS; HR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.17-4.20; P = .015), whereas those with a missing KIR ligand had superior RFS (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.30-0.94; P = .031). The presence of a somatic mutation and donor haplotype A was also associated with less acute GvHD (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.16-0.92; P = .032), more relapse (HR, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.13-6.52; P = .025), inferior RFS (HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.07-4.14; P = .030), and OS (HR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.11-4.38; P = .024). Enhanced NK cell alloreactivity from more KIR activating signals (donor B haplotype) and fewer inhibitory signals (recipient missing KIR ligand or C1 or C2 homozygosity) may help mitigate the adverse prognosis associated with some AML somatic mutations. These results may have implications for improving patient risk stratification prior to transplant and optimizing donor selection.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, there is limited data on this outcome in patients with hematologic malignancies. This study aimed to identify the clinical features of patients with malignant hematologic diseases diagnosed with Aeromonas sobria bacteremia and to evaluate whether the type of bacteremia, community-acquired bacteremia (CAB) or HAB, is associated with mortality. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of pediatric and adult patients between January 2000 and December 2017. Clinical characteristics were compared between CAB and HAB. Additionally, we stratified based on age group. Survival outcomes were assessed with Kaplan-Meier curves and a multivariate Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 37 patients (median age 24 years) were identified; 23 (62%) had HAB and 14 (38%) had CAB. Overall, the most common presenting symptom was abdominal pain (41%). Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 12/15, 80%) and acute myeloid leukemia (n = 8/22, 36%) were the primary hematologic malignancies in pediatric and adult patients, respectively. CAB patients had worse overall survival (OS) rates at 30 days in all (43% versus HAB 91%, p = 0.006) and adult patients (30% versus HAB 92%, p = 0.002). Cox regression analysis found that quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment and CAB were statistically significant factors associated with mortality. Low antimicrobial-resistant was noted, except for ciprofloxacin (n = 5/37, 14%). CONCLUSION: Our study found a worse OS among patients with hematologic malignancies and CAB by Aeromonas sobria. Our results suggest that patients with CAB present with a worse disease severity.

In this study, patients failing to attain a molecular response of BCR-ABL1</= 0.16%(IS) after 6 months of imatinib therapy were unlikely to subsequently achieve stable MR(4.5) with imatinib. Our data suggest that achievement of BCR-ABL1</= 0.16%(IS) at 6 months is predictive of future stable MR(4.5).",,"['Nee, Aisling', 'Lipton, Jeffrey H', 'Kim, Dennis Dong Hwan']","['Nee A', 'Lipton JH', 'Kim DDH']",,"['Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'MR4.5', 'molecular response', 'treatment-free remission', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2021/08/12 06:00,2021/08/12 06:00,['2021/08/11 12:14'],"['2021/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/12 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/11 12:14 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2021.1961234 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2022 Jan;63(1):162-169. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2021.1961234.

Maintenance therapy with fluconazole (FLCZ) is generally prescribed as secondary prophylaxis in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection and non-immunocompromised hosts. However, previous reports have revealed that FLCZ is insufficient as a secondary prophylaxis for cryptococcal infection in HSCT cases. There is no well-established evidence of effective secondary prophylaxis against cryptococcal infection in conditions of severe immunosuppression, such as in HSCT. Herein, we report a case of atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML) presenting with cryptococcal meningitis. A 58-year-old man with progressive leukocytosis and headache was referred to our hospital. Bone marrow biopsy revealed aCML. Because the estimated overall survival was limited, HSCT was indicated. Furthermore, enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and lumbar puncture aided in diagnosing cryptococcal meningitis, which was treated with a combination therapy comprising liposomal amphotericin B and 5-fluorocystine for 28 days. Given the high recurrence rate of cryptococcal meningitis, voriconazole (VRCZ) dose was calculated using the trough concentration of VRCZ in the cerebrospinal fluid. Eventually, HSCT was successfully performed at an appropriate therapeutic range of VRCZ. To the best of our knowledge, there is no case report on HSCT with secondary prophylaxis against cryptococcal meningitis. Our report thus emphasizes the efficacy of VRCZ maintenance therapy as secondary prophylaxis for cryptococcal infection.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

MicroRNAs are short non-coding RNAs that are important regulators of normal hematopoiesis, and abnormal changes in their expression levels can contribute to hematological tumor development. To assess the prognosis of the disease, an international assessment system taking into account a karyotype, the number of blast cells, and the degree of deficiency of different blood cell types is used. However, the overall survival and effectiveness of the therapy offered are not always consistent with predictions.

Such acquisition is often underlined by a metabolic reprogramming that can provide a therapeutic opportunity, as it can lead to the emergence of vulnerabilities and dependencies to be exploited as targets against the resistant cells. In this regard, genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs) have emerged as powerful tools to integrate multiple layers of data to build cancer-specific models and identify putative metabolic vulnerabilities. Here, we use genome-scale metabolic modelling to reconstruct a GSMM of the THP1 AML cell line and two derivative cell lines, one with acquired resistance to AraC and the second with acquired resistance to DOX. We also explore how, adding to the transcriptomic layer, the metabolomic layer enhances the selectivity of the resulting condition specific reconstructions. The resulting models enabled us to identify and experimentally validate that drug-resistant THP1 cells are sensitive to the FDA-approved antifolate methotrexate. Moreover, we discovered and validated that the resistant cell lines could be selectively targeted by inhibiting squalene synthase, providing a new and promising strategy to directly inhibit cholesterol synthesis in AML drug resistant cells.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.'],"['Karakitsou, Effrosyni', 'Foguet, Carles', 'Contreras Mostazo, Miriam G', 'Kurrle, Nina', 'Schnutgen, Frank', 'Michaelis, Martin', 'Cinatl, Jindrich', 'Marin, Silvia', 'Cascante, Marta']","['Karakitsou E', 'Foguet C', 'Contreras Mostazo MG', 'Kurrle N', 'Schnutgen F', 'Michaelis M', 'Cinatl J', 'Marin S', 'Cascante M']",,"['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biomedicine, Faculty of Biology, Universitat de Barcelona, 08028 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute of Biomedicine of University of Barcelona, 08028 Barcelona, Spain.', 'CIBER of Hepatic and Digestive Diseases (CIBEREHD), Institute of Health Carlos III (ISCIII), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biomedicine, Faculty of Biology, Universitat de Barcelona, 08028 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute of Biomedicine of University of Barcelona, 08028 Barcelona, Spain.', 'CIBER of Hepatic and Digestive Diseases (CIBEREHD), Institute of Health Carlos III (ISCIII), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Metabolomics Node at Spanish National Bioinformatics Institute (INB-ISCIII-ES-ELIXIR), Institute of Health Carlos III (ISCIII), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biomedicine, Faculty of Biology, Universitat de Barcelona, 08028 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute of Biomedicine of University of Barcelona, 08028 Barcelona, Spain.', 'CIBER of Hepatic and Digestive Diseases (CIBEREHD), Institute of Health Carlos III (ISCIII), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, University Hospital Frankfurt, Goethe-University, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site Frankfurt/Mainz and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Frankfurt Cancer Institute (FCI), Goethe University, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, University Hospital Frankfurt, Goethe-University, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site Frankfurt/Mainz and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Frankfurt Cancer Institute (FCI), Goethe University, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'School of Biosciences, University of Kent, Canterbury, United Kingdom.', 'Institut fur Medizinische Virologie, Klinikum der Goethe-Universitat, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biomedicine, Faculty of Biology, Universitat de Barcelona, 08028 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute of Biomedicine of University of Barcelona, 08028 Barcelona, Spain.', 'CIBER of Hepatic and Digestive Diseases (CIBEREHD), Institute of Health Carlos III (ISCIII), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Metabolomics Node at Spanish National Bioinformatics Institute (INB-ISCIII-ES-ELIXIR), Institute of Health Carlos III (ISCIII), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biomedicine, Faculty of Biology, Universitat de Barcelona, 08028 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute of Biomedicine of University of Barcelona, 08028 Barcelona, Spain.', 'CIBER of Hepatic and Digestive Diseases (CIBEREHD), Institute of Health Carlos III (ISCIII), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Metabolomics Node at Spanish National Bioinformatics Institute (INB-ISCIII-ES-ELIXIR), Institute of Health Carlos III (ISCIII), 28029 Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Comput Struct Biotechnol J,Computational and structural biotechnology journal,101585369,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug targets', 'Metabolic models', 'Metabolic vulnerabilities']",2021/08/12 06:00,2021/08/12 06:01,['2021/08/11 06:38'],"['2021/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/29 00:00 [revised]', '2021/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/11 06:38 [entrez]', '2021/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.csbj.2021.06.049 [doi]', 'S2001-0370(21)00287-7 [pii]']",epublish,Comput Struct Biotechnol J. 2021 Jul 8;19:4059-4066. doi: 10.1016/j.csbj.2021.06.049. eCollection 2021.,20210708,,,,PMC8326745,"['The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or', 'personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in', 'this paper.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of these ""domesticated"", transposase-derived factors is SETMAR/Metnase which is a naturally occurring fusion protein that consists of a histone-lysine methyltransferase domain and an HsMar1 transposase. To elucidate the biological role of SETMAR, it is crucial to identify genomic targets to which SETMAR specifically binds and link these sites to the regulation of gene expression. Herein, we mapped the genomic landscape of SETMAR binding in a near-haploid human leukemia cell line (HAP1) in order to identify on-target and off-target binding sites at high resolution and to elucidate their role in terms of gene expression. Our analysis revealed a perfect correlation between SETMAR and inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) of HsMar1 transposon remnants, which are considered as natural target sites for SETMAR binding. However, we did not detect any untargeted events at non-ITR sequences, calling into question previously proposed off-target binding sites. We identified sequence fidelity of the ITR motif as a key factor for determining the binding affinity of SETMAR for chromosomes, as higher conservation of ITR sequences resulted in increased affinity for chromatin and stronger repression of SETMAR-bound gene loci. These associations highlight how SETMAR's chromatin binding fine-tune gene regulatory networks in human tumour cells.",['(c) 2021 The Author(s).'],"['Miskei, Marton', 'Horvath, Adrienn', 'Viola, Livia', 'Varga, Laura', 'Nagy, Eva', 'Fero, Orsolya', 'Karanyi, Zsolt', 'Roszik, Jason', 'Miskey, Csaba', 'Ivics, Zoltan', 'Szekvolgyi, Lorant']","['Miskei M', 'Horvath A', 'Viola L', 'Varga L', 'Nagy E', 'Fero O', 'Karanyi Z', 'Roszik J', 'Miskey C', 'Ivics Z', 'Szekvolgyi L']",,"['MTA-DE Momentum Genome Architecture and Recombination Research Group, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Hungary.', 'MTA-DE Momentum Genome Architecture and Recombination Research Group, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Hungary.', 'MTA-DE Momentum Genome Architecture and Recombination Research Group, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Hungary.', 'MTA-DE Momentum Genome Architecture and Recombination Research Group, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Hungary.', 'MTA-DE Momentum Genome Architecture and Recombination Research Group, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Hungary.', 'MTA-DE Momentum Genome Architecture and Recombination Research Group, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Hungary.', 'MTA-DE Momentum Genome Architecture and Recombination Research Group, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Department of Melanoma Medical Oncology, Division of Cancer Medicine, MD Anderson Cancer Centre, University of Texas, USA.', 'Division of Medical Biotechnology, Paul Ehrlich Institute, Langen D-63225, Germany.', 'Division of Medical Biotechnology, Paul Ehrlich Institute, Langen D-63225, Germany.', 'MTA-DE Momentum Genome Architecture and Recombination Research Group, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Debrecen, Hungary.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Comput Struct Biotechnol J,Computational and structural biotechnology journal,101585369,,['NOTNLM'],"['ChIP-seq', 'Histone methyltransferase', 'SETMAR/Metnase', 'Transposase']",2021/08/12 06:00,2021/08/12 06:01,['2021/08/11 06:38'],"['2021/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/12 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/11 06:38 [entrez]', '2021/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.csbj.2021.07.010 [doi]', 'S2001-0370(21)00300-7 [pii]']",epublish,Comput Struct Biotechnol J. 2021 Jul 14;19:4032-4041. doi: 10.1016/j.csbj.2021.07.010. eCollection 2021.,20210714,,,,PMC8327481,"['The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or', 'personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in', 'this paper.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patients in the control group were treated with routine nursing. The patients in the observation group were treated with continuous nursing on the basis of routine nursing. The scores of Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) and Quality of Life Index Scale (Spitzer) of patients on admission and one month after discharge in both groups were compared. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in HAMD, HAMA and Spitzer scores of patients on admission between the two groups (P>0.05). After one month of discharge, the HAMD and HAMA scores of patients in both groups were decreased, while the Spitzer scores of patients in both groups were increased (all P<0.05). In addition, compared with the control group, the HAMD and HAMA scores in the observation group were lower, while the Spitzer scores and nursing satisfaction in the observation group were higher (all P<0.001).

In this paper we describe 3 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by SPM with or without PNX. Patient 1 was a 56-year-old woman whose medical history was significant for chronic leukemia. She presented with typical clinical signs of COVID-19 pneumonia and after 2 weeks of hospitalization she developed SPM and subcutaneous emphysema. The management of pneumomediastinum (PNM) was conservative and follow-up computed tomography showed resolution of PNM. Patient 2 was a 67-year-old man presenting with fever, cough and dyspnea. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography was performed after 2 weeks of hospitalization and showed bilateral peripheral consolidations together with massive PNM and right-sided PNX. Thoracic drainage catheter was inserted in his right chest. Despite all supportive care, the patient succumbed to illness. Patient 3 was a 74-year-old man who was admitted to our hospital with COVID-19 pneumonia and spontaneous right-sided PNX. A thoracic drainage catheter was inserted immediately and then removed after ten days which has led to progression of subcutaneous emphysema, PNX and newly diagnosed PNM. Patient was carefully monitored for the next 2 weeks. Follow-up chest x-ray showed regression of PNM and PNX. SPM, PNX and subcutaneous emphysema are rare complications of COVID-19 pneumonia. Increased alveolar pressure and diffuse alveolar injury in severe COVID-19 pneumonia may make the alveoli more prone to rupturing which leads to gas dissemination along the peribronchovascular sheath to the mediastinum. Most cases of SPM and PNX resolve with conservative management.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

However, the therapeutic effect against solid tumors is not as prominent as anticipated to exhibit potent antitumor efficacy. The underlying mechanism maybe attributed to the inhibitory co-stimulatory pathways such as (PD1/PDL1), which provide tumor cells an escape mechanism from immunosurveillance. Therefore, by exchanging the transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail of PD1 with positive costimulatory molecules, such as CD28 and 4-1BB signaling domains (PD1-CD28-4-1BB, PD1-CAR), the T cell-negative co-stimulatory PD1/PDL1 signal pathway was thus converted into a positive one. This study aimed to investigate whether the genetically modified CAR-T-PD1 cells activated by SOCS1 silenced DCs have enhanced anti-neoplastic potential in vitro/in vivo. Methods: In order to enhance the antigenicity and reduce transformation activity, a modified HPV16 E7 (HPV16mE7) was employed to load on dendritic cells (DCs) with SOCS1 silenced to improve its antitumor efficiency and targeting ability against cervical cancer. The CAR-T-PD1 cells activated by the generated DCs were transfused into murine models bearing tumor of CaSki cells that expressing PDL1 and HPV16 E6/E7 for in vitro/in vivo antitumor activity assay. Results: The data showed that DC-activated CAR-T-PD1 cells significantly increased the secretion of IL-2, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, whilst enhanced cytotoxic activity, suppressed tumor growth and prolong the survival time compared with the controls. Conclusion: These results indicated that the genetically engineered T cells activated by DCs had improved antitumor efficiency and targeting ability. Furthermore, it was suggested that it may have important implications for the improvement of T cell immunotherapy against cervical cancer.",['(c) 2021 Zheng et al.'],"['Zheng, Jingwei', 'Huang, Jingsong', 'Ma, Wei', 'Yang, Wenqiang', 'Hu, Bicheng']","['Zheng J', 'Huang J', 'Ma W', 'Yang W', 'Hu B']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0809-0501'],"[""Clinical Medical College of Jilin University, Changchun, 130012, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Transfusion, Xiang'an Hospital of Xiamen University, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361101, People's Republic of China."", ""The Central Laboratory, Wuhan No.1 Hospital, the Hospital of Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Affiliated to Hubei University of Chinese Medicine, Wuhan, 430022, People's Republic of China."", ""The Central Laboratory, Wuhan No.1 Hospital, the Hospital of Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Affiliated to Hubei University of Chinese Medicine, Wuhan, 430022, People's Republic of China."", ""The Central Laboratory, Wuhan No.1 Hospital, the Hospital of Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Affiliated to Hubei University of Chinese Medicine, Wuhan, 430022, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,,['NOTNLM'],"['CAR-T', 'PD1/PDL1', 'cervical cancer', 'dendritic cells', 'suppressor of cytokine signaling 1']",2021/08/12 06:00,2021/08/12 06:01,['2021/08/11 06:34'],"['2021/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/11 06:34 [entrez]', '2021/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S321402 [doi]', '321402 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2021 Aug 4;13:6045-6053. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S321402. eCollection 2021.,20210804,,,,PMC8349543,['The authors declared that they have no conflicts of interest for this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to dissect the nature of co-mutations in NPM1 mutated AML where the detection of NPM1 transcripts allows highly specific and sensitive detection of complete molecular remission (CMR). We analysed 150 consecutive patients who achieved CMR following intensive treatment by next generation sequencing on paired samples at diagnosis, CMR and relapse (38/150 patients). Patients with persistence or the acquisition of non-DTA (DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1) mutations at CMR (23/150 patients, 15%) have a significantly worse prognosis (EFS HR = 2.7, p = 0.003; OS HR = 3.6, p = 0.012). Based on clonal evolution analysis of diagnostic, CMR and relapse samples, we redefine pre-malignant mutations and include IDH1, IDH2 and SRSF2 with the DTA genes in this newly defined group. Only the persistence or acquisition of CHOP-like (clonal hematopoiesis of oncogenic potential) mutations was significantly associated with an inferior outcome (EFS HR = 4.5, p = 0.0002; OS HR = 5.5, p = 0.002). Moreover, the detection of CHOP-like mutations at relapse was detrimental (HR = 4.5, p = 0.01). We confirmed these findings in a second independent whole genome sequencing cohort.",['(c) 2021.

Treatment resistance to targeted inhibitors in other settings is common; elucidating potential mechanisms of rux resistance in JAK2r B-ALL will enable development of therapeutic strategies to overcome or avert resistance. We generated a murine pro-B cell model of ATF7IP-JAK2 with acquired resistance to multiple type-I JAK inhibitors. Resistance was associated with mutations within the JAK2 ATP/rux binding site, including a JAK2 p.G993A mutation. Using in vitro models of JAK2r B-ALL, JAK2 p.G993A conferred resistance to six type-I JAK inhibitors and the type-II JAK inhibitor, CHZ-868.

However, their contributions to the mutation burden and clonal expansions of healthy somatic tissues are not clear. Here, exploiting the mutational footprint of some chemotherapies, we explore their influence on the evolution of hematopoietic cells. Cells of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) secondary to treatment with platinum-based drugs show the mutational footprint of these drugs, indicating that non-malignant blood cells receive chemotherapy mutations. No trace of the 5-fluorouracil (5FU) mutational signature is found in AMLs secondary to exposure to 5FU, suggesting that cells establishing the leukemia could be quiescent during treatment. Using the platinum-based mutational signature as a barcode, we determine that the clonal expansion originating the secondary AMLs begins after the start of the cytotoxic treatment. Its absence in clonal hematopoiesis cases is consistent with the start of the clonal expansion predating the exposure to platinum-based drugs.",['(c) 2021.

We analyzed CD38 expression in 50-T-ALL and 50 B-ALL clinical samples, and 16 T-ALL and 11 B-ALL cell lines. We primarily focused on in vitro assessments of isatuximab-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). In vivo assessment of isatuximab activity was performed in several ALL xenograft models, including disseminated and subcutaneous tumor models in female C.B-17 severe combined immunodeficiency mice. Our study reveals that most patients (90%-100%) carried CD38(+) blasts independent of disease burden. The median CD38 receptor density on abnormal lymphoblasts is 41,026 copies/cell on T-ALL and 28,137 copies/cell on B-ALL, respectively. In patients with T-ALL, there is a significant increase of CD38 expression in abnormal blasts compared with normal T cells. High-level CD38 receptor density (RD) is critical to trigger effective isatuximab-mediated ADCC against target ALL cells. In addition, a correlation between CD38 RD and isatuximab-mediated ADCP is demonstrated. In the disseminated CD38(+), T-ALL, and B-ALL xenograft models, isatuximab is able to induce robust antitumor activity, even at low doses. This study shows that isatuximab has significant in vitro and in vivo activity against ALL cells with robust ADCC and ADCP effects that are associated with CD38 expression levels in both T-ALL and B-ALL.",['(c)2021 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Wang, Anlai', 'Song, Zhili', 'Zheng, Gang', 'Nicolazzi, Celine', 'Fromm, Jonathan R', 'Shehu, Elvis', 'Srinivasan, Srimathi', 'Chen, Xueyan', 'Zhu, Chen', 'Blondel, Marielle Chiron', 'Adrian, Francisco J']","['Wang A', 'Song Z', 'Zheng G', 'Nicolazzi C', 'Fromm JR', 'Shehu E', 'Srinivasan S', 'Chen X', 'Zhu C', 'Blondel MC', 'Adrian FJ']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5302-1233'],"['Sanofi Immuno-Oncology, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Sanofi Immuno-Oncology, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Sanofi Immuno-Oncology, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Sanofi Immuno-Oncology, Vitry-Sur-Seine, France.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Sanofi Immuno-Oncology, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Sanofi Immuno-Oncology, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Sanofi Immuno-Oncology, Cambridge, Massachusetts. chen.zhu@sanofi.com.', 'Sanofi Immuno-Oncology, Vitry-Sur-Seine, France.', 'Sanofi Immuno-Oncology, Cambridge, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,IM,,,2021/08/12 06:00,2021/08/12 06:00,['2021/08/11 05:49'],"['2021/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/12 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/12 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/11 05:49 [entrez]']","['1535-7163.MCT-21-0058 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-21-0058 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2021 Oct;20(10):1916-1925. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-21-0058.

We compared the frequency, clinical characteristics and outcomes of adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and infection in the first vs. second pandemic waves in Spain. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective study the characteristics of ALL and COVID-19 infection, comorbidities, treatment and outcome in the two periods were compared. The study ended when vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 was implemented in Spain. RESULTS: Twenty eight patients were collected in the first wave and 24 in the second. The median age was 46.5 years (range 20-83). Patients from the first wave had a trend to more severe ALL (higher frequency of patients under induction or submitted to transplantation or under immunosuppressive therapy). No significant differences were observed in need for oxygen support, intensive care unit (ICU) requirement, days in ICU and time to COVID-19 infection recovery. Seventeen patients (33%) died, with death attributed to COVID infection in 15 (29%), without significant differences in the 100 day overall survival (OS) probabilities in the two waves (68% +/- 17% vs. 56% +/- 30%). The only prognostic factor for OS identified by was the presence of comorbidities at COVID-19 infection (HR: 5.358 [95% CI: 1.875- 15.313]).

However, many patients treated in the community have limited access to novel therapies and stem cell transplantation (HSCT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The purpose of this retrospective cohort analysis was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of patients >/= 16 years with newly diagnosed ALL treated from October 2007 to June 2019 in the Harris County Health System, Houston, TX. RESULTS: One hundred forty-six patients were included, with newly diagnosed pre-B-ALL (n = 127), T-ALL (n = 18), and chronic myeloid leukemia and/or lymphoid blast crisis (n = 1). Median age was 35 years (16-82) at diagnosis, and 81(55%) were male. The majority of patients with pre-B ALL identified as Hispanic (n = 118, or 92%). Ninety-eight (67%) of patients were uninsured or indigent, receiving care under the county's financial assistance programs. Hyper-CVAD-based induction chemotherapy was administered in 134 (92%) of patients, while 9 (6%) were treated on different protocols, and 3 (2%) were not treated due to early death, or patient refusal. Imatinib was the most common TKI used in 17 of 30 or 57% of patients with Ph+ disease. Out of 137 evaluable for response patients, 117 (85%) achieved complete remission (CR + CRi), 19 (14%) had refractory disease, and 1 (1%) died within 4 weeks of diagnosis. Median follow-up time was 50 months (1.5-135). For the entire study cohort, the median duration of CR/CRi was 15.4 months. Out of 62 patients who were eligible for consolidative HSCT at first CR, 52 (89%) did not receive it, with lack of insurance being the most common reason (n = 29, or 56%). Barriers to utilization of novel therapies such as blinatumomab or CAR-T were also observed. Patient-caused delays in administration of chemotherapy and treatment interruptions of at least 30 days were seen in 31(23%) patients. At 1, 2, and 5 years, relapse rates were 37%, 56%, and 70%. Recurrent and/or refractory disease was the cause of death in most patients (n = 69 [85%]). Five-year EFS and OS rates were 22% and 38% for patients with pre-B ALL, 24% and 44% for patients with T ALL, and 13% and 27% for patients with Ph+ ALL. Median OS was significantly increased (not reached [NR] vs. 24 months; P = .00088) in patients with an indication for HSCT in first CR due to high-risk features who underwent HSCT, versus those who did not. CONCLUSION: Addressing barriers raised by socioeconomic disparities, increasing access to effective therapies, and including patients with ALL treated in the community in clinical trials may improve survival for underserved populations.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s).

Technological improvements enhanced the availability of genetic AML biomarkers. The clinical relevance of these molecular markers for AML diagnosis, planning of therapy and risk stratification are increasing evidently. METHODS: In current study, one hundred newly diagnosed AML patients before receiving induction chemotherapy were included, they were subjected to clinical examination, cytochemical and morphological analysis of blood cells, flow cytometric, cytogenetic and molecular genetic analysis for detection of NPM1, FLT3-ITD and DNMT3A mutations. Direct sequencing analysis for detection of NPM1 and DNMT3A genes mutations were done. FLT3 /ITD gene mutation was detected by gel electrophoresis after PCR amplification. RESULTS: According to genetic markers, our AML patients are classified in to further 8groups. AML patients with three DNMT3A/FLT3/NPM1 gene mutations (AML (DNMT3A /FLT3/NPM1)) this group of patients presented with a heavy disease burden, had an elevated WBC in comparison to other groups (70 vs. 41 x 10(3)/muL; P = .019), and BM blast counts (71% vs. 55.6%, P < .02). When comparing eight groups for death event there were significant difference among groups; P = .005, group 1 (AML (DNMT3A /FLT3/NPM1)) showed rapid decline of the cumulative overall survival. There was a significant difference among 8 groups as regards response to treatment after 14 days (P = .02), group 7 AML with (DNMT3A +NMP1) gene mutations showed better response to treatment (100%), groups 1 and 3 AML with (NPM1+DNMT3A +NMP1) gene mutations and AML with isolated FLT3-ITD showed no response to treatment after 14 days. And as regards response to treatment after 28 days, the eight groups showed no significant difference (P = .14).

Effective treatments to these patients remain unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, we retrospectively analyzed diagnostic and outcomes of 31 Acute Myeloid leukemia (AML) and 9 Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients with TP53 mutation at our hospital from September 2015 to October 2020. RESULTS: A total of 42 variants (28 unique variants) in the coding region of TP53 gene were identified, and most were missense mutation (34 of 42, 81%). The median overall survival (OS) was 8 months for the AML patients (1-32 months) and 7 months for the MDS patients (3-27 months). There were 35 and 13 patients underwent frontline chemical therapy and Allo-HSCT, respectively. The overall response rate was 45.3% (16/35) for the frontline treatment. There was no significant difference between intensive and low-intensity regimens on either response to the frontline treatment (P = .255) or overall survival (P = .078). Patients, who achieved complete or partial remission at the frontline treatment, presented a higher survival than patients in non-remission, no matter transplant or not. CONCLUSION: This study corroborates that improving the response to the first-line treatment could prolong the survival of myeloid neoplasms patients with TP53 mutation.

More recently, therapies targeting fundamental signaling and anti-apoptotic pathways within the CLL cell have demonstrated dramatic clinical responses, including in patients with high-risk prognostic markers, thus emerging as preferred therapy for many patients. While the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies to traditional chemotherapy resulted in significant improvements in outcomes, the role of monoclonal antibodies in the era of targeted agents remains an active area of investigation. Furthermore, since the advent of next-generation anti-CD20 antibodies, the role of specific anti-CD20 antibodies remains an open question. AREAS COVERED: In this review, we highlight the important role that anti-CD20 antibody therapy has had in the field of CLL, both when used with chemotherapy and in combination with targeted therapy, as well as the current studies that are further exploring this treatment paradigm in the modern era.

AREAS COVERED: The occurrence of adverse events was revealed as a major cause of ibrutinib failure in the real-world. Ibrutinib-induced lymphocytosis carries the risk of an untimely interruption of therapy because it may be misinterpreted as disease progression. In addition, drug interactions can worsen ibrutinib-associated toxicities by increasing the plasma concentration of ibrutinib. In this review, we present a case of major hemorrhage and atrial fibrillation (AF) during ibrutinib use and summarize the adverse events associated with ibrutinib. Furthermore, the practical management of ibrutinib-associated toxicities was covered with reference to a drug interaction mechanism. EXPERT OPINION: Clinicians should examine the prescribed drugs prior to ibrutinib initiation and carefully monitor toxicities while taking ibrutinib. A reduced dose of ibrutinib with the concurrent use of CYP3A inhibitors such as antifungal agents could be an attractive strategy to reduce toxicities and may confer financial benefits.

Current successful, approved cancer immunotherapies fall into two broad classes: antibodies and cellular therapies. Approved cellular therapies thus far consist of Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells targeting CD19 for refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma and relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Part of the ardor surrounding CAR T-cells stems from the fact that the survival curve of treated patients has a clear plateau, meaning that a number of patients with aggressive, disseminated disease who would have otherwise died rather rapidly appear to now be cured, commonly after just one dose. Despite an encouraging number of these durable remissions, the majority do still relapse. In this review, we discuss the potential for strategically utilizing radiation to further improve CAR T-cell patient outcomes. Given that there are currently over 750 cellular therapies in development, half of which are now in clinical trial, CAR T-cell usage will inevitably expand; as the field grows in importance and effectiveness, radiation oncology has the opportunity to coevolve symbiotically and steer these novel, exciting live therapies to new depths.",,"['DeSelm, Carl']",['DeSelm C'],['ORCID: 0000-0001-7645-5798'],"['Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis, St Louis, Missouri.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Br J Radiol,The British journal of radiology,0373125,IM,,,2021/08/11 06:00,2021/10/30 06:00,['2021/08/10 17:11'],"['2022/11/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/30 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/10 17:11 [entrez]']",['10.1259/bjr.20210098 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Radiol. 2021 Nov 1;94(1127):20210098. doi: 10.1259/bjr.20210098.

The most standardized tools to study MRD in ALL are multiparametric flow cytometry and realtime-quantitative polymerase chain reaction amplification-based methods. In recent years, MRD measurement has reached greater levels of sensitivity and standardization through international laboratory networks collaboration. AREAS COVERED: We herewith describe how to assess and apply the prognostic impact of MRD in treatment decisions, with specific focus on pediatric ALL. We also highlight the role of MRD monitoring in the context of genetically homogeneous subgroups of pediatric ALL. However, some queries remain to be addressed and emerging technologies hold the promise of improving MRD detection in ALL patients. EXPERT OPINION: Emerging technologies, like next generation flow cytometry, droplet digital PCR, and next generation sequencing appear to be important methods for assessing MRD in pediatric ALL. These more specific and/or sensitive MRD monitoring methods may help to predict relapse with greater accuracy, and are currently being used in clinical trials to improve pediatric ALL outcome by optimizing patient stratification and earlier MRD-based interventional therapy.",,"['Ceppi, Francesco', 'Rizzati, Frida', 'Colombini, Antonella', 'Conter, Valentino', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni']","['Ceppi F', 'Rizzati F', 'Colombini A', 'Conter V', 'Cazzaniga G']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2955-4528'],"['Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Unit, Division of Pediatrics, Woman-Mother-Child Department, Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV) and University of Lausanne (UNIL), Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Unit, Division of Pediatrics, Woman-Mother-Child Department, Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV) and University of Lausanne (UNIL), Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University Milano Bicocca, Fondazione MBBM/Ospedale San Gerardo, Monza, Italy.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University Milano Bicocca, Fondazione MBBM/Ospedale San Gerardo, Monza, Italy.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Milano Bicocca, Fondazione MBBM/Ospedale San Gerardo, Monza, Italy.', 'Medical Genetics, School of Medicine, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all)', 'minimal residual disease (mrd)', 'pediatric', 'prognostic factors']",2021/08/11 06:00,2021/08/11 06:00,['2021/08/10 12:17'],"['2021/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/11 06:00 [medline]', '2021/08/10 12:17 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2021.1967137 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2021 Sep;14(9):795-807. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2021.1967137.

However, the influence of its single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on AML remains unknown. METHODS: We used allele-specific PCR to genotype GATA2 rs2335052 and rs78245253 in 159 newly diagnosed AML (non-M3) patients and 300 healthy volunteers, and all of participants came from China. And 34 common hematological tumor gene mutations in 159 AML patients were detected by next-generation sequencing. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazard regression were used to analyze the association between the two SNPs and the prognosis of AML. RESULTS: We found GATA2 rs2335052 C/T genotype, rs2335052 T/T genotype and rs78245253 G/C genotype in 51.6%, 13.8% and 11.3% AML patients. Our results demonstrated that GATA2 rs2335052 and rs78245253 were associated with certain laboratory features in AML patients, which had no effect on the pathogeny, chemotherapy response and recurrence of patients. Nevertheless, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that, compared with rs78245253 G/G genotype, rs78245253 G/C genotype was significantly related to a decrease in overall survival (OS) (P = .020). Additionally, multivariate cox regression analysis showed that GATA2 rs78245253 was an independent risk factor for OS of AML patients in China. CONCLUSION: GATA2 rs78245253 was an independent predictor for prognosis of AML patients in China and may be used as a potential indicator to predict the survival of AML patients in China.

METHODS: Patients with advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer who were enrolled in the CALGB/SWOG 80405 trial were identified by race. On the basis of covariates (treatment arm, KRAS status, sex, age, and body mass index), each Black patient was exact matched with a White patient. The association between race and OS and PFS was examined using a marginal Cox proportional hazard model for matched pairs. The interaction between KRAS status and race was tested in the model. The association between race and response to therapy and adverse events were examined using a marginal logistic regression model. RESULTS: In total, 392 patients were matched and included in the final data set. No difference in OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73-1.16), PFS (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.78-1.20), or response to therapy (odds ratio [OR], 1.00; 95% CI, 0.65-1.52) was observed between Black and White patients. Patients with KRAS mutant status (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.02-1.67), a performance statusscore of 1 (reference, a performance status of 0; HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.18-1.88), or >/=3 metastatic sites (reference, 1 metastatic site; HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.22-2.28) experienced worse OS. Black patients experienced lower rates and risk of grade >/=3 fatigue (6.6% vs 13.3%; OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.24-0.91) but were equally likely to be treated with a dose reduction (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.72-1.65). CONCLUSIONS: No difference in OS, PFS, or response to therapy was observed between Black patients and White patients in an equal treatment setting of the CALGB/SWOG 80405 randomized controlled trial. LAY SUMMARY: Despite improvements in screening and treatment, studies have demonstrated worse outcomes in Black patients with colorectal cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there was a difference in cancer-specific outcomes among Black and White patients receiving equivalent treatment on the CALGB/SWOG 80405 randomized clinical trial. In this study, there was no difference in overall survival, progression-free survival, or response to therapy between Black and White patients treated on a clinical trial.

In this report, we present a rare case of a patient with HCL developing a high-grade blastoid marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (MZBCL).","['Copyright (c) 2021, Teklie et al.']","['Teklie, Yeshanew', 'Bell, Stephen', 'Idogun, Precious', 'Venigalla, Madhavi']","['Teklie Y', 'Bell S', 'Idogun P', 'Venigalla M']",,"['Internal Medicine, Florida State University College of Medicine, Sarasota Memorial Hospital, Sarasota, USA.', 'Internal Medicine, Florida State University College of Medicine, Sarasota, USA.', 'Internal Medicine, Florida State University College of Medicine, Sarasota, USA.', 'Hematology and Oncology, Sarasota Memorial Hospital, Sarasota, USA.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,['NOTNLM'],"['blastoid', 'blastoid marginal cell lymphoma', 'hairy cell leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'marginal zone lymphoma mzl']",2021/08/11 06:00,2021/08/11 06:01,['2021/08/10 06:39'],"['2021/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/10 06:39 [entrez]', '2021/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.16239 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2021 Jul 7;13(7):e16239. doi: 10.7759/cureus.16239. eCollection 2021 Jul.,20210707,,,,PMC8345332,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MLL is frequently fused with transcription cofactors AF4 (~35%), AF9 (25%) or its paralog ENL (10%). The AHD domain of AF9/ENL binds to AF4, its paralog AFF4, or histone-H3 lysine-79 (H3K79) methyltransferase DOT1L. Formation of AF9/ENL/AF4/AFF4-containing super elongation complexes (SEC) and the catalytic activity of DOT1L are essential for MLL-rearranged leukemia. Protein-protein interactions (PPI) between AF9/ENL and DOT1L/AF4/AFF4 are therefore a potential drug target. Methods: Compound screening followed by medicinal chemistry was used to find inhibitors of such PPIs, which were examined for their biological activities against MLL-rearranged leukemia and other cancer cells. Results: Compound-1 was identified to be a novel small-molecule inhibitor of the AF9/ENL-DOT1L/AF4/AFF4 interaction with IC50s of 0.9-3.5 microM. Pharmacological inhibition of the PPIs significantly reduced SEC and DOT1L-mediated H3K79 methylation in the leukemia cells. Gene profiling shows compound-1 significantly suppressed the gene signatures related to onco-MLL, DOT1L, HoxA9 and Myc. It selectively inhibited proliferation of onco-MLL- or Myc-driven cancer cells and induced cell differentiation and apoptosis. Compound-1 exhibited strong antitumor activity in a mouse model of MLL-rearranged leukemia. Conclusions: The AF9/ENL-DOT1L/AF4/AFF4 interactions are validated to be an anticancer target and compound-1 is a useful in vivo probe for biological studies as well as a pharmacological lead for further drug development.",['(c) The author(s).'],"['Wu, Fangrui', 'Nie, Shenyou', 'Yao, Yuan', 'Huo, Tong', 'Li, Xin', 'Wu, Xiaowei', 'Zhao, Jidong', 'Lin, Yi-Lun', 'Zhang, Yinjie', 'Mo, Qianxing', 'Song, Yongcheng']","['Wu F', 'Nie S', 'Yao Y', 'Huo T', 'Li X', 'Wu X', 'Zhao J', 'Lin YL', 'Zhang Y', 'Mo Q', 'Song Y']",,"['Department of Pharmacology and Chemical Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, 1 Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Dan L.

Using a sphingolipid network focused CRISPR/Cas9 library screen, we identified an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) enzyme, 3-Ketodihydrosphingosine reductase (KDSR), to be essential for leukemia cell maintenance. Loss of KDSR led to apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and aberrant ER structure. Transcriptomic analysis revealed the indispensable role of KDSR in maintaining the unfolded protein response (UPR) in ER. High-density CRISPR tiling scan and sphingolipid mass spectrometry pinpointed the critical role of KDSR's catalytic function in leukemia. Mechanistically, depletion of KDSR resulted in accumulated 3-ketodihydrosphingosine (KDS) and dysregulated UPR checkpoint proteins PERK, ATF6, and ATF4. Finally, our study revealed the synergism between KDSR suppression and pharmacologically induced ER-stress, underscoring a therapeutic potential of combinatorial targeting sphingolipid metabolism and ER homeostasis in leukemia treatment.","['(c) 2021.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous SNPs that increase cancer risks, such as breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and leukemia. These SNPs were cataloged for scientific use. However, GWAS are often conducted on certain populations in which the Orang Asli and Malays were not included. Therefore, we have developed a bioinformatic pipeline to mine the whole-genome sequence databases of the Orang Asli and Malays to determine the presence of pathogenic SNPs that might increase the risks of cancers among them. Five different in silico tools, SIFT, PROVEAN, Poly-Phen-2, Condel, and PANTHER, were used to predict and assess the functional impacts of the SNPs. Out of the 80 cancer-related nsSNPs from the GWAS dataset, 52 nsSNPs were found among the Orang Asli and Malays. They were further analyzed using the bioinformatic pipeline to identify the pathogenic variants. Three nsSNPs; rs1126809 (TYR), rs10936600 (LRRC34), and rs757978 (FARP2), were found as the most damaging cancer pathogenic variants. These mutations alter the protein interface and change the allosteric sites of the respective proteins. As TYR, LRRC34, and FARP2 genes play important roles in numerous cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, growth, and cell survival; therefore, any impairment on the protein function could be involved in the development of cancer. rs1126809, rs10936600, and rs757978 are the important pathogenic variants that increase the risks of cancers among the Orang Asli and Malays.

This report describes long-term follow-up of 519 patients in whom molecular alterations were evaluated according to a predefined seven-scale target prioritization algorithm. Mean turnaround time from sample receipt to report was 25.4 days. The highest target priority level was observed in 42 patients (8.1%). Of these, 20 patients received matched targeted treatment with a median progression-free survival of 204 days [95% confidence interval (CI), 99-not applicable], compared with 117 days (95% CI, 106-143; P = 0.011) in all other patients. The respective molecular targets were shown to be predictive for matched treatment response and not prognostic surrogates for improved outcome. Hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes were identified in 7.5% of patients, half of which were newly identified through the study. Integrated molecular analyses resulted in a change or refinement of diagnoses in 8.2% of cases. SIGNIFICANCE: The pediatric precision oncology INFORM registry prospectively tested a target prioritization algorithm in a real-world, multinational setting and identified subgroups of patients benefiting from matched targeted treatment with improved progression-free survival, refinement of diagnosis, and identification of hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes.See related commentary by

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloHCT) has seen many advancements in the last decades showing benefits in younger ALL patients, but this treatment modality is decreasingly used with increasing age due to high treatment-related mortality. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified 84 ALL patients 70 to 84 years old allografted In 2002 to 2019 from a matched related (23%), unrelated (58%), haploidentical (17%), or cord blood (2%) donor at EBMT participating centers with a median follow-up of 23 months. RESULTS: The 2-year relapse incidence (RI) and non-relapse mortality were 37% and 28%, respectively, and 2-year leukemia-free survival (LFS), overall survival (OS) and GVHD-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS) were 35%, 39% and 23%, respectively. The strongest predictor of outcome was disease status at transplant whereby patients in first complete remission (CR1) had >50% 2-year OS, reflected in multivariate analysis (MVA) with significant improvement in RI, LFS, and GRFS (HR 0.23, 0.49, and 0.54, respectively). Furthermore, karnofsky score >/=90 reflective of good functional status positively influenced non-relapse mortality in both univariate and MVA (HR 0.37), and interestingly, donor CMV positivity appeared to negatively affect RI, LFS and OS in univariate analysis and RI in MVA (HR 2.87). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that alloHCT is an option for elderly ALL patients, particularly those carefully selected and transplanted in CR1 especially if failed or without access to novel non-chemotherapy-based approaches.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

The mechanism can be dysimmune, associated or not with monoclonal gammopathies; paraneoplastic; infiltrative; or more commonly, iatrogenic or due to vitamin deficiency. The diagnosis can be complex, especially when the neuropathy is the presenting manifestation, requiring a close cooperation between internists and neurologists. The positive diagnosis of the neuropathy is based on a systematic electro-clinical investigation, which specifies the topography and the mechanism of the nerve damage, sometimes reinforced by imaging examinations, in particular, nerve and/or plexus MRI. The imputability of the neuropathy to a lymphoproliferative syndrome is based on a set of arguments including the clinical context (B signs, tumour syndrome), first-line laboratory tests (hemogram, protein electrophoresis, viral serologies, complement), auto-antibodies discussed according to the neuropathy (anti-MAG, anti-gangliosides) and sometimes more invasive examinations (bone marrow or neuro-muscular biopsies).","['Copyright (c) 2021 Societe Nationale Francaise de Medecine Interne (SNFMI).', 'Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

34372909,NLM,MEDLINE,20211101,1756-8722 (Electronic) 1756-8722 (Linking),14,1,2021 Aug 9,Treatment-induced arteriolar revascularization and miR-126 enhancement in bone marrow niche protect leukemic stem cells in AML.,122,10.1186/s13045-021-01133-y [doi],"BACKGROUND: During acute myeloid leukemia (AML) growth, the bone marrow (BM) niche acquires significant vascular changes that can be offset by therapeutic blast cytoreduction. The molecular mechanisms of this vascular plasticity remain to be fully elucidated. Herein, we report on the changes that occur in the vascular compartment of the FLT3-ITD+ AML BM niche pre and post treatment and their impact on leukemic stem cells (LSCs). METHODS: BM vasculature was evaluated in FLT3-ITD+ AML models (Mll(PTD/WT)/Flt3(ITD/ITD) mouse and patient-derived xenograft) by 3D confocal imaging of long bones, calvarium vascular permeability assays, and flow cytometry analysis. Cytokine levels were measured by Luminex assay and miR-126 levels evaluated by Q-RT-PCR and miRNA staining. Wild-type (wt) and Mll(PTD/WT)/Flt3(ITD/ITD) mice with endothelial cell (EC) miR-126 knockout or overexpression served as controls. The impact of treatment-induced BM vascular changes on LSC activity was evaluated by secondary transplantation of BM cells after administration of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) to Mll(PTD/WT)/Flt3(ITD/ITD) mice with/without either EC miR-126 KO or co-treatment with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) or anti-miR-126 miRisten. RESULTS: In the normal BM niche, CD31(+)Sca-1(high) ECs lining arterioles have miR-126 levels higher than CD31(+)Sca-1(low) ECs lining sinusoids. We noted that during FLT3-ITD+ AML growth, the BM niche lost arterioles and gained sinusoids. These changes were mediated by TNFalpha, a cytokine produced by AML blasts, which induced EC miR-126 downregulation and caused depletion of CD31(+)Sca-1(high) ECs and gain in CD31(+)Sca-1(low) ECs. Loss of miR-126(high) ECs led to a decreased EC miR-126 supply to LSCs, which then entered the cell cycle and promoted leukemia growth. Accordingly, antileukemic treatment with TKI decreased the BM blast-produced TNFalpha and increased miR-126(high) ECs and the EC miR-126 supply to LSCs. High miR-126 levels safeguarded LSCs, as shown by more severe disease in secondary transplanted mice. Conversely, EC miR-126 deprivation via genetic or pharmacological EC miR-126 knock-down prevented treatment-induced BM miR-126(high) EC expansion and in turn LSC protection. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment-induced CD31(+)Sca-1(high) EC re-vascularization of the leukemic BM niche may represent a LSC extrinsic mechanism of treatment resistance that can be overcome with therapeutic EC miR-126 deprivation.",['(c) 2021.

However, longitudinal changes and treatment effects remain poorly understood. This study aimed to characterize the clinical course of urinary dysfunction in this population. METHODS: This prospective observational study included 547 patients enrolled in HAM-net, a nationwide registry for HAM/TSP in Japan. Urinary dysfunction severity was evaluated using the HAM/TSP-bladder dysfunction symptom score (HAM-BDSS) and the HAM/TSP-bladder dysfunction severity grade (HAM-BDSG). These specific measures were recently developed for assessing urinary dysfunction in HAM/TSP. We analyzed longitudinal changes over a 6-year follow-up period, associations between urinary and gait dysfunction, and treatment efficacy of urinary catheterization and mirabegron (a beta3-adrenergic agonist for overactive bladder symptoms). RESULTS: The mean (standard deviation [SD]) age and disease duration at enrollment were 61.9 (10.7) years and 16.6 (11.6) years, respectively, and 74.6% of patients were women. Only 8.0% were free from urinary symptoms (HAM-BDSG 0), 65.4% had urinary symptoms or were on medication (HAM-BDSG I), and 23.2% and 3.3% used intermittent and indwelling catheters (HAM-BDSG II and III), respectively. HAM-BDSG and BDSS were worse in patients with greater gait dysfunction (p < 0.001 for both). During the 6-year follow-up, 66.7% of patients with HAM-BDSG 0 developed new urinary symptoms. Of those with HAM-BDSG I at enrollment, 10.8% started using urinary catheters. Importantly, HAM-BDSS significantly improved after initiating catheterization (mean [SD] change, - 8.93 [10.78], p < 0.001). The number of patients receiving mirabegron increased in the fourth year. Multivariable linear regression analysis significantly associated mirabegron with improvement in HAM-BDSS (- 5.82, 95% confidence interval - 9.13 to - 2.51, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Urinary dysfunction affected 92% of patients and progressed over the 6-year follow-up. Urinary symptoms were more severe in patients with poorer gait function. Urinary catheterization and mirabegron were effective in relieving symptoms. Effective utilization of real-world data is key to establishing evidence for rare diseases, such as HAM/TSP.",['(c) 2021.

Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9), a core component of P-TEFb, regulates the process of transcription elongation, which is associated with differentiation and apoptosis in many cancer types. Wogonin, a natural CDK9 inhibitor isolated from Scutellaria baicalensis. This study aimed to investigate the involved molecular mechanisms of wogonin on anti- chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: mRNA and protein levels were analysed by RT-qPCR and western blot. Flow cytometry was used to assess cell differentiation and apoptosis. Cell transfection, immunofluorescence analysis and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays were applied to address the potential regulatory mechanism of wogonin. KU-812 cells xenograft NOD/SCID mice model was used to assess and verify the mechanism in vivo. RESULTS: We reported that the anti-CML effects in K562, KU-812 and primary CML cells induced by wogonin were regulated by P-TEFb complex. We also confirmed the relationship between CDK9 and erythroid differentiation via knockdown the expression of CDK9. For further study the mechanism of erythroid differentiation induced by wogonin, co-IP experiments were used to demonstrate that wogonin increased the binding between GATA-1 and FOG-1 but decreased the binding between GATA-1 and RUNX1, which were depended on P-TEFb. Also, wogonin induced apoptosis and decreased the mRNA and protein levels of MCL-1 in KU-812 cells, which is the downstream of P-TEFb. In vivo studies showed wogonin had good anti-tumor effects in KU-812 xenografts NOD/ SCID mice model and decreased the proportion of human CD45(+) cells in spleens of mice. We also verified that wogonin exhibited anti-CML effects through modulating P-TEFb activity in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated a special mechanism involving the regulation of P-TEFb kinase activity in CML cells, providing evidences for further application of wogonin in CML clinical treatment.

The treatment of TCL remains challenging and new treatment options are urgently needed. With the goal of developing a novel therapeutic approach for TCL, we investigated the activity of the clinical formulation of oncolytic reovirus (Reolysin, Pelareorep) in TCL models. Our studies revealed that HTLV-1-negative TCL cells were highly sensitive to Reolysin-induced cell death, but HTLV-1-positive TCL cells were resistant. Consistent with these data, reovirus displayed significant viral accumulation in HTLV-1-negative cells, but failed to efficiently replicate in HTLV-1-positive cells. Transcriptome analyses of HTLV-1-positive vs. negative cells revealed a significant increase in genes associated with retroviral infection including interleukin-13 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5). To investigate the relationship between HTLV-1 status and sensitivity to Reolysin, we infected HTLV-1-negative cells with HTLV-1. The presence of HTLV-1 resulted in significantly decreased sensitivity to Reolysin. Treatment with the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib suppressed STAT5 phosphorylation and expression of the key anti-viral response protein MX1 and enhanced the anti-TCL activity of Reolysin in both HTLV-1-positive and negative cells. Our data demonstrate that the inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway can be used as a novel approach to antagonize the resistance of HTLV-1-positive cells to oncolytic virus therapy.",,"['Islam, Shariful', 'Espitia, Claudia M', 'Persky, Daniel O', 'Carew, Jennifer S', 'Nawrocki, Steffan T']","['Islam S', 'Espitia CM', 'Persky DO', 'Carew JS', 'Nawrocki ST']",,"['Division of Translational and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine, The University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, AZ 85724, USA.', 'Division of Translational and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine, The University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, AZ 85724, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, The University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, AZ 85724, USA.', 'Division of Translational and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine, The University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, AZ 85724, USA.', 'Division of Translational and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine, The University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, AZ 85724, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01CA190789/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA172443/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA023074/NH/NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['*HTLV-1', '*Pelareorep', '*Reolysin', '*T-cell lymphoma', '*oncolytic virus', '*reovirus']",2021/08/11 06:00,2021/11/20 06:00,['2021/08/10 01:05'],"['2021/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/11 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/10 01:05 [entrez]', '2021/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/20 06:00 [medline]']","['v13071406 [pii]', '10.3390/v13071406 [doi]']",epublish,Viruses. 2021 Jul 20;13(7). pii: v13071406. doi: 10.3390/v13071406.,20210720,20211119,"['0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (reolysin)', '82S8X8XX8H (ruxolitinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']","['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*therapy/*virology', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Oncolytic Viruses/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Reoviridae/*physiology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",PMC8310324,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Retroviral vector gene transfer strategies allow stable and durable transgene expression. Here, we used alpharetroviral vectors to modify NK-92 cells, a natural killer cell line, with a third-generation CAR designed to target the IL-3 receptor subunit alpha (CD123), which is strongly expressed on the surface of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Alpharetroviral vectors also contained a transgene cassette to allow constitutive expression of human IL-15 for increased NK cell persistence in vivo. The anti-AML activity of CAR-NK-92 cells was tested via in vitro cytotoxicity assays with the CD123(+) AML cell line KG-1a and in vivo in a patient-derived xenotransplantation CD123(+) AML model. Unmodified NK-92 cells or NK-92 cells modified with a truncated version of the CAR that lacked the signaling domain served as controls.

Thus, there is an imperative need to find effective reprogramming approaches in order to resume normal fetal development. Polyphenols are bioactive compounds found in vegetables and fruits that exert its anti-obesity effect through its powerful anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.

This work focuses on the design, formulation, and characterization of four semisolid formulations for oral mucosa in order to symptomatically treat these painful processes. The formulations have two active pharmaceutical ingredients, triamcinolone acetonide (TA) and lidocaine hydrochloride (LIDO). The formula also contains, as an excipient, Orabase((R)), which is a protective, hydrophobic, and anhydrous adhesive vehicle, used to retain or facilitate the application of active pharmaceutical ingredients to the oral mucosa. After designing the formulations, an analytical method for TA was validated using HPLC so as to achieve reliable analytical results. Franz-type diffusion cells were used to perform drug release studies using synthetic membrane, and permeation studies using buccal mucosa, estimating the amount and rate of TA permeated across the tissue. Additionally, sublingual permeation studies were carried out to evaluate a scenario of a continuous contact of the tongue with the applied formulation. Permeation fluxes and the amount of TA retained within sublingual mucosa were similar to those in buccal mucosa, also implying anti-inflammatory activity in the part of the tongue that is in direct contact with the formulation. In addition, the dynamic conditions of the mouth were recreated in terms of the presence of phosphate buffered saline, constant movement of the tongue, pH, and temperature, using dissolution equipment. The amount of TA released into the phosphate buffered saline in dynamic conditions (subject to being ingested) is well below the normal oral doses of TA, for which the formulation can be considered safe. The formulations applied to buccal or sublingual mucosas under dynamic conditions permit the successful retention of TA within either tissue, where it exerts anti-inflammatory activity. The four formulations studied show a pseudoplastic and thixotropic behavior, ideal for topical application.

To control the spread of BLV, several studies have attempted to clarify the molecular mechanisms of BLV pathogenesis, but the details of the mechanism are still enigmatic. Currently, viral non-coding RNAs are attracting attention as a novel player for BLV pathogenesis because these transcripts can evade the host immune response and are persistently expressed in latent infection. One of the viral non-coding RNA, AS1, is encoded in the antisense strand of the BLV genome and consists of two isoforms, AS1-L and AS1-S. Although the function of the AS1 is still unknown, the AS1 RNA might also have some roles because it keeps expressing in tumor tissues. In the present study, we identified novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the AS1 coding region and indicated that individuals infected with BLV with minor SNPs showed low proviral load. To evaluate the effect of identified SNPs, we constructed infectious clones with these SNPs and found that their introduction affected the expression profile of AS1 RNA; the amount of AS1-L isoform increased compared with the wild type, although the total amount of AS1 RNA remained unchanged. Prediction analysis also suggested that the introduction of SNPs changed the secondary structure of AS1 RNA. These results explain part of the relationship between BLV expansion in vivo and the expression profile of AS1, although further analysis is required.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

METHODS: The genomic DNA of untreated pediatricBCR-ABL1 negative B-ALL patients was analyzed for deletions of IKZF1, PAX5, CDKN2A/B, BTG1, RB1, ETV6, EBF1, ERG, pseudoautosomal region(PAR) genes using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, along with the routine genetic work-up. The patients were assigned an 'M'score- 0 (M0) for low and 1 (M1) for high genetic-risk as per the criteria by Moorman et al., and another score ""IKplus""-1 (IKplus1) for IKZF1plus as per the criteria by Stanulla et al., and 0 (IKplus0) for other patients. The final ""MRplus"" risk-score of 0 (MRplus0), 1 (MRplus1) or 2 (MRplus2) was obtained by adding both these scores. The association of risk scores with overall survival (OS) and event free survival(EFS) was seen using Cox proportion hazard model. The overall goodness of fit of the model was done using Cox-Snell residuals. RESULTS: The median age of 320 patients was 6 years (1-18 years). The patients with score M1 were 139 (43.4 %), M0-181 (56.6 %); IKplus1-32 (10 %) and IKplus0-288 (90 %). The final ""MRplus"" score of 0,1,or 2 was obtained in 181(56.6 %), 107(33.4 %) and 32(10 %) patients respectively. The post-induction remission rate was 90.7 %, 77.8 %, 73.9 % (p = 0.004); 4-year OS 67 %, 48 %, 27 % (p < 0.001); and 4-year EFS 56 %, 34 %, 19 %(p < 0.001) in patients with ""MRplus"" score 0,1,and 2 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed ""MRplus"" scoring at baseline could identify three distinct risk groups-good (MRplus0), intermediate (MRplus1) and poor (MRplus2), with different outcomes; in pediatricBCR-ABL1 negative B-ALL. This may help in better risk-stratification and selection of patients for alternative treatment approaches.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Elements' analysis was carried out using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and demographic features such as age, gender, smoking habits and area of residence were recorded and statistically treated applying Shapiro-Wilk, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Mann Whitney and Kruskal Wallis tests (p < 0.05). Spearman correlation and principal component analysis (PCA) were also performed to investigate possible associations. RESULTS: The results demonstrated significantly higher (p < 0.05) trace elements concentrations in cases' serum compared to that of controls excluding Ba, with Cu (median concentration 1295 mug L(-1)) being the most abundant in cases. Additionally, concentration of toxic Pb and Cd were found at seven and four fold higher concentrations in cases, respectively. Among the trace elements examined, only Rb (164 mug L(-1)) was detected in higher concentrations in controls. Ba, Cd and Co presented the lowest concentrations (lower than 1 mug L(-1)). PCA was performed for overall and classified data, indicating a stronger relation among the toxic As, Cd, Ni and Pb in cases than controls, particularly referring to smokers and industrial sites' residents. Hematological parameters and factors such as age and gender did not present any significant outcome or correlation. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this pilot study suggest a potential relationship between metals and leukemia, especially concerning the toxic ones. Results from the employed source apportionment tools imply that smoking and atmospheric degradation may be positively related with higher metal serum levels in leukemia patients.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier GmbH.

Currently, therapies inhibiting KIT signaling are a leading strategy to treat MC proliferative disorders. However, these approaches may have off-target effects, and in some patients, complete remission or improved survival time cannot be achieved. These limitations led us to develop an approach using chemically stable exon skipping oligonucleotides (ESOs) that induce exon skipping of precursor (pre-)mRNA to alter gene splicing and introduce a frameshift into mature KIT mRNA transcripts. The result of this alternate approach results in marked downregulation of KIT expression, diminished KIT signaling, inhibition of MC proliferation, and rapid induction of apoptosis in neoplastic HMC-1.2 MCs. We demonstrate that in vivo administration of KIT targeting ESOs significantly inhibits tumor growth and systemic organ infiltration using both an allograft mastocytosis model and a humanized xenograft MC tumor model. We propose that our innovative approach, which employs well-tolerated, chemically stable oligonucleotides to target KIT expression through unconventional pathways, has potential as a KIT-targeted therapeutic alone, or in combination with agents that target KIT signaling, in the treatment of KIT-associated malignancies.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy.

SUMMARY: INTRODUCTION: As a result of advances in diagnostic techniques and the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, the prognosis of chronic myeloid leukemia has improved over the last decades. OBJECTIVE: Most of our knowledge about chronic myeloid leukemia results from clinical trials, therefore data derived from non-selected patient population is substantial. METHOD: Data of chronic myeloid leukemia patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors at the Department of Internal Medicine and Oncology, Semmelweis University, between 2003 and 2019 were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: 88 patients received treatment, 73 patients were on therapy at the time of the analysis. Overall survival at 5 years was 86%, progression-free survival at 5 years was 70%. 9 patients died, 2 of them due to progressive disease. 38 patients needed 2nd line therapy, the main reason of treatment change was failure of therapy. Subsequent treatment modifications were conducted mostly because of intolerance. More than half of the patients on 1st line treatment reached major molecular response and 85% of the patients on treatment at the end of the analysis are in major molecular response. DISCUSSION: Based on our data, survival and therapeutic response of patients in our center are similar to the international results. CONCLUSION: This analysis provides real-world data about treatment results of chronic myeloid leukemia in the tyrosine kinase inhibitor era.

Nearly 40% of patients with cancer using cannabis believe it will treat their cancer with numerous anecdotal reports shared online through social media platforms. Case reports have been published in peer-reviewed journals, but often lack key clinical information to validate anticancer claims. Methods: We reviewed literature in PubMed and EBSCO databases that evaluated the relationship between cannabis or the endocannabinoid system and potential anticancer activity. We also reviewed online sources, books, and ClinicalTrials.gov for reports or studies on using cannabis as cancer treatment. All case reports published in peer-reviewed journals were compiled and appraised as weak, moderate, or strong based on the quality of evidence provided supporting an anticancer effect. Strong reports met three criteria; (a) active cancer at time of cannabis administration, (b) validated laboratory or radiographic responses were reported, and (c) cannabis used without concurrent anticancer treatments. Results: Of the 207 pre-clinical articles reviewed, 107 (52%) were pre-clinical studies with original data. A total of 77 unique case reports described patients with various cancers (breast, central nervous system, gynecological, leukemia, lung, prostate, and pancreatic) using cannabis. Our appraisal showed 14% of the case reports were considered strong, 5% moderate, and the remaining 81% were weak. Ten percent of cases were in pediatric patients. Cannabidiol use was most often reported as the anticancer cannabinoid with daily doses ranging from 10 to 800 mg. Tetrahydrocannabinol use was reported in six studies, with doses ranging from 4.8 to 7.5 mg. Two small trials published data on survival in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. Conclusion: This review of clinical data suggests most published, peer-reviewed case reports provide insufficient data to support the claim for cannabis as an anticancer agent, and should not be used in place of evidence-based, traditional treatments outside of a clinical trial. No strong clinical trial data exist to confirm the pre-clinical studies that suggest cannabinoids may have an anticancer benefit. Future studies exploring anticancer potential of cannabis in patients with metastatic cancers who have not responded to traditional therapy are needed.",,"['Guggisberg, Jordan', 'Schumacher, Megan', 'Gilmore, Grace', 'Zylla, Dylan M']","['Guggisberg J', 'Schumacher M', 'Gilmore G', 'Zylla DM']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1726-3715'],"['The Cancer Research Center, HealthPartners/Park Nicollet, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'The Cancer Research Center, HealthPartners/Park Nicollet, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'The Cancer Research Center, HealthPartners/Park Nicollet, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'The Cancer Research Center, HealthPartners/Park Nicollet, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cannabis Cannabinoid Res,Cannabis and cannabinoid research,101684827,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['antineoplastic', 'cancer', 'cannabis', 'marijuana']",2021/08/10 06:00,2021/08/10 06:00,['2021/08/09 17:15'],"['2021/08/09 17:15 [entrez]', '2021/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/can.2021.0045 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Cannabis Cannabinoid Res. 2021 Aug 7. doi: 10.1089/can.2021.0045.,20210807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both centrifugation and red cell lysis can cause cellular depletion and cell dysfunction, resulting in erroneous measurements. To address limitations of current assays, we developed an improved strategy to determine cellular cytotoxicity using flow cytometry. Viable nucleic acid stains are used to identify live nucleated cells and discriminate them from non-nucleated erythrocytes, platelets, and debris while avoiding lysing and washing steps to maintain cell functionality. To detect target cells, we have used two different labeling approaches. In the first approach, EGFP-labeled K562 human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells provide a ""ready-to-use"" target without the need of additional for labeling or staining. For the second approach, we perform parallel cytotoxicity assays in the presence of wild-type K562 cells previously loaded with a fluorescent dye that has spectral properties similar to those of EGFP. Given the importance of cytotoxic assays and the deleterious effects of current sample preparation methods, the aim of this study was to adapt this ""untouched cells"" flow cytometry method to study cytotoxic activity using unlysed whole blood samples and fluorescent target cells.

From March 2008 to December 2016, 430 AL patients </= 35 years of age were included in the discovery, retrospective study. Patients who received transplantation from a MSD or a HSD had better 5-year OS rates compared with patients who received transplantation from a URD or a HPD. A superior graft-versus-leukemia effect was observed for high-risk patients undergoing HSD-HSCT with a lower relapse rate (p = 0.014) and a higher disease-free survival (DFS) rate (p = 0.029) compared with those undergoing MSD-HSCT. Outcomes of high-risk patients receiving an URD or HPD were equivalent. For intermediate/standard-risk patients, either a MSD or HSD may be the front-line donor selection with comparable outcomes. HLA-matched unrelated donors were preferred over HPDs with reduced non-relapse mortality and higher overall survival (OS) and DFS rates.

A recent computational study involving the TCGA database of glioma patients found RUNX1T1 as one of the downregulated driver genes associated with poor overall survival of glioma patients. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) is upregulated in glioma and has been associated with the severity and drug resistance of glioma. Previously, we have shown that RUNX1T3 degrades HIF1alpha affecting the proliferation of leukemia cells. We hypothesize that RUNX1T1 might be associated with the growth and development of glioma through the regulation of HIF1alpha. We have evaluated the expression level of RUNX1T1 at different stages of glioma and the effect of RUNX1T1 on the proliferation and invasiveness of glioblastoma cells in vitro. We further looked at the effect of RUNX1T1 on the expression and stability of HIF1alpha in vitro. Expression of RUNX1T1 was significantly downregulated, both at RNA and protein levels in glioma samples as studied by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. While expression of HIF1alpha was higher in glioma tissues compared with its level in the normal brain. In vitro studies demonstrated that RUNX1T1 interacted with HIF1alpha and recruited HIF1alpha modification factor such as PHD2 and GSK3beta causing hydroxylation of HIF1alpha following ubiquitination by FBW7. RUNX1T1 led to the degradation of HIF1alpha and decreased proliferation/invasiveness of glioblastoma cell lines. Further, RUNX1T1 increased the effectiveness of temozolomide (TMZ), a conventional glioma drug toward glioblastoma cell lines. This study indicates that downregulation of RUNX1T1 might play an important role in the severity and development of glioma.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Kumar, Parveen', 'Verma, Vivek', 'Mohania, Dheeraj', 'Gupta, Surbhi', 'Babbar, Avneet K', 'Rathi, Bhawna', 'Dhanda, Rakesh S', 'Yadav, Manisha']","['Kumar P', 'Verma V', 'Mohania D', 'Gupta S', 'Babbar AK', 'Rathi B', 'Dhanda RS', 'Yadav M']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8707-7219'],"['Dr. B.

Genome-wide association studies have identified missense variants in CDKN2A associated with the development of ALL. This study systematically evaluated the effects of CDKN2A coding variants on ALL risk. METHODS: We genotyped the CDKN2A coding region in 308 childhood ALL cases enrolled in CCCG-ALL-2015 clinical trials by Sanger Sequencing. Cell growth assay, cell cycle assay, MTT-based cell toxicity assay, and western blot were performed to assess the CDKN2A coding variants on ALL predisposition. RESULTS: We identified 10 novel exonic germline variants, including 6 missense mutations (p.A21V, p.G45A and p.V115L of p16INK4A; p.T31R, p.R90G, and p.R129L of p14ARF) and 1 nonsense mutation and 1 heterozygous termination codon mutation in exon 2 (p16INK4A p.S129X). Functional studies indicate that five novel variants resulted in reduced tumor suppressor activity of p16INK4A, and increased the susceptibility to the leukemic transformation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Compared to other variants, p.H142R contributes higher sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors. CONCLUSION: These findings provide direct insight into the influence of inherited genetic variants at the CDKN2A coding region on the development of ALL and the precise clinical application of CDK4/6 inhibitors.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s).

Utilizing nanoparticle tracking analysis, protein quantification, and electron microscopy, we show that ultracentrifugation with an OptiPrep cushion can effectively minimize contaminants from starting materials including plasma and conditioned media of CLL cell lines grown in EV-depleted complete RPMI media but not grown in the serum-free media AIM V commonly used in CLL experimental work. Moreover, we confirm the benefit of including 25 mM trehalose in PBS during EV isolation steps to reduce EV aggregation, to preserve function for downstream applications and characterization.

In the current study, we showed that the downregulation of FoxM1 by its inhibitor thiostrepton inhibited cell viability and induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in a panel of B-pre-ALL cell lines. Thiostrepton led downregulation of FoxM1 accompanied by decreased expression of Aurora kinase A, B, matrix metalloproteinases, and oncogene SKP2 as well as MTH1. Downregulation of the FoxM1/SKP2/MTH1 axis led to increase in the Bax/Bcl2 ratio and suppression of antiapoptotic proteins. Thiostrepton-mediated apoptosis was prevented by N-acetyl cysteine, a scavenger of reactive oxygen species. Co-treatment of B-pre-ALL with subtoxic doses of thiostrepton and bortezomib potentiated the proapoptotic action.

Present computational investigations explain dynamical behavior of water molecules during the conformational transition process from GMP to IMP using molecular dynamics simulations. Residues at substrate-binding site of cancerous protein (PDB Id. 2C6Q) are mostly more dynamic in nature than the normal protein (PDB Id. 2BLE). Nineteen conserved water molecules are identified at the GMP/IMP binding site and are classified as (i) conserved stable dynamic and (ii) infrequent dynamic. Water molecules W11, W14, and W16 are classified as conserved stable dynamic due to their immobile character, whereas remaining water molecules (W1, W2, W3, W4, W5, W7, W8, W9, W10, W12, W13, W15, W17, W18, and W19) are infrequent with dynamic nature. Entrance or displacement of these infrequent water molecules at GMP/IMP sites may occur due to forward and backward movement of reference residues involving ligands. Four water molecules of hGMPR-I and nine water molecules of hGMPR-II are observed in repetitive transitions from GMP to IMP pathway, which indicates discrimination between two isoforms of hGMPRs. Water molecules in cancerous protein are more dynamic and unstable compared to normal protein. These water molecules execute rare dynamical events at GMP binding site and could assist in detailed understanding of conformational transitions that influence the hGMPR's biological functionality.

With the deepening of non-coding RNA research, more and more miRNAs have been found to participate in various physiological processes of tumors. In this study, we tried to find the miRNA related to the prognosis of AML. METHODS: Collect gene expression data and clinical information of AML patients in the Cancer Genome Atlas database for statistical analysis. The expression level of miR-195 of each patient was standardized by logCPM and then produced as a box plot according to subtype classification. TargetScan was used to predict the target genes of miR-195, and these genes were subjected to GO pathway enrichment analysis by Metascape. Differential miRNAs were screened through the DESeq2 package in the R language. Survival rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. The multivariate Cox proportional hazard models of EFS and OS were established. RESULTS: We found that the expression of miR-195 was the lowest in cytogenetically normal (CN-) AML, and high expression of miR-195 only promoted the prognosis of chemotherapy-only CN-AML patients (EFS: P = 0.016; OS: P = 0.035). Multivariate analysis showed that miR-195(high) was a favorable and independent factor for CN-AML (both P < 0.05). Further analysis showed that miR-195 may affect signal transduction through ANHAK2 in AML. CONCLUSION: We found that high expression of miR-195 can increase prognosis time of chemotherapy-only CN-AML patients, providing a new possibility for treatment.",['(c) 2021.

The present review outlines the physiological characteristics of the SUMOylation pathway and provides examples of SUMOylation participation in different cancer types, including in hematological malignancies (leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma). It has been indicated that the SUMO pathway may influence chromosomal instability, cell cycle progression, apoptosis and chemical drug resistance.

Assuming this type of loss to follow-up as independent censoring, as in standard Kaplan-Meier estimates, ignores the likely association of abandonment with biologic and socio-economic factors related to outcome. Moreover, when comparing treatment protocols adopted in different time periods, possible imbalances in patients' characteristics must be considered. We aim to compare the outcome of children enrolled in two subsequent protocols for ALL treatment (2000-2007 and 2008-2015) in Honduras, taking both dependent censoring due to abandonment of treatment and imbalances between patient characteristics into account. METHODS: Marginal structural models based on inverse probability of treatment and censoring (IPTC) weighting allow the estimation of potential event-free survival (EFS) as if no abandonment of treatment occurred and the whole cohort was exposed, or not, to both protocols. An Aalen additive model and a logistic-regression model were used to build abandonment and treatment weights, respectively. RESULTS: The two protocols recruited 514 and 717 patients. Measured baseline covariates in both protocols were gender, age, white blood cell count, central nervous system involvement, tumour histology and socio-economic status. The potential EFS is slightly higher under the more recent protocol in the first 3 years but no difference is estimated in the long period [survival difference at 5 years (95% confidence interval) = 0.1% (-0.97%; 1.13%)]. Both protocols would allow reducing the event rate by 12-13% if there was no abandonment of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Using IPTC weighting, we found a similar potential effect of the two treatment protocols if the imbalance due to the different distribution of potential confounders and to abandonment of therapy was removed.","['(c) The Author(s) 2021; all rights reserved.

We evaluated data from 279 patients (545 CVC insertions) with haematological diseases including age, sex, underlying disease, reason for insertion, insertion site, number of lumens, venue, dates of insertion and removal, complete blood counts, percentage of neutrophils and serum albumin concentrations at the time of CVC insertion. Findings: Overall, 55 CLABSI events occurred during a period of 23,434 catheter days (2.35 per 1,000 catheter days). In total, 153 and 190 patients underwent 226 and 305 CVC insertions, respectively in a ward and in an operating room, respectively. Univariate analysis identified the operating room (P = 0.017), allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (P < 0.001), triple lumen catheter (P = 0.002), haemoglobin (P = 0.019), white blood cell count (P = 0.012) and percentage of neutrophils (P = 0.012) as significant factors for the development of CLABSI. However, multivariate analysis adjusted for age, reason for insertion, insertion site, number of lumens, haemoglobin, percentage of neutrophils and platelet counts found no significant differences between the venue where CVC were inserted and CLABSI development (P = 0.158). Conclusion: The venue of CVC insertion is unlikely to influence CLABSI development in patients with haematological diseases.",['(c) 2020 The Authors.'],"['Kitamura, Hiroaki', 'Kubota, Yasushi', 'Komukai, Sho', 'Yoshida, Hisako', 'Kaneko, Yukari', 'Mihara, Yukiko', 'Nagasawa, Zenzo', 'Kawaguchi, Atsushi', 'Aoki, Yosuke', 'Kimura, Shinya']","['Kitamura H', 'Kubota Y', 'Komukai S', 'Yoshida H', 'Kaneko Y', 'Mihara Y', 'Nagasawa Z', 'Kawaguchi A', 'Aoki Y', 'Kimura S']",,"['Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine, Saga University Hospital, Saga, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, Saga University Hospital, Saga, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, Saga University Hospital, Saga, Japan.', 'Department of Infectious Disease and Hospital Epidemiology, Saga University Hospital, Saga, Japan.', 'Department of Infectious Disease and Hospital Epidemiology, Saga University Hospital, Saga, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Technology and Sciences, School of Health Sciences at Fukuoka, International University of Health and Welfare, Okawa, Japan.', 'Education and Research Center for Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Department of Infectious Disease and Hospital Epidemiology, Saga University Hospital, Saga, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Infect Prev Pract,Infection prevention in practice,101777928,,['NOTNLM'],"['Central line-associated bloodstream infection', 'Central venous catheter', 'Haematological malignancy', 'Leukaemia', 'Operating room', 'Ward']",2020/03/04 00:00,2020/03/04 00:01,['2021/08/09 06:48'],"['2019/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/09 06:48 [entrez]', '2020/03/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/04 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.infpip.2020.100050 [doi]', 'S2590-0889(20)30014-7 [pii]']",epublish,Infect Prev Pract. 2020 Mar 4;2(2):100050. doi: 10.1016/j.infpip.2020.100050. eCollection 2020 Jun.,20200304,,,,PMC8336171,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First-degree relatives of individuals with CLL have an ~8 fold increased risk of developing the malignancy. Strong heritability suggests pedigree studies will have good power to localize pathogenic genes. However, CLL is relatively rare and heterogeneous, complicating ascertainment and analyses. Our goal was to identify CLL risk loci using unique resources available in Utah and methods to address intra-familial heterogeneity. Methods: We identified a six-generation high-risk CLL pedigree using the Utah Population Database. This pedigree contains 24 CLL cases connected by a common ancestor. We ascertained and genotyped eight CLL cases using a high-density SNP array, and then performed shared genomic segment (SGS) analysis - a method designed for extended high-risk pedigrees that accounts for heterogeneity. Results: We identified a genome-wide significant region (P = 1.9 x 10(-7), LOD-equivalent 5.6) at 2q22.1. The 0.9 Mb region was inherited through 26 meioses and shared by seven of the eight genotyped cases. It sits within a ~6.25 Mb locus identified in a previous linkage study of 206 small CLL families. Our narrow region intersects two genes, including CXCR4 which is highly expressed in CLL cells and implicated in maintenance and progression. Conclusion: SGS analysis of an extended high-risk CLL pedigree identified the most significant evidence to-date for a 0.9 Mb CLL disease locus at 2q22.1, harboring CXCR4. This discovery contributes to a growing literature implicating CXCR4 in inherited risk to CLL. Investigation of the segregating haplotype in the pedigree will be valuable for elucidating risk variant(s).",,"['Feusier, Julie E', 'Madsen, Michael J', 'Avery, Brian J', 'Williams, Justin A', 'Stephens, Deborah M', 'Hu, Boyu', 'Osman, Afaf E G', 'Glenn, Martha J', 'Camp, Nicola J']","['Feusier JE', 'Madsen MJ', 'Avery BJ', 'Williams JA', 'Stephens DM', 'Hu B', 'Osman AEG', 'Glenn MJ', 'Camp NJ']",,"['Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Hematological Malignancies, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Hematological Malignancies, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Hematological Malignancies, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Hematological Malignancies, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Hematological Malignancies, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Hematological Malignancies, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Hematological Malignancies, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA134674/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'TL1 TR002540/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],United States,J Transl Genet Genom,Journal of translational genetics and genomics,101754424,,['NOTNLM'],"['CXCR4', 'Gene-mapping', 'Utah Population Database (UPDB)', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)', 'linkage', 'pedigree', 'shared genomic segment (SGS)']",2021/08/10 06:00,2021/08/10 06:01,['2021/08/09 06:48'],"['2021/08/09 06:48 [entrez]', '2021/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.20517/jtgg.2021.05 [doi]'],ppublish,J Transl Genet Genom. 2021;5:189-199. doi: 10.20517/jtgg.2021.05.

Children with hematological tumors may have secondary fungal infections, including Fusarium infections, which are due to tumor bone marrow infiltration or prolonged bone marrow suppression after chemotherapy. Because of the lack of typical clinical manifestations and effective antifungal drugs, early diagnosis and treatment of the disease are difficult, and the prognosis is poor. CASE SUMMARY: The patient in this case was a 13-year-old female child with rash and fever as the first symptoms. She had the characteristics of the four stages of skin that are typical of Fusarium infection. She was diagnosed with disseminated Fusarium infection through skin biopsy and blood culture and diagnosed with Fusarium solani infection based on the morphological characteristics of the blood culture. After treatment with liposome amphotericin B combined with voriconazole, the child recovered. CONCLUSION: This case highlights that for children with secondary agranulocytosis after receiving chemotherapy for hematological malignancies, once typical abnormal skin damage is found, the possibility of Fusarium infection should be considered, and voriconazole alone or in combination with polyenes may be the most effective anti-Fusarium drugs. Amphotericin B, the traditional drug of disseminated Fusarium disease, has a high mortality rate, and it is not recommended to use it alone. Adequate neutrophil counts are essential for the treatment of disseminated Fusarium bloodstream infection.","['(c)The Author(s) 2021. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

Therefore little is known about the clinical features and suitable treatment for APL related MS due to the rarity of the disease, although this may be different from the treatment and prognosis of MS in the relapse stage. To our best knowledge, this is the second case report of APL initial presentation as colon MS. CASE SUMMARY: A 77-year-old woman complained of intermittent right lower abdominal pain, black stool, and difficult defecation for 2 mo. Physical examination showed diffuse tenderness during deep palpation and an anemic appearance. Laboratory findings showed positivity for fecal occult blood testing; white blood cell count: 3.84 x 10(9)/L; hemoglobin: 105 g/L; platelet count: 174 x 10(9)/L; and negativity for tumor markers. Abdominal enhanced computed tomography showed a space occupying lesion in the colon (1.9 cm). Fibrocolonoscopy revealed a polypoid and ulcerated mass measuring 2.5 cm. The tumor was removed. To our surprise, MS was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. PML/RARalpha fusion gene was detected in colon specimens by fluorescent in situ hybridization and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, which was consistent with the bone marrow. She was diagnosed as having APL related MS. A smooth and unobstructed intestinal wall was found by fibrocolonoscopy, and continuous molecular remission was confirmed in both the bone marrow and colon after four courses of ATRA + arsenic trioxide (ATO). ATRA + ATO showed a favorable therapeutic response for both APL and MS. CONCLUSION: Early use of ATRA can benefit APL patients, regardless of whether MS is the first or recurrent manifestation.","['(c)The Author(s) 2021. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

Under physiologic conditions the niche protects hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from sustained or overstimulation. Acute or chronic stress deregulates hematopoiesis and some of these alterations occur indirectly via the niche. Effects on niche cells include skewing of its cellular composition, specific localization and molecular signals that differentially regulate the function of HSCs and their progeny. Importantly, while acute insults display only transient effects, repeated or chronic insults lead to sustained alterations of the niche, resulting in HSC deregulation. We here describe how changes in BM niche composition (ecosystem) and structure (remodeling) modulate activation of HSCs in situ. Current knowledge has revealed that upon chronic stimulation, BM remodeling is more extensive and otherwise quiescent HSCs may be lost due to diminished cellular maintenance processes, such as autophagy, ER stress response, and DNA repair. Features of aging in the BM ecology may be the consequence of intermittent stress responses, ultimately resulting in the degeneration of the supportive stem cell microenvironment. Both chronic stress and aging impair the functionality of HSCs and increase the overall susceptibility to development of diseases, including malignant transformation. To understand functional degeneration, an important prerequisite is to define distinguishing features of unperturbed niche homeostasis in different settings. A unique setting in this respect is xenotransplantation, in which human cells depend on niche factors produced by other species, some of which we will review. These insights should help to assess deviations from the steady state to actively protect and improve recovery of the niche ecosystem in situ to optimally sustain healthy hematopoiesis in experimental and clinical settings.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Frobel, Landspersky, Percin, Schreck, Rahmig, Ori, Nowak,', 'Essers, Waskow and Oostendorp.']","['Frobel, Julia', 'Landspersky, Theresa', 'Percin, Gulce', 'Schreck, Christina', 'Rahmig, Susann', 'Ori, Alessandro', 'Nowak, Daniel', 'Essers, Marieke', 'Waskow, Claudia', 'Oostendorp, Robert A J']","['Frobel J', 'Landspersky T', 'Percin G', 'Schreck C', 'Rahmig S', 'Ori A', 'Nowak D', 'Essers M', 'Waskow C', 'Oostendorp RAJ']",,"['Immunology of Aging, Leibniz Institute on Aging - Fritz Lipmann Institute, Jena, Germany.', 'School of Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine III, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Immunology of Aging, Leibniz Institute on Aging - Fritz Lipmann Institute, Jena, Germany.', 'School of Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine III, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Immunology of Aging, Leibniz Institute on Aging - Fritz Lipmann Institute, Jena, Germany.', 'Proteomics of Aging, Leibniz Institute on Aging - Fritz Lipmann Institute, Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Heidelberg Institute for Stem Cell Technology and Experimental Medicine (HI-STEM gGmbH), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division Inflammatory Stress in Stem Cells, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Immunology of Aging, Leibniz Institute on Aging - Fritz Lipmann Institute, Jena, Germany.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, Technical University Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'School of Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine III, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,['NOTNLM'],"['aging', 'bone marrow', 'hematopoiesis', 'leukemia', 'microenvironment', 'niche', 'transplantation', 'xenograft']",2021/08/10 06:00,2021/08/10 06:01,['2021/08/09 06:41'],"['2021/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/09 06:41 [entrez]', '2021/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2021.705410 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Jul 22;9:705410. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.705410. eCollection 2021.,20210722,,,,PMC8339972,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They kill primarily through the release of granules containing potent cytolytic molecules. NK cells also release these molecules within membrane-bound exosomes and microvesicles - collectively known as extracellular vesicles (EV). Here we report the characterization and anti-tumor function of EVs isolated from NK3.3 cells, a well described clonal normal human NK cell line. We show that NK3.3 EVs contain the cytolytic molecules perforin, granzymes A and B, and granulysin, and an array of common EV proteins. We previously reported that the E3 ubiquitin ligase, natural killer lytic-associated molecule (NKLAM), is localized to NK granules and is essential for maximal NK killing; here we show it is present in the membrane of NK3.3 EVs. NK3.3-derived EVs also carry multiple RNA species, including miRNAs associated with anti-tumor activity. We demonstrate that NK3.3 EVs inhibit proliferation and induce caspase-mediated apoptosis and cell death of an array of both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic tumor cell lines. This effect is tumor cell specific; normal cells are unaffected by EV treatment.

Overall, in this study, the area of the 1005 cm(-1) DNA SERS marker band shows a stepwise decrease in DNA global methylation as cells progress from a pre-leukemia to a full-blown acute leukemia, highlighting thus the potential of SERS as an emerging method of analyzing the methylation landscape of DNA in the context of leukemia genesis and progression.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Moisoiu, Sas, Stefancu, Iancu, Jurj, Pasca, Iluta, Zimta,', 'Tigu, Teodorescu, Turcas, Blag, Dima, Popa, Arghirescu, Man, Colita, Leopold and', 'Tomuleasa.']","['Moisoiu, Vlad', 'Sas, Valentina', 'Stefancu, Andrei', 'Iancu, Stefania D', 'Jurj, Ancuta', 'Pasca, Sergiu', 'Iluta, Sabina', 'Zimta, Alina-Andreea', 'Tigu, Adrian B', 'Teodorescu, Patric', 'Turcas, Cristina', 'Blag, Cristina', 'Dima, Delia', 'Popa, Gheorghe', 'Arghirescu, Smaranda', 'Man, Sorin', 'Colita, Anca', 'Leopold, Nicolae', 'Tomuleasa, Ciprian']","['Moisoiu V', 'Sas V', 'Stefancu A', 'Iancu SD', 'Jurj A', 'Pasca S', 'Iluta S', 'Zimta AA', 'Tigu AB', 'Teodorescu P', 'Turcas C', 'Blag C', 'Dima D', 'Popa G', 'Arghirescu S', 'Man S', 'Colita A', 'Leopold N', 'Tomuleasa C']",,"['Faculty of Physics, Babes-Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Faculty of Physics, Babes-Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Faculty of Physics, Babes-Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Research Center for Functional Genomics and Translational Medicine, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Medfuture Research Center for Advanced Medicine, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Medfuture Research Center for Advanced Medicine, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Victor Babes University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Timisoara, Romania.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Louis Turcanu Emergency Hospital for Children, Timisoara, Romania.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Fundeni Clinical Institute, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Faculty of Physics, Babes-Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Biomed Data Analytics SRL, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Medfuture Research Center for Advanced Medicine, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Ion Chiricuta Clinical Cancer Center, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Bioeng Biotechnol,Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,101632513,,['NOTNLM'],"['SERS', 'acute leukemia', 'down syndrome', 'myeloproliferative neoplasm', 'transient leukemia associated with down syndrome']",2021/08/10 06:00,2021/08/10 06:01,['2021/08/09 06:41'],"['2021/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/09 06:41 [entrez]', '2021/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fbioe.2021.703268 [doi]'],epublish,Front Bioeng Biotechnol. 2021 Jul 23;9:703268. doi: 10.3389/fbioe.2021.703268. eCollection 2021.,20210723,,,,PMC8343173,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The MED14-HOXA9 fusion gene was detected in both the diagnostic and relapsed blasts with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing. The patient received combined conventional chemotherapy but suffered relapse at 11 months and died of disease progression one year after the initial diagnosis.

The development of immunotherapies such as anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor(CAR) T cells and bispecific T-cell engagers has given clinicians therapeutic options with less expected toxicity when compared to standard re-induction chemotherapy. This is especially beneficial in patients with toxicities from their prior treatment. Along with this, the emergence of haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has increased opportunity for patients to receive HCT who may not have had an available matched donor. We present four patients who have received all of these therapies in different combinations to treat multiple relapses. Because of the success of achieving remission as well as decreasing toxicity, the patients are alive and well up to 15 y after the original B-ALL diagnosis, rendering this as a chronic disease for them.","['(c) 2021 The Author(s).

For both chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)- and TCR-redirected T cells, several clinical studies indicate that T cell subsets with a less-differentiated phenotype (e.g. stem cell memory T cells, TSCM) survive longer and mediate superior anti-tumor effects in vivo as opposed to more terminally differentiated T cells. Cytokines added during in vitro and ex vivo culture of T cells play an important role in driving the phenotype of T cells for adoptive transfer. Using the OP9-DL1 co-culture system, we have shown previously that we are able to generate in vitro, starting from clinically relevant stem cell sources, T cells with a single tumor antigen (TA)-specific TCR. This method circumvents possible TCR chain mispairing and unwanted toxicities that might occur when introducing a TA-specific TCR in peripheral blood lymphocytes. We now show that we are able to optimize our in vitro culture protocol, by adding IL-21 during maturation, resulting in generation of TA-specific T cells with a less-differentiated phenotype and enhanced in vitro anti-tumor effects. We believe the favorable TSCM-like phenotype of these in vitro generated T cells preludes superior in vivo persistence and anti-tumor efficacy. Therefore, these TA-specific T cells could be of use as a valuable new form of patient-tailored T cell immunotherapy for malignancies for which finding a suitable CAR-T target antigen is challenging, such as AML.","['(c) 2021 The Author(s).

This study aimed at defining the potential impact of IL-1beta in the post-remission phase of AML patients receiving immunotherapy for relapse prevention in an international phase IV trial of 84 patients (ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT01347996). Consecutive serum samples were collected from AML patients in first complete remission (CR) who received cycles of relapse-preventive immunotherapy with histamine dihydrochloride (HDC) and low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2). Low IL-1beta serum levels before and after the first HDC/IL-2 treatment cycle favorably prognosticated leukemia-free survival and overall survival. Serum levels of IL-1beta were significantly reduced in patients receiving HDC/IL-2. HDC also reduced the formation of IL-1beta from activated human PBMCs in vitro. Additionally, high serum levels of the IL-1 receptor antagonist IL-1RA were associated with favorable outcome, and AML patients with low IL-1beta along with high IL-1RA levels were strikingly protected against leukemic relapse. Our results suggest that strategies to target IL-1beta might impact on relapse risk and survival in AML.","['(c) 2021 The Author(s).

We aimed to determine the presence of these rare variants in young men with severe COVID-19. Methods: We prospectively studied males between 18 and 50 years-old without predisposing comorbidities that required at least high-flow nasal oxygen to treat COVID-19. The coding region of TLR7 was sequenced to assess the presence of potentially deleterious variants. Results: TLR7 missense variants were identified in two out of 14 patients (14.3%). Overall, the median age was 38 (IQR 30-45) years. Both variants were not previously reported in population control databases and were predicted to be damaging by in silico predictors. In a 30-year-old patient a maternally inherited variant [c.644A>G; p.(Asn215Ser)] was identified, co-segregating in his 27-year-old brother who also contracted severe COVID-19. A second variant [c.2797T>C; p.(Trp933Arg)] was found in a 28-year-old patient, co-segregating in his 24-year-old brother who developed mild COVID-19. Functional testing of this variant revealed decreased type I and II interferon responses in peripheral mononuclear blood cells upon stimulation with the TLR7 agonist imiquimod, confirming a loss-of-function effect. Conclusions: This study supports a rationale for the genetic screening for TLR7 variants in young men with severe COVID-19 in the absence of other relevant risk factors. A diagnosis of TLR7 deficiency could not only inform on treatment options for the patient, but also enables pre-symptomatic testing of at-risk male relatives with the possibility of instituting early preventive and therapeutic interventions.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Solanich, Vargas-Parra, van der Made, Simons,', 'Schuurs-Hoeijmakers, Antoli, del Valle, Rocamora-Blanch, Setien, Esteller, van',

However, toxicities associated with CAR-T therapy are being increasingly identified. Pancytopenia is one of the most common complications after CAR-T therapy, and platelet transfusions are an essential part of its supportive care. Study Design and Methods: This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of platelet transfusions for R/R ALL patients at our single center and identify associated risk factors. Overall, 44 R/R ALL patients were enrolled in this study, of whom 26 received CAR-T therapy and 18 received salvage chemotherapy. Result: Patients in the CAR-T group had a higher incidence of platelet transfusion refractoriness (PTR) (15/26, 57.7%) than those in the chemotherapy group (3/18, 16.7%) (p = 0.007). For patients receiving CAR-T therapy, multivariate analysis showed that the grade of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was the only independent risk factor associated with PTR (p = 0.007). Moreover, higher peak serum IL-6 and IFN-gamma levels suggested a higher risk of PTR (p = 0.024 and 0.009, respectively). Patients with PTR received more platelet infusion doses than those without PTR (p = 0.0426). Patients with PTR had more grade 3-4 bleeding events than those without PTR (21.4 vs. 0%, p = 0.230), and the cumulative incidence of grade 3-4 bleeding event was different (p = 0.023). Conclusion: We found for the first time that PTR is associated with the CRS grade. Improved knowledge on the mechanisms of PTR after CAR-T therapy is needed to design a rational therapeutic strategy that aims to improve the efficiency of transfusions.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Liu, Liang, Liu, Wei, Wu, Yang, Yang, Huang, Xie and Hu.']","['Liu, Yadan', 'Liang, Bin', 'Liu, Yan', 'Wei, Guoqing', 'Wu, Wenjun', 'Yang, Luxin', 'Yang, Li', 'Huang, He', 'Xie, Jue', 'Hu, Yongxian']","['Liu Y', 'Liang B', 'Liu Y', 'Wei G', 'Wu W', 'Yang L', 'Yang L', 'Huang H', 'Xie J', 'Hu Y']",,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Engineering Laboratory for Stem Cell and Immunity Therapy, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Engineering Laboratory for Stem Cell and Immunity Therapy, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Engineering Laboratory for Stem Cell and Immunity Therapy, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Engineering Laboratory for Stem Cell and Immunity Therapy, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Engineering Laboratory for Stem Cell and Immunity Therapy, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Engineering Laboratory for Stem Cell and Immunity Therapy, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Engineering Laboratory for Stem Cell and Immunity Therapy, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Zhejiang Province Engineering Laboratory for Stem Cell and Immunity Therapy, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'chimeric antigen receptor T cells', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'platelet transfusion refractoriness', 'relapsed/refractory']",2021/08/10 06:00,2021/08/10 06:01,['2021/08/09 06:29'],"['2021/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/09 06:29 [entrez]', '2021/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fphar.2021.702152 [doi]', '702152 [pii]']",epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2021 Jul 23;12:702152. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2021.702152. eCollection 2021.,20210723,,,,PMC8343018,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Data on patients diagnosed with primary SCE as their first malignancy were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database from 2000 to 2016. Observed-to-expected ratios of SPNs were calculated to estimate standardized incidence ratios (SIRs). Patients were compared with a reference population (RP) matched for age, gender, and race. RESULTS: Five hundred fifty-nine patients with primary SCE were identified, 16% of whom developed SPNs. SCE patients displayed a 61% increased risk of developing SPNs compared with the RP (p < 0.001). Overall, the risk of SPNs of the lungs (SIR = 1.82; p < 0.05), pancreas (SIR = 2.94; p < 0.05), salivary glands (SIR = 41.65; p < 0.001), and skin (SIR = 8.33; p < 0.05) was elevated. Only non-Hispanic Whites were at an increased risk (SIR = 1.51; p < 0.05). Patients 40-54 years old at the time of diagnosis were at the highest risk of developing SPNs compared with the RP (SIR = 3.15; p < 0.05). Women with SCE experienced an increased risk of breast cancer (SIR = 3.6; p < 0.05) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (SIR = 8.8; p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: SCE patients are more likely to develop SPNs of the lungs, pancreas, salivary gland, and skin than the RP. Forty to fifty-four years old Caucasian patients are at the highest risk. Women are at an increased risk of developing breast malignancies and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Clinicians should be cognizant of these risks when managing SCE patients.","['Copyright (c) 2021 by The American Society of Ophthalmic Plastic and', 'Reconstructive Surgery, Inc., All rights reserved.']","['Tadrosse, Abanoob F', 'Tadrosse, Marina F', 'Ezzat, Bishoy M', 'Sadek, Dina M', 'Langer, Paul D']","['Tadrosse AF', 'Tadrosse MF', 'Ezzat BM', 'Sadek DM', 'Langer PD']",,"['Institute of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, Newark, New Jersey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Ophthalmic Plast Reconstr Surg,Ophthalmic plastic and reconstructive surgery,8508431,IM,,,2021/08/10 06:00,2021/08/10 06:00,['2021/08/09 06:19'],"['2021/08/09 06:19 [entrez]', '2021/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/IOP.0000000000002039 [doi]', '00002341-900000000-97807 [pii]']",aheadofprint,Ophthalmic Plast Reconstr Surg. 2021 Aug 5. pii: 00002341-900000000-97807. doi: 10.1097/IOP.0000000000002039.,20210805,,,,,['The authors have no financial or conflicts of interest to disclose.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, the mechanism of HSPC aging is lacking, especially the cellular memory mechanism. Here, we not only reported a new HSPC senescence model in vitro, but also propose and verify the cellular memory mechanism of HSPC aging of the Polycomb/Trithorax system. METHODS: HSPCs (Lin(-)c-kit(+) cells) were isolated and purified by magnetic cell sorting (MACS). The proportions and cell cycle distribution of cells were determined by flow cytometry; senescence-related beta-galactosidase assay, transmission electron microscope (TEM), and colony-forming unit (CFU)-mix assay were detected for identification of the old HSPC model. Proteomic tests and RNA-seq were applied to analyze differential pathways and genes in the model cells. qPCR, Western blot (WB), and chromatin immunoprecipitation PCR (CHIP-PCR) were used to detect the gene expression of cell memory-related proteins. Knockdown of cell memory-related key genes was performed with shRNA interference. RESULTS: In the model old HSPCs, beta-gal activity, cell cycle, colony-forming ability, aging-related cell morphology, and metabolic pathway were significantly changed compared to the young HSPCs. Furthermore, we found the model HSPCs have more obvious aging manifestations than those of natural mice, and IL3 is the major factor contributing to HSPC aging in the model. We also observed dramatic changes in the expression level of PRC/TrxG complexes. After further exploring the downstream molecules of PRC/TrxG complexes, we found that Uhrf1 and TopII played critical roles in HSPC aging based on the HSPC senescence model. CONCLUSIONS: These findings proposed a new HSPC senescence model in vitro which we forecasted could be used to preliminary screen the drugs of the HSPC aging-related hemopathy and suggested cellular memory mechanism of HSPC aging.",['(c) 2021.

Here, single-cell RNA sequencing is performed with T cells sorted from the peripheral blood of healthy individuals and patients with B cell-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Unbiased bioinformatics analysis enabled the authors to identify 13 T cell clusters in the patients based on their molecular properties. All 11 major T cell subsets in healthy individuals are found in the patients with B-ALL, with the counterparts in the patients universally showing more activated characteristics. Two exhausted T cell populations, characterized by up-regulation of TIGIT, PDCD1, HLADRA, LAG3, and CTLA4 are specifically discovered in B-ALL patients. Of note, these exhausted T cells possess remarkable heterogeneity, and ten sub-clusters are further identified, which are characterized by different cell cycle phases, naive states, and GNLY (coding granulysin) expression. Coupled with single-cell T cell receptor repertoire profiling, diverse originations of the exhausted T cells in B-ALL are suggested, and clonally expanded exhausted T cells are likely to originate from CD8(+) effector memory/terminal effector cells.

Here, we summarize the long-term follow-up of 254 B-ALL treated with CD19 CAR-T cells from 5 clinical trials (NCT03173417, NCT02546739, and NCT03671460 retrospectively registered on May 23, 2017, March 1, 2018, and September 7, 2018, respectively, at www.clinicaltrials.gov ; ChiCTR-ONC-17012829, and ChiCTR1800016541 retrospectively registered on September 28, 2017, and June 7, 2018, at www.chictr.org.cn ). Our data showed that TP53 mutation, bone marrow blasts > 20%, prior CAR-T/blinatumomab treatment, and severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS) were associated with a lower complete remission (CR) rate while age, extramedullary disease, complex cytogenetics, history of prior transplant, prior courses of chemotherapy, CAR-T cell dose, and manufacturing source of the cellular product did not affect patients' CR rate. Risk factors related to leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS) were history of prior transplant, complex cytogenetics, TP53 mutation, severe CRS, neurotoxicity, and CAR-T therapy without consolidative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Age and CAR-T cell dose did not influence LFS and OS. Patients with consolidative allo-HSCT after CAR-T therapy had a superior OS and LFS compared to those who did not. This benefit was also observed in both pediatric and adult patients as well as in patients either in high- or low-risk groups. This large study to identify risk factors of CR, LFS, and OS may help to maximize clinical outcomes of CAR-T therapy. Precis TP53 mutation and BM blasts > 20% are two independent factors associated with the CR rate. Patients with high tumor burden as well as those with bone marrow blasts < 5% can benefit from consolidative allo-HSCT post-CAR-T therapy.","['(c) 2021.

Given the scarcity of smouldering samples, little data are available to determine which translational programmes are dysregulated and whether the mechanisms of progression are uniform across the main molecular subgroups. In this work, we investigated 223 SMM and 1348 MM samples from the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) for which we had gene expression profiling (GEP). Patients were analysed by TC-7 subgroup for gene expression changes between SMM and MM. Among the commonly dysregulated genes in each subgroup, PHF19 and EZH2 highlight the importance of the PRC2.1 complex. We show that subgroup specific differences exist even at the SMM stage of disease with different biological features driving progression within each TC molecular subgroup. These data suggest that MMSET SMM has already transformed, but that the other precursor diseases are distinct clinical entities from their symptomatic counterpart.","['(c) 2021.

However, study groups have only started to use RNA-Seq. For broader clinical use, technical, quality control, and appropriate performance validation are needed. We describe the development and validation of an RNA-Seq workflow for subtype classification, TPMT/NUDT15/TP53 variant discovery, and immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) disease clone identification for Malaysia-Singapore acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) 2020. We validated this workflow in 377 patients in our preceding Malaysia-Singapore ALL 2003/Malaysia-Singapore ALL 2010 studies and proposed the quality control measures for RNA quality, library size, sequencing, and data analysis using the International Organization for Standardization 15189 quality and competence standard for medical laboratories. Compared with conventional methods, we achieved >95% accuracy in oncogene fusion identification, digital karyotyping, and TPMT and NUDT15 variant discovery. We found seven pathogenic TP53 mutations, confirmed with Sanger sequencing, which conferred a poorer outcome. Applying this workflow prospectively to the first 21 patients in Malaysia-Singapore ALL 2020, we identified the genetic drivers and IGH disease clones in >90% of patients with concordant TPMT, NUDT15, and TP53 variants using PCR-based methods. The median turnaround time was 12 days, which was clinically actionable. In conclusion, RNA-Seq workflow could be used clinically in management of B-cell ALL patients.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Association for Molecular Pathology and American Society for', 'Investigative Pathology.

Nucleophosmin 1(NPM1) protein is an abundant multifunctional nucleolar chaperone and its gene is the most frequently mutated in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients. So far, the role of NPM1 mutations in leukemogenesis has remained largely elusive considering that they have the double effect of unfolding the C-terminal domain (CTD) and delocalizing the protein in the cytosol (NPM1c+). This mislocalization heavily impacts on cell cycle regulation. Our recent investigations unequivocally demonstrated an amyloid aggregation propensity introduced by AML mutations. Herein, employing complementary biophysical assays, we have characterized a N-terminal extended version of type F AML mutation of CTD and proved that it is able to form assemblies with amyloid character and fibrillar morphology. The present study represents an additional phase of knowledge to deepen the roles exerted by different types of cytoplasmatic NPM1c+ forms to develop in the future potential therapeutics for their selective targeting.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The presence and drug resistance nature of cancer stem cells (CSCs) further lends HMs hard to cure. The development of new treatments like molecular targeted drugs and antibodies has improved the clinical outcomes for HMs but only to a certain extent, due to issues of low bioavailability, moderate response, occurrence of drug resistance, and/or dose-limiting toxicities. In the past years, polymeric nanomedicines targeting HMs including refractory and relapsed lymphoma, leukemia and multiple myeloma have emerged as a promising chemotherapeutic approach that is shown capable of overcoming drug resistance, delivering drugs not only to cancer cells but also CSCs, and increasing therapeutic index by lessening drug-associated adverse effects. In addition, polymeric nanomedicines have shown to potentiate next-generation anticancer modalities such as therapeutic proteins and nucleic acids in effectively treating HMs. In this review, we highlight recent advance in targeted polymeric nanoformulations that are coated with varying ligands (e.g. cancer cell membrane proteins, antibodies, transferrin, hyaluronic acid, aptamer, peptide, and folate) and loaded with different therapeutic agents (e.g. chemotherapeutics, molecular targeted drugs, therapeutic antibodies, nucleic acid drugs, and apoptotic proteins) for directing to distinct targets (e.g. CD19, CD20, CD22, CD30, CD38, CD44, CD64, CXCR, FLT3, VLA-4, and bone marrow microenvironment) in HMs. The advantages and potential challenges of different designs are discussed.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Asymmetric segregation of Notch signaling regulatory protein Numb plays a crucial role in cell diversification. However, the molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we examined the unequal distribution of Numb in the daughter cells of murine erythroleukemia cells (MELCs) that undergo DMSO-induced erythroid differentiation. In contrast to the cytoplasmic localization of Numb during uninduced cell division, Numb is concentrated at the cell boundary in interphase, near the one-spindle pole in metaphase, and is unequally distributed to one daughter cell in anaphase in induced cells. The inheritance of Numb guides this daughter cell toward erythroid differentiation while the other cell remains a progenitor cell. Mitotic spindle orientation, critical for distribution of cell fate determinants, requires complex communication between the spindle microtubules and the cell cortex mediated by the NuMA-LGN-dynein/dynactin complex. Depletion of each individual member of the complex randomizes the position of Numb relative to the mitotic spindle. Gene replacement confirms that multifunctional erythrocyte protein 4.1R (4.1R) functions as a member of the NuMA-LGN-dynein/dynactin complex and is necessary for regulating spindle orientation, in which interaction between 4.1R and NuMA plays an important role. These results suggest that mispositioning of Numb is the result of spindle misorientation. Finally, disruption of the 4.1R-NuMA-LGN complex increases Notch signaling and decreases the erythroblast population. Together, our results identify a critical role for 4.1R in regulating the asymmetric segregation of Numb to mediate erythropoiesis.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, the fixed-dose HMAs approach was adopted to reduce the expenses. This study focuses on the clinical outcome of various treatment protocols, including intensive chemotherapy, fixed-dose HMAs, and palliative treatment in Thai elderly patients with AML. Fixed-dose HMAs include 5-azacitidine given at 100 mg per day for seven days and decitabine given at 30 mg per day for 5 days. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a 10-year cohort study focused on elderly AML patients aged over 60 years. The exclusion criteria were acute promyelocytic leukemia. RESULTS: A total of 243 AML patients were enrolled. Comparing 3 groups of treatment regimens (intensive chemotherapy, fixed-dose HMAs, and palliative treatment), the proportions of patients in each category accounted for 23.5%, 21.4%, and 55.1%, respectively. The median overall survival (OS) in each therapeutic option was 7.7, 11, and 2.5 months, respectively. From multivariate analysis, palliative treatment was significantly inferior OS comparing to the fixed-dose HMAs and intensive treatment (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.42; 95% CI, 0.29-0.60; P value <.001 and HR: 0.41; 95% CI, 0.28-0.61; P value <.001, respectively). Nevertheless, the OS outcome in patients with fixed-dose HMAs was comparable to those who received intensive treatment. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that the fixed-dose regimen of HMAs is the reasonable treatment for these patients, and this approach is not inferior to intensive therapy.

Nilotinib, a c-Abl inhibitor used for chronic myeloid leukemia, has been proven effective in relieving PD progression. However, whether nilotinib could affect neuroinflammation is largely unknown. In this current study, we investigated the role of nilotinib in microglia-mediated neuroinflammatory response in Parkinson's disease. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation in BV2 microglial cells and mouse brains were used as models for Parkinson's disease. Our results demonstrated that nilotinib significantly suppressed LPS-induced neuroinflammation by reducing the production of pro-inflammatory factors including iNOS, COX-2, IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha in BV2 cells. Moreover, pretreatment of nilotinib attenuated the neurotoxicity of LPS-treated microglial conditioned medium to MES23.5 dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Mechanismly, nilotinib inhibited NF-kappaB signaling pathway and suppressed the nuclear translocation of p65 upon LPS stimulation. In LPS-injected mouse brains, nilotinib administration markedly suppressed the activation of microglia and down-regulated COX-2 as well as IL-1beta expression. Most importantly, nilotinib effectively protected against microglial activation-mediated mouse DA neuronal loss. Taken together, our study suggests that nilotinib exerts anti-neuroinflammatory effect and protects DA neurons from activated microglia-induced inflammatory damage through suppressing NF-kappaB signaling pathway, indicating its potential application in further clinical trials.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Conventional methods for assessing FLT3-ITD status and allele burden have been primarily limited to PCR fragment size analysis because of the inherent difficulty in detecting large ITD variants by next-generation sequencing (NGS). In this study, we assess the performance of publicly available bioinformatic tools for the detection and quantification of FLT3-ITDs in clinical hybridization-capture NGS data. We found that FLT3_ITD_ext had the highest overall accuracy for detecting FLT3-ITDs and was able to accurately quantify allele burden. Although all other tools evaluated were able to detect FLT3-ITDs reasonably well, allele burden was consistently underestimated. We were able to significantly improve quantification of FLT3-ITD allelic burden independent of the detection method by utilizing soft-clipped reads and/or ITD junctional sequences. In addition, we show that identifying mutant reads by previously identified junctional sequences further improves the sensitivity of detecting FLT3-ITDs in post-treatment samples. Our results demonstrate that FLT3-ITDs can be reliably detected in clinical NGS data using available bioinformatic tools. We further describe how accurate quantification of FLT3-ITD allele burden can be added on to existing clinical NGS pipelines for routine assessment of FLT3-ITD status in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Association for Molecular Pathology and American Society for', 'Investigative Pathology.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk of LHMs in patients with psoriasis according to the best evidence. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational cohort studies was undertaken to assess the association of psoriasis with different LHMs. A literature search for relevant studies was performed on February 28, 2021. The random-effects model in conducting meta-analyses was applied. To evaluate the risk of bias, the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was employed. RESULTS: A total of 25 observational studies were selected, comprising collectively 2,501,652 subjects. A significantly increased risk for LHM (hazard ratio [HR], 1.55; 1.24-2.94) and lymphoma (HR, 1.27; 1.08-1.50) in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis compared to the general population was found. In detail, increased risks for Hodgkin lymphoma (HR, 1.71; 1.27-2.30), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (HR, 1.27; 1.08-1.50), multiple myeloma (HR, 1.32; 1.03-1.69), and leukemia (HR, 1.28; 1.00-1.65) were found. The risk of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma was markedly augmented in patients with psoriasis (HR, 6.22; 3.39-11.42).

However, the association of PD-L1 expression with the clinicopathological features and prognosis in pediatric ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) remains unclear. Using PD-L1/ALK immunofluorescence double staining, we evaluated the PD-L1 expression on tumor cells/tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) and the quantity of TIICs in 54 children with ALK-positive ALCL treated with the ALCL99 protocol. The percentages of PD-L1-positive tumor cells were significantly lower in patients with skin/mediastinum involvement, clinical high-risk group, present minimal disseminated disease (MDD), and a low ALK-antibody titer. The percentages of PD-L1-positive TIICs were significantly higher in patients with absent MDD. The percentages of TIICs were significantly lower in patients with absent MDD and a common morphological pattern. We classified patients according to the PD-L1 expression on tumor cells (Tumor-PD-L1), PD-L1 expression on TIICs (TIIC-PD-L1), and quantity of TIICs (TIIC-quantity). The progression-free survival (PFS) did not differ between Tumor-PD-L1(high) and Tumor-PD-L1(low) ALCL; TIIC-PD-L1(high) and TIIC-PD-L1(low) ALCL; and TIIC-quantity(high) and TIIC-quantity(low) ALCL. According to the combined parameters of Tumor-PD-L1 and TIIC-quantity, Tumor-PD-L1(high)/TIIC-quantity(high) ALCL had a worse 5-year PFS than other ALCL (50% versus 83%; P = .009). Tumor-PD-L1(high)/TIIC-quantity(high) ALCL remained a significant prognostic factor in multivariate analysis (P = .044). This is the first study to demonstrate that a high tumoral PD-L1 expression with a high quantity of TIICs was associated with a poor prognosis in pediatric ALK-positive ALCL.

Since targeting metabolic vulnerability is the emerging therapeutic strategy of cancer, we herein investigated a novel therapeutic target of Evi1 by analyzing transcriptomic, epigenetic, and metabolomic profiling of mouse high Evi1 leukemia cells. We revealed that Evi1 overexpression and Evi1-driven leukemic transformation upregulate transcription of gluconeogenesis enzyme Fbp1 and other pentose phosphate enzymes with interaction between Evi1 and the enhancer region of these genes. Metabolome analysis using Evi1-overexpressing leukemia cells uncovered pentose phosphate pathway upregulation by Evi1 overexpression. Suppression of Fbp1 as well as pentose phosphate pathway enzymes by shRNA-mediated knockdown selectively decreased Evi1-driven leukemogenesis in vitro. Moreover, pharmacological or shRNA-mediated Fbp1 inhibition in secondarily transplanted Evi1-overexpressing leukemia mouse significantly decreased leukemia cell burden. Collectively, targeting FBP1 is a promising therapeutic strategy of high Evi1 AML.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

DFT/ TDDFT procedures were also performed to determine the electronic structure and the nature of the electronic transitions of PdPQ. Moreover, the affinity and binding properties of DNA to the desired complex have been studied in details using electronic absorption, fluorescence, circular dichroism spectroscopies, and viscosity measurement in combination with molecular docking technique. The obtained results exhibit relatively high DNA binding values with a static quenching mechanism, which suggest that an intercalative mode plays a peridominate role in interaction process concluded by experimental/theoretical measurements.

The FLT3 inhibitor, gilteritinib, was approved in Japan for patients with FLT3(mut+) R/R AML based on the phase 3 ADMIRAL trial, which demonstrated the superiority of gilteritinib over salvage chemotherapy (SC) with respect to overall survival (OS; median OS, 9.3 vs 5.6 months, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.64 [95% confidence interval 0.49, 0.83]; P < 0.001). METHODS: We evaluated the Japanese subgroup (n = 48) of the ADMIRAL trial, which included 33 patients randomized to 120-mg/day gilteritinib and 15 randomized to SC. RESULTS: Median OS was 14.3 months in the gilteritinib arm and 9.6 months in the SC arm. The complete remission/complete remission with partial hematologic recovery rate was higher in the gilteritinib arm (48.5%) than in the SC arm (13.3%). After adjustment for drug exposure, fewer adverse events (AEs) occurred in the gilteritinib arm than in the SC arm.

BSIs were documented in 19.3% of patients. The isolated microorganisms were 39 Gram-negative bacteria, 21 Gram-positive bacteria, and four fungi. There was a statistically significant risk of BSI between the variables: protocol for T-line-derived leukemia (Derived T Protocol) (p = 0.020), oral manifestations (p = 0.015), central venous catheter (p = 0.008), and bladder catheter (p = 0.004).

We investigated the impact of having a sibling with cancer or type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) on the psychological features of adolescents, with particular focus on self-conscious emotions such as guilt and shame-which are associated with the development of psychopathologies. METHOD: Sixty-four children who were siblings of patients diagnosed with cancer (CS group), 54 children who were siblings of patients diagnosed with T1DM (DMS group), and 200 adolescents with siblings who did not have any chronic disease (control group) were included in the study. The CS group was also divided into two subgroups with respect to cancer type (leukemia and non-leukemia). Feelings of guilt and shame were evaluated via the Test of Self-Consciousness Affect for Adolescents (TOSCA-A). The Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were used to determine the levels of depression and anxiety symptoms. Comparisons between groups were performed and within-group directional relationships between scores were analyzed. RESULTS: Guilt scores were significantly higher in CSs than controls (p = 0.009), and the guilt scores of CSs and DMSs were similar (p = 0.508). Other subdimension scores obtained from the TOSCA-A and the CDI and STAI scores were similar in all three groups. In the CS group, externalization scores of siblings with leukemia were significantly higher than that of siblings with non-leukemia cancer. Although shame scores were similar in the CS, DMS, and control groups, shame scores were found to be positively correlated with CDI and STAI total scores in each group (p < 0.05 for all), whereas guilt scores did not demonstrate any significant correlations. CONCLUSION: Our results support prior studies in showing that CSs feel a greater level of guilt compared to adolescents without disease-stricken siblings, whereas, interestingly, CSs and DMSs were found to experience similar levels of guilt. Despite lack of significant increase in the CS and DMS groups, shame levels were positively correlated with depression and anxiety scores in all groups, but the lower correlation coefficients for the CS group indicate the presence of other factors influencing this relationship. We believe our results warrant the need for future studies evaluating the needs of the siblings of children with other chronic diseases, preferably with longitudinal follow-up to determine situations associated with need for psychosocial support.","['(c) 2021.

Using a mouse model with a gain-of-function CXCR4 mutation (CXCR4(C1013G)) that hyperactivates CXCR4 signaling, we identified CXCR4 as a crucial activator of multiple key oncogenic pathways. CXCR4 hyperactivation resulted in an expansion of transitional B1 lymphocytes, which represent the precursors of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Indeed, CXCR4 hyperactivation led to a significant acceleration of disease onset and a more aggressive phenotype in the murine Emicro-TCL1 CLL model. Hyperactivated CXCR4 signaling cooperated with TCL1 to cause a distinct oncogenic transcriptional program in B cells, characterized by PLK1/FOXM1-associated pathways. In accordance, Emicro-TCL1;CXCR4(C1013G) B cells enriched a transcriptional signature from patients with Richter's syndrome, an aggressive transformation of CLL. Notably, MYC activation in aggressive lymphoma was associated with increased CXCR4 expression. In line with this finding, additional hyperactive CXCR4 signaling in the Emicro-Myc mouse, a model of aggressive B-cell cancer, did not impact survival. In summary, we here identify CXCR4 hyperactivation as a co-driver of an aggressive lymphoma phenotype.",['(c) 2021.

We performed whole genome sequencing of samples collected at diagnosis, relapse(s) and remission from 29 Nordic patients. Somatic point mutations and large-scale structural variants were called using individually matched remission samples as controls, and allelic expression of the mutations was assessed in ALL cells using RNA-sequencing. We observed an increased burden of somatic mutations at relapse, compared to diagnosis, and at second relapse compared to first relapse. In addition to 29 known ALL driver genes, of which nine genes carried recurrent protein-coding mutations in our sample set, we identified putative non-protein coding mutations in regulatory regions of seven additional genes that have not previously been described in ALL. Cluster analysis of hundreds of somatic mutations per sample revealed three distinct evolutionary trajectories during ALL progression from diagnosis to relapse. The evolutionary trajectories provide insight into the mutational mechanisms leading relapse in ALL and could offer biomarkers for improved risk prediction in individual patients.",['(c) 2021.

In the majority of cases, they are related to infections and volume overload. Medications have also been reported to cause pleural effusion in the general population, albeit very rarely. Dasatinib-induced pleural effusion has been reported in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia but not in those with HSCT. We here report a case of dasatinib-induced pleural effusion following HSCT for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). The proposed mechanism of dasatinib-induced pleural effusion involves build-up of fluid due to an immune-mediated vascular insult. CASE REPORT A 72-year-old man who received HSCT for ALL was treated with dasatinib to prevent a recurrence. After 6 months, the patient was admitted to the hospital for pneumonia, which was observed as bilateral pleural effusion upon chest X-ray. After completing the antibiotics course, he developed recurrent pleural effusion during hospitalization. Repeated thoracentesis of the fluid revealed an exudative lymphocytic effusion with negative culture and cytology. Dasatinib was withdrawn and the pleural effusion resolved gradually. CONCLUSIONS In patients with dasatinib-induced pleural effusions following HCTS, withdrawal of the drug leads to symptom resolution, thereby avoiding unnecessary procedures. This case illustrates that dasatinib-induced pleural disease typically manifests with lymphocytic exudative fluid. Physicians should be aware that pleural effusion is a possible medication-related adverse effect, which may be missed in cases of infection in patients following HSCT.",,"['Alrubaye, Riyadh R', 'Fadel, Celine A', 'Adewunmi, Comfort Y', 'Del Rio Lopez, Loida']","['Alrubaye RR', 'Fadel CA', 'Adewunmi CY', 'Del Rio Lopez L']",,"['Department of Hospital Medicine, North East Georgia Health System, Gainsvellie, GA, USA.', 'Graduate Medical Education, Internal Medicine Residency Program, North East Georgia Health System, Gainsvellie, GA, USA.', 'Graduate Medical Education, Internal Medicine Residency Program, North East Georgia Health System, Gainsvellie, GA, USA.', 'Graduate Medical Education, Internal Medicine Residency Program, North East Georgia Health System, Gainsvellie, GA, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,IM,,,2021/08/08 06:00,2021/08/11 06:00,['2021/08/07 05:43'],"['2021/08/07 05:43 [entrez]', '2021/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/11 06:00 [medline]']","['932711 [pii]', '10.12659/AJCR.932711 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2021 Aug 7;22:e932711. doi: 10.12659/AJCR.932711.,20210807,20210810,"['0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']","['Aged', 'Dasatinib/adverse effects', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Pleural Effusion/chemically induced/diagnostic imaging', 'Pyrimidines', 'Thiazoles/adverse effects']",PMC8363658,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Individual HSCs demonstrate heterogeneity in their repopulating capacities. Here, we found that the levels of the histone acetyltransferase MOF (males absent on the first) and its target modification histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation are heterogeneous among HSCs and influence their proliferation capacities. The increased proliferative capacities of MOF-depleted cells are linked to their expression of CD93. The CD93(+) HSC subpopulation simultaneously shows transcriptional features of quiescent HSCs and functional features of active HSCs. CD93(+) HSCs were expanded and exhibited an enhanced proliferative advantage in Mof (+/-) animals reminiscent of a premalignant state. Accordingly, low MOF and high CD93 levels correlate with poor survival and increased proliferation capacity in leukemia. Collectively, our study indicates H4K16ac as an important determinant for HSC heterogeneity, which is linked to the onset of monocytic disorders.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American', 'Association for the Advancement of Science.

METHODS: 81 non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients with bone marrow invasion as the first manifestation treated in our hospital from January 2010 to July 2019 were selected. The clinical features, blood routine, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), EB virus results, bone marrow features, immunophenotyping, gene and genetic characteristics of all patients were analyzed retrospectivel. RESULTS: Among 81 patients, 73 cases(90%) were B-cell lymphoma, 5 cases(6%) were T-cell lymphoma and 3 cases(4%) were NK/T-cell lymphoma, while the mantle cell lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma were the highest, which accounted for 21%(17 cases) and 19.7%(16 cases), and lymphoma accounted for 8.6%(7 cases). There were 44 cases(54.3%) showed B symptoms, 65 cases (80.2%) showed abnormal blood routine. The MYD88 gene was detected in 5 of 17 cases. 25 cases of patients underwent chromosome examination, the result showed that 5 cases were t(8; 14) (q24; q32), 3 cases were complex karyotype and 17 cases were normal karyotype. 23 cases(23.4%) were EB virus positive, 42 cases(51.9%) were LDH increased. The proportion of bone marrow lymphoma cells was 1%-92%. Among them, 32 cases were diagnosed as lymphoma leukemia, and 6 cases of bone marrow lymphoma cells showed mass distribution similar to extramedullary tumor cells with bone marrow metastasis. CONCLUSION: B-cell lymphoma is the predominant NHL with bone marrow invasion as the first manifestation, while mantle cell lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma are the most common pathological types with blood routine abnormalities. Bone marrow lymphoma cells can also present clusters of bone marrow metastasis, different types of lymphoma cells can make directional diagnosis.",,"['Lin, Ping', 'Huang, Rong-Fu', 'Xie, Ruo-Teng', 'Zhang, Ya-Lan', 'Zhuang, Wei-Huang', 'Zhang, Xue-Ya']","['Lin P', 'Huang RF', 'Xie RT', 'Zhang YL', 'Zhuang WH', 'Zhang XY']",,"['Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University,Quanzhou 362000,Fujian Province,China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University,Quanzhou 362000,Fujian Province,China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University,Quanzhou 362000,Fujian Province,China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University,Quanzhou 362000,Fujian Province,China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University,Quanzhou 362000,Fujian Province,China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University,Quanzhou 362000,Fujian Province,China,E-mail: jakey3456@sina.com.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,IM,,,2021/08/08 06:00,2021/08/11 06:00,['2021/08/07 05:32'],"['2021/08/07 05:32 [entrez]', '2021/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/11 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2021)04-1148-08 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2021.04.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2021 Aug;29(4):1148-1155. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2021.04.020.,,20210810,,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow', 'Humans', 'Laboratories', '*Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse', '*Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell', '*Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The human myelogenous leukemia cell line HL-60 was selected as the research object, and the effect of TRF1 expression and its changes on cell proliferation and cycle was investigated by regulating intracellular CDK1 expression. The objects were divided into 5 groups, including control group, shRNA-NC group, CDK1-shRNA group, pcDNA group and pcDNA-CDK1 group. RT-PCR was used to detect the CDK1 expression of cells in each group; colony formation was used to detect the proliferation of the cells. Western blot was used to detect the expression of CDK1, PLK1, Aurora B, TRF1, and cyclin p53, p27, cyclinA. RESULTS: The phosphorylation level of PLK1, Aurora B and the expression of TRF1 in the CDK1-shRNA group were significantly down-regulated as compared with those in the control group (P<0.05). Compared with the control group, the cells in CDK1-shRNA group showed lower clone formation rate, the increasing of cycle-associated proteins p53 and p27 and the decreasing of cyclinA expression (P<0.05). It was shown that interfered CDK1 expression could inhibit the proliferation of HL-60 cells and prolong the time that they enter mitosis, thereby extending the cell cycle. Compared with the control group, the overexpressed CDK1 in the pcDNA-CDK1 group made the phosphorylation level of PLK1, Aurora B, and TRF1 expression increase significantly (P<0.05), also the colony formation rate (P<0.05). The cycle-related proteins p53 and p27 was down-regulated, while cyclinA expression was up-regulate significantly (P<0.05). The results indicted that overexpressed CDK1 could stimulate adverse reactions, thereby promoting the proliferation of HL-60 cells and shortening the cell cycle. CONCLUSION: Knocking out CDK1 can inhibit the phosphorylation of PLK1 and Aurora B and negatively regulate TRF1, thereby inhibiting the proliferation of leukemia cells.",,"['Wang, Chong', 'Li, Meng-Ya', 'Shen, Xiao-Hui', 'Wang, Shu-Juan', 'Wang, Wei-Qiong', 'Liu, Yan-Fang']","['Wang C', 'Li MY', 'Shen XH', 'Wang SJ', 'Wang WQ', 'Liu YF']",,"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, Henan Province, China E-mail: fccwangc@zzu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, Henan Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, Henan Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, Henan Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, Henan Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, Henan Province, China.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,IM,,,2021/08/08 06:00,2021/08/11 06:00,['2021/08/07 05:32'],"['2021/08/07 05:32 [entrez]', '2021/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/11 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2021)04-1129-07 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2021.04.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2021 Aug;29(4):1129-1135. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2021.04.017.,,20210810,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK1 protein, human)']","['CDC2 Protein Kinase', '*Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia', 'Mitosis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: After MOLM13 treated with RSL3, CCK-8 assay was performed to detect cell viability, flow cytometry was used to detect the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level of the cells, RT-qPCR and Western blot were used to detect the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). After MOLM13/IDA and MOLM13/Ara-C, the drug-resistant cell lines were constructed, the ferroptosis induced by RSL3 was observed. Bone marrow samples were collected from patients with acute monocytic leukemia. RT-qPCR and Western blot were performed to detect the expression of related genes and proteins involved in ferroptosis pathway. RESULTS: RSL3 significantly inhibited the cell viability of MOLM13 and increased the intracellular ROS level, which were partially reversed by ferrostatin-1. The mRNA and protein expression of GPX4 decreased in MOLM13 treated with RSL3. RSL3 inhibited the viability of MOLM13/IDA and MOLM13/Ara-C cells more strongly than that of non-drug resistant cells, also increased the intracellular ROS level . The cytotoxic effects were partially reversed by ferrostatin-1. The mRNA and protein expressions of GPX4 in MOLM13/IDA and MOLM13/Ara-C cells were higher than those in non-drug resistant cells. The mRNA and protein levels of GPX4 in bone marrow of relapsed/refractory acute mononuclear leukemia patients were higher than those of ordinary acute mononuclear leukemia patients. CONCLUSION: RSL3 can induce non-drug resistant cells MOLM13 ferroptosis by inhibiting GPX4 activity. MOLM13/IDA and MOLM13/Ara-C are more sensitive to RSL3 compared with non-drug resistant cells MOLM13, which may be caused by the differences in GPX4 expression.

METHODS: Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR was used to detect the expression levels of miR-142-3p and HOXA5 in human B-ALL cell Nalm6 cell line and human B lymphoblast Hmy2-cir cells. Nalm6 was transfected by using liposome transfection technology, miR-142-3p mimic, pcDNA-HOXA5 overexpression plasmid, miR-142-3p mimic+pcDNA-HOXA5 overexpression plasmid, and control. The binding site of HOXA5 and miR-142-3p was predicted according to microRNA.org, and the targeting relationship between miR-142-3p and HOXA5 gene was detected by double luciferase reporter gene experiment. The effect of miR-142-3p to the proliferation of Nalm6 cells was detected using the Cell Counting Box-8 (CCK-8) method and cell clone formation experiments.

METHODS: The cytotoxic effects of 28 Nilotinib derivatives on K562, KA, KG, HA and 32D cell lines were detected by MTT assays, and the compound Nilo 22 was screen out. Cell apoptosis and cell cycle on leukemia cells were detected by flow cytometry. The effect of compound screened out on leukemogenesis potential of MLL-AF9 leukemia mice GFP(+) cells was tested by colony-forming units assays (CFU). The cytotoxic effect was further detected by transplant assays ex vivo. Telomerase activity assay, C-circle assay were used to measure the effects of compound on the length mechanism of telomere, RT-PCR was used to detected the changes of telomere. RESULTS: Nilo 22 serves as the most outstanding candidate out of 28 Nilotinib derivatives, which impairs leukemia cell lines, but spares normal hematopoietic cell line. Comparing with Nilotinib, Nilo 22 could induce the apoptosis of GFP(+) cells significantly, slightly arrests the cell cycle at G0/G1 phase, and significantly inhibits colony formation and prolong the progression in MLL-AF9 leukemia mice model. The expression showed that the compound could slow the disease progression in MLL-AF9 leukemia mice significantly.

METHODS: KG1a and KG1cells were treated by different concentrations of SFN for 48 h. Flow cytometry (FCM) was used to analyze the phase distribution of cell cycle. High-throughput sequencing was used to detect the effect of SFN on the expression of cell cycle related genes in KG1a cells. The mRNA expression of P53, P21, CDC2 and CyclinB1 were detected by qPCR. The protein expression of P53, CDC2, P-CDC2 and CyclinB1 were detected by Western blot. RESULTS: Cells in the G2/M phase were increased from 11.9% to 54.0% in KG1a cells and 18.5% to 83.3% in KG1 cells after treated by SFN (8 mu mol / L) for 48 hoursP<0.001. KEGG analysis indicated that P53 pathway was enriched in KG1a cells after treated by SFN. The heat-map graph showed that SFN could change the relevant genes of the cell cycle in KG1a cells. After SFN treatment, the mRNA level of P53 and P21 were significantly increased in KG1 and KG1a cellsP<0.05 or P<0.01. The mRNA level of CDC2 showed a decrease trend with the increasing dose of SFN. At the dosage of 8 mumol /L, the mRNA expression levels of CDC2 was significantly lower than that in control groupP<0.05. At the same time, the protein level of P53 was significantly increased in KG1 and kG1a cells after treated by SFNP<0.05. The protein level of CDC2 showed a decrease trend with the increasing dose of SFN in a dose mannerr=0.9482 and r=0.8977. The protein levels of CDC2 in SFN 8 and 12 mu mol/L groups were significantly lower than that in control group(P<0.05, P<0.01). The protein levels of P-CDC2 was increased.

Compared with the patients in non-DeltaJBP group, the age of patients in DeltaJBP group were older (63 vs 54 years old, P=0.047), and the occurrence rate of CEBPA double mutation (CEBPA(dm)) were more frequency (31.3% vs 0, P=0.009), the complete remission (CR) rate after induction chemotherapy(37.5% vs 81.8%, P=0.008) were lower, the median EFS (5 vs 19 months, P=0.000) and median OS (16 vs 22 months, P=0.041) were shorter. Univariate analysis showed that platelets <50x109/L (P=0.004) and CEBPA(dm) (P=0.001) were related to the shorter OS of the patients. Further COX multivariate analysis showed that CEBPA(dm) is an independent prognostic factors of OS in TET2DeltaJBP patients (P=0.010). In addition, DeltaJBP patients with CEBPA(dm) showed lower hemoglobin levels (62 vs 75g/L, P=0.030) and lower median OS (9 months vs 18 months, P=0.000) than the patients without CEBPA(dm). CONCLUSION: AML patients with TET2DeltaJBP truncation mutant shows lower CR rate, shorter EFS and OS after induction chemotherapy, which may be related to the poor prognosis, and co-mutation with CEBPA(dm), which is the independent prognostic factors of OS in AML patients with TET2DeltaJBP.",,"['Yang, Yu-Chao', 'Xia, Ting', 'Luo, Ming', 'Guo, Wen-Zheng', 'Zhang, Ling-Li', 'Chen, Xiu-Hua', 'Xu, Zhi-Fang', 'Wang, Hong-Wei', 'Tan, Yan-Hong']","['Yang YC', 'Xia T', 'Luo M', 'Guo WZ', 'Zhang LL', 'Chen XH', 'Xu ZF', 'Wang HW', 'Tan YH']",,"['Departmenet of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030000, Shanxi Province, China.', 'Departmenet of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030000, Shanxi Province, China.', 'Departmenet of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030000, Shanxi Province, China.', 'Departmenet of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030000, Shanxi Province, China.', 'Departmenet of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030000, Shanxi Province, China.', 'Departmenet of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030000, Shanxi Province, China.', 'Departmenet of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030000, Shanxi Province, China.', 'Departmenet of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030000, Shanxi Province, China.', 'Departmenet of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030000, Shanxi Province, China,E-mail: tanyh2010@163.com.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,IM,,,2021/08/08 06:00,2021/08/11 06:00,['2021/08/07 05:32'],"['2021/08/07 05:32 [entrez]', '2021/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/11 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2021)04-1011-08 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2021.04.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2021 Aug;29(4):1011-1018. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2021.04.001.,,20210810,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)']","['DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Dioxygenases', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Remission Induction']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Column chromatography and NMR spectroscopy were used to purify and characterize betulin from an ethyl acetate soluble fraction of acacia bark. Betulin, a known inducer of apoptosis, was screened against a panel of 16 disease-related protein kinases. Betulin was shown to inhibit Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (ABL1) kinase, casein kinase 1epsilon (CK1epsilon), glycogen synthase kinase 3alpha/beta (GSK-3 alpha/beta), Janus kinase 3 (JAK3), NIMA Related Kinase 6 (NEK6), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 kinase (VEGFR2) with activities in the micromolar range for each. The effect of betulin on the cell viability of doxorubicin-resistant K562R chronic myelogenous leukemia cells was then verified to investigate its putative use as an anti-cancer compound. Betulin was shown to modulate the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway, with activity similar to that of imatinib mesylate, a known ABL1 kinase inhibitor. The interaction of betulin and ABL1 was studied by molecular docking, revealing an interaction of the inhibitor with the ABL1 ATP binding pocket. Together, these data demonstrate that betulin is a multi-target inhibitor of protein kinases, an activity that can contribute to the anticancer properties of the natural compound and to potential treatments for leukemia.",,"['Ahmadu, Augustine A', 'Delehouze, Claire', 'Haruna, Anas', 'Mustapha, Lukman', 'Lawal, Bilqis A', 'Udobre, Aniefiok', 'Baratte, Blandine', 'Triscornia, Camilla', 'Autret,

In this study, the AB-type diblock copolymers poly(ethylene glycol)-polylactide (PEG-PLA) were subjected to the dispersion of poorly water-soluble molecules in aqueous solutions. The physicochemical behavior of the chemotherapeutic agent DBPR114 in the PEG-PLA-polymeric aqueous solution was investigated by dynamic light scattering (DLS) technology. In vitro cell culture indicated that replacing the organic solvent DMSO with PEG-PLA polymeric micelles could maintain the anti-proliferative effect of DBPR114 on leukemia cell lines. A murine tumor-associated antigen vaccine model was established in tumor-bearing mice to determine the effectiveness of these formulas in inducing tumor regression. The results demonstrated that the therapeutic treatments effectively reinforced each other via co-delivery of antitumor drug/antigen agents to synergistically integrate the efficacy of cancer therapy.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), a key component of this BM niche, are affected in several ways with unfavorable consequences on hematopoietic stem cells favoring leukemic cells. These alterations in MSC during B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) have not been fully studied. In this work, we have compared the modifications that occur in an in vitro leukemic niche (LN) with those observed in MSC isolated from B-ALL patients. MSC in this LN niche showed features of a senescence process, i.e., altered morphology, increased senescence-associated beta-Galactosidase (SA-betaGAL) activity, and upregulation of p53 and p21 (without p16 expression), cell-cycle arrest, reduced clonogenicity, and some moderated changes in stemness properties. Importantly, almost all of these features were found in MSC isolated from B-ALL patients. These alterations rendered B-ALL cells susceptible to the chemotherapeutic agent dexamethasone. The senescent process seems to be transient since when leukemic cells are removed, normal MSC morphology is re-established, SA-betaGAL expression is diminished, and MSC are capable of re-entering cell cycle. In addition, few cells showed low gammaH2AX phosphorylation that was reduced to basal levels upon cultivation. The reversibility of the senescent process in MSC must impinge important biological and clinical significance depending on cell interactions in the bone marrow at different stages of disease progression in B-ALL.",,"['Vanegas, Natalia-Del Pilar', 'Ruiz-Aparicio, Paola Fernanda', 'Uribe, Gloria Ines', 'Linares-Ballesteros, Adriana', 'Vernot, Jean-Paul']","['Vanegas NP', 'Ruiz-Aparicio PF', 'Uribe GI', 'Linares-Ballesteros A', 'Vernot JP']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5135-1714', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8486-9883', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0237-3375']","['Fisiologia Celular y Molecular, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogota D.C. 111321, Colombia.', 'Fisiologia Celular y Molecular, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogota D.C. 111321, Colombia.', 'Servicio de Patologia, Laboratorio de Hematologia Especial y Citometria de Flujo, Fundacion Hospital de la Misericordia, Bogota D.C. 111071, Colombia.', 'Oncohematologia Pediatrica, Fundacion Hospital de la Misericordia, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogota D.C. 111071, Colombia.', 'Fisiologia Celular y Molecular, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogota D.C. 111321, Colombia.', 'Facultad de Medicina, Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogota D.C. 111321, Colombia.']",['eng'],"['58257/Ministerio de Ciencia Tecnologia e Innovacion', '40181/Direccion de Investigacion y Extension Sede Bogota- DIEB']",['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL)', 'bone marrow microenvironment', 'leukemic niche (LN)', 'mesenchymal stem cells (MSC)', 'reversible senescence', 'senescence']",2021/08/08 06:00,2021/09/14 06:00,['2021/08/07 01:08'],"['2021/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/12 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/07 01:08 [entrez]', '2021/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/14 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms22158166 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms22158166 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Jul 29;22(15). pii: ijms22158166. doi: 10.3390/ijms22158166.,20210729,20210913,,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Cellular Senescence', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', '*Tumor Microenvironment']",PMC8348535,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, Pyri can display significant anti-cancer potential in different tumor models, but the possible mode of its actions remains unclear. Hence, in this study, the possible anti-tumoral impact of Pyri on human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) was deciphered. Pyri inhibited cell growth in various types of tumor cells and exhibited a marked inhibitory action on CML cells. In addition to apoptosis, Pyri also triggered sustained autophagy. Targeted inhibition of autophagy sensitized the tumor cells to Pyri-induced apoptotic cell death. Moreover, the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) and its downstream target gene Bcl-2 was attenuated by Pyri. Accordingly, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated STAT5 knockdown augmented Pyri-induced autophagy and apoptosis and promoted the suppressive action of Pyri on cell viability. Moreover, ectopic overexpression of Bcl-2 protected the cells from Pyri-mediated autophagy and apoptosis. Overall, the data indicated that the attenuation of STAT5-Bcl-2 cascade by Pyri can regulate its growth inhibitory properties by simultaneously targeting both apoptosis and autophagy cell death mechanism(s).",,"['Jung, Young Yun', 'Kim, Chulwon', 'Ha, In Jin', 'Lee, Seok-Geun', 'Lee, Junhee', 'Um, Jae-Young', 'Ahn, Kwang Seok']","['Jung YY', 'Kim C', 'Ha IJ', 'Lee SG', 'Lee J', 'Um JY', 'Ahn KS']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9210-1401', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0060-5777', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0568-9738', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2882-0612']","['Department of Science in Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, 24 Kyungheedae-ro, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul 02447, Korea.', 'Department of Science in Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, 24 Kyungheedae-ro, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul 02447, Korea.', 'Korean Medicine Clinical Trial Center (K-CTC), Korean Medicine Hospital, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 02447, Korea.', 'Department of Science in Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, 24 Kyungheedae-ro, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul 02447, Korea.', 'Korean Medicine Clinical Trial Center (K-CTC), Korean Medicine Hospital, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 02447, Korea.', 'Korean Medicine Clinical Trial Center (K-CTC), Korean Medicine Hospital, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 02447, Korea.', 'Department of Science in Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, 24 Kyungheedae-ro, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul 02447, Korea.', 'Department of Science in Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, 24 Kyungheedae-ro, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul 02447, Korea.']",['eng'],['NRF-2021R1I1A2060024/National Research Foundation of Korea'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'Pyrimethamine', 'STAT5', 'apoptosis', 'autophagy']",2021/08/08 06:00,2021/09/18 06:00,['2021/08/07 01:08'],"['2021/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/23 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/07 01:08 [entrez]', '2021/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/18 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms22158147 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms22158147 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Jul 29;22(15). pii: ijms22158147. doi: 10.3390/ijms22158147.,20210729,20210917,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (BECN1 protein, human)', '0 (Beclin-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5A protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Atg7 protein, human)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Autophagy-Related Protein 7)', 'Z3614QOX8W (Pyrimethamine)']","['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Autophagy/*drug effects/genetics', 'Autophagy-Related Protein 7/deficiency/genetics', 'Beclin-1/deficiency/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimethamine/*pharmacology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/deficiency/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'THP-1 Cells', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/deficiency/genetics']",PMC8347135,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutated FLT3 variants are constitutively active kinases signaling via AKT kinase, MAP kinases, and STAT5. FLT3 inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of FLT3-mutated AML. However, treatment response to FLT3 inhibitors may be short-lived, and resistance may emerge. Compounds targeting STAT5 may enhance and prolong effects of FLT3 inhibitors in this subset of patients with FLT3-mutated AML. Here STAT5-inhibitor AC-4-130, FLT3 inhibitor midostaurin (PKC412), BMI-1 inhibitor PTC596, MEK-inhibitor trametinib, MCL1-inhibitor S63845, and BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax were assessed as single agents and in combination for their ability to induce apoptosis and cell death in leukemic cells grown in the absence or presence of bone marrow stroma. Synergistic effects on cell viability were detected in both FLT3-mutated and FLT3-wild-type AML cells treated with AC-4-130 in combination with the MCL1 inhibitor S63845. AML patient samples with a strong response to AC-4-130 and S63845 combination treatment were characterized by mutated FLT3 or mutated TET2 genes. Susceptibility of AML cells to AC-4-130, PTC596, trametinib, PKC412, and venetoclax was altered in the presence of HS-5 stroma. Only the MCL1 inhibitor S63845 induced cell death with equal efficacy in the absence or presence of bone marrow stroma. The combination of the STAT5-inhibitor AC-4-130 and the MCL1 inhibitor S63845 may be an effective treatment targeting FLT3-mutated or TET2-mutated AML.",,"['Seipel, Katja', 'Graber, Carolyn', 'Fluckiger, Laura', 'Bacher, Ulrike', 'Pabst, Thomas']","['Seipel K', 'Graber C', 'Fluckiger L', 'Bacher U', 'Pabst T']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3128-1573', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2936-4129', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8771-947X']","['Department for Biomedical Research, University of Bern, 2008 Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department for Biomedical Research, University of Bern, 2008 Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department for Biomedical Research, University of Bern, 2008 Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Bern, 3010 Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, University Hospital Bern, 3010 Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['#310030_127509/Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen', 'Forschung']",['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,['NOTNLM'],"['FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)', 'acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'hematological malignancies', 'myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein (MCL1)', 'signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5)', 'ten-eleven translocation-2 (TET2)', 'tumor suppressor p53 (TP53)']",2021/08/08 06:00,2021/09/15 06:00,['2021/08/07 01:08'],"['2021/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/19 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/08/07 01:08 [entrez]', '2021/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/15 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms22158092 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms22158092 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Jul 28;22(15). pii: ijms22158092. doi: 10.3390/ijms22158092.,20210728,20210914,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (S63845)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5A protein, human)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']","['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Dioxygenases', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Thiophenes/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",PMC8347059,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With combined use of microarray-based gene expression profiling and the promoter-based ChIP-chip assay of E14.5 fetal liver cells from wild type (WT) and EKLF-knockout (Eklf(-/-)) mouse embryos, we identified the pathways and direct target genes activated or repressed by EKLF. This genome-wide study together with the molecular/cellular analysis of the mouse erythroleukemic cells (MEL) indicate that among the downstream direct target genes of EKLF is Tal1/Scl. Tal1/Scl encodes another DNA-binding hematopoietic transcription factor TAL1/SCL, known to be an Eklf activator and essential for definitive erythroid differentiation. Further identification of the authentic Tal gene promoter in combination with the in vivo genomic footprinting approach and DNA reporter assay demonstrate that EKLF activates the Tal gene through binding to a specific CACCC motif located in its promoter.

The characterisation of biofluids has become a core objective for many proteomic researchers in order to detect disease-associated protein biomarkers in a minimally invasive manner. The proteomes of biofluids, including serum, saliva, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine, are highly dynamic with protein abundance fluctuating depending on the physiological and/or pathophysiological context. Improvements in mass-spectrometric technologies have facilitated the in-depth characterisation of biofluid proteomes which are now considered hosts of a wide array of clinically relevant biomarkers. Promising efforts are being made in the field of biomarker diagnostics for haematologic malignancies. Several serum and urine-based biomarkers such as free light chains, beta-microglobulin, and lactate dehydrogenase are quantified as part of the clinical assessment of haematological malignancies. However, novel, minimally invasive proteomic markers are required to aid diagnosis and prognosis and to monitor therapeutic response and minimal residual disease.

Cell models contribute to defining the role of HTLV proteins, as well as the mechanisms of cell-to-cell transmission of the virus. Otherwise, selected and engineered animal models are currently applied to recapitulate in vivo the HTLV-1 associated pathogenesis and to verify the effectiveness of viral therapy and host immune response. Here we review the current cell models for studying virus-host interaction, cellular restriction factors and cell pathway deregulation mediated by HTLV products. We recapitulate the most effective animal models applied to investigate the pathogenesis of HTLV-1-associated diseases such as transgenic and humanized mice, rabbit and monkey models.
