In view of the similarity of the BH3 binding domains of these anti-apoptotic proteins as well as recent evidence that studies of isolated BH3 domains can potentially underestimate the binding between full-length Bcl-2 family members, we examined the interaction of full-length human Noxa with anti-apoptotic human Bcl-2 family members. Surface plasmon resonance using bacterially expressed proteins demonstrated that Noxa binds with mean dissociation constants (K(D)) of 3.4 nm for Mcl-1, 70 nm for Bcl-x(L), and 250 nm for wild type human Bcl-2, demonstrating selectivity but not absolute specificity of Noxa for Mcl-1. Further analysis showed that the Noxa/Bcl-2 interaction reflected binding between the Noxa BH3 domain and the Bcl-2 BH3 binding groove. Analysis of proteins expressed in vivo demonstrated that Noxa and Bcl-2 can be pulled down together from a variety of cells. Moreover, when compared with wild type Bcl-2, certain lymphoma-derived Bcl-2 mutants bound Noxa up to 20-fold more tightly in vitro, pulled down more Noxa from cells, and protected cells against killing by transfected Noxa to a greater extent. When killing by bortezomib (an agent whose cytotoxicity in Jurkat T-cell leukemia cells is dependent on Noxa) was examined, apoptosis was enhanced by the Bcl-2/Bcl-x(L) antagonist ABT-737 or by Bcl-2 down-regulation and diminished by Bcl-2 overexpression. Collectively, these observations not only establish the ability of Noxa and Bcl-2 to interact but also identify Bcl-2 overexpression as a potential mechanism of bortezomib resistance.","['(c) 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An increase in HoxA10 expression correlates with poor prognosis in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Consistent with this scenario, HoxA10 overexpression in murine bone marrow induces a myeloproliferative neoplasm that advances AML over time. Despite the importance of HoxA10 for leukemogenesis, few genuine HoxA10 target genes have been identified. The current study identified ARIH2, the gene encoding Triad1, as a HoxA10 target gene. We identified two distinct HoxA10-binding cis elements in the ARIH2 promoter and determined that HoxA10 activates these cis elements in myeloid cells. Triad1 has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, and we found that HoxA10-overexpressing myeloid cells exhibited a Triad1-dependent increase in protein ubiquitination. Therefore, these studies have identified the regulation of protein ubiquitination as a novel function of Hox transcription factors. Forced overexpression of Triad1 has been show previously to inhibit colony formation by myeloid progenitor cells. In contrast, HoxA10-overexpressing myeloid progenitor cells exhibited increased proliferation in response to low doses of various cytokines. We found that Triad1 knockdown further increased cytokine-induced proliferation in HoxA10-overexpressing cells. Therefore, these studies have identified a HoxA10 target gene that antagonizes the overall influence of overexpressed HoxA10 on myeloproliferation. This result suggests that the consequences of HoxA10 overexpression reflect a balance between the target genes that facilitate and antagonize proliferation. These results have implications for understanding the mechanisms of leukemogenesis in AML with Hox overexpression.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, targeting mutant p53 for degradation might be explored as a therapeutic strategy to manage tumors that are addicted to mutant p53 for survival. Arsenic trioxide, a drug for patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia, is found to target and degrade a class of proteins with high levels of cysteine residues and vicinal thiol groups, such as promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) and PML-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion protein. Interestingly, wild type p53 is accumulated in cells treated with arsenic compounds, presumably due to arsenic-induced oxidative stresses. In this study, we found that wild type p53 is induced by arsenic trioxide in tumor cells, consistent with published studies. In contrast, we found that arsenic compounds degrade both endogenous and ectopically expressed mutant p53 in time- and dose-dependent manners. We also found that arsenic trioxide decreases the stability of mutant p53 protein through a proteasomal pathway, and blockage of mutant p53 nuclear export can alleviate the arsenic-induced mutant p53 degradation. Furthermore, we found that knockdown of endogenous mutant p53 sensitizes, whereas ectopic expression of mutant p53 desensitizes, tumor cells to arsenic treatment. Taken together, we found that mutant p53 is a target of arsenic compounds, which provides an insight into exploring arsenic compound-based therapy for tumors harboring a mutant p53.","['(c) 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The function of these and other domains in the DH-mediated regulation of the GDP/GTP exchange reaction of the Rho proteins is the subject of intensive investigations. This comparative study presents detailed kinetic data on specificity, activity, and regulation of the catalytic DH domains of four GEFs, namely p115, p190, PDZ-RhoGEF (PRG), and leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG). We demonstrate that (i) these GEFs are specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors for the Rho isoforms (RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC) and inactive toward other members of the Rho family, including Rac1, Cdc42, and TC10. (ii) The DH domain of LARG exhibits the highest catalytic activity reported for a Dbl protein till now with a maximal acceleration of the nucleotide exchange by 10(7)-fold, which is at least as efficient as reported for GEFs specific for Ran or the bacterial toxin SopE. (iii) A novel regulatory region at the N terminus of the DH domain is involved in its association with GDP-bound RhoA monitored by a fluorescently labeled RhoA. (iv) The tandem PH domains of p115 and PRG efficiently contribute to the DH-mediated nucleotide exchange reaction. (v) In contrast to the isolated DH or DH-PH domains, a p115 fragment encompassing both the regulator of G-protein signaling and the DH domains revealed a significantly reduced GEF activity, supporting the proposed models of an intramolecular autoinhibitory mechanism for p115-like RhoGEFs.","['(c) 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have demonstrated that expression of some circadian clock genes displays daily oscillation in peripheral tissues including peripheral blood and bone marrow. Circadian rhythms regulate various functions of human body, and the disruption of circadian rhythm has been associated with cancer development and tumor progression. However, the direct links between aberrant circadian clock gene expression and human disorders remain largely unknown. In this study, comparisons were made between the expression profiles of 9 circadian clock genes from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) from 18 healthy volunteers. Peripheral blood (PB) total leukocytes from 54 healthy volunteers and 95 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) were also investigated. Similar expression profiles of all 9 circadian clock genes were observed in PBMCs and PMNs of healthy individuals. In PB total leukocytes of healthy individuals, the daily pattern of PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1, CRY2, and CKIepsilon expression level peaked at 0800 h, and BMAL1 peaked at 2000 h. Daily pattern expression of these 7 genes was disrupted in newly diagnosed pre-imatinib mesylate-treated and blast crisis-phase patients with CML. Partial daily pattern gene expression recoveries were observed in patients with CML with complete cytogenetic response and major molecular response. The expression of CLOCK and TIM did not show a time-dependent variation among the healthy and patients with CML. These results indicate a possible association of the disrupted daily patterns of circadian clock gene expression with the pathogenesis of CML.",['(c) 2011 Sage Publications'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Elevated circulating CCL3 was previously described in Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) but the source of its production was unknown. We performed an immunohistochemical study in bone marrow biopsies of 67 WM patients and found that the whole number of the neoplastic cells express CCL3 in all cases. This finding was constant in newly diagnosed patients with both symptomatic and asymptomatic WM and also in patients with active disease post previous therapies. Our results support, for the first time in the literature, the production of CCL3 by WM cells.

We report a case of large vessel arteritis in a patient with MDS. A 62-year-old male presented with thrombocytopenia and was diagnosed with low-risk MDS, (<5% blasts in his bone marrow and a normal karyotype). Shortly thereafter he developed large vessel (Takayasu's) arteritis (TA) that responded well to oral corticosteroid and methotrexate therapy. Ten months later the MDS transformed into acute myeloid leukemia (AML). After a successful induction course with cytarabine and daunorubicin he underwent allogeneic transplantation from a matched unrelated donor with reduced-intensity conditioning. The transplantation was complicated by systemic cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease and he died 6 weeks post transplantation. Takayasu's arteritis is an uncommon form of vasculitis affecting primarily young women and is atypical for elderly males. Though autoimmune manifestations in MDS occur in 10%-18.5% of patients, usually large vessels are spared. In MDS, activated T cells are thought to mediate bone marrow failure via overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines that cause stem cell apoptosis. These T cells may also mediate the autoimmune phenomena in MDS. The prognostic significance of autoimmunity in the course of MDS is not yet determined. Some reports suggest worse prognosis. The case illustrates a possible association between MDS and large vessel vasculitis and suggests a possible relationship between the presence of autoimmune syndromes and the outcome of patients with MDS.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most patients (78%) had pre-B ALL and were in first salvage (76%), with a first remission duration of 12.6 months (range, 1-78 months). Ten patients had primary refractory disease. Of 88 evaluable patients, 41 (47%) achieved complete remission (CR), with a median time to CR of 29 days (range, 18-80 days). Eight patients (9%) died within the first 30 days. Median CR duration, progression-free survival, and overall survival were 5, 6.2, and 6 months, respectively. Median overall survival of CR patients was 10.2 months (range, 1.4-69.5+ months). Twenty-eight patients (32%) proceeded to stem cell transplantation. Myelosuppression-associated complications were frequent. Pegaspargase was equally effective and easier to administer than L-asparaginase. Augmented hyper-CVAD may be suitable to be studied in younger adults with untreated ALL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A recent array-based study implicated the presence of copy-number variations (CNVs) of EphA3 in the genomes of acute myelogenous leukemia. CNVs are present in the general population at varying degrees, and have been found to associate with various types of diseases including hematologic malignancies. However, most of the current studies focused on the genome-wide screening of CNVs, and the functional impact of such regions needs to be extensively investigated in large number of clinical samples. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In our study, we collected 617 bone marrow samples from multiple types of hematologic malignancies as well as healthy controls. DNA copy numbers and mRNA levels of EphA3 in these samples were examined. RESULTS: We found significant association between the CNVs of EphA3 and these hematologic malignancies including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), multiple myeloma (MM), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

As a consequence, a relevant selection is operated as to inclusion into clinical trials based on intensive induction chemotherapy. However, a lack of validated guidelines results in a considerable heterogeneity in the therapeutic attitude between individual clinicians and clinics. Overall, about 50% of the patients are considered as not eligible for therapy aiming at complete remission (CR) achievement and receive conservative approaches. In order to achieve the best therapeutic results and avoid unnecessary toxicity, it would be of major clinical use to determine which patients will do well with some types of treatment and not other. This is particularly clinical relevant because the > 15% risk of death in the month after the start of treatment is difficult to justify because of median survivals of < 1 year in the patients who do not die early. Therefore, factors other than age significantly influencing survival would be considered and taken into account as soon as diagnosis in the process of therapeutic decision-making. In the recent years promising results have been reported with the use of new drugs, such as clofarabine, cloretazine, hypomethylating agents and vorexolin also in patients with adverse characteristics at diagnosis, but further improvement is urgently needed. In this perspective, AML in the elderly can represent an ideal target patient population to investigate new AML treatment approaches, that may eventually also be of benefit to younger patients with the disease.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2011 Mar 30.,,,,"BACKGROUND: Fever of unknown origin (FUO) has been defined as a fever of >/=101 degrees F that persists for 3 weeks or more. It is not readily diagnosed after 1 week of intensive in-hospital testing or after intensive outpatient or inpatient testing. Fevers of unknown origin may be caused by infectious diseases, malignancies, collagen vascular diseases, or a variety of miscellaneous disorders. The relative distribution of causes of FUOs is partly age-related. In the elderly, the preponderance of FUOs is attributable to neoplastic and infectious etiologies, whereas in children, collagen vascular diseases, neoplasms, and viral infectious disease predominate. The diagnostic approach to FUOs depends on a careful analysis of the history, physical findings, and laboratory tests. Most patients with FUOs exhibit localizing findings that should direct the diagnostic workup and limit diagnostic possibilities. The most perplexing causes of FUOs involve those without specific diagnostic tests, e.g., juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) or adult Still's disease. In a young adult with FUO, if all of the cardinal symptoms are present, JRA may present either a straightforward or an elusive diagnosis, if key findings are absent or if the diagnosis goes unsuspected. METHODS: We present a 19-year-old man with a recurrent FUO. His illness began 3 years before admission and has recurred twice since. In the past, he did not manifest arthralgias, arthritis, or a truncal rash. On admission, he presented with an FUO with hepatosplenomegaly, aseptic meningitis, and pericarditis. An extensive diagnostic workup ruled out lymphoma and leukemia. Moreover, a further extensive workup eliminated infectious causes of FUO appropriate to his clinical presentation, ie, tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, brucellosis, Q fever, typhoid fever, Epstein-Barr virus, infectious mononucleosis, cytomegalovirus, human herpes virus (HHV)-6, babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, viral hepatitis, and Whipple's disease. RESULTS: The diagnosis of JRA was based on the exclusion of infectious and neoplastic disorders in a young adult with hepatosplenomegaly, aseptic meningitis, pericarditis, and a double quotidian fever. With JRA, tests for rheumatic diseases are negative, as they were in this case. The only laboratory abnormalities in this patient included elevated serum transaminases, a mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and a moderately elevated level of serum ferritin. CONCLUSION: Diagnostic fever curves are most helpful in cases where the diagnosis is most elusive, as was the case here. Relatively few disorders are associated with a double quotidian fever, ie, visceral leishmaniasis, mixed malarial infections, right-sided gonococcal acute bacterial endocarditis, and JRA. Because the patient received antipyretics during the first week of admission, fever was not present. After infectious disease consultation during week 2 of hospitalization, antipyretics were discontinued, and a double quotidian fever was present, which provided the key diagnostic clue in this case.",['Copyright A(c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were calculated for total leukemia and AML among 625 residents affected by the gasoline spill in relation to both PA and local county cancer incidence rates. The risk of total leukemia and AML among the gasoline exposed population was evaluated for the period prior to the spill, 1985-1989; during the time surrounding the spill, 1990-1994; and for a period subsequent to the spill, 1995-2001. RESULTS: The incidence of total leukemia and AML was significantly elevated subsequent to the spill for the entire period 1990-2001 and was highest for the period 1995-2001, whether comparison was made to PA or local county leukemia rates. Based on comparison to PA rates, the SIRs for total leukemia and AML were 7.69 (95% CI=1.58-22.46) and 11.54 (95% CI=2.38-33.69) for the 1995-2001 period, respectively. Prior to the spill, 1985-1989, and during the period of the spill, 1990-1994, no cases of leukemia were identified among the affected residents. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a possible association between chronic low level benzene exposure and increased risk of leukemia among residents of the Tranguch Spill Site in NE PA. Our study provides additional support to the growing body of evidence implicating low level benzene exposure and cancer risk. We recommend that other communities contaminated with gasoline vapor through leaking underground storage vessels be monitored for elevated risk of leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Among the CD8(+)CD62L(-) subset, the few cells, specific for M-MuLV encoded antigens, expressing TCRVbeta5 rearrangements increased in an explosive manner doubling the percentage of TCRVbeta5(+) subset so that as a final result more than 10% of CD8(+) lymphocytes became potential virus-specific cytotoxic effectors.

A panel of leukemia cell lines was analyzed for their GSTP1 expression, revealing cell lines with high, moderate or no detectable GSTP1 expression. Bisulfite sequencing, methylation-specific PCR and combined bisulfite restriction analysis revealed that GSTP1 promoter was completely methylated in transcriptionally inactive RAJI and MEG-01 cell lines. In contrast, cell lines expressing GSTP1 exhibited an unmethylated and transcriptionally active promoter. Furthermore, histone marks and effector proteins associated with transcriptional activity were detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation in the GSTP1 expressing hypomethylated K-562 cell line. However, repressive chromatin marks and the recruitment of silencing protein complexes were found in the non-expressing hypermethylated RAJI and MEG-01 cell lines. Finally, we provide evidence that treatment of RAJI and MEG-01 cells with the DNA demethylating agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, resulted in GSTP1 promoter demethylation, drastic changes of histone modifications and promoter associated proteins and GSTP1 gene activation. In contrast, treatments with HDAC inhibitors failed to demethylate and reactivate the GSTP1 gene. Our study extends the knowledge on leukemia-specific epigenetic alterations of GSTP1 gene. Furthermore, we are showing the correlation of DNA methylation and histone modifications with the positive/negative GSTP1 transcriptional expression state. Finally, these data support the concept of the dominance of DNA methylation over HDAC inhibitor-sensitive histone deacetylation in gene silencing.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The percentage of positive cells in HBZ-ISH was 5-70%. Immunohistochemical staining for Tax protein showed positivity in seven of 11 cases in NOD/SCID/beta2-microglobulin(null) mice with ATLL transplanted and in six of eight human ATLL cases, but the percentage of positive cells was very low (range, 1-5%).

Deregulation of sphingolipid metabolism is reflected as various pathophysiological conditions including metabolic disorders and several forms of cancer. Ceramides, ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P), glucosyl ceramide (GluCer), sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) are among the bioactive sphingolipid species that have important roles in the regulation of cell death, survival and chemotherapeutic resistance. Some of those species are known to accumulate in the cells upon chemotherapy while some others are known to exhibit an opposite pattern. Even though the length of fatty acid chain has a deterministic effect, in general, upregulation of ceramides and sphingosine is known to induce apoptosis. However, S1P, C1P and GluCer are proliferative for cells and they are involved in the development of chemoresistance. Therefore, sphingolipid metabolism appears as a good target for the development of novel therapeutics or supportive interventions to increase the effectiveness of the chemotherapeutic drugs currently in hand. Some approaches involve manipulation of the synthesis pathways yielding the increased production of apoptotic sphingolipids while the proliferative ones are suppressed. Some others are trying to take advantage of cytotoxic sphingolipids like short chain ceramide analogs by directly delivering them to the malignant cells as a distinct chemotherapeutic intervention. Numerous studies in the literature show the feasibility of those approaches especially in acute and chronic leukemias. This review compiles the current knowledge about sphingolipids and their roles in chemotherapeutic response with the particular attention to leukemias.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Estrogen mediates its effects through estrogen receptors (ERs), ERalpha and ERbeta; however, regulation of ERs in dermal fibroblasts remains poorly understood. Friend leukemia integration factor 1 (Fli1), a member of the Ets transcription factor family, has been shown to play a pivotal role in regulation of the ECM genes in dermal fibroblasts. The aim of this study was to examine a possible interaction between Fli1 and estrogen pathways, focusing on ERalpha. We show that treatment of human dermal fibroblasts with transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) increases ERalpha protein and mRNA levels. Similarly, ERalpha expression was increased in response to small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated depletion of Fli1, suggesting that Fli1 is a mediator of the TGF-beta effects on ERalpha expression. Accordingly, we showed that Fli1 binds to the most proximal region of the ERalpha promoter, and dissociates from the promoter upon TGF-beta treatment.

We analyzed a large series of pediatric patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma treated within a prospective randomized trial (the Euro-LB 02 study). Among 193 lymphomas, in which a detailed immunohistochemical analysis was carried out, there were several unusual and diagnostically challenging morphologic and immunophenotypical variants. These included 11 lymphomas with mixed phenotypes expressing markers of at least 2 hematopoietic lineages, 7 terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-negative lymphoblastic lymphomas, and 3 undifferentiated hematopoietic neoplasms that could not be assigned to any lineage with certainty. Our data indicate that World Health Organization guidelines for lineage determination and subtyping of precursor cell leukemia need to be adapted before they can be applied to immunohistochemical diagnosis of lymphoma.

In this study, we show that PtdGlc forms functional domains that are different from those produced by lactosylceramide (LacCer)-enriched lipid rafts. These rafts initiate neutrophil apoptosis. Neutrophils are the only type of human peripheral blood leukocyte or monocyte-derived dendritic cell to express large amounts of PtdGlc on their cell surfaces. PtdGlc was not colocalized with LacCer. Anti-PtdGlc IgM DIM21 did not induce neutrophil chemotaxis or superoxide generation, whereas anti-LacCer IgM T5A7 induced these activities. DIM21, but not T5A7, significantly induced neutrophil apoptosis. DIM21-induced apoptosis was inhibited by specific inhibitors of cysteine-containing aspartate-specific proteases (caspases)-8, -9, and -3 but not by the Src family kinase inhibitor PP1, PIP(3) kinase inhibitor LY294002, NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium, superoxide dismutase, or catalase. PtdGlc was colocalized with Fas on the neutrophil plasma membrane. DIM21 and the agonist anti-Fas Ab DX2 induced the formation of large Fas-colocalized clusters of PtdGlc on the plasma membrane. Furthermore, the antagonistic anti-Fas Ab ZB4 significantly inhibited DIM21-induced neutrophil apoptosis. These results suggest that PtdGlc is specifically expressed on neutrophils and mediates apoptosis of these cells, and that the Fas-associated death signal may be involved in PtdGlc-mediated apoptosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2011 Mar 30.,,,,"Avian leukosis virus (ALV) is an enveloped and oncogenic retrovirus. Avian leukosis caused by the members of ALV subgroups A, B and J has become one of the major problems challenging the poultry industry in China. However, the cellular factors such as signal transduction pathways involved in ALV infection are not well defined. In this study, our data demonstrated that ALV-J strain NX0101 infection in primary chicken embryo fibroblasts or DF-1 cells was correlated with the activity and phosphorylation of Akt. Akt activation was initiated at a very early stage of infection independently of NX0101 replication. The specific phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors LY294002 or wortmannin could suppress Akt phosphorylation, indicating that NX0101-induced Akt phosphorylation is PI3K-dependent. ALV-A strain GD08 or ALV-B strain CD08 infection also demonstrated a similar profile of PI3K/Akt activation. Treatment of DF-1 cells with the drug 5-(N, N-hexamethylene) amiloride that inhibits the activity of chicken Na(+)/H(+) exchanger type 1 significantly reduced Akt activation induced by NX0101, but not by GD08 and CD08. Akt activation triggered by GD08 or CD08 was abolished by clathrin-mediated endocytosis inhibitor chlorpromazine. Receptor-mediated endocytosis inhibitor dansylcadaverine had a negligible effect on all ALV-induced Akt phosphorylation. Moreover, viral replication of ALV was suppressed by LY294002 in a dose-dependent manner, which was due to the inhibition of virus infection by LY294002. These data suggest that the activation of the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway by exogenous ALV infection plays an important role in viral entry, yet the precise mechanism remains under further investigation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although some data suggest that a small number of mutations may be associated with a less favorable response to treatment with one second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor versus another, these data need to be interpreted cautiously because they are derived primarily retrospectively from single-institution studies and a small number of patients. More research and clinical experience and a better understanding of the implications of in vitro data are needed before these data can be routinely incorporated into therapeutic decisions. Currently, there is no consensus on when to screen patients for mutations, what technique should be used, or how values should be reported.

Epub 2011 Mar 30.,,,,"MOTIVATION: In the functional genomic era, a large number of gene sets have been identified via high-throughput genomic and proteomic technologies. These gene sets of interest are often related to the same or similar disorders or phenotypes, and are commonly presented as differentially expressed gene lists, co-expressed gene modules, protein complexes or signaling pathways. However, biologists are still faced by the challenge of comparing gene sets and interpreting the functional relationships between gene sets into an understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms. RESULTS: We introduce a novel network-based method, designated corrected cumulative rank score (CCRS), which analyzes the functional communication and physical interaction between genes, and presents an easy-to-use web-based toolkit called GsNetCom to quantify the functional relationship between two gene sets. To evaluate the performance of our method in assessing the functional similarity between two gene sets, we analyzed the functional coherence of complexes in functional catalog and identified protein complexes in the same functional catalog. The results suggested that CCRS can offer a significant advance in addressing the functional relationship between different gene sets compared with several other available tools or algorithms with similar functionality. We also conducted the case study based on our method, and succeeded in prioritizing candidate leukemia-associated protein complexes and expanding the prioritization and analysis of cancer-related complexes to other cancer types.

To investigate whether a change in the immune status can be used as an earlier marker for HCMV reactivation than the traditional PCR analysis, eight chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients at risk for reactivation due to commencement of alemtuzumab (anti-CD52) treatment were longitudinally followed. Five series of consecutive weekly blood samples were immunophenotyped by flow cytometry to cover both the innate and adaptive immune responses. Concurrently, patients were monitored by PCR for HCMV reactivation. We found a minor upregulation of the early activation marker CD69 on NK cells immediately before HCMV was detected in circulation by PCR. Interestingly, for the specific immune response, CD69 was highly upregulated on CD3(+) T cells, especially for the CD8(+) subset, in the two patients experiencing an HCMV reactivation between 6 and 20 d before HCMV viremia was measured by PCR. Moreover, a CD4(+):CD8(+) ratio lower than 0.6 may indicate a trend toward an increased risk for viral reactivation. In conclusion, an increase in CD69 expression is a promising candidate as an early predictor of HCMV reactivation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS & METHODS: We performed an integrated analysis to associate the gene expression of diagnostic bone marrow blasts from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients treated in the discovery set (AML97; n = 42) and in the independent validation set (AML02; n = 46) with multiple clinical and pharmacological end points. Based on prior biological knowledge, we defined a gene to show a therapeutically beneficial (detrimental) pattern of association of its expression positively (negatively) correlated with favorable phenotypes such as intracellular cytarabine 5 -triphosphate levels, morphological response and event-free survival, and negatively (positively) correlated with unfavorable end points such as post-cytarabine DNA synthesis levels, minimal residual disease and cytarabine LC(50). RESULTS: We identified 240 probe sets predicting a therapeutically beneficial pattern and 97 predicting detrimental pattern (p </= 0.005) in the discovery set. Of these, 60 were confirmed in the independent validation set. The validated probe sets correspond to genes involved in PIK3/PTEN/AKT/mTOR signaling, G-protein-coupled receptor signaling and leukemogenesis. This suggests that targeting these pathways as potential pharmacogenomic and therapeutic candidates could be useful for improving treatment outcomes in AML.

We observed good biocompatibility of the therapeutic approach, and the fresh evidence from the electrochemical studies, MTT assays, and caspase-3 immunocytochemistry demonstrated that the strategy could significantly increase the uptake of DNR by drug-resistant leukemia cells, and enhance the sensitivity of the MDR cells to the chemotherapeutic agents after released in the cells. The resisting fold became obviously lower and the apoptosis was induced in the cells as well. It was therefore concluded that the strategy could have good reversal ability of MDR in tumor.

METHODS: All patients who received proton therapy or mixed photon-proton radiotherapy from 1983 to 2009 at the Massachusetts General Hospital were reviewed. Criteria for proton therapy were the need for high dose in the context of highly conformal radiotherapy of unresected or partially resected OSA, positive postoperative margins, postoperative imaging studies with macroscopic disease, or incomplete resection as defined by the surgeon. The primary endpoint was local control of the site treated; secondary endpoints were disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), long-term toxicity, and prognostic factors associated with clinical outcome. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients with a median age of 29 years (range, 2-76 years) were offered proton therapy. The mean dose was 68.4 gray (Gy; standard deviation, 5.4 Gy). Of the total dose, 58.2% (range, 11%-100%) was delivered with protons. Local control after 3 and 5 years was 82% and 72%, respectively. The distant failure rate was 26% after 3 and 5 years. The 5-year DFS was 65%, and the 5-year OS was 67%. The extent of surgical resection did not correlate with outcome. Risk factors for local failure were >/= 2 grade disease (P < .0001) and total treatment length (P = .008). Grade 3 to 4 late toxicity was seen in 30.1 % of patients.

Thus, no therapy targeting this process has yet been approved. Chemokines and their receptors are mediators of chronic inflammation and have been linked to the metastasis of numerous cancers. More recently, the Cysteine X Cysteine (CXC) chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) has emerged as a key mediator of tumor metastasis; therefore, identification of inhibitors of this receptor has the potential to abrogate metastasis. In this report, we demonstrate that acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid (AKBA), a component of the therapeutic plant Boswellia serrata, can downregulate CXCR4 expression in pancreatic cancer cells. The reduction in CXCR4 induced by this terpenoid was found to be cell-type specific, as its expression was also abrogated in leukemia, myeloma and breast cancer cell lines. Neither proteasome inhibitors nor lysosomal stabilization could prevent the AKBA-induced reduction in CXCR4 expression. This downregulation occurred at the transcriptional level. Suppression of CXCR4 by AKBA was accompanied by the inhibition of pancreatic cancer cell invasion, which is induced by CXCL12, the ligand for CXCR4. In addition, abrogation of the expression of chemokine receptor by AKBA was found in human pancreatic tissues from orthotopic animal model. AKBA also abolished breast tumor cell invasion, and this effect correlated with the disappearance of both the CXCR4 messenger RNA and CXCR4 protein. Overall, our results show that AKBA is a novel inhibitor of CXCR4 expression and, thus, has the potential to suppress the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells.",['Copyright (c) 2011 UICC.'],['NIHMS275197'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2011 Mar 29.,,,,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to link expression patterns of B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (Bmi-1) and p16 to patient outcome (recurrence and survival) in a cohort of 252 patients with oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OSCC). METHODS: Expression levels of Bmi-1 and p16 in samples from 252 patients with OSCC were evaluated immunohistochemically using the tissue microarray method. Staining intensity was determined by calculating an intensity reactivity score (IRS). Staining intensity and the localization of expression within tumor cells (nuclear or cytoplasmic) were correlated with overall, disease-specific, and recurrence-free survival. RESULTS: The majority of cancers were localized in the oropharynx (61.1%). In univariate analysis, patients who had OSCC and strong Bmi-1 expression (IRS >10) had worse outcomes compared with patients who had low and moderate Bmi-1 expression (P = .008; hazard ratio [HR], 1.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.167-2.838); this correlation was also observed for atypical cytoplasmic Bmi-1 expression (P = .001; HR, 2.164; 95% CI, 1.389-3.371) and for negative p16 expression (P < .001; HR, 0.292; 95% CI, 0.178-0.477). The combination of both markers, as anticipated, had an even stronger correlation with overall survival (P < .001; HR, 8.485; 95% CI, 4.237-16.994). Multivariate analysis demonstrated significant results for patients with oropharyngeal cancers, but not for patients with oral cavity tumors: Tumor classification (P = .011; HR, 1.838; 95%CI, 1.146-2.947) and the combined marker expression patterns (P < .001; HR, 6.254; 95% CI, 2.869-13.635) were correlated with overall survival, disease-specific survival (tumor classification: P = .002; HR, 2.807; 95% CI, 1.477-5.334; combined markers: P = .002; HR, 5.386; 95% CI, 1.850-15.679), and the combined markers also were correlated with recurrence-free survival (P = .001; HR, 8.943; 95% CI, 2.562-31.220). CONCLUSIONS: Cytoplasmic Bmi-1 expression, an absence of p16 expression, and especially the combination of those 2 predictive markers were correlated negatively with disease-specific and recurrence-free survival in patients with oropharyngeal cancer. Therefore, the current results indicate that these may be applicable as predictive markers in combination with other factors to select patients for more aggressive treatment and follow-up.",['Copyright (c) 2011 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The studied mechanisms included taxane pharmacokinetics, expression of genes dominating their metabolism (Cyp3a1/2) and transport (Abcb1) and genes controlling tumour angiogenesis (growth factors and receptors). SB-T-1214, SB-T-12854 and IDN5109 suppressed rat lymphoma more effectively than paclitaxel, SB-T-12851, SB-T-12852, SB-T-12853 or IDN5390 as well as P388D1 leukaemia cells in vitro. The greater anti-lymphoma effects of SB-T-1214 in rats corresponded to a higher bioavailability than with SB-T-12854, and lower systemic toxicity of SB-T-1214 for rats reflected its lower cytotoxicity for P388D1 cells in vitro. Suppression of Abcb1 and CYP3a1 expression by SB-T-1214 and IDN5109 could partly explain their anti-lymphoma effects, but not that of SB-T-12854. Growth factors genes Egf, Fgf, Pdgf, and Vegf associated with tumour angiogenesis had significantly lower expression following treatment with anti-lymphoma effective IDN5109 and their receptors were unaffected, whereas inefficient IDN5390 increased expression of the most important Vegf. The effective SB-T-12854 inhibited Egf, Egfr, Fgfr and Pdgfr expression, while the ineffective SB-T-12851, SB-T-12852 and SB-T-12853 inhibited only Egf or Egfr expression. Vegfr expression was inhibited significantly by SB-T-12851 and SB-T-12854, but effect of SB-T-12851 was compromised by induced Vegf expression. The very effective SB-T-1214 decreased the expression of Vegf, Egf and all receptors most prominently indicating the possible supporting role of these genes in anti-lymphoma effects. In conclusion, SB-T-1214, SB-T-12854 and IDN5109 are good candidates for further study.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The activity of MLN8237 was evaluated against 28 neuroblastoma and Ewing sarcoma cell lines, and its in vivo efficacy was studied over a range of doses against 12 pediatric tumor xenograft models. Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and genomic studies were undertaken. RESULTS: In vitro neuroblastoma cell lines were generally more sensitive to MLN8237 than Ewing sarcoma lines. MLN8237 demonstrated significant activity in vivo against solid tumor models at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD); however, only 2 of 6 neuroblastoma models had objective responses at 0.25MTD. In contrast, MLN8237 induced objective responses at its MTD and at 0.5MTD in three ALL models and in two out of three at 0.25MTD. Pharmacokinetic studies at 0.5MTD demonstrated a T (max) of 0.5 h, C (max) of 24.8 muM, AUC((0-24)) of 60.3 muM h, and 12 h trough level of 1.2 muM. Mitotic indices increased 6-12 h after MLN8237 administration. AURKA copy number variation was frequent in xenografts, and expression was highly correlated with copy number. CONCLUSIONS: Objective responses were more frequent in tumors with decreased AURKA copy number (5/8) compared to those with increased gene copy number (2/14). This report confirms the significant activity against both solid tumor and ALL xenografts at the MTD, with a steep dose response. These data support clinical development of MLN8237 in childhood cancer. Because of the steep dose-response relationship, such studies should target achieving trough levels of 1 muM or higher for sustained periods of treatment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The overall cure rate in children is 85%, whereas it is only 40% in adults. Kefir is an important probiotic that contains many bioactive ingredients, which give it unique health benefits. It has been shown to control several cellular types of cancer. PURPOSE: The present study investigates the effect of a cell-free fraction of kefir on CEM and Jurkat cells, which are human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1)-negative malignant T-lymphocytes. METHODS: Cells were incubated with different kefir concentrations. The cytotoxicity of the compound was evaluated by determining the percentage viability of cells. The effect of all the noncytotoxic concentrations of kefir on the proliferation of CEM and Jurkat cells was then assessed. The levels of transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), transforming growth factor- beta1 (TGF-beta1), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), and MMP-9 mRNA upon kefir treatment were then analyzed using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Finally, the growth inhibitory effects of kefir on cell-cycle progression/apoptosis were assessed by Cell Death Detection (ELISA) and flow cytometry. RESULTS: The maximum cytotoxicity recorded after 48-hours treatment with 80 mug/muL kefir was only 42% and 39% in CEM and Jurkat cells, respectively. The percent reduction in proliferation was very significant, and was dose-, and time-dependent. In both cell lines, kefir exhibited its antiproliferative effect by downregulating TGF-alpha and upregulating TGF-beta1 mRNA expression. Upon kefir treatment, a marked increase in cell-cycle distribution was noted in the preG(1) phase of CEM and Jurkat cells, indicating the proapoptotic effect of kefir, which was further confirmed by Cell Death Detection ELISA. However, kefir did not affect the mRNA expression of metalloproteinases needed for the invasion of leukemic cell lines.

It has also been suggested that the virus can be found circulating amongst the general population. The discovery has been controversial, with conflicting results from attempts to reproduce the original studies. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We extracted peripheral blood DNA from a cohort of 540 HIV-1-positive patients (approximately 20% of whom have never been on anti-retroviral treatment) and determined the presence of XMRV and related viruses using TaqMan PCR. While we were able to amplify as few as 5 copies of positive control DNA, we did not find any positive samples in the patient cohort. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In view of these negative findings in this highly susceptible group, we conclude that it is unlikely that XMRV or related viruses are circulating at a significant level, if at all, in HIV-1-positive patients in London or in the general population.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, NK cells play important roles in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation by providing the graft versus leukemia effect and preventing the development of graft versus host disease. Thus, understanding the developmental pathway(s) from multipotent HSCs to the NK cell lineage-restricted progenitors is of significant clinical value. However, despite extensive progress in the delineation of mature blood cell development, including the B- and T-cell lineages, the early stages of NK cell lineage commitment and development have been less well established and characterized.

The prognostic significance of the occurrence of variant translocations has been discussed in previous studies. The European LeukemiaNet recommendations do not provide a ""warning"" for patients with variant translocations, but there is limited information about their outcome after therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

Variant translocations occurred in 30 patients (5%). Our data show that the presence of variant translocations has no impact on the cytogenetic and molecular response or on outcome, regardless of the involvement of different mechanisms, the number of involved chromosomes, or the presence of deletions. Therefore, we suggest that patients with variant translocations do not constitute a ""warning"" category in the imatinib era.

New therapies for AML are targeted at signal transduction pathways known to support blast survival, such as the Stat3 pathway. Aberrant activation of Stat3 has been demonstrated in many different malignancies, including AML, and this finding is frequently associated with more aggressive disease. The objectives of this study were: (1) to characterize Stat3 signaling patterns in AML cells lines and primary pediatric samples; and (2) to test the efficacy and potency of a novel Stat3 inhibitor in inducing apoptosis in AML cells. We found that Stat3 was constitutively activated in 6 of 7 AML cell lines and 6 of 18 primary pediatric AML samples. Moreover, constitutively phosphorylated Stat3 was frequent in samples with normal karyotype but uncommon in samples with t(8;21). Most cell lines and primary samples responded to G-CSF stimulation, although the sensitivity and magnitude of the response varied dramatically. Our novel small-molecule Stat3 inhibitor, C188-9, inhibited G-CSF-induced Stat3 phosphorylation, induced apoptosis in AML cell lines and primary samples, and inhibited AML blast colony formation with potencies in the low micromolar range. Therefore, Stat3 inhibition may be a valuable strategy for targeted therapies for AML.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that the genome profiles of the PB frequently differed from those of the LN samples. The results showed that 9 of 13 cases investigated had a log2 ratio imbalance among chromosomes, and that chromosome imbalances were more frequent in LN samples. Detailed analysis revealed that the imbalances were likely caused by the presence of multiple subclones in the LN samples. Five of 13 cases showed homozygous loss regions in PB samples, which were not found in the LN samples, indicating that tumors in the PB were derived from LN subclones in most cases. Southern blot analysis of TCRgamma showed that these multiple subclones originated from a common clone.

Perturbation of the SFKs Lyn and Hck with genetics or inhibitors revealed Bcr-Abl downstream phosphorylation events either mediated by or independent of SFKs. We identified multiple negative feedback mechanisms within the network of signaling events affected by Bcr-Abl and SFKs and found that Bcr-Abl attenuated these inhibitory mechanisms. The C-terminal Src kinase (Csk)-binding protein Pag1 (also known as Cbp) and the tyrosine phosphatase Ptpn18 both mediated negative feedback to SFKs. We observed Bcr-Abl-mediated phosphorylation of the phosphatase Shp2 (Ptpn11), and this may contribute to the suppression of these negative feedback mechanisms to promote Bcr-Abl-activated SFK signaling.

Epub 2011 Mar 29.,,,,"VEGFA is considered one of the most important regulators of tumor-associated angiogenesis in cancer. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) VEGFA is an independent prognostic factor for reduced overall and relapse-free survival. Transcriptional activation of the VEGFA promoter, a core mechanism for VEGFA regulation, has not been fully elucidated. We found a significant (P < 0.0001) inverse correlation between expression of VEGFA and AML1/RUNX1 in a large set of gene expression array data. Strikingly, highest VEGFA levels were demonstrated in AML blasts containing a t(8;21) translocation, which involves the AML1/RUNX1 protein (AML1/ETO). Overexpression of AML1/RUNX1 led to downregulation of VEGFA expression, whereas blocking of AML1/RUNX1 with siRNAs resulted in increased VEGFA expression. Cotransfection of AML1/RUNX1 and VEGFA promoter luciferase promoter constructs resulted in a decrease in VEGFA promoter activity. ChIP analysis shows a direct binding of AML1/RUNX1 to the promoter of VEGFA on three AML1/RUNX1 binding sites. Silencing of AML1/ETO caused a decrease in VEGFA mRNA expression and a decrease in secreted VEGFA protein levels in AML1/ETO-positive Kasumi-1 cells. Taken together, these data pinpoint to a model whereby in normal cells AML1/RUNX1 acts as a repressor for VEGFA, while in AML cells VEGFA expression is upregulated due to AML1/RUNX1 aberrations, for example, AML1/ETO. In conclusion, these observations give insight in the regulation of VEGFA at the mRNA level in AML.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients received bortezomib by intravenous push on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Patients also received alvocidib on days 1 and 8 by 30-minute bolus infusion followed by a 4-hour continuous infusion. Treatment was on a 21-day cycle, with indefinite continuation for patients experiencing responses or stable disease. Dose escalation employed a standard 3 + 3 design until the MTD was identified on the basis of DLTs. Pharmacokinetic studies and pharmacodynamic studies were conducted. RESULTS: Sixteen patients were treated. The MTD was established as 1.3 mg/m(2) for bortezomib and 30 mg/m(2) for alvocidib (both the 30-minute bolus and 4-hour infusions). Common hematologic toxicities included leukopenia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. Common nonhematologic toxicities included fatigue and febrile neutropenia. DLTs included fatigue, febrile neutropenia, and elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels. Two complete responses (CR; 12%) and five partial responses (PR; 31%) were observed at the MTD (overall response rate = 44%). Pharmacokinetic results were typical for alvocidib and pharmacodynamic studies yielded variable results. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of bortezomib and alvocidib is tolerable and an MTD has been established for the tested schedule. The regimen appears active in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, justifying phase II studies to determine the activity of this regimen more definitively.",['(c)2011 AACR.'],['NIHMS284625'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that BRD7 is a component of hSWI-SNF complexes that interacts with PRMT5 and PRC2. Recruitment studies revealed that BRD7 co-localizes with PRMT5 and PRC2 on 'suppressor of tumorigenecity 7' (ST7) and retinoblastoma-like protein 2 (RBL2) promoters in patient-derived B cell lines, and that its association with these target genes correlates with hypermethylation of H3R8, H4R3 and H3K27. Furthermore, inhibition of BRD7 expression reduces PRMT5 and PRC2 recruitment to ST7 and RBL2 promoters; however, only ST7 becomes transcriptionally derepressed. Evaluation of the PRMT5- and PRC2-induced epigenetic marks revealed that while H3(Me(2))R8, H4(Me(2))R3 and H3(Me(3))K27 marks are erased from the ST7 promoter, demethylation of RBL2 promoter histones is incomplete. We also show that the arginine demethylase (RDM) JMJD6, which can erase PRMT5-induced H4R3 methylation, and the H3K27-lysine-specific demethylases, KDM6A/UTX and KDM6B/JMJD3, are differentially recruited to ST7 and RBL2. These findings highlight the role played by BRD7 in PRMT5- and PRC2-induced transcriptional silencing, and indicate that recruitment of specific RDMs and KDMs is required for efficient transcriptional derepression.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to perform a comprehensive study of the phosphotyrosine proteome. Immunoaffinity enriched pTyr proteins and peptides from K562 leukemia cells were analyzed with high-resolving liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Two different antibodies selective for the pTyr modification were used in repeated enrichments to identify as many pTyr peptides as possible. Stringent verification of putative pTyr sites was performed to assure high reliability in the subsequent biological interpretation of the data. Identified pTyr proteins were subjected to pathway analysis by using different analytical tools. In total, 294 pTyr peptides belonging to 217 pTyr proteins were identified, 15 of which had not previously been reported to be modified by pTyr. The pTyr proteins were clustered in six major groups based on the biological functions ""cellular signaling"", ""cell motility and shape"", ""cell cycle process"", ""transport"", ""RNA processing"" and ""protein processing"". The pTyr proteins were mainly positioned in the following cellular compartments: cytoplasm, cytoskeleton, nucleus and ribonucleoprotein complexes. An interesting finding was that many proteins were related to RNA processing and were found to be heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins. Also, more than half of the novel pTyr proteins were localized to the nucleus, of which three (PBX2, TEAD1 and DIDO1) were classified as transcription factors and two (CENPC1 and MAD2L1) are associated with cell division control.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Mitochondrial pathology in MDS is suggested by abnormal mitochondrial iron accumulation, increased apoptosis, and a high frequency of acquired mitochondrial DNA mutations in bone marrow cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mitochondrial gene expression was measured by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in CD34(+) bone marrow cells from 37 patients with MDS (22 refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia, 9 refractory anemia with excess of blasts [5-9% marrow blasts], 6 refractory anemia with excess of blasts [10-19% marrow blasts]), 14 cases of acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes (acute myeloid leukemia-MDS), and 9 normal controls. Relative quantification was achieved by using specific plasmid standards and 18S ribosomal RNA. Genes were selected to represent the multi-enzyme complexes I to IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase subunit 3 (subunit of complex I), succinate dehydrogenase B (complex II), cytochrome B (complex III), and cytochrome-c-oxidase subunit I (complex IV). RESULTS: Expression of mitochondrial-encoded genes was significantly reduced in patients with MDS and acute myeloid leukemia-MDS compared to normal controls, while mitochondrial DNA copy number was increased rather than diminished. An age-related decrease in mitochondrial gene expression was observed in MDS patients as well as controls. However, this effect was less pronounced than the MDS-related effect. Besides an overall decrease in mitochondrial gene expression, MDS patients displayed a stochiometric imbalance of mitochondrial-encoded genes, assessed in relation to the nuclear-encoded succinate dehydrogenase B. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show dysregulated mitochondrial gene expression that goes beyond a simple age-related effect and is compatible with the putative role of mitochondrial dysfunction in MDS pathophysiology. However, it remains unclear whether the problem arises from primary lesions in the mitochondria, i.e., mitochondrial DNA mutations, or as a result of changes in the cell nucleus.","['Copyright (c) 2011 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

DESIGN: A retrospective population-based cohort study. METHOD: Data from the Netherlands Cancer Registry were used for this study. For all patients diagnosed with cancer in the Netherlands between 1989 and 2008, information on vital status was obtained from hospitals, municipalities and the Municipal Personal Records Database. Age-standardised, relative survival rates per cancer type were calculated. RESULTS: The 5-year relative survival for all types of cancer combined increased from 47% in 1989-1993 to 59% in 2004-2008. This increase was greater in males than in females (from 40% to 55% and from 55% to 62%, respectively). The most striking improvements in survival were observed in breast, prostate and colorectal cancers, probably for reasons differing for each cancer type. Patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia showed the greatest gain in survival (43%). Survival rates in older patients were generally worse in comparison to those in younger patients, especially in case of head and neck cancer, ovarian cancer and haematological malignancies. The survival gap between older and younger patients has increased over the last 20 years. The 10-year survival rate for most cancer types was not much lower than the 5-year rate, except in chronic and indolent haematological malignancies and cancers that may reoccur after a long time, such as breast and prostate cancer. CONCLUSION: The increase in survival rates of cancer patients in the Netherlands, attributed to early detection and improved treatment, could represent either an increase in the number of patients cured or to cancer patients living longer lives.

A subsequent study reported XMRV antigens in malignant prostatic epithelium and association of XMRV infection with PCa, especially higher-grade tumors, independently of the RNASEL polymorphism. Further studies showed high prevalence of XMRV or related MLV sequences in chronic fatigue syndrome patients (CFS), while others found no, or low, prevalence of XMRV in a variety of diseases including PCa or CFS. Thus, the etiological link between XMRV and human disease remains elusive. To address the association between XMRV infection and PCa, we have tested prostate tissues and human sera for the presence of viral DNA, viral antigens and anti-XMRV antibodies. RESULTS: Real-time PCR analysis of 110 PCa (Gleason scores >4) and 40 benign and normal prostate tissues identified six positive samples (5 PCa and 1 non-PCa). No statistical link was observed between the presence of proviral DNA and PCa, PCa grades, and the RNASEL R462Q mutation. The amplified viral sequences were distantly related to XMRV, but nearly identical to endogenous MLV sequences in mice. The PCR positive samples were also positive for mouse mitochondrial DNA by nested PCR, suggesting contamination of the samples with mouse DNA. Immuno-histochemistry (IHC) with an anti-XMRV antibody, but not an anti-MLV antibody that recognizes XMRV, sporadically identified antigen-positive cells in prostatic epithelium, irrespectively of the status of viral DNA detection. No serum (159 PCa and 201 age-matched controls) showed strong neutralization of XMRV infection at 1:10 dilution. CONCLUSION: The lack of XMRV sequences or strong anti-XMRV neutralizing antibodies indicates no or very low prevalence of XMRV in our cohorts. We conclude that real-time PCR- and IHC-positive samples were due to laboratory contamination and non-specific immune reactions, respectively.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study was to retrospectively evaluate how dementia modified the cancer discovery process, frequency of cancer pain reports and analgesic-narcotic use at a large psychiatric hospital. METHODS: We reviewed all the records of cancer patients with and without dementia treated at the surgical ward of Matsuzawa Hospital from 1993 to 2004. Psychiatric diseases other than dementia, brain metastasis and alcoholism, as well as leukaemia and skin cancer, were excluded. Patients' communicativeness as to pain was ascertained from nursing records. RESULTS: A total of 134 cancer patients with and without dementia (50 demented and 84 non-demented) were included. Demented patients were accidentally discovered to have cancer (48%) or by an unexpected unfolding of clinical signs (44%), whereas most non-demented patients (63%) voluntarily sought medical evaluation (P= 0.000). Overall, 76% of non-demented patients had cancer pains (stages I and II, 64%; stages III and IV, 84%), whereas just 22% of demented patients had cancer pains (stages I and II, 16%; stages III and IV, 26%; P= 0.000). Non-demented patients showed stage-dependent requirements for both non-narcotic analgesics (stages I and II, 64%; stages III and IV, 84%) and narcotics (stages I and II, 0%; stages III and IV, 41%). Demented patients required much less analgesics (stages I and II, 11%; stages III and IV, 13%), with only one stage IV patient requiring narcotics (P= 0.000).

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Study approval was obtained from the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board. The master diagnosis index was queried from January 1, 1980, through December 31, 2008, to identify patients with AFX and CLL or other types of NHL. A retrospective chart review was conducted. RESULTS: Ten patients were identified with AFX and NHL. These patients did not show a greater risk of recurrence, metastasis, or death than that found in previous case reports. Of these 10 patients, four had AFX and CLL. The outcomes of these patients were no different from those of patients with AFX and other types of lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: AFX did not demonstrate aggressive features such as recurrence or metastasis in patients with concomitant CLL or other NHL. More studies are needed to definitively characterize the behavior of AFX in this patient population.","['(c) 2011 by the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effects of the mutations K65R, R78A and K65R/V75I on the fidelity of HIV-1 group O RTs were studied using gel-based and M13mp2 lacZ forward-mutation fidelity assays. Forward-mutation assays demonstrated that mutant RTs K65R, R78A and K65R/V75I showed >9-fold increased accuracy in comparison with the wild-type enzyme and were approximately two times more faithful than the MLV RT. Compared with MLV RT, all of the tested HIV-1 group O RT variants showed decreased frameshift fidelity. However, K65R RT showed a higher tendency to introduce one-nucleotide deletions in comparison with other HIV-1 group O RT variants. R78A had a destabilizing effect on the RT, either in the presence or absence of V75I. At temperatures above 52 degrees C, K65R and K65R/V75I retained similar levels of DNA polymerase activity to the wild-type HIV-1 group O RT, but were more efficient than HIV-1 group M subtype B and MLV RTs. K65R, K65R/V75I and R78A RTs showed decreased misinsertion and mispair extension fidelity in comparison with the wild-type enzyme for most base pairs studied.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forces of 0.3 N were applied to move the upper left first molars mesially in 24 rats. These forces were kept constant for 3, 7, and 14 days and followed by animal sacrifice. The contralateral molars served as control. The rate of tooth movement was measured by Image J software. Paraffin-embedded sections of the upper jaws were prepared for histological and immunohistochemical analysis to test the LIF and LIFR expression. RESULTS: Loaded teeth showed a significantly higher rate of tooth movement. The periodontium of the moved teeth experienced tissue remodeling, while there was no obvious change in the contralateral controls. Furthermore, LIF and LIFR were expressed in the periodontal tissue, and there were statistically significant differences between the loaded and unloaded teeth at 3 and 14 days. LIF presented significantly higher expression on the tension side compared with the pressure side at 3 days. CONCLUSION: Both LIF and LIFR exist in the periodontal tissue, and continuous orthodontic forces induce the upregulation of LIF/LIFR production, suggesting that LIF/LIFR may play important roles in periodontium remodeling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the TRM rate decreased in patients who were diagnosed after July 1, 2004 (11.2% vs 7.9%; P = .02), the rate of induction death did not change (5.2% vs 5.8%; P = .58). Independent predictors of induction death included higher risk ALL (odds ratio [OR], 1.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-3.27; P = .04), lower initial platelet counts (OR per 10 x 10(9) /L, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89-0.98; P = .005), and longer travel time to the clinic (OR, 1.06 per hour; 95% CI, 1.01-1.14; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: In Central America, TRM remains an important cause of treatment failure in children with ALL. A large proportion of TRM occurs in maintenance, although this proportion has decreased over time. Supportive care interventions should especially target children who present with low platelet counts. Further study on transfusion ability and the location of induction deaths is required.",['Copyright (c) 2011 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The BCCSS is a population based cohort of individuals diagnosed with childhood cancer between 1940 and 1991 and who survived at least 5 years from diagnosis (n = 17,981). 10483, 71% of those survivors aged at least 16 years, returned a completed questionnaire, which asked if hypothyroidism had been diagnosed. Of the whole cohort, 7.7% reported hypothyroidism with the highest risk among patients treated for Hodgkin's disease (HD) (19.9%), CNS neoplasms (15.3%), Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (6.2%) and leukaemia (5.2%). Survivors were more likely to develop hypothyroidism if they had received radiotherapy for HD (p = 0.0001) or a CNS neoplasm (p < 0.00005) but not leukaemia (p = 0.3). In these three patient groups, the frequency of hypothyroidism was similar in men and women. Survivors of irradiated CNS tumours reported a prevalence of hypothyroidism, which was substantially lower if discharged to primary care compared with being on hospital follow-up and which declined substantially with increased follow-up in both primary care (p = 0.004) and hospital follow-up (p = 0.023) settings. Hypothyroidism is a common finding amongst adult survivors of childhood malignancy. The substantial differences in reported hypothyroidism prevalence after irradiated CNS neoplasms suggests substantial under-diagnosis, which increased with increased follow-up, and which increased among those followed-up in primary care compared with hospital settings.",['Copyright (c) 2011 UICC.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Artemisinin has inhibitory effects on cancer cell growth and anti-angiogenetic activity, including many drug- and radiation-resistant cancer cell lines. Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site 1 (BMI-1) has been shown to regulate proliferation by inhibiting p16(ink4a) transcription. It is well known that BMI-1 over-expression was found in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines and correlated with advanced invasive stage of the tumor progression and poor prognosis. In the present investigation, we analyzed the inhibitory effects of artemisinin on proliferation of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines (CNE-1 and CNE-2, well-differentiated cells, and poorly differentiated cells). We demonstrated that artemisinin induced G1 cell cycle arrest in CNE-1 and CNE-2 cells. Artemisinin inhibited BMI-1 both in protein and transcript levels. BMI-1 knockdown made the cells more sensitive to artemisinin with an increase in G1 phase, but over-expression of BMI-1 partially reversed the artemisinin-induced G1 cell cycle arrest. Depletion of BMI-1 was able to intensifying the increment of p16 and the reduction of CDK4 induced by artemisinin. In addition, over-expression of BMI-1 was capable of attenuating the increasing p16 and decreasing CDK4 in cells treated with artemisinin. Taking together, the BMI1-p16/CDK4 axis was involved in the artemisinin-driven G1 arrest in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells, and these results indicated that a potential treatment that the combination of artemisinin and BMI-1 downregulation could enhance the growth inhibitory affects on nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2011 Mar 29.,,,,"BACKGROUND: Hesperidin, a flavanone present in citrus fruits, has been identified as a potent anticancer agent because of its proapoptotic and antiproliferative characteristics in some tumor cells. However, the precise mechanisms of action are not entirely understood. AIM: The main purpose of this study is to investigate the involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) in hesperidin's anticancer actions in human pre-B NALM-6 cells, which expresses wild-type p53. METHODS: The effects of hesperidin on cell-cycle distribution, proliferation, and caspase-mediated apoptosis were examined in NALM-6 cells in the presence or absence of GW9662. The expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma), p53, phospho-IkappaB, Bcl-2, Bax, and XIAP proteins were focused on using the immunoblotting assay. The transcriptional activities of PPARgamma and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) were analyzed by the transcription factor assay kits. The expression of PPARgamma and p53 was analyzed using the RT-PCR method. RESULTS: Hesperidin induced the expression and transcriptional activity of PPARgamma and promoted p53 accumulation and downregulated constitutive NF-kappaB activity in a PPARgamma-dependent and PPARgamma-independent manner. The growth-inhibitory effect of hesperidin was partially reduced when the cells preincubated with PPARgamma antagonist prior to the exposure to hesperidin. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study clearly demonstrate that hesperidin-mediated proapoptotic and antiproliferative actions are regulated via both PPARgamma-dependent and PPARgamma-independent pathways in NALM-6 cells. These data provide the first evidence that hesperidin could be developed as an agent against hematopoietic malignancies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The physical properties of DNR-MNPs were investigated and their effect on leukemia cells in vitro was evaluated by a standard WST-1 cell proliferation assay. Furthermore, cell apoptosis and intracellular accumulation of DNR were determined by FACSCalibur flow cytometry. RESULTS: Our results showed that the majority of MNPs were spherical and their sizes were from 10 to 20 nm. The average hydrodynamic diameter of DNR-MNPs in water was 94 nm. The in vitro release data showed that the DNR-MNPs have excellent sustained release property. Proliferation of K562 cells was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by DNR in solution (DNR-Sol) or by DNR-MNPs. The IC(50) for DNR-MNPs was slightly higher than that for DNR-Sol. DNR-MNPs also induced less apoptosis in K562 cells than did DNR-Sol. Detection of fluorescence intensity of intracellular DNR demonstrated that DNR-MNPs could be taken up by K562 cells and persistently released DNR in cells. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that optimized DNR-MNPs formulation possesses sustained drug-release and favorable antitumor properties, which may be used as a conventional dosage form for antitumor therapy.",,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['K562 cells', 'daunorubicin', 'drug delivery system', 'magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles', 'target selection']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also, low BCRP expression was present on CD34(+) blood DC precursors and expression was increased upon their differentiation to LC. The CD34(+) acute myeloid leukemia-derived DC cell line MUTZ3 can be cultured into LC or IDC, depending on the cytokine cocktail used. Introduction of functional BCRP in MUTZ3 progenitor cells through retroviral transduction resulted in the emergence of typical LC-characteristics in IDC cultures; the majority of cells remained negative for the IDC-specific C-type lectin DC-SIGN, but rather displayed enhanced expression of the LC-specific C-type lectin Langerin and characteristic high expression levels of CD1a. BCRP-induced skewing toward LC-like differentiation coincided with early RelB expression in 'IDC', derived from MUTZ3-BCRP, and depended on endogenous transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) production. Intriguingly, cellular BCRP localization differed between skin LC and IDC, and a more cytoplasmic BCRP localization, as observed in primary skin LC, seemed to relate to LC-like differentiation in IDC cultures upon BCRP introduction in MUTZ3 progenitors. Together these data support a role for BCRP in preferential LC differentiation from CD34(+) myeloid DC progenitors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in many MDS/AML patients no genetic aberrations have been identified yet, and even within some cytogenetically well-defined subclasses there is considerable clinical heterogeneity. Recent advances in genomics technologies such as gene expression profiling (GEP) provide powerful tools to further characterize myeloid malignancies at the molecular level, with the goal to refine the MDS/AML classification system, incorporating as yet unknown molecular genetic and epigenetic pathomechanisms, which are likely reflected by aberrant gene expression patterns. In this study, we provide a comprehensive review on how GEP has contributed to a refined molecular taxonomy of MDS and AML with regard to diagnosis, prediction of clinical outcome, discovery of novel subclasses and identification of novel therapeutic targets and novel drugs. As many challenges remain ahead, we discuss the pitfalls of this technology and its potential including future integrative studies with other genomics technologies, which will continue to improve our understanding of malignant transformation in myeloid malignancies and thereby contribute to individualized risk-adapted treatment strategies for MDS and AML patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was aimed to find out an effective, nontoxic dendritic cell (DC) maturating agent for the immunotherapy of acute leukemia. RESULTS: MDP-matured DCs(M-DCs) expressed higher level of phenotypic markers and secreted higher cytokine level, while lower than TNF-alpha-matured DCs (T-DCs) and co-administration of MDP and TNF-alpha-matured DCs (MT-DCs). MT-DCs promoted significantly allogeneic T-cells reaction. As a result, allogeneic T-cell proliferated significantly and secreted higher amount of IFN-gamma. HL60-derived antigens were presented more effectively by MT-DCs to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) to induce more beneficial anti-tumor effects in a dose-dependent manner. METHODS: Purified mononuclear cells (MNCs) from bone marrow of acute leukemia children were differentiated by granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and recombinant human interleukin-4 (rhIL-4) and further matured by either Muramyl Dipeptide (MDP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) or co-administration of MDP and TNF-alpha.

METHODS: Previously reported cases of lactic acidosis in solid malignancy are reviewed. In addition, we report a case of type B lactic acidosis in a woman with metastatic breast cancer. Afterwards, we speculate on the elusive pathophysiology of this oncological emergency. RESULTS: 14 cases of lactic acidosis due to solid malignancies, without prior chemotherapy, were identified. The cases were published from the year 1978 to 2006. DISCUSSION: Several theories concerning the mechanism for type B lactic acidosis in solid malignancy have been postulated. During the last decade, more and more evidence supports the role of overproduction of lactic acid due to ischaemia in the neoplastic tissue bed and with cancer cells having an aberrant energy production.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Historically, efforts aimed at understanding the molecular bases for therapy response have repeatedly illuminated APL pathogenesis. The classic model attributes this therapeutic success to the transcriptional reactivation elicited by retinoic acid and the resulting overcoming of the differentiation block characteristic of APL blasts. However, in clinical practice, retinoic acid by itself only rarely yields prolonged remissions, even though it induces massive differentiation. In contrast, as a single agent, arsenic trioxide neither directly activates transcription nor triggers terminal differentiation ex vivo, but cures many patients. Here we review the evidence from recent ex vivo and in vivo studies that allow a reassessment of the role of differentiation in APL cure. We discuss alternative models in which PML-RARA degradation and the subsequent loss of APL cell self-renewal play central roles. Rather than therapy aimed at inducing differentiation, targeting cancer cell self-renewal may represent a more effective goal, achievable by a broader range of therapeutic agents.",,,,,,,,['Blood. 2012 Mar 1;119(9):2177-9.

METHODS: From June 2000 through October 2007, 356 children with ALL were randomly assigned to receive initial single-agent treatment with HDMTX (1 g/m(2)) as either a 24-hour infusion or a 4-hour infusion at two pediatric hospitals in the United States. The primary outcome measures were the accumulation of MTXPG(1-7) in leukemia cells and the antileukemic effects (eg, inhibition of de novo purine synthesis in bone marrow ALL cells, and decrease in circulating ALL cells). RESULTS: The 24-hour infusion resulted in significantly higher amounts of MTXPG(1-7) in bone marrow leukemia cells (median: 1,695 v 1,150 pmol/10(9) cells, P = .0059), and better antileukemic effects. The 24-hour infusion had the greatest effect on MTXPG(1-7) accumulation in hyperdiploid ALL (median: 3,919 v 2,417 pmol/10(9) cells, P = .0038); T-cell ALL exhibited smaller differences in MTXPG(1-7) but greater antileukemic effects with the longer infusion (median decrease in leukemia cells: 88.4% v 51.8%, P = .0075). In contrast, infusion duration had no significant impact on MTXPG(1-7) accumulation or antileukemic effects in ALL with the t(12;21)/(ETV6-RUNX1) chromosomal translocation. CONCLUSION: Shortening the infusion time of HDMTX reduces accumulation of active methotrexate in leukemia cells and decreases antileukemic effects, with differing consequences among major ALL subtypes.",,,,,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 2011 Sep 1;29(25):3493-4; author reply 3494-5.

We took the advantage of one of these cases to test the hypothesis that the chemokine receptor CCR4 is involved in the homing of CLL cells to skin. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated CCR4 expression by flow cytometry in both circulating and skin CD19(+) leukemic cells from a patient with cutaneous DLBCL. As controls, we used peripheral blood samples from CLL patients without skin manifestations and from elderly healthy donors. RESULTS: We found that both DLBCL cells derived from the original CLL clone and circulating CLL cells from this patient expressed CCR4. Although it was previously reported that CCR4 is not expressed in CLL cells, we found that a low but significant proportion of leukemic cells from CLL patients with no skin manifestations do express CCR4. There was a positive correlation between the expression of CCR4 and the percentage of ZAP-70 of each sample. Moreover, we consistently observed a higher expression of CCR4 within CD19(+)CD38(+) and CD19(+)Ki67(+) subsets compared to CD19(+)CD38(-) and CD19(+)Ki67(-) lymphocytes from the same sample, respectively. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the chemokine receptor CCR4 is not a special feature of CLL cells with skin manifestation, but rather it is expressed in a low but significant proportion of peripheral blood CLL cells.",['(c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accumulated evidence shows that activation of oncogenic pathways such as phosphoinositide-3-kinase/AKT/IKK or RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase suppresses FOXO transcriptional activity through the phosphorylation of FOXOs at different sites that ultimately leads to nuclear exclusion and degradation of FOXOs. In addition, posttranslational modifications of FOXOs such as acetylation, methylation and ubiquitination also contribute to modulating FOXO3a functions. Several anti-cancer drugs like paclitaxel, imatinib, and doxorubicin activate FOXO3a by counteracting those oncogenic pathways which restrain FOXOs functions.

For further evaluation of the antiallergic activity, a 70% ethanol extract of the rhizomes of Rheum tanguticum (RTE) was prepared and its inhibitory activity on an animal model of atopic dermatitis (AD) was examined for the first time. Oral administration of RTE (30-300 mg/kg/day) for 5 weeks significantly inhibited hapten-induced dermatitis in NC/Nga mice based on the skin severity score. In addition, treatment with RTE at 100 mg/kg/day also reduced the numbers of white blood cells, neutrophils and eosinophils in the blood, and led to a significant reduction in the IgE concentration in the serum. In rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-1 cells, RTE inhibited 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX)-catalysed leukotriene production (IC(50) = 43.6 microg/mL). Among the anthraquinone derivatives isolated, emodin strongly inhibited this parameter (IC(50) = 4.3 microM). Taken together, these findings suggest that rhubarb exerts inhibitory activity against AD, and that the 5-LOX inhibitory activity of its major constituent, emodin, may contribute to this inhibitory action.","['Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DIAGNOSIS: The major criterion is presence of multifocal clusters of morphologically abnormal MC in the bone marrow. Minor diagnostic criteria include elevated serum tryptase level, abnormal MC expression of CD25 and/or CD2, and presence of KITD816V. RISK STRATIFICATION: The prognostic relevance of the 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of SM has recently been confirmed. Classification of SM patients into indolent (SM), aggressive SM (ASM), SM associated with a clonal non-MC lineage disease (SM-AHNMD), and mast cell leukemia (MCL) subgroups is a useful first step in establishing prognosis. RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: SM treatment is generally palliative. ISM patients have a normal life expectancy and receive symptom-directed therapy; infrequently, cytoreductive therapy may be indicated for refractory symptoms. ASM patients have disease-related organ dysfunction; interferon-alpha (+/-corticosteroids) can control dermatological, hematological, gastrointestinal, skeletal, and mediator-release symptoms, but is hampered by poor tolerability. Similarly, cladribine has broad therapeutic activity, with particular utility when rapid MC debulking is indicated; the main toxicity is myelosuppression. Imatinib has a therapeutic role in the presence of an imatinib-sensitive KIT mutation or in KITD816-unmutated patients. Treatment of SM-AHNMD is governed primarily by the non-MC neoplasm; hydroxyurea has modest utility in this setting. Dasatinib's in vitro anti- KITD816V activity has not translated into significant therapeutic activity in most SM patients. In contrast, preliminary data suggest that Midostaurin may produce significant decreases in MC burden in some patients.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow cytogenetic studies (24,262) were performed at our institution between 1989 and 2009. An abnormal karyotype was demonstrated in 6,565 cases (~27%); of these, 1,365 (~21%) included autosomal monosomies that occurred as sole (n = 133; ~10%), part of two (n = 82; ~6%) or more (n = 1,150; ~84%) anomalies. All 22 autosomes were involved, but monosomy 7 was by far the most frequent, constituting ~80% of all isolated monosomies and the highest fraction of those with two or more abnormalities. Other recurrent sole monosomies included chromosomes 20 (~11%) and 21 (~4%). Monosomy 13 (~10%), 20 (~8%), 18 (~7%), 17 (~6%), 21 (~5%), 5 (~5%), and 12 (~4%) were also recurrent in the setting of >/=2 abnormalities.

Our results revealed that hMSCs inhibited the proliferation and invasion of A549 and Eca-109 cells, arrested tumor cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and induced the apoptosis of tumor cells in vitro by using a co-culture system and the hMSCs-conditioned medium. However, animal study showed that hMSCs enhanced tumor formation and growth in vivo.

According to the observation of tumor mass and the result of microvessel density (MVD), we found that the promoting role of hMSCs on tumor growth was related with the increase of tumor vessel formation. Our present study suggests that hMSCs have a contradictory effect on tumor cell growth between in vitro and in vivo, and therefore, the exploitation of hMSCs in new therapeutic strategies should be cautious under the malignant conditions.","['Copyright (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Next to nothing is known about their regulation, function or stress-responsiveness in poikilotherms. Here, both acute heat stress and thermal acclimation were demonstrated to induce the expression of one isoform, C/EBP-delta, in the liver, white muscle and gill of the eurythermal estuarine goby, Gillichthys mirabilis. The established role of C/EBP-delta in causing cell cycle arrest and/or promoting apoptosis in other vertebrates suggests that the heat-inducibility of this protein in poikilotherms may be part of the conserved cellular stress response with the hypothesized role of causing temporary cessation of cell growth and/or programmed cell death during bouts of environmental stress.

The traditionally described mechanisms of p53 inactivation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) include TP53 mutations and abrogation of p53 pathway. Malfunction of wild-type (wt) p53, due to its cytoplasmic mislocalization, has been described, thus far, only in solid tumors. Herein, we present a patient with therapy-related resistant AML, monosomal karyotype, wt TP53, and cytoplasmic sequestration of p53 protein. Proposed mechanisms of p53 mislocalization and their probable clinical and therapeutic implications are discussed. In view of the relative rareness of TP53 mutations in AML, the cytoplasmic sequestration of p53 protein offers an additional inactivating mechanism, which might be more frequent than currently diagnosed. This notion warrants confirmation by prospective studies in large cohorts of patients. We recommend that evaluation of p53 subcellular localization and function should be included in the diagnostic work-up of AML with wt p53.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway of apoptosis is governed up-stream of mitochondria, by the family of Bcl-2 proteins, and down-stream of mitochondria, by low-probability events, such as apoptosome formation, and by feedback circuits involving caspases and inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), such as XIAP. All these regulatory mechanisms ensure that cells only commit to death once a threshold of damage has been reached and the anti-apoptotic reserve of the cell is overcome. As cancer cells are invariably exposed to strong intracellular and extracellular stress stimuli, they are particularly reliant on the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins. Hence, many cancer cells undergo apoptosis when exposed to agents that inhibit anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 molecules, such as BH3 mimetics, while normal cells remain relatively insensitive to single agent treatments with the same class of molecules. Targeting different proteins within the apoptotic network with combinatorial treatment approaches often achieves even greater specificity. This led us to investigate the sensitivity of leukemia and lymphoma cells to a pro-apoptotic action of a BH3 mimetic combined with a small molecule inhibitor of XIAP. Using the computational probabilistic model of the apoptotic pathway, verified by experimental results from human leukemia and lymphoma cell lines, we show that inhibition of XIAP has a non-linear effect on sensitization towards apoptosis induced by the BH3 mimetic HA14-1. This study justifies further ex vivo and animal studies on the potential of the treatment of leukemia and lymphoma with a combination of BH3 mimetics and XIAP inhibitors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The outcome of those distinct groups can be explained by different underlying disease biology. In clinical practice, patients are stratified into risk groups based on prognostic models, most commonly the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS). In higher-risk disease, the standard of care is hypomethylating agents to extend survival and suppress leukemia potential, and consideration of allogeneic stem cell transplantation, which remains the only curative option. Patients classified as having lower-risk disease begin treatment with management focused on ameliorating hematologic deficits, related symptoms, or both. This review of lower-risk MDS highlights the biology of the disease and models for risk stratification.

In solid tumors, however, PTPN11 mutations occur at low frequencies while the wildtype Shp2 is activated by protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) in cancer cells and mediates PTK signaling. Therefore, it is important to address whether the wildtype Shp2 plays a functional role critical for tumor growth. Using shRNAs and a PTP-inactive mutant to inhibit Shp2, we find here that tumor growth of DU145 prostate cancer and H292 lung cancer cells depends on Shp2. Suppression of Shp2 inhibited cell proliferation, decreased c-Myc and increased p27 expression in cell cultures. In H292 tumor tissues, c-Myc-positive cells coincided with Ki67-positive cells and smaller tumors from Shp2 knockdown cells had less c-Myc-positive cells and more nuclear p27. Shp2-regulated c-Myc expression was mediated by Src and Erk1/2. Down-regulation of c-Myc reduced cell proliferation while up-regulation of c-Myc in Shp2 knockdown H292 cells partially rescued the inhibitory effect of Shp2 suppression on cell proliferation. Tyrosine phosphoproteomic analysis of H292 tumor tissues showed that Shp2 could both up- and down-regulate tyrosine phosphorylation on cellular proteins. Among other changes, Shp2 inhibition increased phosphorylation of Src Tyr-530 and Cdk1 Thr-14/Tyr-15 and decreased phosphorylation of Erk1 and Erk2 activating sites in the tumors. Significantly, we found that Shp2 positively regulated Gab1 Tyr-627/Tyr-659 phosphorylation. This finding reveals that Shp2 can auto-regulate its own activating signal. Shp2 Tyr-62/Tyr-63 phosphorylation was observed in tumor tissues, indicating that Shp2 is activated in the tumors.",,['NIHMS256110'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our laboratory has previously identified the RalGDS-related (Rgr) oncogene in a DMBA (7,12-dimethylbenz[alpha]anthracene)-induced rabbit squamous cell carcinoma and its human orthologue, hRgr. In this study, we analyzed the expression levels of the human hRgr transcript in a panel of human hematopoietic malignancies and found that a truncated form (diseased-truncated (Dtr-hrgr)) was significantly overexpressed in many T-cell-derived neoplasms. Although the Rgr proto-oncogene belongs to the RalGDS family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), we show that upon the introduction of hRgr into fibroblast cell lines, it is able to elicit the activation of both Ral and Ras GTPases. Moreover, in vitro guanine nucleotide exchange assays confirm that hRgr promotes Ral and Ras activation through GDP dissociation, which is a critical characteristic of GEF proteins. hRgr has guanine nucleotide exchange activity for both small GTPases and this activity was reduced when a point mutation within the catalytic domain (CDC25) of the protein, (cd) Dtr-hRgr, was utilized. These observations prompted the analysis of the biological effects of hRgr and (cd) hRgr expression in cultured cells. Here, we show that hRgr increases proliferation in low serum, increases invasion, reduces anchorage dependence and promotes the progression into the S phase of the cell cycle; properties that are abolished or severely reduced in the presence of the catalytic dead mutant. We conclude that the ability of hRgr to activate both Ral and Ras is responsible for its transformation-inducing phenotype and it could be an important contributor in the development of some T-cell malignancies.",,['NIHMS274064'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2011 Mar 28.,,,PMC4001980,"AIM: To examine the effects of triptolide (TPL) on T-cell leukemia cells and identify their underlying mechanisms. METHODS: The cytotoxicity of TPL was assessed by MTT assay. Cell apoptosis was determined using annexin V and DAPI staining and analyzed by flow cytometry or fluorescence microscopy. The activation of caspase pathways and the expression of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65 were examined by Western blotting. Differences in microRNA (miRNA) expression in Molt-4 and Jurkat cells before and after TPL treatment were identified using microarrays and real-time RT-PCR, respectively. RESULTS: TPL 20-160 nmol/L treatment potently inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in T-cell lymphocytic leukemia cell lines. Molt-4 and Jurkat cells, however, were more sensitive to TPL than L428 and Raji cells. After 24 h of treatment, bortezomib abrogated the growth of Molt-4 and Jurkat cells with an IC(50) of 15.25 and 24.68 nmol/L, respectively. Using Molt-4 cells, we demonstrated that treatment 20-80 nmol/L inhibited the translocation of NF-kappaB p65 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and that phosphorylated NF-kappaB p65 in nuclear extracts was down-regulated in a dose-dependent manner. Similar results were also seen in Jurkat cells but not in L428 cells, as these cells are resistant to TPL and bortezomib (a NF-kappaB inhibitor). Twenty-three miRNAs were differentially expressed after TPL treatment. Functional analysis revealed that TPL treatment could inhibit expression of miR-16-1* and that transfection of miR-16-1* led to significantly decreased apoptosis induced by TPL. CONCLUSION: Our in vitro studies suggest that TPL might be an effective therapeutic agent for treatment of T-cell lymphocytic leukemia and that its cytotoxic effects could be associated with inhibition of NF-kappaB and down-regulation of miR-16-1*.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report that activation of a humanized Npm1c knock-in allele in mouse hemopoietic stem cells causes Hox gene overexpression, enhanced self renewal and expanded myelopoiesis. One third of mice developed delayed-onset AML, suggesting a requirement for cooperating mutations. We identified such mutations using a Sleeping Beauty transposon, which caused rapid-onset AML in 80% of mice with Npm1c, associated with mutually exclusive integrations in Csf2, Flt3 or Rasgrp1 in 55 of 70 leukemias.

It is important to recognize this diagnostic challenge as it may be the initial manifestation of leukemia or of relapse. METHODS: A retrospective search of patient files from 2 teaching hospitals identified 4 adult patients who presented with large joint arthritis and concurrent or subsequent leukemic synovitis. All patients presented with inflammatory arthritis of large joints, and leukemic synovitis was identified by the presence of leukemic cells in the synovial fluid or infiltrating the synovial membrane seen at biopsy. RESULTS: A leukemia of monocytic origin-acute myelomonocytic leukemia or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia-was diagnosed in all 4 patients. In 2 cases, leukemic synovitis was the initial manifestation of leukemia. In the third case, it was the first sign of relapse, and in the remaining case, it developed shortly after diagnosis of leukemia. All patients had either osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. One patient was diagnosed simultaneously with osteoarthritis and leukemia. The remaining patients had a prior history of arthritis. CONCLUSIONS: Adult leukemic synovitis occurs in association with leukemias of monocytic differentiation. Data presented here, and review of isolated case reports, support this association. The finding of large joint arthritis as a comorbidity in these 4 cases raises questions about the role of antecedent arthritis as a predisposing factor in the pathophysiology of leukemic synovitis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the immunological status and the activity of certain enzymes in blood lymphocytes in adult patients of ALL at different stages. METHODS: ALL patients (n=71) admitted during 2000-2005 were included in this study. All patients had decreased T-lymphocytes content. At first attack, they had CD4 + -cells decreasing and increasing IgM and IgG concentration. In complete remission all examined parameters were low. The peculiarities of ALL recurrence were high NK-cells content and disbalances of the main immunoglobulin concentrations. RESULTS: In the first attack and recurrence the anaerobe glucose oxidation intensity and the reactions of macromolecular synthesis were lower in lymphocytes compared to control. In remission all these processes restored to normal. In all stages in lymphocytes GR had decreased activity. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that most of changes in immune status of ALL patients were in a stage of complete remission when patients arrived on its maintenance through the small period from spent before therapy when the immune system of the patient has not been restored. Thus, probably cytostatic action causes immune failure in the future and starts disease again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The investigations involved 22 patients with AML undergoing chemotherapy with daunorubicin, cytosine arabinoside, etoposide and mitoxantrone. The oxidation phenotype prior to therapy and after termination of induction was examined in all 22 patients and was examined in 10 patients after termination of the first consolidation cycle. The acetylation phenotype was examined prior to therapy and after termination of induction in 21 patients and after termination of the first remission consolidation cycle in 9 patients. The oxidation phenotype was determined by means of the method by Eichelbaum and Gross. The acetylation phenotype was determined using Varley's modification of the Bratton-Marshall method. Anticancer therapy affected the oxidation phenotype, causing decreased activity of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2D6. This decrease suggests that daunorubicin, cytosine arabinoside, etoposide and mitoxantrone may impair the metabolism of other active substances metabolized by this isoenzyme, which should be taken into consideration in planning the dosage scheme in individual patients and considering interactions between drugs.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the frequency of EBV DNA levels before and after transplantation among saliva samples of Iranian kidney transplant patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 40 kidney transplant recipients and their healthy donors, we evaluated the EBV DNA levels in saliva samples by quantitative polymerase chain reaction method using samples obtained 1 hour before transplantation surgery. In addition, 3 months after transplantation we evaluated EBV DNA levels in recipients for comparison with preoperative levels. Exclusion criteria included hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human T-cell leukemia virus infections before transplantation as well as HIV-positive patients under highly active antiretroviral therapy, graft rejection requiring dialysis and active viral infection of oral cavity. RESULTS: Before renal transplantation, there was no significant difference in saliva EBV DNA levels between kidney donor and recipient patients (P=.8). The levels increased significantly to 67.6% in the recipient group after transplantation (P=.01). CONCLUSION: We observed that EBV was more frequently present in the oral mucosa after renal transplantation. Thus, we can follow these patients for EBV infection using saliva examinations as a simple screening method.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Between the years of 1984 and 2007, 7933 transplantations were performed. The number of HSCTs per year has continued to increase, with a plateau in allogeneic HSCT (allo-HSCT) between 2005 and 2007. Overall, a greater proportion of transplantations were allo-HSCT (n = 5761, 77%) compared with autologous HSCT (ASCT) (n = 2172, 23%). Of 5761 allo-HSCT, acute leukemia constituted the main indication (n = 2124, 37%). There was a significant proportion of allo-HSCT for bone marrow failures (n = 1001, 17%) and hemoglobinopathies (n = 885, 15%). The rate of unrelated donor transplantations remained low, with only 2 matched unrelated donor allo-HSCTs reported. One hundred umbilical cord blood transplantations were reported (0.017% of allo-HSCT). Peripheral blood stem cells were the main source of graft in allo-HSCT, and peripheral blood stem cells increasingly constitute the main source of hematopoietic stem cells overall. Reduced-intensity conditioning was utilized in 5.7% of allografts over the surveyed period. ASCT numbers continue to increase. There has been a shift in the indication for ASCT from acute leukemia to lymphoproliferative disorders (45%), followed by myeloma (26%). The survey reflects transplantation activity according to the unique health settings of this region. Notable differences in transplantation practices as reported to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation over recent years are highlighted.","['Copyright (c) 2011 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

As a co-receptor for plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), which are key factors in plasmin generation, the annexin A2 (A2) complex promotes vascular fibrinolysis. The intracellular A2 complex is a heterotetramer of two A2 monomers and two copies of the associated protein, p11. In response to endothelial cell activation, A2 is phosphorylated by src-kinase, and translocated to the cell surface in a highly regulated manner. Over-expression of A2 is seen in acute promyelocytic leukemia during the early hemorrhagic phase, while high titer antibodies to A2, as in antiphospholipid syndrome or cerebral venous thrombosis, are associated with thrombosis. In experimental hyperhomocysteinemia, moreover, derivatization of A2 by homocysteine leads to intravascular fibrin accumulation and dysangiogenesis, features that phenocopy the Anxa2(-/-) mouse. Exogenous A2 may also offer a novel therapeutic approach to ischemic thrombotic stroke, as administration of A2 in conjunction with conventional tPA-based thrombolytic therapy improved outcome in an animal model.

KEY FINDINGS: Cl(-)-dependent K(+) efflux was strongly stimulated by hypo-osmotic challenge and this increased K(+) efflux was mediated by the DIOA- and Ba(2+)-sensitive KCl cotransport. RO 31-8220, calphostin C, genistein, PP2, AG18, AG1478, wortmannin, LY294002 and PD98059 were shown to significantly inhibit or stimulate the activity of this pathway. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that the hypo-osmotically-activated KCl cotransport is an important regulator of K562 cell volume, and the activity of this pathway is modulated by PKC, PTK, PI 3-kinase and/or MAP kinases.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Since three years, this patient had a history of CLL with plasmocytic differentiation and was left untreated owing to stade A Binet classification. After chemotherapy, the lymphocytosis and the adenopathies disappear and the renal function improve. Infiltration of the kidneys by non-Hodgkin small B-cell lymphoma, including chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), is usually asymptomatic, fortuitously discovered at the time of an X-ray examination or at autopsy. Association with renal failure is extremely rare. We review the reported cases of renal failure associated with lymphomatous infiltration (13 cases of CLL and five cases of lymphoplasmocytic lymphoma kappa or lambda IgM), with the following conclusions: in most cases, renal insufficiency appears in a few months and significantly disappears after chemotherapy; the renal infiltrate is usually focal in lymphoplasmocytic lymphoma and rather massive and diffuse in CLL; the neoplastic feature of a small B-cell lymphoid infiltrate may be difficult to determine: a poorly limited, monomorphous, CD20+ CD5+ lymphoid infiltrate is lymphomatous. In case of plasmocytic differentiation, it must be looked for kappa or lambda monotypy; the type of the lymphomatous infiltrate according to the WHO 2008 classification may be difficult to determine in a small sampling of renal tissue: the renal infiltrate must be compared, if possible, with a lymph node infiltrate. Owing to its bad prognosis, mantle cell lymphoma must be distinguished from other small B-cell lymphoma like CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma and lymphoplasmocytic lymphoma.","['Copyright A(c) 2011 Association Societe de nephrologie.

The viral Tax protein is a key factor in HTLV-1 pathogenicity. A major part of Tax oncogenic potential is accounted for by its capacity of inducing the transcriptional activity of the NFkappaB factors, which regulate the expression of numerous cellular genes. Propolis (PE), a natural product produced by honeybees, has been used for a long time in folk medicine. One of PE active components, caffeic acid phenylethyl ester (CAPE), was well characterized and found to be a potent inhibitor of NFkappaB activation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to pursue the possibility of blocking Tax oncogenic effects by treatment with these natural products. Human T-cell lines were used in this study since these cells are the main targets of HTLV-1 infections. We tried to determine which step of Tax-induced NFkappaB activation is blocked by these products. Our results showed that both tested products substantially inhibited the activation of NFkappaB-dependent promoter by Tax. However, only PE could efficiently inhibit also the Tax-induced activation of SRF- and CREB-dependent promoters. Our results showed also that PE and CAPE strongly prevented both Tax binding to IkappaBalpha and its induced degradation by Tax. However, both products did not interfere in the nuclear transport of Tax or NFkappaB proteins.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fluorophore was also coupled to unspecific rabbit-IgG antibody or corresponding Fab fragments. Expression of CysLT1R in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells in vitro could be proven by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real-time PCR, and flow cytometry. Detection of the probes by flow cytometry showed that CysLT1R*DY-734 probe binds distinctly stronger to HL-60 cells than IgG*DY-734. Induction of ear edema in mice was conducted to test signaling of the synthesized probes in vivo. A markedly higher fluorescence intensity was observed in the edematous region than in the healthy region by a whole-body imaging system. Semiquantitative analysis showed that CysLT1R*DY-734 and Fab-CysLT1R*DY-734 probes bind 1.9- and 1.2-fold stronger, respectively, than the unspecific probes.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We compared prospectively FCM versus cytology/histology analysis of FNA samples for the diagnostic screening and further World Health Organization (WHO) subclassification of B-NHL. FCM and cytology showed a high degree of agreement (93%); however, diagnosis of reactive processes (RP), B-NHL and T-NHL by FCM showed higher sensitivity than cytology (92-100% versus 64-94%, respectively), without false positive NHL cases. The antibody combination used did not allow a positive diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma as distinct from a RP. A high concordance rate was found between FCM and histopathology (74%) in subtyping B-NHL. In this regard, mantle-cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma showed the highest degree of agreement (100% concordant rates). In turn, FCM showed higher sensitivity/specificity in classifying follicular lymphoma (FL) and large B cell lymphomas, while the opposite occurred for marginal-zone and lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas. CONCLUSIONS: FCM enhances the diagnostic ability of FNA cytology, playing a crucial role in a rapid and accurate differential diagnosis between RP, B-NHL and T-NHL. In addition, immunophenotyping of FNA samples contributes to a more precise subclassification of B-NHL when combined with histopathology and genetic/molecular data.",['(c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Limited.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Surface receptors expressed on HCL cells and respective stromal ligands are critical for this cross-talk between HCL cells and the microenvironment. Chemokine receptors, adhesion molecules (integrins, CD44), the B cell antigen receptor (BCR), and CD40, expressed on the HCL cells, are likely to be critical for homing, retention, survival, and expansion of the neoplastic B cells. Some of these pathways are now targeted in first clinical trials in other mature B-cell malignancies.

Further, in order to establish an acute or long-term persistent infection, C. trachomatis develops several strategies to circumvent host immune responses. Hence, resolution of the C. trachomatis infection may require modulation of host factors especially during persistent or chronic infection. Moreover, azithromycin treatment has been reported to possess anti-inflammatory properties but its mechanism of action is still not elucidated. Therefore, in order to better understand the effect of azithromycin in chronic conditions, our aim was to study changes in expression of key genes associated with inflammatory cytokines and receptors, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, and apoptosis pathway before and after therapy with azithromycin in infertile women with recurrent C. trachomatis infection. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to study inflammatory cytokines and receptors, MAPK signaling pathway, and apoptosis pathway before and after therapy with azithromycin in infertile women with recurrent C. trachomatis infection. Further, effect of azithromycin on activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase was studied in epithelial cells by western blotting. Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), CCL5, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1), CXCL5, CXCL9, interleukin-1B (IL-1B), IL-8, baculoviral IAP repeat-containing 3 (BIRC3), myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL1), and MAPK1 were downregualted after azithromycin treatment. In addition, phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase was inhibited after azithromycin treatment in epithelial cells obtained from women with recurrent infection. Hence, our data suggest that azithromycin with its properties apart from antibacterial activity may contribute to its therapeutic potential in treatment of chronic recurrent infection in infertile women.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2011 Mar 26.,,,,"INTRODUCTION: The B-cell receptor (BCR) delivers antigen-dependent and -independent signals that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several common B-cell malignancies. Agents that can efficiently block BCR signaling have recently been developed and are currently being evaluated as novel targeted therapies. Among these, agents that inhibit the Syk kinase appear particularly promising in preclinical and early clinical studies. AREAS COVERED: The manuscript provides an overview of recent findings that implicate Syk and the BCR signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of several common lymphoid malignancies. It outlines preclinical and early clinical experiences with the Syk inhibitor fostamatinib disodium (R788) and discusses various options for further clinical development of this compound. EXPERT OPINION: Inhibitors of Syk or other components of the BCR signaling pathway are emerging as an exciting novel class of agents for the treatment of common B-cell malignancies. Future efforts should focus on defining the disease entities that are most likely to benefit from these agents, although considerable evidence is already available to pursue such studies in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Combinations with chemo-immunotherapy, treatment of early-stage disease and consolidation therapy should all be explored and could lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches with improved efficacy, tolerability and toxicity profiles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this context, considerable attention is paid to Asian populations who consume high amounts of soy and soy-derived isoflavones, and have a lower risk for several cancer types such as breast and prostate cancers than populations in Western countries. Hence, interest focuses on soyfoods, soy products, and soy ingredients such as isoflavones with regard to their possible beneficial effects that were observed in numerous experiments and studies. The outcomes of the studies are not always conclusive, are often contradictory depending on the experimental conditions, and are, therefore, difficult to interpret. Isoflavone research revealed not only beneficial but also adverse effects, for instance, on the reproductive system. This is also the case with tumor-promoting effects on, for example, breast tissue. Isoflavone extracts and supplements are often used for the treatment of menopausal symptoms and for the prevention of age-associated conditions such as cardiovascular diseases and osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. In relation to this, questions about the effectiveness and safety of isoflavones have to be clarified. Moreover, there are concerns about the maternal consumption of isoflavones due to the development of leukemia in infants. In contrast, men may benefit from the intake of isoflavones with regard to reducing the risk of prostate cancer. Therefore, this review examines the risks but also the benefits of isoflavones with regard to various kinds of cancer, which can be derived from animal and human studies as well as from in vitro experiments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lymphocytic leukemia cells (MOLT4) were used as an experimental model, and the results were compared to those for normal cell types. The results show that cancer and normal cells were mostly unable to repair all DSBs before the next radiation dose induced new DNA damage. Accumulation of DSBs was observed in normal human fibroblasts and healthy lymphocytes irradiated in vitro after the second radiation dose. The lymphocytic leukemia cells irradiated with 4 x 1 Gy and a single dose of 4 Gy had very similar survival; however, there was a big difference between human fibroblasts irradiated with 4 x 1.5 Gy and a single dose of 6 Gy. These results suggest that exponentially growing lymphocytic leukemia cells, similar to rapidly proliferating tumors, are not very sensitive to fraction size, in contrast to the more slowly growing fibroblasts and most late-responding (radiation therapy dose-limiting) normal tissues, which have a low proliferation index.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, we demonstrate that air expression is induced in the tumor cell lines by a naturally occurring ROS-inducing compound, phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), a potential dietary cancer chemopreventive agent. Since PEITC inhibits NF-kappaB activation, air induction by this agent is consistent with the suppressive effect of NF-kappaB on air expression. This finding contributes a new clue to the role of NF-kappaB in regulating oxidative stress-induced pro-apoptotic genes and identifies a novel potential tool for enhancing pancreas cancer response to treatment.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MoMuLV-based vectors have the ability to efficiently transfer genes into mammalian cells, leading to permanent integration of a single copy of the gene of interest into the cellular chromosomes. The technique of single-colony inverse [polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to track individual descendants of MoMuLV-vector-transduced hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), by capitalizing upon the unique restriction patterns generated by the random integration events (1-2). Methods to adapt the inverse PCR technology to the use of other vector systems, such as lentiviral or adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, are currently under development. These techniques will be necessary to determine the efficacy of the newer vector systems in transducing individual human HSC that have the capacity to generate both lymphoid and myeloid progeny, as has been demonstrated in rare occurrences using MoMuLV-based vectors (2).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

T1D cases showed clustering at birth for ages 0-14 years; for ages 0-4 years at diagnosis, and when the residential history was accounted for. T1D cases clustered near leukemia cases particularly in the age group 2-6 years at diagnosis. Leukemia and T1D in this age group thus may share etiological factors mediated by geographic location. This suggests common environmental risk factors, with exposure to infections as first possible candidate, geographically localized exposure to agents that compromise development and/or response of the immune system being a second, and chance being a third.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Data from the World Health Organization mortality database was analyzed using a joinpoint regression model to identify significant mortality rate changes over time and to estimate annual percent change. RESULTS: Leukemia is ranked first among cancer-related causes of death among children and AYA in Latin America. In children, the global percentage changes indicate increased rates for both sexes in Colombia, Ecuador, and Mexico, with substantially higher rates for Mexico. In AYA, significant increases were observed for both sexes in Mexico; Ecuador saw some increase for both sexes; and Colombia and Uruguay had increases in females only. Downward trends were observed in Argentina for both sexes, and in Costa Rica for males only. There were no major changes in the other countries analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: Leukemia mortality rates among AYA are declining, but show less significant decreases than rates among children. The study results point to a global need for further advances, specifically for AYA, similar to those made by childhood leukemia therapeutic protocols. Also, specialized oncological centers exist in most countries of Latin America, but they are often inaccessible. Special attention should be given to Mexico due to the significant increase in mortality rates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we integrated computational and experimental methods to unravel the response of a lineage uncommitted precursor cell-line, HL-60, to Retinoic Acid (RA). HL-60 is a human myeloblastic leukemia cell-line used extensively to study human differentiation programs. Initially, we focused on the role of the BLR1 receptor in RA-induced differentiation and G1/0-arrest in HL-60. BLR1, a putative G protein-coupled receptor expressed following RA exposure, is required for RA-induced cell-cycle arrest and differentiation and causes persistent MAPK signaling. A mathematical model of RA-induced cell-cycle arrest and differentiation was formulated and tested against BLR1 wild-type (wt) knock-out and knock-in HL-60 cell-lines with and without RA. The current model described the dynamics of 729 proteins and protein complexes interconnected by 1356 interactions. An ensemble strategy was used to compensate for uncertain model parameters. The ensemble of HL-60 models recapitulated the positive feedback between BLR1 and MAPK signaling. The ensemble of models also correctly predicted Rb and p47phox regulation and the correlation between p21-CDK4-cyclin D formation and G1/0-arrest following exposure to RA. Finally, we investigated the robustness of the HL-60 network architecture to structural perturbations and generated experimentally testable hypotheses for future study.

The differentially expressed genes were grouped according to their reported functions, and correlations were sought with biological differences previously observed between the same groups. The most relevant findings include the following. (i) CML G0 cells are in a more advanced stage of development and more poised to proliferate than normal G0 cells. (ii) When CML G0 cells are stimulated to proliferate, they differentiate and mature more rapidly than normal counterpart. (iii) Whereas normal G0 cells form only granulocyte/monocyte colonies when stimulated by cytokines, CML G0 cells form a combination of the above and erythroid clusters and colonies. (iv) Prominin-1 is the gene most downregulated in CML G0 cells, and this appears to be associated with the spontaneous formation of erythroid colonies by CML progenitors without EPO.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2011 Mar 25.,,,,"It has become apparent that regulation of protein translation is an important determinant in controlling cell growth and leukemic transformation. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is often implicated in sensitivity and resistance to therapy. Dysregulated signaling through the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway is often the result of genetic alterations in critical components in this pathway as well as mutations at upstream growth factor receptors. Furthermore, this pathway is activated by autocrine transformation mechanisms. PTEN is a critical tumor suppressor gene and its dysregulation results in the activation of Akt. PTEN is often mutated, silenced and is often haploinsufficient. The mTOR complex1 (mTORC1) regulates the assembly of the eukaryotic initiation factor4F complex, which is critical for the translation of mRNAs that are important for cell growth, prevention of apoptosis and transformation. These mRNAs have long 5'-untranslated regions that are G+C rich, rendering them difficult to translate. Elevated mTORC1 activity promotes the translation of these mRNAs via the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1. mTORC1 is a target of rapamycin and novel active-site inhibitors that directly target the TOR kinase activity. Although rapamycin and novel rapalogs are usually cytostatic and not cytotoxic for leukemic cells, novel inhibitors that target the kinase activities of PI3K and mTOR may prove more effective for leukemia therapy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two initial studies examining c-Cbl mutations in AML, one from Germany and one from the US, found vastly different incidences of mutations (0.6% compared to 33%, respectively). Therefore, it was important to determine the incidence and characteristics of c-Cbl mutations in a cohort of Australian AML patients. METHODS: Ninety patients with AML were investigated. The open reading frame between exons 4 and 11 of the c-Cbl gene was analysed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), nested PCR and DNA sequencing. RESULTS: We found four AML samples (4/90; 4.44%) with distinct c-Cbl deletions involving exons 6 to 9. Sample 10 [AML with t(8;21)] showed two deletions [c.870-1007del] and [c.1106-1228del]. Sample 81 (AML with minimal differentiation) showed a large deletion [c.1008-1431del] causing a frameshift and a premature stop codon. Sample 82 (AML without maturation) showed two deletions [c.928-1307del] and [c.1385-1431del] also causing a frameshift and a premature stop codon. Sample 84 (AML with myelodysplasia related changes) showed a large deletion [c.964-1380del].

It is characterized by the t(15;17)(q22;q11.2) chromosomal translocation that creates the promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML-RARA) fusion oncogene. Although this fusion oncogene is known to initiate APL in mice, other cooperating mutations, as yet ill defined, are important for disease pathogenesis. To identify these, we used a mouse model of APL, whereby PML-RARA expressed in myeloid cells leads to a myeloproliferative disease that ultimately evolves into APL. Sequencing of a mouse APL genome revealed 3 somatic, nonsynonymous mutations relevant to APL pathogenesis, of which 1 (Jak1 V657F) was found to be recurrent in other affected mice. This mutation was identical to the JAK1 V658F mutation previously found in human APL and acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples. Further analysis showed that JAK1 V658F cooperated in vivo with PML-RARA, causing a rapidly fatal leukemia in mice. We also discovered a somatic 150-kb deletion involving the lysine (K)-specific demethylase 6A (Kdm6a, also known as Utx) gene, in the mouse APL genome. Similar deletions were observed in 3 out of 14 additional mouse APL samples and 1 out of 150 human AML samples. In conclusion, whole genome sequencing of mouse cancer genomes can provide an unbiased and comprehensive approach for discovering functionally relevant mutations that are also present in human leukemias.",,,,,,,,['J Clin Invest. 2011 Apr;121(4):1255-8.

In this issue of the JCI, Wartman and colleagues use an innovative approach to find other relevant mutations in APL. They performed whole genome sequencing and copy number analysis of a well-characterized APL mouse model to uncover somatic mutations in Jak1 and lysine (K)-specific demethylase 6A (Kdm6a, also known as Utx) in mice with APL and validated the ability of Jak1 mutations to cooperate with PML-RARA in APL.

We previously linked SXR with immunity and inflammation by showing that SXR antagonizes the activity of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB in vitro and in vivo. SXR(-/-) mice demonstrate aberrantly high NF-kappaB activity and overexpression of NF-kappaB target genes. Here we show that SXR(-/-) mice develop B cell lymphoma in an age-dependent manner. SXR(-/-) mice develop multiple hyperplastic lymphoid foci composed of B-1a cells in the intestine, spleen, lymph nodes, peritoneal cavity, and blood. In all circumstances, these lymphocytes possess cell surface and molecular characteristics of either chronic lymphocytic leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma originating from B-1 lymphocytes. These results demonstrate a novel and unsuspected role for SXR signaling in the B-1 cell compartment, establish SXR as a tumor suppressor in B-1 cells, and may provide a link between metabolism of xenobiotic compounds and lymphomagenesis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have pursued a strategy to deimmunize recombinant immunotoxins by identifying and removing B-cell epitopes. We previously reported that we could eliminate most B-cell epitopes using a combination of point mutations and deletions. Here we show the location and amino acid composition of all of the B-cell epitopes in the remaining 25-kDa portion of Pseudomonas exotoxin. Using this information, we eliminated these epitopes to produce an immunotoxin (HA22-LR-8M) that is fully cytotoxic against malignant B-cell lines, has high cytotoxic activity against cells directly isolated from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and has excellent antitumor activity in mice. HA22-LR-8M does not induce antibody formation in mice when given repeatedly by intravenous injection and does not induce a secondary antibody response when given to mice previously exposed to HA22. HA22-LR-8M also has greatly reduced antigenicity when exposed to sera from patients who have produced antibodies to HA22.

Out of 619 articles scrutinized, 15 met eligibility criteria and no study was published before 1995. Six dealt mainly with interferon-based therapies, 7 with bone marrow transplantation and only 2 evaluated PROs in the context of TT. No disease-specific, validated PRO instrument for these patients was found. The main evidence being that Imatinib provides clear advantage in terms of HRQOL over interferon-based treatments. There is lack of data concerning PROs in patients treated with current TT.

Epub 2011 Feb 21.,,,,"BACKGROUND: Neutropenic colitis (NC) or typhlitis has an incidence of approximately 5% in patients receiving chemotherapy for malignancy. The precise cause is unknown, but almost all patients are neutropenic; most profoundly so. We reviewed our experience with neutropenic colitis over the past 10 y to assess the incidence, management, and outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hospital records were reviewed after obtaining IRB approval (# 10-10-184E). There were 1224 children treated for cancer at our institution over the study interval. Neutropenic colitis was strictly defined as the presence of both clinical and radiographic findings consistent with the diagnosis, since there are no definitive diagnostic criteria. Patients with confirmed appendicitis were excluded. Medical management consisted of bowel rest and/or decompression, broad-spectrum IV antibiotics and anti-fungal coverage, and serial clinical exams and radiographic studies. Clinical deterioration and free air were the primary indications for surgery. Demographic factors, signs, symptoms, clinical presentation, underlying disease process, white blood cell count (WBC), and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) prior to the onset of the disease, treatment, and outcome were analyzed. RESULTS: Neutropenic colitis was confirmed in 17 children (1.4% incidence). Three patients had more than one episode. Leukemia was the most common underlying diagnosis (53%). There was no gender predominance, and the mean age at diagnosis was 8.4 y. Mean WBC and ANC at onset were 670 and 164, respectively. A sharp decline in the ANC usually immediately preceded the onset of NC; 2/17 (12%) underwent operation, but both patients had only pneumatosis at exploration. Overall survival was 9/17 (53%), but no deaths were directly attributable to the colitis. CONCLUSION: Neutropenic colitis is an uncommon occurrence in children with neoplasia (1.4% in the current study). Leukemia is the most common cause. A precipitous decline in ANC usually occurs prior to the onset of NC. Most patients do not require operation and the overall mortality directly attributable to NC is low.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SDS, due to bi-allelic mutations of the SBDS gene, is a multi-system disorder that also includes bony abnormalities, and pancreatic and neurocognitive dysfunction. SBDS associates with the 60S subunit in human cells and has a role in subunit joining and translational activation in yeast models. In contrast, 5q- syndrome is associated with acquired haplo-insufficiency of RPS14, a component of the small 40S subunit. RPS14 is critical for 40S assembly in yeast models, and depletion of RPS14 in human CD34(+) cells is sufficient to recapitulate the 5q- erythroid defect. Both SDS and the 5q- syndrome represent important models of ribosome function and may inform future treatment strategies for the ribosomopathies.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: SF was collected from the knees of 45 OA, 22 RA patients and 20 asymptomatic organ donors. Eight biomarkers were selected and analyzed by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay: interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-11; leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF); cartilage oligomeric protein (COMP); osteocalcin; and osteogenic protein 1 (OP-1). Data are expressed as medians (interquartile ranges). The effects of sex and disease activity were assessed on the basis of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities index score for patients with OA and on the basis of white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level for patients with RA. RESULTS: The mean ages (+/- SD) of the patients were as follows: 53 +/- 9 years for patients with OA, 54 +/- 11 years for patients with RA and 52 +/- 7 years for asymptomatic organ donors. No effect of participants' sex was identified. In the SF of patients with RA, four of five cytokines were higher than those in the SF of patients with OA and those of asymptomatic organ donors. The most significant differences were found for IL-6 and IL-8, where IL-6 concentration in SF of patients with RA was almost threefold higher than that in patients with OA and fourfold higher than that in asymptomatic donor controls: 354.7 pg/ml (1,851.6) vs. 119.4 pg/ml (193.2) vs. 86.97 pg/ml (82.0) (P < 0.05 and P < 0.05, respectively). IL-8 concentrations were higher in SF of patients with RA than that in patients with OA as well as that in asymptomatic donor controls: 583.6 pg/ml (1,086.4) vs. 429 pg/ml (87.3) vs. 451 pg/ml (170.1) (P < 0.05 and P < 0.05, respectively). No differences were found for IL-11 in the SF of patients with RA and that of patients with OA, while a 1.4-fold difference was detected in the SF of patients with OA and that of asymptomatic donor controls: 296.2 pg/ml (257.2) vs. 211.6 pg/ml (40.8) (P < 0.05). IL-1 concentrations were the highest in the SF of RA patients (9.26 pg/ml (11.1)); in the SF of asymptomatic donors, it was significantly higher than that in patients with OA (9.083 pg/ml (1.6) vs. 7.76 pg/ml (2.6); P < 0.05). Conversely, asymptomatic donor control samples had the highest LIF concentrations: 228.5 pg/ml (131.6) vs. 128.4 pg/ml (222.7) in the SF of patients with RA vs. 107.5 pg/ml (136.9) in the SF of patients with OA (P < 0.05). OP-1 concentrations were twofold higher in the SF of patients with RA than those in patients with OA and threefold higher than those in asymptomatic donor control samples (167.1 ng/ml (194.8) vs. 81.79 ng/ml (116.0) vs. 54.49 ng/ml (29.3), respectively; P < 0.05). The differences in COMP and osteocalcin were indistinguishable between the groups, as were the differences between active and inactive OA and RA. CONCLUSIONS: Activation of selected biomarkers corresponds to the mechanisms that drive each disease.

Epub 2011 Mar 23.,,,,"Chromosomal rearrangements involving the ABL1 gene, leading to a BCR-ABL1 fusion gene, have been mainly associated with chronic myeloid leukemia and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). At present, six other genes have been shown to fuse to ABL1. The kinase domain of ABL1 is retained in all chimeric proteins that are also composed of the N-terminal part of the partner protein that often includes a coiled-coil or a helix-loop-helix domain. These latter domains allow oligomerization of the protein that is required for tyrosine kinase activation, cytoskeletal localization, and neoplastic transformation. Fusion genes that have a break in intron 1 or 2 (BCR-ABL1, ETV6-ABL1, ZMIZ1-ABL1, EML1-ABL1, and NUP214-ABL1) have transforming activity, although NUP214-ABL1 requires amplification to be efficient. The NUP214-ABL1 gene is the second most prevalent fusion gene involving ABL1 in malignant hemopathies, with a frequency of 5% in T-cell ALL. Both fusion genes (SFPQ-ABL1 and RCSD1-ABL1) characterized by a break in intron 4 of ABL1 are associated with B-cell ALL, as the chimeric proteins lacked the SH2 domain of ABL1. Screening for ABL1 chimeric genes could be performed in patients with ALL, more particularly in those with T-cell ALL because ABL1 modulates T-cell development and plays a role in cytoskeletal remodeling processes in T cells.",['(c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous clonal disorder of hematopoietic progenitor cells that presents genetic abnormalities in several genes, including NPM. Mutations of the NPM gene occur in 35% of patients with AML with normal karyotype, causing cytoplasmic rather than nuclear localization of the protein. Because the NPM antibody recently became commercially available, we immunostained a series of diagnosed AML samples. We performed NPM immunostaining in 48 AML cases. NPM immunostaining was correlated with phenotypic and cytogenetic data. RESULTS: Reactivity for NPM was exclusively nuclear in 31 cases (64.6%) and nuclear and cytoplasmic in 17 cases (35.4%). The distribution of NPM cytoplasmic staining was more frequently observed in cases with monocytic differentiation and with normal karyotype or with minor cytogenetic abnormalities (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: NPM immunostaining is a feasible test, without problems of interpretation for pathologists, when the sections are optimally prepared and can be considered predictive of peculiar phenotypic and karyotype subtypes of AML, in addition to the well-known prognostic role.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These requirements include incorporation of the genome into particles that are stable outside of cells, recognition of and entry into appropriate host cells, replication of the genome, and the translation of viral messenger RNA to yield new viral proteins. Retroviruses are enveloped RNA viruses, a complex group with several common features. Enveloped RNA viruses contain proteins that carry out five basic functions: (1) condensation of the genome into an RNA-protein complex; (2) packaging of this complex in a protein shell; (3) enclosure of the shell in a lipid membrane, or envelope; (4) modification of the envelope by addition of surface proteins that recognize cellular receptors; and (5) for negative strand viruses and retroviruses, copying of the RNA in the newly infected cell. Many enveloped viruses in fact are more complicated, with two or more proteins sharing each function, and others are simpler, with one protein carrying out two or three functions. The simpler enveloped viruses provide useful paradigms to help understand aspects of retroviral structure. Until the successful crystallization and X-ray diffraction work on spherical viruses in the last decade, structural information was gained largely by fractionation of the components of purified viruses, by electron microscopy, and indirectly by genetic analysis. For the many viruses for which useful crystals have not been obtained, these techniques remain the cornerstone upon which inferences about structure are built. The first direct visualization of retroviruses, by thin-section and negative-stain electron microscopy, predated these first biochemical studies (Bernhard 1958). The first substantially pure preparations of retroviruses became available in the 1960s, for the avian sarcoma/leukosis viruses (ASLVs) and the murine leukemia viruses (MLVs), which were the most widely studied retroviruses until the advent of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The technique of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to separate denatured polypeptides, developed in the late 1960s, became a key tool to characterize the viral proteins. Discovery of viral reverse transcriptase (Baltimore 1970; Temin and Mizutani 1970) and its associated RNase H (Moelling et al. 1971) and elucidation of the mechanism by which the genome is copied (Chapter 4) provided a unifying simplicity to models for replication. Also unifying was the recognition that the internal structural proteins are derived from a precursor polypeptide (Vogt and Eisenman 1973) and that the reverse transcriptase itself, as well as the protease necessary for processing of the precursor, is translated as a precursor also containing the structural proteins (Chapter 7). The much later observation that the virus carries with it the enzyme-catalyzing integration of viral DNA into host chromosomes (Chapter 5) further solidified the view of retroviral structure and replication. Finally, the discoveries that retroviral transformation is genetically separable from replication and that retroviral oncogenes are derived directly from cellular oncogenes (Chapter 10) made it clear that the complexities of oncogenic transformation in many cases had little to do with the virus per se. One might say that this theme of simplicity survived until the discovery of retroviral accessory genes in human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) (Seiki et al. 1983), eventually extended to HIV and other viruses (Chapter 6). Even so, in terms of structural and genetic organization, retroviruses remain among the simpler members of the virus world, and they are likely to be among the more ancient as well (Chapter 8).","['Copyright (c) 1997, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.']",,,,,,,,,,,20110325,,,['Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press'],['Retroviruses'],['2011/03/25 06:00'],['0879695714'],"['Coffin, John M', 'Hughes, Stephen H', 'Varmus, Harold E']","['Coffin JM', 'Hughes SH', 'Varmus HE']",,,,,,,,

The historical importance of retroviruses in the discovery of cancer genes is now widely appreciated, but many of the recent spectacular revelations about the molecular basis of cancer have occurred in other venues-such as human genetics, cell signaling, and developmental biology-rather than virology. Instead, the central goals of retrovirology today are the treatment and the prevention of AIDS and the use of retroviruses as gene delivery devices. These goals have only intensified the need to further dissect viral particles and genomes, understand their modes of replication, and describe host responses to infection. Such efforts have focused on structural properties of viral proteins and their assembly; host receptors for retroviruses and their interactions with envelope proteins; the mechanism of proviral integration; the regulation of viral gene expression; and various aspects of pathogenesis and the immune response to retroviral infection. Not surprisingly, recent efforts to examine these issues have focused largely on the HIVs and the retroviruses most commonly used to create vectors, the murine leukemia viruses (MLVs). It is our contention, and an assumption on which this book is built, that a full understanding of any single retrovirus depends on an appreciation of the common properties of retroviruses as a class, as well as the unique features of each type.","['Copyright (c) 1997, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.']",,,,,,,,,,,20110325,,,['Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press'],['Retroviruses'],['2011/03/25 06:00'],['0879695714'],"['Coffin, John M', 'Hughes, Stephen H', 'Varmus, Harold E']","['Coffin JM', 'Hughes SH', 'Varmus HE']",,,,,,,,

We then incorporate this CA design into a group sequential response-adaptive randomization (RA) scheme.

Despite these guidelines, RAI ablation has been used routinely in all but the very lowest risk patients with thyroid cancer over the last 30 years. The objective of this study was to evaluate patterns of RAI use and elevated risk of secondary primary malignancies (SPM) in patients with low-risk (T1N0) WDTC. METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was used to analyze trends in RAI use over time in the United States. To determine the excess risk of SPM, the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and excess absolute risk (EAR) of various cancers were calculated in the 2 cohorts. Between 1973 and 2007, 37,176 patients with WDTC were followed in the SEER Program, equating to 408,750 person-years at risk (PYR). In total, 14,589 patients received RAI, and SPMs were observed in 3223 patients. RESULTS: During the study period, the rate of RAI use in patients with low-risk (T1N0) WDTC increased from 3.3% to 38.1%. For low-risk patients, the SIR of SPM was 1.21 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.93-1.54), and the EAR was 4.6 excess cases per 10,000 PYR. SPM with significantly elevated risk because of RAI were salivary gland malignancies (SIR = 11.13; 95% CI, 1.35-40.2) and leukemia (SIR = 5.68; 95% CI, 2.09-12.37). The excess risk of leukemia was significantly greater in patients aged <45 years (SIR = 5.32; 95% CI, 2.75-9.30) compared with the excess risk in older patients (SIR = 2.26; 95% CI, 1.43-3.39). CONCLUSIONS: The increased risk of a SPM in patients with low-risk (T1N0) WDTC, along with a lack of data demonstrating improved survival outcomes with adjuvant RAI, provide a compelling argument in favor of rationing the use of RAI in this patient population.",['Copyright (c) 2011 American Cancer Society.'],['NIHMS288055'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we elucidated the mechanisms of its carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicity. METHODS: We examined DNA damage induced by 2-NO(2)-T and its metabolite, 2-nitrosotoluene (2-NO-T), using (32)P-5'-end-labeled DNA. We measured 8-oxo-7, 8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), an indicator of oxidative DNA damage, in calf thymus DNA and cellular DNA in cultured human leukemia (HL-60) cells treated with 2-NO(2)-T and 2-NO-T. 8-Oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) gene expression in HL-60 cells was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We examined estrogenic activity using an E-screen assay and a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor. RESULTS: In experiments with isolated DNA fragments, 2-NO-T induced oxidative DNA damage in the presence of Cu (II) and beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide disodium salt (reduced form) (NADH), while 2-NO(2)-T did not. 2-NO-T significantly increased levels of 8-oxodG in HL-60 cells. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis revealed upregulation of OGG1 gene expression induced by 2-NO-T. An E-screen assay using the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 revealed that 2-NO(2)-T induced estrogen-dependent cell proliferation. In contrast, 2-NO-T decreased the cell number and suppressed 17beta-estradiol-induced cell proliferation. The data obtained with the SPR sensor using estrogen receptor alpha and the estrogen response element supported the results of the E-screen assay. CONCLUSIONS: Oxidative DNA damage caused by 2-NO-T and estrogen-disrupting effects caused by 2-NO(2)-T and 2-NO-T may play a role in the reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity of these entities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The movie described the Woburn case, begun in 1982 and concluded in 1990, one of the most famous cases of trichloroethylene pollution. In a small town near Boston, twelve children died of leukemia, which seemed attributable to trichloroethylene contamination of the drinking water. The victims, however, could not win the case, since evidence that the identified chemicals could cause leukemia and other human illnesses was rather sketchy. There have been many cases of trichloroethylene pollution in industrial nations including Japan, therefore, we reconsidered the missing link. Our conclusion is that the disease occurred not by a direct effect of the chemical hazard on biological macromolecules but by an indirect effect through the physiological system such as signal transduction and transcriptional regulation. In 1984, we reported a marked reduction in the regulatory heme pool by trichloroethylene exposure, however, the biological significance was not well understood. Recently, we found that the DNA binding activity of Bach1, a negative regulator of genes, is controlled by heme, the regulation of which seems to explain how leukemia develops. The heterodimer of Bach1 with MafK recognizes Maf recognition elements (MAREs) competing with the erythroid type positive regulator, a complex of NF-E2 with MafK. Bach1/MafK occupies MAREs under lower heme conditions, whereas MAREs are open to NF-E2/MafK along with increasing heme concentration.

The aim of this study was to investigate the genotoxic effects of exposure to 50-Hz EMFs. and of co-exposure to cisplatin, a mutagen and carcinogen, and 50-Hz EMFs, using an in vivo newborn rat astrocyte micronucleus assay. METHODS: Three day-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were co-exposed to 50-Hz EMFs and 1.25 or 2.5 mg/kg of cisplatin. Brain cells were dissociated into single cells and cultured for 96 hours, then stained with acridine orange and an antibody against glial fibrillary acidic protein. The frequency of micronucleated astrocytes was counted with a fluorescent microscope. RESULTS: The frequency of micronuclei was not increased in rat astrocytes exposed to EMFs alone. However, the frequencies of micronuclei in co-exposure to 2.5 mg/kg cisplatin and EMFs (7.5- and 10-mT) were significantly increased, compared with those in exposure to 2.5 mg/kg cisplatin alone (sham-exposure, 0-mT EMFs) for 72 hours (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Exposure to EMFs alone did not have a genotoxic effect but co-exposure to EMFs increased the genotoxic activity induced by cisplatin.

We investigated the mechanism of DNA damage by environmental chemicals (catechol, propyl gallate and bisphenol-A), homocysteine and UVA radiation using human cultured cell lines and(32)P-labeled DNA fragments. Carcinogenic catechol induced piperidine-labile sites frequently at thymine residues in the presence of Cu(II) and NADH. Furthermore, catechol increased the formation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), a characteristic oxidative DNA lesion, in human leukemia cell line HL-60, but not in HP100, a hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-resistant cell line derived from HL-60. Thus, it is concluded that oxidative DNA damage through generation of H(2)O(2) plays an important role in the carcinogenic process of catechol. In addition, an environmental factor, bisphenol-A, and a dietary factor, propyl, gallate, also induced sequence-specific DNA damage via ROS generation.UVA, as well as UVB, contributes to photoaging. In humans, telomere shortening is believed to be associated with cell senescence. In this study, we investigated the shortening rate of telomeres in human WI-38 fibroblasts exposed to UVA irradiation. The telomere length (as measured by terminal restriction fragment length) in WI-38 fibroblasts irradiated with UVA decreased with increasing the irradiation dose. UVA irradiation with riboflavin caused damage specifically at the GGG sequence in the DNA fragments containing telomere sequence (TTAGGG)(4). We concluded that the GGG-specific damage in telomere sequence induced by UVA irradiation participates in the increase of the telomere shortening rate.In this report, we show our experimental results and discuss the mechanisms of sequence-specific DNA damage in relation to carcinogenesis and aging.",,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"[""8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine"", 'DNA damage', 'aging', 'carcinogenesis', 'reactive oxygen species']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we studied the long-term effects of doxorubicin on the capacity of dendritic cell (DC) precursors to differentiate into a particular DC subset, the Langerhans cells (LC). In order to achieve high telomerase activity as detected in hematological stem cells, precursor cells from the acute-myeloid leukemia (AML)-derived cell line MUTZ3 were stably transduced with human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) to facilitate their growth potential, while preventing growth, and drug-induced senescence, and preserving their unique capacity for cytokine-dependent DC and LC differentiation. The hTERT-MUTZ3 cells were selected with increasing concentrations of the anthracyclin doxorubicin. After 1-2 months of selection with 30-90 nM doxorubicin, the cells completely lost their capacity to differentiate into LC. This inhibition turned out to be reversible, as the cells slowly regained their capacity to differentiate after a 3- to 4-month drug-free period and with this became capable again of priming allogeneic T cells. Of note, the loss and gain of this capacity to differentiate coincided with the loss and gain of a subpopulation within the CD34(+) proliferative compartment with surface expression of the stem cell factor receptor (SCF-R/CD117/c-Kit). These data are in favor of cytostatic drug-free intervals before applying autologous DC-based vaccination protocols, as specific DC precursors may need time to recover from protracted chemotherapy treatment and re-emerge among the circulating CD34(+) hematopoietic stem and precursor cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has become the standard technique for cytogenetic analysis in CLL. However, interphase FISH is not able to provide an overview on the whole karyotype. In order to improve chromosome banding analysis in CLL, specific stimulation techniques have been developed. These either use CD40 ligand or oligonucleotides (e.g., CpG) and IL-2 in combination. With the respective techniques, metaphase cultivation is successful in >90% of CLL cases and aberrant karyotypes can be detected in nearly 90% of CLL cases. This has allowed the detection of new clinically relevant subgroups (e.g., complex aberrant karyotype cases) and a more differentiated picture of distinct cytogenetic subtypes, e.g., cases with a 13q deletion. Efforts should continue to define the value of chromosomal banding in CLL focusing as well on the interaction with already established techniques such as interphase FISH or immunophenotyping.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This rearrangement generates the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene that characterizes leukemic cells in all CML cases. In about 90% of cases, the BCR-ABL1 rearrangement is manifest cytogenetically by the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, a derivative of the reciprocal translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11.2). For the remaining cases, recombination may be more complex, involving BCR, ABL1, and genomic sites on one or more other chromosomal regions, or it may occur cryptically within an apparently normal karyotype. Detection of the Ph and associated t(9;22) translocation is a recognized clinical hallmark for CML diagnosis. The disease has a natural multistep pathogenesis, and during chronic phase CML, the t(9;22) or complex variant is usually the sole abnormality. In 60-80% of cases, additional cytogenetic changes appear and often forecast progression to an accelerated disease phase or a terminal blast crisis. Because new frontline therapies such as imatinib specifically target the abnormal protein product of the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene to eliminate BCR-ABL1 positive cells, there is a new reliance on the cytogenetic evaluation of bone marrow cells at diagnosis, then at regular posttreatment intervals. Combined with other parameters, presence or absence of Ph-positive cells in the bone marrow is a powerful early indicator for clinical risk stratification. Cytogenetic changes detected at any stage during treatment, including in the BCR-ABL1-negative cells, may also provide useful prognostic information. Laboratory methods detailed here extend from initial collection of peripheral blood or bone marrow samples through cell culture with or without synchronization, metaphase or interphase harvest, hypotonic treatment and fixation, slide preparation for G-banding or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and final interpretation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If left untreated, the disease progresses to acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). There are many options for the management of MDS, but the only potentially curative treatment is allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), which is often not an option because of advanced age or comorbidities at diagnosis or lack of a human leukocyte antigen-identical donor. MDS in the elderly should be managed similar to that in young patients, but the fact that many advanced age patients cannot undergo allo-HSCT precludes any chance of cure. Despite the main objective of prolonging overall survival and the time to progression to AML, the key is to improve quality of life for the longest possible time. To achieve these objectives, supportive care is essential. Likewise, immunomodulatory drugs, such as lenalidomide, can reduce transfusion requirements and reverse cytologic and cytogenetic abnormalities in patients with MDS with chromosome 5q deletion. Elderly patients with high-risk MDS can benefit from 5-azacitidine (5-AZA), with efficacy and safety profiles comparable with those found in patients under 75 years of age. In any patient, predictive drug response scores are required in order to ensure more rational use of these medications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This ubiquitously acting free radical scavenger has recently been shown to stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in tumour cells, making them undergo apoptosis, whilst it prevents apoptosis in healthy cells. The mechanisms by which melatonin exerts these dual actions are, however, not yet clearly understood. Thus, the aim of this study was to further investigate how melatonin can enhance oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in a leukaemia cell line. The results show that melatonin increased the apoptotic effects of H(2)O(2) in human myeloid HL-60 cells as assessed by cellular viability, mitochondrial permeability transition induction, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, ROS generation, caspases 3, 8 and 9 activity, phosphatidylserine externalization, and DNA fragmentation techniques. When healthy leucocytes were exposed to H(2)O(2), melatonin increased the viability of the cells. Taken together, the findings indicate that melatonin is a potential physiological tool capable of protecting healthy cells from chemotherapy-induced ROS production as well as inducing tumour cell death. Because cancer cells manifest increased oxidative stress as a result of their elevated metabolism, the use of melatonin may be useful in impairing their ROS buffering capacity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the apoptotic phenotype of dying AML cells has been less extensively characterized. Even though specific antileukemic immune reactivity is important in AML, especially for allotransplanted patients, it has not been investigated whether dying primary human AML cells show phenotypic characteristics consistent with immunogenic apoptosis [calreticulin exposure, heat shock protein (HSP) release]. We therefore investigated whether in vitro cultured primary human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells show calreticulin exposure and HSP70/HSP90 release during spontaneous (stress-induced) apoptosis when cultured in medium alone and when cultured in the presence of antileukemic drugs. Both surface exposure of calreticulin and release of HSP70 and HSP90 was detected but showed a wide variation between patients. This variation was also maintained when the AML cells were cultured in the presence of cytotoxic drugs (cytarabine, daunorubicin, mitomycin), all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and valproic acid. Finally, AML cells collected during in vivo ATRA therapy showed increased calreticulin exposure during spontaneous in vitro apoptosis, suggesting that in vivo pharmacotherapy can modulate the apoptotic phenotype. To conclude, apoptotic AML cells can show phenotypic characteristics consistent with immunogenic apoptosis, but there is a wide variation between patients and the level of calreticulin exposure/HSP release seems to depend on individual patient characteristics rather than the apoptosis-inducing agent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the fact that survivin is overexpressed in almost all human malignancies, its expression is undetectable in most normal adult tissues, which is what makes it a potential target for anticancer interventions. The aim of this work was to investigate whether survivin is involved in resistance to idarubicin (ida), a drug commonly used in leukemia treatment. Cytotoxic assays using MTT showed that 1 microM of ida could inhibit 50% of cell viability in K562, a chronic myeloid leukemia cell line. Western blotting analysis revealed that survivin expression was increased in the cell line after treatment with ida 0.5 and 1 microM concentrations, protecting cells from ida-induced apoptosis. However, the highest ida concentrations tested were able to inhibit survivin levels and induce apoptosis in K562 cells, as evaluated by morphology and caspase-3 and -9 activation. These results indicate that survivin expression is involved in ida resistance in K562 leukemic cells. Flow cytometry analysis of the cell cycle showed that ida induced G2/M arrest in these cells and there was a statistically significant positive correlation between survivin expression and the percentage of cells in G2/M phase. This work supports the idea that survivin may contribute to an apoptosis-resistant phenotype by inhibiting ida-induced apoptosis and preventing cells from progressing in the cell cycle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Macrophages (iPS-MP) with activity of zymosan phagocytosis and C5a-induced chemotaxis were also generated from iPS cells. Genetically modified iPS-MPs were generated by the introduction of expression vectors into undifferentiated iPS cells, isolation of transfectant iPS cell clone and subsequent differentiation. By this procedure, we generated iPS-MP expressing a membrane-bound form of single chain antibody (scFv) specific to amyloid beta (Abeta), the causal protein of Alzheimer's disease. The scFv-transfectant iPS-MP exhibited efficient Abeta-specific phagocytosis activity. iPS-MP expressing CD20-specific scFv engulfed and killed BALL-1 B-cell leukemia cells.

However, there is increased evidence that certain chemotherapy regimens can cause dose-dependent permanent alopecia. The histological features of this type of alopecia and the mechanisms of its origin are not known yet. We discuss the histological features of 10 cases of permanent alopecia after systematic chemotherapy with taxanes (docetaxel) for breast cancer (6 patients), busulfan for acute myelogenous leukemia (3 patients), and cisplatin and etoposide for lung cancer (1 patient). All patients had moderate to very severe hair thinning, which in 4 cases was more accentuated on androgen-dependent scalp regions. Patients complained that scalp hair did not grow longer than 10 cm and showed altered texture. Paired scalp biopsies from the affected scalp areas were obtained and evaluated in serial horizontal and vertical sections. The histology of all specimens was characterized by a nonscarring pattern with a preserved number of follicular units and lack of fibrosis. The hair count revealed decreased number of terminal hairs, increased telogen hairs, and increased miniaturized vellus-like hairs with a terminal to vellus and anagen to telogen ratios of 1:1 and 3.6:1, respectively. There was increased number of fibrous streamers (stelae) in both reticular dermis and subcutis. Arao-Perkins bodies were found in the subcutaneous portions of the streamers. The histological findings of permanent alopecia after chemotherapy are those of a nonscarring alopecia similar to androgenetic alopecia. Dermatopathologists should be aware of this condition as the absence of fibrosis and the presence of miniaturized hairs may be considered as features consistent with a diagnosis of androgenetic alopecia. Hence, these cases could easily be misdiagnosed in the absence of a good clinicopathological correlation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given this diversity, the full spectrum of Us3 function may not yet be recognized. We noted, in transiently transfected cells, that herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) Us3 disrupted promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies (PML-NBs). However, PML-NB disruption was not observed in cells expressing catalytically inactive HSV-2 Us3. Analysis of PML-NBs in Vero cells transfected with pseudorabies virus (PRV) Us3 and those in Vero cells infected with Us3-null or -repaired PRV strains indicated that PRV Us3 expression also leads to the disruption of PML-NBs. While loss of PML-NBs in response to Us3 expression was prevented by the proteasome inhibitor MG132, Us3-mediated degradation of PML was not observed in infected cells or in transfected cells expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged PML isoform IV. These findings demonstrate that Us3 orthologues derived from distantly related alphaherpesviruses cause a disruption of PML-NBs in a kinase- and proteasome-dependent manner but, unlike the alphaherpesvirus ICP0 orthologues, do not target PML for degradation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The changes of cell phenotype and cytokines secretion of CIK were determined. K562/ADR cells were divided into three groups: ADR in combination CIK (group I), CIK alone (group II) and ADR alone (group III). The viability and proliferation of K562/ADR cells were assayed by MTT assay, the intracellular concentration of ADR and the expression of P-glycoproteins (P-gp) in K562/ADR cells by FCM. RESULTS: The cytotoxicity of ADR in group I was higher than that in group II (P < 0.05). The cytotoxicity was increased with the E/T ratio increasing (P < 0.05) but had no relation with the concentration of ADR in group I (P > 0.05).

METHODS: Hut-78 cells were cultured with different concentrations of BTZ or THP alone and the two drugs combination for 48 h. Cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis were evaluated. The cell cycle inhibitor P21 was determined by Western blot. RESULTS: BTZ or THP alone significantly inhibited the growth of Hut-78 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In the combination groups, the inhibitory effect of BTZ followed by THP was the highest (P < 0.01). When the inhibition rate was more than 50%, the combination index analysis showed significant synergistic if treated with BTZ followed by THP or the two at the same time, but antagonistic if treated with THP followed by BTZ. With the inhibition rate increasing, only the synergistic effect of BTZ followed by THP was further increased. The apoptosis rate of BTZ followed by THP was higher than that of single agent each (P < 0.01). BTZ alone significantly increased the proportion of cells in G(2)/M phase (P < 0.01) in a dose-dependent manner and up-regulated the expression level of P21. Sequential THP notably enhanced BTZ-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: BTZ alone effectively induces growth inhibition and apoptosis of Hut-78 cells in vitro. BTZ followed by THP can synergistically enhance this cytotoxic effect. The mechanism may be that THP enhances BTZ-induced G(2)/M arrest and P21 up-regulation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eighty-two ALL patients were selected as the experimental group and 21 with normal bone marrow as control group for real-time quantitative RT-PCR (RQ-PCR). RESULTS: (1) There were 19 genes expressed differently between group B and A, including 14 up-regulated as ABCC4 and BCL11A, 5 down-regulated genes as TOP2A. (2) ABCC4 and BCL11A were validated by RQ-PCR and their expression level was higher in the high risk group than in the standard risk group (P < 0.05). The gene expression level in the group A and B was higher than that in the normal control group (P < 0.01). TOP2A was also validated by RQ-PCR and its expression level in the high risk group was lower than that in the standard risk group (P < 0.05). The gene expression level in the groups A and B was lower than that in the normal control group and the difference was statistically significance (P < 0.01).

METHODS: Thirty two patients were diagnosed as MPAL by bone marrow examination, immunophenotyping, cytogenetic and molecular assay and were treated with combined chemotherapy regimens for both acute lymphoblastic and acute myeloid leukemia. Two cases were received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). RESULTS: (1) The incidence of MPAL in acute leukemias was 2.6%. There were 16 cases (50.0%) of mixed myeloid and B-lymphoid (M/B), 14(43.8%) myeloid and T-lymphoid (M/T), one each (3.1%) of trilineage (M/B/T) and B- and T-lymphoid (B/T) phenotype. (2) The positive rates of CD34 and HLA-DR were 87.5% and 62.5%, respectively. (3) Abnormal karyotypes were detected in 70.0% of 30 MPAL patients, which were structural and numerical abnormalities including t(9;22), 11q23 and complex karyotypes. (4) The total complete remission (CR) rate was 75.0% and the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) at 2 years were 14.8% and 14.2% respectively. The CR rates for M/B and M/T cases were 75.0% and 71.4% respectively. No statistical difference was observed in OS and DFS between M/B and M/T cases. CONCLUSIONS: MPAL is a rare type of acute leukemia with a high heterogeneity. The unfavorable indicators of MPAL may be factors such as abnormal karyotypes, high expression of CD34 and extramedullary infiltration. Combined regimens and more intensive therapy including allo-HSCT might contribute to improving survival.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytotoxic CD8 T cells are critical in adaptive immunity by targeting virally infected or tumor cells. In this study, we addressed whether functional CD8 T cells can be generated fully in vitro using human umbilical cord blood (UCB) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in coculture with OP9-DL1 cells. RESULTS: HSC/OP9-DL1 cocultures supported the differentiation of CD8 T cells, which were TCR/CD3(hi) CD27(hi) CD1a(neg) and thus phenotypically resembled mature functional CD8 single positive thymocytes. These in vitro-generated T cells also appeared to be conventional CD8 cells, as they expressed high levels of Eomes and low levels of Plzf, albeit not identical to ex vivo UCB CD8 T cells. Consistent with the phenotypic and molecular characterization, upon TCR-stimulation, in vitro-generated CD8 T cells proliferated, expressed activation markers (MHC-II, CD25, CD38), secreted IFN-gamma and expressed Granzyme B, a cytotoxic T-cell effector molecule. CONCLUSION: Taken together, the ability to direct human hematopoietic stem cell or T-progenitor cells towards a mature functional phenotype raises the possibility of establishing cell-based treatments for T-immunodeficiencies by rapidly restoring CD8 effector function, thereby mitigating the risks associated with opportunistic infections.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PURPOSE: To assess the consistency of treatment benefit across patient subsets and the robustness of data with respect to trial centers and endpoints. METHODS: Forest plots were constructed with hazard ratios (HRs) of HDC/IL-2 treatment effects versus no treatment (control) for prospectively defined patient subsets. Inconsistency coefficients (I(2)) and interaction tests (X(2)) were used to detect any differences in benefit among subsets. Robustness of results to the elimination of individual study centers was performed using ""leave-one-center-out"" analyses. Associations between treatment effects on the endpoints were evaluated using weighted linear regression between HRs for LFS and OS estimated within countries. RESULTS: The benefit of HDC/IL-2 over controls was statistically consistent across all subsets defined by baseline prognostic variables. I(2) and P-values of X(2) ranged from 0.00 to 0.51 and 0.14 to 0.91, respectively. Treatment effects were statistically significant in 14 of 28 subsets analyzed. The ""leave-one-center-out"" analysis confirmed that no single center dominated (P-values ranged from 0.004 to 0.020 [mean 0.009]). The HRs representing the HDC/IL-2 effects on LFS and OS were strongly correlated at the country level (R(2) = 0.84). LIMITATIONS: Small sample sizes in some of the subsets analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: These analyses confirm the consistency and robustness of the HDC/IL-2 effect as compared with no treatment. LFS may be an acceptable surrogate for OS in future AML trials. Analyses of consistency and robustness may aid interpretation of data from multicenter trials, especially in populations with rare diseases, when the size of randomized clinical trials is limited.

Histamine dihydrochloride inhibits the formation of reactive oxygen species that suppress the activation of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells.

In a large, 3-year, randomized, open-label, multicentre, phase III trial in adult patients with AML in first or subsequent remission, those who received subcutaneous histamine dihydrochloride and concomitant subcutaneous IL-2 as maintenance therapy had a significantly longer leukaemia-free survival (LFS; primary endpoint) than patients receiving no treatment. This difference was also shown for the subgroup of patients in first remission. The between-group difference in overall survival (OS) was not significant, although this trial was not powered to detect such a difference. Histamine dihydrochloride and IL-2 therapy had an acceptable tolerability profile in patients in the phase III trial. The majority of reported adverse events were of grade 1 or 2 severity. The most commonly reported grade 3 adverse events with active treatment were thrombocytopenia, headache, neutropenia, pyrexia, eosinophilia and diarrhoea; grade 4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia and leukopenia not otherwise specified. Serious adverse events were mostly relapse related. Histamine dihydrochloride and IL-2 as maintenance therapy significantly prolonged LFS compared with no treatment and had an acceptable tolerability profile in a large phase III trial in patients with AML. Although some issues remain to be addressed, most notably the effects of therapy on OS and the efficacy of treatment in older patients (who represent the majority of AML patients), histamine dihydrochloride in addition to IL-2 appears to be a useful maintenance therapy option for adult patients with AML in remission.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We compared the oncolytic potential of MV in two B-cell malignancies; adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, an aggressive leukemia) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL, an indolent leukemia overexpressing Bcl-2) using patient-derived material. In vitro, distinct cytopathological effects were observed between MV-infected primary ALL and CLL cells, with large multinucleated syncytia forming in ALL cultures compared to minimal cell-to-cell fusion in infected CLL cells. Cell viability and immunoblotting studies confirmed rapid cell death in MV-infected ALL cultures and slower MV oncolysis of CLL cells. In cell lines, overexpression of Bcl-2 diminished MV-induced cell death providing a possible mechanism for the slower kinetic of MV oncolysis in CLL. In vivo, intratumoral MV treatment of established subcutaneous ALL xenografts had striking antitumor activity leading to complete resolution of all tumors. The antitumor activity of MV was also evident in disseminated ALL xenograft models. In summary, both ALL and CLL are targets for MV-mediated lysis albeit with different kinetics. The marked sensitivity of both primary ALL cells and ALL xenografts to MV oncolysis highlights the tremendous potential of MV as a novel replicating-virus therapy for adult ALL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Target tissues include the active bone marrow, associated with radiogenic leukemia, and total shallow marrow, associated with radiogenic bone cancer. Monoenergetic electron emissions are considered over the energy range 1 keV to 10 MeV for the following sources: bone marrow (active and inactive), trabecular bone (surfaces and volumes), and cortical bone (surfaces and volumes). Specific absorbed fractions are computed according to the MIRD schema, and are given as skeletal-averaged values in the paper with site-specific values reported in both tabular and graphical format in an electronic annex available from http://stacks.iop.org/0031-9155/56/2309/mmedia. The distribution of cortical bone and spongiosa at the macroscopic dimensions of the phantom, as well as the distribution of trabecular bone and marrow tissues at the microscopic dimensions of the phantom, is imposed through detailed analyses of whole-body ex vivo CT images (1 mm resolution) and spongiosa-specific ex vivo microCT images (30 microm resolution), respectively, taken from a 40 year male cadaver. The method utilized in this work includes: (1) explicit accounting for changes in marrow self-dose with variations in marrow cellularity, (2) explicit accounting for electron escape from spongiosa, (3) explicit consideration of spongiosa cross-fire from cortical bone, and (4) explicit consideration of the ICRP's change in the surrogate tissue region defining the location of the osteoprogenitor cells (from a 10 microm endosteal layer covering the trabecular and cortical surfaces to a 50 microm shallow marrow layer covering trabecular and medullary cavity surfaces). Skeletal-averaged values of absorbed fraction in the present model are noted to be very compatible with those weighted by the skeletal tissue distributions found in the ICRP Publication 110 adult male and female voxel phantoms, but are in many cases incompatible with values used in current and widely implemented internal dosimetry software.",,['NIHMS308358'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To better understand the cooperating genetic events in LMO2-associated T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), we investigated the roles of Arf tumor suppressor loss and Notch activation in murine models of transplantation. Lmo2 overexpression enhanced the expansion of primitive DN2 thymocytes, eventually facilitating the stochastic induction of clonal CD4(+)/CD8(+) malignancies. Inactivation of the Arf tumor suppressor further increased the self-renewal capacity of the primitive, preleukemic thymocyte pool and accelerated the development of aggressive, Lmo2-induced T-cell lympholeukemias. Notch mutations were frequently detected in these Lmo2-induced tumors. The Arf promoter was not directly engaged by Lmo2 or mutant Notch, and use of a mouse model in which activation of a mutant Notch allele depends on previous engagement of the Arf promoter revealed that Notch activation could occur as a subsequent event in T-cell tumorigenesis. Therefore, Lmo2 cooperates with Arf loss to enhance self-renewal in primitive thymocytes. Notch mutation and Arf inactivation appear to independently cooperate in no requisite order with Lmo2 overexpression in inducing T-ALL, and all 3 events remained insufficient to guarantee immediate tumor development.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The leukemogenesis process is still largely unknown, but relies on extended survival and clonal expansion of infected cells, which in turn accumulate genetic defects. A common feature of human tumor viruses is their ability to stimulate proliferation and survival of infected pretumoral cells and then hide by establishing latency in cells that have acquired a transformed phenotype. Whereas disruption of the DNA repair is one of the major processes responsible for the accumulation of genomic abnormalities and carcinogenesis, the absence of DNA repair also poses the threat of cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis of virus-infected cells. This study describes how the HTLV-1 p30 viral protein inhibits conservative homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair by targeting the MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 complex and favors the error-prone nonhomologous-end-joining (NHEJ) DNA-repair pathway instead. As a result, HTLV-1 p30 may facilitate the accumulation of mutations in the host genome and the cumulative risk of transformation. Our results provide new insights into how human tumor viruses may manipulate cellular DNA-damage responses to promote cancer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both marks are detected on class I and II endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) in murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Recently, we reported that the H3K9-specific lysine methyltransferase (KMTase) Eset/Setdb1/KMT1E is required for H3K9me3 and the maintenance of silencing of ERVs in mESCs. In contrast, G9a/Ehmt2/KMT1C is dispensable, despite the fact that this KMTase is required for H3K9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) and efficient DNA methylation of these retroelements. Transcription of the exogenous retrovirus (XRV) Moloney murine leukemia virus is rapidly extinguished after integration in mESCs, concomitant with de novo DNA methylation. However, the role that H3K9 KMTases play in this process has not been addressed. Here, we demonstrate that G9a, but not Suv39h1 or Suv39h2, is required for silencing of newly integrated Moloney murine leukemia virus-based vectors in mESCs. The silencing defect in G9a(-/-) cells is accompanied by a reduction of H3K9me2 at the proviral LTR, indicating that XRVs are direct targets of G9a. Furthermore, de novo DNA methylation of newly integrated proviruses is impaired in the G9a(-/-) line, phenocopying proviral DNA methylation and silencing defects observed in Dnmt3a-deficient mESCs. Once established, however, maintenance of silencing of XRVs, like ERVs, is dependent exclusively on the KMTase Eset. Taken together, these observations reveal that in mESCs, the H3K9 KMTase G9a is required for the establishment, but not for the maintenance, of silencing of newly integrated proviruses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene is an immediate target gene regulated by IRF-8 in response to IFN-gamma activation. PML is a multifunctional protein that has many isoforms serving as the scaffold components for nuclear bodies (NBs) engaged in numerous proteins interactions. The role of PML in the retinoic acid pathway that drives GMPs to granulopoiesis is documented in the literature. Here, we show that PML is also involved in monopoiesis by mediating some of the IRF-8 activities during the differentiation of murine-derived bone marrow macrophages (BMMs). PML silencing resulted in altered expression level of key transcription factors essential for monopoiesis that was accompanied by silencing of typical myeloid-specific genes. Interestingly, this altered expression resembled that of the GMPs and that of BMMs derived from IRF-8(-/-) mice altogether supporting the role of PML in monopoiesis. Further, PML silencing led to reduced colony-forming capacity of bone marrow cells highlighting the dual function of PML in myelopoiesis. Last, PML overexpression only partially rescued the phenotype of IRF-8(-/-) BMMs. Together, our data show that PML is an important factor for monopoiesis and not solely for granulopoiesis. This suggests that PML-NBs respond to an incoming signal that affects the fate of GMP driving cell differentiation to granulocytes or monocytes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 71 patients under 15 years old who were newly diagnosed with acute leukemia between September 2007 and August 2008 without Downs' syndrome or other tumors, and 113 gender- and age-matched controls without tumors or congenital diseases were enrolled for the case-control study. The general data and potential risk factors were obtained by questionnaires. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to determine the metal concentrations in urine, which was collected randomly before chemotherapy. Logistic regression model was performed for univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The questionnaire showed that there was significant difference in the proportion of children whose mothers had taken iron supplements during or 3 months before pregnancy between case group and control group, which was 28.2% (20/71) and 14.2% (16/113) respectively (Wald chi(2) = 5.438, P = 0.02). Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that levels of vanadium, manganese, iron, cobalt, copper, arsenic, and barium in urine from case group were all higher than those of control group with significant difference. The median values for vanadium in urine from case and control groups were 5.39 and 3.04 ng/mg creatinine (Wald chi(2) = 9.03, P < 0.05); the median values for manganese were respectively 4.46 and 2.44 ng/mg creatinine (Wald chi(2) = 10.57, P < 0.05); the median values for iron were separately 58.69 and 14.09 ng/mg creatinine (Wald chi(2) = 13.41, P < 0.05); the median values for cobalt were respectively 0.98 and 0.77 ng/mg creatinine (Wald chi(2) = 4.46, P < 0.05); the median values for copper were 61.17 and 10.90 ng/mg creatinine (Wald chi(2) = 8.15, P < 0.05); the median values for arsenic were respectively 55.93 and 36.11 ng/mg creatinine (Wald chi(2) = 4.57, P < 0.05); and the median values for barium were 8.55 and 2.87 ng/mg creatinine (Wald chi(2) = 4.82, P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the level of iron in urine had a significantly positive relation with the incidence of childhood acute leukemia (OR = 1.009, 95%CI = 1.002 - 1.016). CONCLUSION: The level of iron in urine might be related to the occurrence of childhood acute leukemia, but its specific role needs further investigation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2011 Mar 23.,,,PMC3088985,"Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies are promising for the treatment of B-cell malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and autoimmune diseases where auto-antibodies play an important role. Anti-CD20 such as rituximab (RTX) mediates B-cell depletion through mechanisms such as complement-mediated cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. However, in haematological malignancies, such effector mechanisms can be saturated and result in release of malignant B cells with reduced levels of CD20. It has been hypothesized that this is the result of monocyte-mediated shaving of the CD20/RTX complex from the B-cell surface. Here, we confirm, that in vitro co-culture of human monocytes and RTX-labelled syngeneic B cells results in reduced expression of CD20/RTX complex on the B cell surface. This shaving mechanism was the result of active protease activity because EDTA and PMSF were able to mediate partial inhibition. Also, a series of alternative anti-CD20 antibodies representing both type I and type II antibodies were tested for their ability to induce the shaving reaction. These results demonstrate that a monocyte-mediated shaving reaction can lead to complete loss of most anti-CD20 antibodies from the surface of B cells even from healthy donors and this is an important obstacle for antibody-mediated immune therapy. The findings demonstrate the necessity of developing novel antibodies that maintain high effector functions without enabling activation of the shaving reaction.",['(c) 2011 The Authors.

In 36 studies evaluated, atrazine was the most common triazine investigated. In general the studies were limited by lack of in-depth exposure measurements and by small numbers of subjects with potential high exposure and/or with many years of follow-up since first exposure. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, prostate cancer, and breast cancer were most frequently investigated. Only one to three analytical or ecological studies investigated Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, multiple myeloma, soft tissue sarcoma, hairy-cell leukemia, melanoma, and cancers of the ovary, testes, colon, stomach, lung, brain, bladder, buccal cavity, and pharynx. Results of these studies were typically imprecise and did not form an adequate basis for determining if triazine exposure causes any form of cancer. Collectively, the available epidemiology studies do not provide consistent, scientifically convincing evidence of a causal relationship between exposure to atrazine or triazine herbicides and cancer in humans. Based upon the assessment studies, there is no scientific basis for inferring the existence of a causal relationship between triazine exposure and the occurrence of cancer in humans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The activities of K562 proliferation cells were detected by MTT assay; cell apoptosis was detected by Hoechst 33258 staining assay, DNA fragmentation assay, and Annexin V/PI double-labeled cytometry; the expression and phosphorylation level of Caspase family members and AKT signaling pathway related proteins were determined by Western blot before and after celastrol treatment, and further the effect of AKT signaling pathway on celastrol-induced-apoptosis was analyzed. RESULTS: K562 cell proliferation was inhibited by celastrol in a time- and dose-dependent manner, with the IC50 value for 24 h of (2.15 +/- 0.11) micromol/L. Celastrol induced K562 cells apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, apparent DNA fragmentation and typical apoptotic morphological changes, and accompanied Caspase-3, 8 activation in the apoptosis process were shown after cells were treated with 2.0 micromol/L celastrol for 24 h. And the celastrol induced apoptosis could be blocked by 50 micromol/L z-VAD-fmk (caspase inhibitor), but augmented by 25 micromol/L WORT (PI3K-Akt inhibitor). Moreover, Celastrol decreased the expressions of p-Akt, survivin and Bcl-2 in the Akt signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Celastrol inhibited the proliferation of K562 cells and induced cell apoptosis by way of activating caspase cascade. The decreased level of Akt phosphorylation during celastrol-induced-apoptosis process suggested that celastrol acted synergistically with PI3K-Akt inhibitors in K562 cell apoptosis inducing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Area-based differentials in childhood cancer throughout Australia have not been previously published at a national level. PROCEDURE: Population-based information from the Australian Paediatric Cancer Registry was used to identify all children aged 0- to 14-years old diagnosed with invasive cancer or intracranial and intraspinal tumors of benign or uncertain behavior between 1996 and 2006. Age-standardized incidence rates per million children per year and the corresponding incidence rate ratios were calculated, categorized by remoteness of residence and an area-based index of socioeconomic disadvantage. Results were also stratified by the most common types of childhood cancer. RESULTS: There was a significant, decreasing gradient in the incidence of childhood cancer as remoteness of residence increased. Children living in remote or very remote areas were 21% less likely to be diagnosed with cancer compared to children in major cities, mainly due to differences in the incidence of leukemias and lymphomas. This differential was no longer significant when only non-Indigenous children were considered. No clear relationship was found between incidence and socioeconomic status (SES) in contrast to similar earlier studies. CONCLUSIONS: The findings by remoteness of residence are consistent with the lower incidence rates of cancer that are typically associated with Indigenous Australians. There is also a suggestion that the etiological factors associated with childhood leukemia and SES may have altered over time.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aims were to assess fatigue levels, prevalence of chronic fatigue (CF) and the association of CF with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in survivors of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), infratentorial astrocytoma (IA), and Wilms tumor (WT) in childhood. PROCEDURE: Seventy percent (398/567) of Nordic patients treated for AML, IA, and WT between 1985 and 2001 at age >1 year responded to a postal survey, encompassing the Fatigue Questionnaire and the Short Form 36 (SF-36). Participants were divided into two groups at time of study; younger (YG, 13-18 years) and older (OG, 19-34 years). Respondents (19-34 years, n = 763) from a Norwegian general population (GP) survey served as controls for the OG. RESULTS: The OG [mean age was 24 years (SD 3.3)] had higher fatigue levels compared to the YG and the GP, especially the females (P < 0.05). There was also a higher prevalence of CF in the OG than in the GP (14 vs. 6%, P < 0.001). Regardless of diagnosis, the OG with CF had poorer physical health (P < 0.05) on the SF-36 but better mental health (P < 0.05 and P = 0.001) relative to controls with CF. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of CF is higher among Nordic survivors of AML, IA, and WT than GP controls of similar age. CF is associated with impaired HRQoL in survivors.

Thus, optimal dose individualisation is of paramount importance. PROCEDURE: We studied how pharmacokinetic parameters were related to outcome in 340 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). A population pharmacokinetic model was developed with data from 1284 HDMTX courses in 304 children evaluating age, height, weight, body surface area (BSA), sex, serum creatinine and serum alanine aminotransferase as potential covariates. RESULT: Body weight improved the population pharmacokinetic model significantly more than any of the other patient characteristics, indicating that body weight may be the better way of dose normalisation. In a logistic regression analysis, higher values of clearance as well as volume of distribution were related to increased relapse risk in the standard (SR) and intermediate risk (IR) groups as well as in the entire cohort. A higher weight was strongly associated with worse outcome in the SR and IR groups, (P = 0.0186 and 0.0121, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that dose normalisation of methotrexate according to body weigh may give more predictable pharmacokinetics of methotrexate and may also improve the outcome for children with ALL.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genuine ESC identity can only be maintained when both self-renewal and suppression of differentiation are active and balanced. Here, we identify Pramel7 (preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma-like 7) as a novel factor crucial for maintenance of pluripotency and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-mediated self-renewal in ESCs. In vivo, Pramel7 expression was exclusively found in the pluripotent pools of cells, namely, the central part of the morula and the inner cell mass of the blastocyst. Ablation of Pramel7 induced ESC differentiation, whereas its overexpression was sufficient to support long-term self-renewal in the absence of exogenous LIF. Furthermore, Pramel7 overexpression suppressed differentiation in ESCs in vitro and in vivo. This process was reversible, as on transgene excision cells reverted to a LIF-dependent state and regained their capacity to participate in the formation of chimeric mice. Molecularly, LIF directly controls Pramel7 expression, involving both STAT3-dependent transcriptional regulation and PI3K-dependent phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta. Pramel7 expression in turn confers constitutive self-renewal and prevents differentiation through inactivation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation. Accordingly, knockdown of Pramel7 promotes ESC differentiation in presence of LIF and even on forced STAT3-activation. Thus, Pramel7 represents a central and essential factor in the signaling network regulating pluripotency and self-renewal in ESCs.",['Copyright (c) 2011 AlphaMed Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here the isolation of glioma stem cells (GSCs) maintaining telomere length through a telomerase-independent mechanism known as alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALTs). TG20 cells were isolated from a glioblastoma multiforme, which had the ALT phenotype. They have no detectable telomerase activity and extremely long and heterogeneous telomeres colocalizing with promyelocytic leukemia bodies. The cancer stem cell potential of TG20 cells was confirmed based on their expression of neural stem cell markers, their capacity of in vitro long-term proliferation and to form intracranial tumors in immune-deficient mice. Interestingly, we found that both in vitro and in vivo TG20 cells were significantly more resistant to ionizing radiation than GSCs with telomerase activity. Analysis of DNA damage foci, DNA double-strand breaks repair, and chromosome instability suggest that radiation resistance was related to interference of ALT pathway with DNA damage response. Therefore, our data show for the first time that the ALT pathway can confer to cancer stem cells the capacity to sustain long-term proliferation as telomerase activity and importantly may also affect treatment efficiency. TG20 cells are thus the first cellular model of GSCs displaying ALT and should prove to be useful for the development of specific treatment strategies.",['Copyright (c) 2011 AlphaMed Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We further illustrated that its enzymatic activity is involved, through signaling peptides, in SC maintenance. Therefore, CD10 is not only a cell surface marker in normal and malignant contexts but also affects the extracellular environment and plays a key role in regulation of a number of biological functions and likely in SC. In tumors, the ""niche"" favors the survival of sheltered cancer SC whose eradication has become the new challenge in oncology. This highlights the importance of understanding the role of CD10 in cancer SC. We will review the characteristics, main functions, and mechanism of action of CD10.

Currently, there are 8 therapies approved to treat multiple sclerosis: beta-interferons (Avonex, Betaseron, Extavia, and Rebif), fingolimod (Gilenya), glatiramer acetate (Copaxone), mitoxantrone (Novantrone), and natalizumab (Tysabri).

The timing of beginning therapy and selection of these agents must be individualized for each patient depending upon patient preference, tolerability, clinical and magnetic resonance imaging disease activity, and disease course. All of the current treatments are approved for relapsing disease. To date only the injectable agents, including interferons and glatiramer acetate, have been shown to be of benefit when started after an initial demyelinating event referred to as clinically isolated syndrome. Mitoxantrone was approved for progressive relapsing and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, although its use is limited by potential risks such as cardiotoxicity and leukemia. Although these agents have made a significant impact on the treatment of multiple sclerosis, they are often only partially effective, so patients may continue to have disease activity.

The authors then used logistic regression to estimate the likelihood of delay and Cox regression to examine survival. RESULTS: For the 5086 patients analyzed, the median time between sign or symptom and CLL diagnosis was 63 days (interquartile range [IQR] = 0-251). Predictors of delay included age >/=75 (OR 1.45 [1.27-1.65]), female gender (OR 1.22 [1.07-1.39]), urban residence (OR 1.46 [1.19 to 1.79]), >/=1 comorbidities (OR 2.83 [2.45-3.28]) and care in a teaching hospital (OR 1.20 [1.05-1.38]). Delayed diagnosis was not associated with survival (HR 1.11 [0.99-1.25]), but receipt of flow cytometry within thirty days before or after diagnosis was (HR 0.84 [0.76-0.91]).

The authors evaluated predictive factors in patients with secondary AML treated with anthracycline-based induction therapy. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of secondary AML patients treated with induction therapy. Age, International Prognostic Scoring System, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, cytogenetics, duration of MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm, and prior MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm treatment were evaluated for their impact on complete response (CR), CR with low platelets, and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: The authors evaluated 61 secondary AML patients who received induction chemotherapy; 59% (36 patients) achieved CR/CR with low platelets (95% confidence interval [CI], 46%-71%), and median OS was 6.5 (95% CI, 3.9-8.1) months. Three factors were associated with lower CR/CR with low platelets and OS: poor risk cytogenetics, prior treatment with hypomethylating agents or lenalidomide, and longer time to transformation to AML.

The expression pattern of the human IRG1 gene, however, has not yet been established, and the predicted gene sequence has been revised several times according to computed expressed sequence tags (ESTs). To determine the human IRG1 gene expression profile, human fetal tissue samples, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from normal healthy subjects, and the human leukemia cell lines THP-1 and K-562 challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were subjected to RT-PCR using degenerate primers. The results indicated that the IRG1 gene is differentially expressed in human fetal PBMCs and LPS-stimulated adult PBMCs. The amplified gene fragment was cloned into the pET32a(+) vector and fusion-expressed with a His-tag in a prokaryotic system. After affinity chromatography, human IRG1h fusion proteins were isolated by SDS-PAGE and identified by mass spectrometric analysis for use as an immunogen to immunize rabbits. The titer and specificity of the purified rabbit antiserum were sufficient to measure human IRG1 gene expression in various tissues and cultures. This purified polyclonal antiserum will allow us to initiate studies to elucidate the biological roles of the human IRG1 gene.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this analysis was to determine the indication, treatment concepts, and efficiency of RT. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical features, treatment concepts, and outcome data during the past 20 years were analyzed. Endpoints were pain relief, symptomatic and hematological response, and treatment-related side effects. RESULTS: From 1989-2009, a total of 122 patients received 246 RT courses because of symptomatic SM. Overall 31 patients had chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), 37 had chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 23 had osteomyelofibrosis (OMF), 17 had polycythemia vera (PV), 5 had acute myelogenous leukemia, 4 had idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), 3 had non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and 2 had multiple myeloma (MM). Patients were treated with (60)Co gamma rays or 5-15MV photons. The fraction size ranged from 10-200 cGy and the total dose per treatment course from 30-1600 cGy. Significant pain relief was achieved for 74.8% of the RT courses given for splenic pain. At least 50% regression was attained for 77% of the RT courses given for SM. 36 patients died within 2 months due to the terminal nature of their disease. Of the RT courses applied for cytopenia, 73.6% achieved a significant improvement of hematological parameters and reduction of transfusion need. Notable hematologic toxicities were reported < EORTC/RTOG II degrees . CONCLUSION: The present analysis documents the efficacy of RT. In addition, RT as a palliative treatment option for symptomatic SM should not be forgotten.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its cytotoxicity against eukaryotic cells and potential as a prospective drug for human diseases has been examined only in a limited context. Our data demonstrate the time- and concentration-dependent cytotoxicity of camalexin on human T-leukemia Jurkat cells in the micromolar range, and the lower potency of cytotoxic effects on human lymphoblasts and primary fibroblasts. Cytotoxicity of camalexin is enhanced by the glutathione-depleting agent buthionine sulfoximine and completely blocked by pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. Treatment of Jurkat cells with camalexin resulted in activation of caspase-8, caspase-9, caspases-3/7, and apoptosis that was detected by the presence of a sub-G1 population of cells, externalization of phosphatidyl serine and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. Staining with 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate and dihydroethidium bromide displayed increased concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) early in camalexin-treated Jurkat cells, prior to the onset of apoptosis, while staining with MitoSOX() dye identified mitochondria as a source of increased ROS. Our data suggest that this phytochemical, which has a wide range of predicted pharmacological activities, induces apoptosis in Jurkat leukemia cells through increased ROS followed by dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential and execution of caspase-9- and caspase-8-initiated apoptosis. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first report on antileukemic activity and mode of action of this unique indole phytoalexin.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Long-term cultivation of normal SSCs into stable cell lines, and maintaining SSCs in an undifferentiated state capable of self-renewal, is a major challenge. Here, we compare the effect of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) expression on mouse SSCs isolated from testicular tissue cultured under different conditions. We found that human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs) with high LIF expression (LIF(high)) feeder cells allowed mouse SSCs to maintain a high level of AP activity when cultured long term. Expression of some important stem cell markers was higher in mouse SSCs cultured on hAECs (LIF(high)) compared to those cultured on hAECs (LIF(low)). Taken together, these results suggest that LIF expression could be a crucial component for feeder cells to maintain mouse SSCs in an undifferentiated, proliferative state capable of self-renewal.",['(c) The Society for In Vitro Biology 2011'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effects of MSCs on tumor growth are controversial. In this study, we showed that MSCs increase proliferation of tumor cells in vitro and promote tumor growth in vivo. We also further analyzed the mechanisms that underlie these effects. For use in in vitro and in vivo experiments, we established a bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cell line from cells isolated in C57BL/6 mice. Effects of murine MSCs on tumor cell proliferation in vitro were analyzed in a coculture model with B16-LacZ cells. Both coculture with MSCs and treatment with MSC-conditioned media led to enhanced growth of B16-LacZ cells, although the magnitude of growth stimulation in cocultured cells was greater than that of cells treated with conditioned media. Co-injection of B16-LacZ cells and MSCs into syngeneic mice led to increased tumor size compared with injection of B16-LacZ cells alone. Identical experiments using Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells instead of B16-LacZ cells yielded similar results. Consistent with a role for neovascularization in MSC-mediated tumor growth, tumor vessel area was greater in tumors resulting from co-injection of B16-LacZ cells or LLCs with MSCs than in tumors induced by injection of cancer cells alone. Co-injected MSCs directly supported the tumor vasculature by localizing close to vascular walls and by expressing an endothelial marker. Furthermore, secretion of leukemia inhibitory factor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor was increased in cocultures of MSCs and B16-LacZ cells compared with B16-LacZ cells alone. Together, these results indicate that MSCs promote tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo and suggest that tumor promotion in vivo may be attributable in part to enhanced angiogenesis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The device consists of a square capillary with an inner diameter of roughly five cell diameters, connected via Teflon tubing to a syringe. Aptamers are immobilized on the inner surface of the capillary through biotin-avidin chemistry, the extent of which can be controlled by adjusting the aptamer concentration. Introduction of different cell types into separate devices, as well as mixtures of target and non-target cells, demonstrated that aptamer-target cells can be captured in significantly higher concentrations compared to non-target cells. Once optimized, 91.1 +/- 3.5% capture efficiency of target leukemia cells was reported, as well as 97.2 +/- 2.8% and 83.6 +/- 5.8% for two different colon cancer cell lines. In addition, cells captured in the device were imaged, and the square capillary exhibited better optical properties than standard cylindrical capillaries, leading to the detection of leukemia cells in blood samples.

Epub 2011 Mar 21.,,,,"Mixed lineage leukemia 5 (MLL5) has been implicated in multiple aspects of cell physiology, such as hematopoiesis, cell cycle control and chromatin regulatory network. In this study, we present evidence that MLL5 is involved in the camptothecin (CPT)-induced p53 activation. CPT promoted the degradation of MLL5 protein in a time- and dose-dependent manner in actively replicating cells. The downregulation of MLL5 led to phosphorylation of p53 at Ser392, which was abrogated by exogenous overexpression of MLL5. In MLL5-knockdown cells, p53 protein was stabilized and bound to DNA with higher affinity, leading to activation of downstream genes. Co-immunoprecipitation showed that MLL5 preferentially interacted with the tetramerized form of p53, and knockdown of MLL5 promoted chromatin accumulation of p53 tetramers, suggesting that the association of MLL5 with p53 may prevent the p53 tetramers from binding to the chromatin target sites. The role of MLL5 in CPT-induced p53 activation was conserved in developing zebrafish, where CPT downregulated zebrafish Mll5 protein, and the microinjection of zebrafish mll5 mRNA substantially blocked the CPT-induced apoptosis. In summary, our study proposed MLL5 as a novel component in the regulation of p53 homeostasis and a new cellular determinant of CPT.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2011 Mar 21.,['Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,PMC3163261,"Past studies have shown that upregulation of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1 is a major adaptive mechanism of melanoma cells to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and has an important role in resistance of the cells to apoptosis. In this study, we show that the increase in transcription of Mcl-1 in melanoma cells triggered by pharmacological ER stress inducers is mediated by the transcription factor Ets-1. By incremental deletion analysis of the Mcl-1 promoter, we identified a DNA fragment containing an Ets-1 binding site that is transcriptionally responsive to ER stress. Mutations in the Ets-1 binding site or knockdown of Ets-1 inhibited the increase in Mcl-1, indicating that Ets-1 has a critical role in transcriptional upregulation of Mcl-1. Similar to Mcl-1, Ets-1 was transcriptionally upregulated by ER stress. This was mediated by the IRE1alpha/XBP-1 branch of the unfolded protein response, as upregulation of Ets-1 was inhibited in melanoma cell lines deficient in IRE1alpha or XBP-1 established by short hairpin RNA knockdown. Activation of the PI3k/Akt pathway downstream of XBP-1 was also involved, in that inhibition of the pathway blocked upregulation of Ets-1. Inhibition of Ets-1 enhanced ER stress-induced apoptosis in melanoma cell lines and in fresh melanoma isolates, recapitulating the effect of inhibition of Mcl-1. These results reveal a key mechanism by which Mcl-1 is transcriptionally upregulated in melanoma cells by ER stress, and identify Ets-1 as a potential target for inhibition to sensitize melanoma cells to apoptosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The crystallization of UA or calcium phosphate in renal tubules can result in acute tumor lysis syndrome (ATLS). Some reports indicate that patients who experience ATLS have a better prognosis than those who do not. We investigated the relationship between urinary IP and UA excretion and treatment outcome in children with acute leukemia. Participants included 93 patients with ALL and 31 patients with AML.

One of the most tantalizing approaches in this regard involves the use of dendritic cell-based vaccines. Dendritic cells (DCs) are antigen-presenting cells, capable of inducing anti-leukemic immune responses directed against leukemia-associated antigens. They can be obtained in high numbers following in vitro differentiation of peripheral blood monocytes. Research efforts are now focused on optimizing in vitro culture conditions and antigen loading strategies of DCs in order to maximize their potential to induce anti-leukemic immunity. Here, we will highlight some important aspects in the design of a potent DC vaccine for AML. We also discuss the importance of natural killer cells and combination strategies to further improve the outcome of DC-based vaccination in AML patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we demonstrate that BTK protein and mRNA are significantly over expressed in CLL compared with normal B cells. Although BTK is not always constitutively active in CLL cells, BCR or CD40 signaling is accompanied by effective activation of this pathway. Using the irreversible BTK inhibitor PCI-32765, we demonstrate modest apoptosis in CLL cells that is greater than that observed in normal B cells. No influence of PCI-32765 on T-cell survival is observed. Treatment of CD40 or BCR activated CLL cells with PCI-32765 results in inhibition of BTK tyrosine phosphorylation and also effectively abrogates downstream survival pathways activated by this kinase including ERK1/2, PI3K, and NF-kappaB. In addition, PCI-32765 inhibits activation-induced proliferation of CLL cells in vitro, and effectively blocks survival signals provided externally to CLL cells from the microenvironment including soluble factors (CD40L, BAFF, IL-6, IL-4, and TNF-alpha), fibronectin engagement, and stromal cell contact. Based on these collective data, future efforts targeting BTK with the irreversible inhibitor PCI-32765 in clinical trials of CLL patients is warranted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2011 Mar 21.,,,PMC3123014,"Arsenic had been used in treating malignancies from the 18th to mid-20th century. In the past 3 decades, arsenic was revived and shown to be able to induce complete remission and to achieve, when combined with all-trans retinoic acid and chemotherapy, a 5-year overall survival of 90% in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia driven by the t(15;17) translocation-generated promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML-RARalpha) fusion. Molecularly, arsenic binds thiol residues and induces the formation of reactive oxygen species, thus affecting numerous signaling pathways. Interestingly, arsenic directly binds the C3HC4 zinc finger motif in the RBCC domain of PML and PML-RARalpha, induces their homodimerization and multimerization, and enhances their interaction with the SUMO E2 conjugase Ubc9, facilitating subsequent sumoylation/ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Arsenic-caused intermolecular disulfide formation in PML also contributes to PML-multimerization. All-trans retinoic acid, which targets PML-RARalpha for degradation through its RARalpha moiety, synergizes with arsenic in eliminating leukemia-initiating cells. Arsenic perturbs a number of proteins involved in other hematologic malignancies, including chronic myeloid leukemia and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, whereby it may bring new therapeutic benefits. The successful revival of arsenic in acute promyelocytic leukemia, together with modern mechanistic studies, has thus allowed a new paradigm to emerge in translational medicine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The MUC1 oncoprotein is aberrantly expressed in AML cells; however, there has been no evidence for involvement of MUC1 in myeloid leukemogenesis. Cell-penetrating peptide inhibitors of the MUC1-C subunit block its oligomerization and thereby oncogenic function. The present results demonstrate that treatment of human MOLM-14 and MV4-11 AML cells with these inhibitors is associated with arrest of growth, induction of late apoptosis/necrosis, and loss of self-renewal capacity. Similar results were obtained with primary blasts from patients with AML. Inhibition of MUC1-C was associated with increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and depletion of glutathione. Increases in ROS have been linked to induction of hematopoietic cell differentiation along the myeloid lineage. In this regard, inhibition of MUC1-C was associated with induction of a terminally differentiated myeloid phenotype in AML cell lines and primary blasts by an ROS-dependent mechanism. These findings indicate that MUC1-C function is of importance to AML cell self-renewal and that inhibition of MUC1-C represents a potential therapeutic approach to induce terminal differentiation of AML cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2011 Mar 21.,,,,"PURPOSE: Treatment of chronic-phase (CP) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with imatinib 400 mg/d can be unsatisfactory. Optimization of treatment is warranted. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 1,014 newly diagnosed CP-CML patients were randomly assigned to imatinib 800 mg/d (n = 338), imatinib 400 mg/d (n = 325), or imatinib 400 mg/d plus interferon alfa (IFN-alpha; n = 351). Dose adaptation to avoid higher-grade toxicity was recommended. First primary end point was major molecular remission (MMR) at 12 months. RESULTS: A higher rate of MMR at 12 months occurred with tolerability-adapted imatinib 800 mg/d than with imatinib 400 mg/d (59% [95% CI, 53% to 65%] v 44% [95% CI, 37% to 50%]; P < .001) or imatinib 400 mg/d plus IFN-alpha (59% v 46% [95% CI, 40% to 52%]; P = .002). Median dose in the 800-mg/d arm was 628 mg/d with a maximum dose of 737 mg/d during months 4 to 6 and a maintenance dose of 600 mg/d. All three treatment approaches were well tolerated with similar grade 3 and 4 adverse events. Independent of treatment approach, MMR at 12 months showed better progression-free survival (99% v 94%; P = .0023) and overall survival (99% v 93%; P = .0011) at 3 years when compared with > 1% on the international scale or no MMR but showed no difference in 0.1% to < 1% on the international scale, which closely correlates with complete cytogenetic remission. CONCLUSION: Treatment of early-phase CML with imatinib can be optimized. Early high-dose therapy followed by rapid adaptation to good tolerability increases the rate of MMR at 12 months. Achievement of MMR by month 12 is directly associated with improved survival.",,,,,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 2011 Apr 20;29(12):1512-6. PMID: 21422414'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, available information on morbidity and mortality is largely based on sponsored trials, whereas independent long-term field studies are lacking. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive CML patients who started imatinib treatment before 2005 and who were in complete cytogenetic remission (CCyR) after 2 years (+/- 3 months) were eligible for enrollment in the independent multicenter Imatinib Long-Term (Side) Effects (ILTE) study. Incidence of the first serious and nonserious adverse events and loss of CCyR were estimated according to the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the standard log-rank test. Attainment of negative Philadelphia chromosome hematopoiesis was assessed with cytogenetics and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Cumulative incidence of death related or unrelated to CML progression was estimated, accounting for competing risks, according to the Kalbleisch-Prentice method. Standardized incidence ratios were calculated based on population rates specific for sex and age classes. Confidence intervals were calculated by the exact method based on the chi(2) distribution. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: A total of 832 patients who were treated for a median of 5.8 years were enrolled. There were 139 recorded serious adverse events, of which 19.4% were imatinib-related. A total of 830 nonserious adverse events were observed in 53% of patients; 560 (68%) were imatinib-related. The most frequent were muscle cramps, asthenia, edema, skin fragility, diarrhea, tendon, or ligament lesions. Nineteen patients (2.3%) discontinued imatinib because of drug-related toxic effects. Forty-five patients lost CCyR, at a rate of 1.4 per 100 person-years. Durable (>1 year) negative Philadelphia chromosome hematopoiesis was attained by 179 patients. Twenty deaths were observed, with a 4.8% mortality incidence rate (standardized incidence ratio = 0.7; 95% confidence interval = 0.40 to 1.10, P = .08), with only six (30%) associated with CML progression. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, CML-related deaths were uncommon in CML patients who were in CCyR 2 years after starting imatinib, and survival was not statistically significantly different from that of the general population.",,,,,,,,['J Natl Cancer Inst. 2011 Apr 6;103(7):527-9.

We describe a case of widespread granulomatous dermatitis that preceded the diagnosis of MDS by 2 years. OBSERVATIONS: A 71-year-old man developed a generalized, mildly pruritic eruption that slowly progressed over a 2-year period. Punch biopsy specimens demonstrated interstitial dermal granulomatous inflammation. A complete blood cell count with differential showed marked monocytosis, and the findings of a subsequent biopsy of the bone marrow confirmed MDS. Lenalidomide therapy was initiated, and the patient's skin condition improved after 6 weeks of treatment; however, his MDS progressed to acute myeloid leukemia, and he died shortly thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: There is a paucity of literature documenting the occurrence of granulomatous dermatitis as a manifestation of an underlying hematologic disorder. This case illustrates a striking example of widespread granulomatous dermatitis heralding the onset of MDS. It is imperative that the dermatologic community recognize the rare association of granulomatous dermatitis with myelodysplasia, because the cutaneous manifestations may be the presenting finding and can precede the development of leukemia by several years.",,,,,,,,['Arch Dermatol. 2011 Mar;147(3):342-4.

Epub 2011 Mar 21.,,,PMC3105644,"BACKGROUND: Alterations of the short arm of chromosome 12 (12p) occur in various hematologic malignancies and ETV6 and CDKN1B, which are located on 12p, have been implicated as leukemogenic genes of interest. DESIGN AND METHODS: We selected seven patients with myeloid malignancies and small 12p deletions detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization encompassing only the region centromeric of ETV6 and further evaluated them by single nucleotide polymorphism microarrays. RESULTS: The minimally deleted region contained only nine genes. These genes were subsequently analyzed by microarray expression profiling in an independent cohort of 781 patients, most, but not all, of whom had different hematologic malignancies CREBL2, MANSC1, and CDKN1B were expressed in more than 25% of cases, while the other six genes were expressed in only a minority of cases. As CDKN1B is a cell cycle regulator and functions as a tumor suppressor gene, this gene was selected for further expression studies in 286 patients with acute myeloid leukemia. When comparing patients with low CDKN1B expression (expression level<1,160; 1st quartile) with those with intermediate or high expression (2nd-4th quartiles), certain mutations were observed more frequently in the former: RUNX1-RUNX1T1 (11/83, 13.3% versus 5/203; 2.5%; P=0.001), PML-RARA rearrangements (11/83, 13.3% versus 4/203, 2.0%; P<0.001), 11q23/MLL rearrangements (6/83, 7.2% versus 4/203, 2.0%; P=0.038), and FLT3-TKD mutations (7/63, 11.1% versus 6/167, 3.6%; P=0.047). The median overall survival of patients with low CDKN1B expression was longer than that of patients with intermediate/high expression (not reached versus 14.9 months; P=0.005). Likewise, patients with low CDKN1B expression had a longer event-free survival than those with intermediate/high expression (31.0 versus 9.7 months; P=0.013). CONCLUSIONS: CDKN1B is an interesting candidate gene as a potential biomarker for prognostication in acute myeloid leukemia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Conditioned media (CM) were collected from cultured adult and fetal RPE cells and analyzed for trophic factor composition and concentration by multiplex ELISA. Trophic factor receptor occupancy was calculated to evaluate the potential biological effectiveness of the differences in trophic factor concentrations. Retina-preserving activity of the collected CM was evaluated using an in vitro model of degenerating porcine retina. Isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) was used to identify additional proteins with a potential effect on porcine retinal survival. RESULTS: The overall trophic factor secretion profile of cultured fetal RPE cells remained stable over multiple passages and extended culture duration. Compared with CM from adult RPE cells, fetal RPE-CM had significantly higher concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) and significantly lower concentrations of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and nerve growth factor (NGF). Fetal RPE-CM was significantly better than adult RPE-CM at improving degenerating porcine retina survival. iTRAQ analysis identified insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), semaphorin-3B, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF), and gelsolin as factors potentially contributing to this activity. Co-culture of fetal RPE and porcine retina was significantly better than fetal RPE-CM at preserving porcine retinal survival. CONCLUSIONS: Adult and fetal RPE cells have significantly different trophic factor secretion profiles, which correlate with differences in their ability to support porcine retina survival. Combined with trophic factor receptor occupancy calculations, these data implicate VEGF-A and PEDF as key RPE-derived factors promoting preservation of retinal structure and function.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its significance in leukemic transformation is a matter of even greater controversy. The aim of this study was to evaluate both the JAK2(V617F) mutational status of the rare cases in which blast crisis occurred in our institution and the response after intensive treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1999 and 2009, 778 patients received diagnoses of BCR-ABL1-negative MPNs in our center (395 polycythemia vera, 329 essential thrombocythemia, and 45 primary myelofibrosis cases, as well as 9 MPN cases not otherwise classifiable). Of these patients, 7 developed leukemic transformation. The genotyping of the JAK2(V617F) mutation was performed by the amplification-refractory mutation system. RESULTS: Six of the 7 patients were tested for JAK2(V617F) in the chronic phase of their disease, and 3 of these patients were positive for JAK2(V617F). These patients, 2 with polycythemia vera and 1 with essential thrombocythemia, also harbored JAK2(V617F) in the heterozygous state during blast crisis and even after intensive treatment in one of these patients. The other cases that evolved to blast crisis did not harbor the JAK2(V617F) mutation before and after transformation. All 7 patients died despite conventional or supportive treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The transformation of MPNs into acute leukemia is by itself a very rare phenomenon, and so is the persistence of the JAK2(V617F) mutation after blast crisis. In our series, all JAK2(V617F)-positive patients remained positive for this mutation after leukemic transformation, although in the heterozygous state, suggesting that JAK2(V617F) is not essential for transformation in these cases. The fact that all JAK2(V617F)-negative cases remained negative after blast crisis reinforces the theory that other molecular event(s) may play a role in the clonal heterogeneity of MPNs. Owing to the poor outcome of acute myeloid leukemia secondary to MPN, patients should be included in clinical trials of the novel JAK2 inhibitors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This retrospective study involved 121 CML patients including 90 in chronic phase, 8 in accelerated phase and 23 with blast crisis. Of these patients, 85 received related and 36 had unrelated donor allo-HSCT. The conditioning regimens included total body irradiation with cyclophosphamide in 37 patients, and modified BUCY protocol in 84 patients. Cyclosporine A (CsA) and methotrexate (MTX) were used for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis in patients undergoing HLA-matched sibling donor transplants. CsA, MTX, antihuman thymocyte globulin and mycophenolate were used in all the patients undergoing HLA-mismatched related donor and unrelated donor transplants. The prognostic factors of CML were evaluated using Cox regression and the cumulative overall survival and the disease-free survival were estimated using Kaplan and Meier survival analysis model. RESULTS: The incidence of II-IV acute GVHD was 26.1% in HLA-matched and 53.3% in HLA-mismatched cases (P=0.006), with a 5-year cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD of 47.4% and 49.6%, respectively (P=0.947). The 5-year cumulative incidences of disease relapse was 16.7% in the total patients, with a 5-year cumulative overall survival (OS) of 70.5% and disease-free survival (DFS) of 63.4%. The 5-year OS was 78.2% in HLA-matched cases, as compared with 47.6% in HLA-mismatched cases. Multivariate analysis with Cox regression model identified HLA mismatch, II-IV acute GVHD, and advanced phase as the risk factors affecting the OS. CONCLUSION: HLA mismatch can significantly increase the incidence of II-IV acute GVHD following allo-HSCT and decrease the long-term survival rate, which is not related to the donor source.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, our arsenal of approaches used to characterize an individual's acute myeloid leukemia (AML) combines hematopathologic evaluation, flow cytometry, cytogenetic analysis, and molecular studies focused on a few key genes. The advent of high-throughput methods capable of full-genome evaluation presents new options for a revolutionary change in the way we diagnose, characterize, and treat AML. Next-generation DNA sequencing techniques allow full sequencing of a cancer genome or transcriptome, with the hope that this will be affordable for routine clinical care within the decade. Microarray-based testing will define gene and miRNA expression, DNA methylation patterns, chromosomal imbalances, and predisposition to disease and chemosensitivity. The vision for the future entails an integrated and automated approach to these analyses, bringing the possibility of formulating an individualized treatment plan within days of a patient's initial presentation. With these expectations comes the hope that such an approach will lead to decreased toxicities and prolonged survival for patients.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Preclinical (cell-based models) and clinical genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in oncology provide an unprecedented opportunity for a comprehensive and unbiased assessment of the heritable factors associated with drug response. The primary challenge with attempting to identify pharmacogenomic markers from clinical studies is that they require a homogeneous population of patients treated with the same dosage regimen and minimal confounding variables. Therefore, the development of cell-based models for pharmacogenomic marker identification has utility for the field since performing these types of studies in humans is difficult and costly.

Researchers in the past have studied the association between dermatoglyphic features in the hand and congenital diseases and diseases with genetic influences. OBJECTIVE: The present research is intended to study the association between acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and palmar dermatoglyphic characteristics to assess the value of dermatoglyphics as a screening tool to detect leukemia in high risk groups. METHODS: Case-control study conducted at the department of Pediatrics, KMC Attavara, a tertiary care teaching hospital of Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore (Manipal University), India during 2006. Twenty-four children suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia were included in the study. The dermatoglyhic features (ab- ridge count, atd, tda and dat angles) of their palm prints were compared with the age and sex matched controls. RESULTS: The present research indicates an association between dermatoglyphic features and ALL. The mean ab-ridge count, and the mean atd - angle were observed to be higher in cases while the mean tda - angle was found to be lower in cases than controls. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present research are suggestive of a possible trend and an association of dermatoglyphic features with children suffering from ALL. Similar studies can be useful in rare forensic case work where the association of dermatoglyphic features with certain diseases is to be explored.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine.

Nevertheless, given that posaconazole can only be administered orally, alternative prophylaxis may be required. Antifungal prophylaxis with micafungin is an attractive option.

Hierarchic clustering, multidimensional scaling, class prediction, and gene ontology analysis were performed to investigate the potential of miRNAs to serve as radiation biomarkers and to elucidate their likely physiologic roles in the radiation response. RESULTS: The expression levels of 45 miRNAs were statistically significantly upregulated 4 hours after irradiation with 1.25 Gy x-rays, 27 of them in every patient. Nonirradiated and irradiated samples form separate clusters in hierarchic clustering and multidimensional scaling. Out of 223 differentially expressed genes, 37 were both downregulated and predicted targets of the upregulated miRNAs. Paired and unpaired miRNA-based classifiers that we developed can predict the class membership of a sample with unknown irradiation status, with accuracies of 100% when all 45 upregulated miRNAs are included. Both miRNA control of and gene involvement in biologic processes such as hemopoiesis and the immune response are increased after irradiation, whereas metabolic processes are underrepresented among all differentially expressed genes and the genes controlled by miRNAs. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to ionizing radiation leads to the upregulation of the expression of a considerable proportion of the human miRNAome of peripheral blood cells. These miRNA expression signatures can be used as biomarkers of radiation exposure.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.'],['NIHMS440595'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fatty acyl amide derivatives of doxorubicin were synthesized with the expectation to improve the lipophilicity and anticancer activity of the drug. The lipophilicity was enhanced with the increase in chain length of fatty acyl moiety. Conjugation of 4'-amino group with fatty acids through an amide bond reduced the anticancer activity in leukemia, breast, ovarian, and colon cancer cell lines, suggesting that the presence of free amino group is required for anticancer activity of doxorubicin.

The clinical use of m-Amsa and other neoplastic drugs is limited due to side effects and drug resistance. In the present study we evaluated one thiazolo[5,4-b]quinoline derivate, 9-[(3-chloro)phenylamine]-2-[3-(diethylamine)propylamine]thiazolo[5,4-b]quinoline (D3CLP), considered isosteric with 9-anilinoacridines, in order to determine its relative cytotoxic activity in tumoral versus non-tumoral cells, as well as the cell death mechanism induced by D3CLP on K-562 human leukemia cells. D3CLP was found to be four times more cytotoxic to tumor cells than Peripheral Blood Monocyte Cells (PBMCs). On the other hand, D3CLP induces cell death without previous cell cycle arrest at any phase, as shown by flow cytometry after 12 h of exposure to this compound. Interestingly, we detected a subdiploid peak 24 h after treatment. Signs of apoptosis were evident, as detected by TUNEL positive cells, chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation. Effector caspases activation were assessed with peak activity at 24 h after treatment (as detected by fluorometry assays), at which time a subdiploid peak was found in flow cytometry histograms. All data are consistent with the induction of apoptotic cell death in K-562 cells via effector caspases activation. In conclusion, the significant cytotoxicity of D3CLP together with the cell death type it produces, justifies further experimental and preclinical evaluation of this compound in the effort to find new and highly specific anti-tumor agents against leukemia cells.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The prototype TKI, imatinib, selectively inhibits BCR-ABL, as well as several other kinases, including stem cell factor receptor (KIT), discoidin domain receptor (DDR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and colony-stimulating factor receptor-1 (CSF-1R). Although the management of CML improved dramatically with the introduction of imatinib, not all patients benefit from treatment because of resistance or intolerance. Consequently, research efforts have focused on developing more potent TKIs with the ability to circumvent imatinib resistance. Nilotinib, a second-generation oral TKI, was rationally designed based on the crystal structure of imatinib to be highly active against a wide range of imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutants and is approved for the treatment of newly diagnosed or imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CML, and has shown superiority over imatinib in first-line treatment for newly diagnosed CML. Furthermore, the activity of nilotinib against KIT and PDGFRalpha has led to its evaluation in advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST).

Although observational studies do not support a beneficial role of tea intake on prostate cancer risk, phase II clinical trials have demonstrated an inhibitory effect of green tea extract against the progression of prostate pre-malignant lesions. Green tea may exert beneficial effects against mammary carcinogenesis in premenopausal women and recurrence of breast cancer. There is no sufficient evidence that supports a protective role of tea intake on the development of cancers of the colorectum, pancreas, urinary tract, glioma, lymphoma, and leukemia. Future prospective observational studies with biomarkers of exposure and phase III clinical trials are required to provide definitive evidence for the hypothesized beneficial effect of tea consumption on cancer formation in humans.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

A novel cancer therapy utilizing TRAIL is thus urgently needed. RESULTS: In this study, we exploited TRAIL receptor-mediated endocytosis for the first time to produce a cell-permeable molecule, soluble forms of recombinant TRAIL:iron superoxide dismutase (sTRAIL:FeSOD), which possesses sTRAIL-induced apoptotic ability and FeSOD antioxidant activity. The FeSOD component was rapidly introduced into the cell by sTRAIL and intracellular superoxide radical (O2-), which have been implicated as potential modulators of apoptosis in cancer cells, was eliminated, resulting in a highly reduced cellular environment. The decrease in cellular O2-, which was accompanied by a brief accumulation of H2O2 and downregulation of phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) and cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein, sensitized K562 leukemia cells and human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The low H2O2 levels protected human LO2 hepatocytes from sTRAIL:FeSOD-induced apoptosis despite downregulation of p-Akt. We also obtained evidence that the lack of response to sTRAIL:FeSOD in normal T cells occurred because sTRAIL:FeSOD shows much stronger shifts of redox state in erythroleukemia (K562) and HL-60 cells compared to that in normal T cells.

The current study was designed to investigate whether resveratrol could sensitize leukemic cells to proteasome inhibitors. METHODS: Leukemic cells were treated with MG132 alone or in combination with resveratrol. Cell viability was investigated using MTT assay, and induction of apoptosis and cell cycle distribution was measured using flow cytometry. Western blot and real-time RT-PCR were used to investigate the expression of FOXO1 and p27Kip1. CHIP was performed to investigate the binding of FOXO1 to the p27 Kip1 promoter. RESULTS: Resveratrol strongly reduced cytotoxic activities of proteasome inhibitors against leukemic cells. MG132 in combination with resveratrol caused cell cycle blockade at G1/S transition via p27Kip1 accumulation. Knockdown of p27Kip1 using siRNA dramatically attenuated the protective effects of resveratrol on cytotoxic actions of proteasome inhibitors against leukemic cells. Resveratrol induced FOXO1 expression at the transcriptional level, while MG132 increased nuclear distribution of FOXO1. MG132 in combination with resveratrol caused synergistic induction of p27Kip1 through increased recruitment of FOXO1 on the p27Kip1 promoter. CONCLUSIONS: Resveratrol may have the potential to negate the cytotoxic effects of proteasome inhibitors via regulation of FOXO1 transcriptional activity and accumulation of p27Kip1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, neither the mechanisms regulating Taspase1's intracellular localization nor their functional consequences are known. Analysis of endogenous and ectopically expressed Taspase1 detected the protease predominantly in the nucleus accumulating at the nucleolus. Microinjection and ectopic expression studies identified an evolutionarily conserved bipartite nuclear import signal (NLS) (amino acids (197) KRNKRKLELA ERVDTDFMQLKKRR(220) ) interacting with importin-alpha. Notably, an NLS-mutated, import-deficient Taspase1 was biologically inactive. Although the NLS conferred nuclear transport already of the proenzyme, Taspase1's nucleolar localization required its autoproteolytic processing, triggering its interaction with the nucleolar shuttle protein nucleophosmin. In contrast, (auto)catalytically inactive Taspase1 mutants neither accumulated at the nucleolus nor bound nucleophosmin. Active nuclear import and interaction with nucleophosmin was found to be required for the formation of proteolytically active Taspase1 ensuring to efficiently process its nuclear targets. Intriguingly, coexpression of pathological nucleophosmin variants increased the amount of cytoplasmic Taspase1. Hence, Taspase1 appears to exploit the nuclear export activity of nucleophosmin to gain transient access to the cytoplasm required to also cleave its cytoplasmic substrates. Collectively, we here describe a hitherto unknown mechanism regulating the biological activity of this protease.",['(c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytochrome P450 3A5 (CYP3A5) plays a crucial role in the catalytic oxidation of endogenous metabolites and toxic substances, including chemotherapeutic agents. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (CYP3A5*3 6986A>G), which renders low enzyme activity, in the risk of developing ALL and in the outcome for children with ALL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six hundred and sixteen childhood patients with ALL and 203 controls were genotyped by allelic discrimination. RESULTS: Individuals with the A allele had a 64% increased risk of developing childhood ALL (odds ratio = 1.64; 95% CI, 1.009-2.657). In general, event-free survival (EFS) did not differ in relation to CYP3A5 genotype. However, for patients with T-ALL, presence of the A allele was associated with better prognosis (EFS = 94.1%), while patients with the low-activity GG genotype only had an EFS of 61.5% (P = 0.015). Thus, for patients with T-ALL having no A allele and therefore low expression of CYP3A5, the risk of experiencing an event was almost eight times higher compared to those having at least one A allele (P = 0.045, hazard ratio = 7.749; 95% CI, 1.044-57.52). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that genetics may play a role in the risk of developing childhood ALL and indicates that improved treatment stratification of childhood patients with ALL may require addition of host genetic information.",['(c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations involving FLT3 are among the most common molecular abnormalities in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Available evidence suggests that these molecular lesions confer a shorter disease-free survival and overall survival in patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics. Therefore, substantial interest in FLT3 as a therapeutic target has led to the development of several promising inhibitors that target this tyrosine kinase. AREAS COVERED: This review covers the molecular pathways associated with FLT3 activation in patients with AML, the biological rationale for inhibiting FLT3 and recent clinical progress with FLT3 inhibitors for the treatment of AML. Six FLT3 inhibitors undergoing clinical evaluation are discussed. A review of selected published manuscripts on the subject of FLT3 inhibition in AML and a search of the English language manuscripts in PubMed using the index words FLT3 and AML were conducted and articles of interest selected. EXPERT OPINION: Mutated forms of FLT3, specifically FLT3-internal tandem duplication, have a significant impact on the prognosis of AML patients, particularly those with a normal karyotype. Inhibiting FLT3 may lead to clinical benefit for patients with AML. Newly developed FLT3 inhibitors have shown encouraging activity as monotherapy and in combination with other therapeutic agents.",,['NIHMS596173'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the entire CLL population, the cumulative prevalence of RS development steadily increases at a rate of 1% per year. Considering conventional predictors of CLL, patient subgroups at high risk of developing RS are characterized by the expression of CD38, absence of del13q14, and a lymph node size >3 cm. Novel risk factors for predicting RS development at CLL diagnosis have been recently identified and include: the host genotype of the CD38 locus and of other genes; telomere length of CLL cells; stereotyped B-cell receptor; and usage of specific immunoglobulin variable genes (IGHV4-39). Importantly, although some risk factors predict both CLL progression and transformation to RS, others (CD38 genotype, absence of del13q14, IGHV4-39 usage, stereotyped B-cell receptor) appear to specifically predict RS. The definition of RS encompasses at least two different conditions: DLBCLs that are clonally related to the pre-existing CLL (accounting for most cases), or DLBCL unrelated to the CLL clone. The transition from CLL to clonally related RS is accompanied by the acquisition of novel genetic alterations that may account for the chemorefractoriness of RS.

Despite outstanding results in long-term survival of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, development of therapies for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have lagged behind. AML in children demonstrate similar long-term survival compared with adults 18-65 years of age: 40-50% overall long-term survival. AML is a heterogeneous disease in both adults and children, but the presence of recurrent chromosome translocations and mutations in children are lower than in adult AML. In particular, patients without chromosome aberrancies have been examined for stratification through examination of gene expression. The paper from Baglobind and coauthors proposes a useful prognostication by gene-expression analysis of 75 gene pairs in 40% of patient cases, accurately discriminating mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene rearrangement, t(8;21)(q22;q22), inv(16)(p13q22), t(15;17)(q21;q22) and t(7;12)(q36;p13)-positive AML. Gene-expression analysis of AML has provided an important research tool for uncovering information about AML biology that can be used for the development of novel therapies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2011 Mar 21.,,,,"This review deals with the cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and its receptor, CD74. MIF and CD74 have been shown to regulate peripheral B cell survival and were associated with tumor progression and metastasis. CD74 expression has been suggested to serve as a prognostic factor in many cancers, with higher relative expression of CD74 behaving as a marker of tumor progression. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, binding of MIF to CD74 induces nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation and up-regulation of TAp63 expression, resulting in the secretion of interleukin 8 (IL-8), which in turn promotes cell survival. In addition, TAp63 expression elevates expression of the integrin VLA-4, particularly during the advanced stage of the disease. Blocking of CD74, TAp63, or VLA-4 inhibits the in vivo homing of CLL cells to the BM. Thus, CD74 and its target genes, TAp63 and VLA-4, facilitate migration of CLL cells back to the BM, where they interact with the supportive BM environment that helps rescue them from apoptosis. These results are expected to pave the way toward novel therapeutic strategies aimed at interrupting this survival pathway. One such agent, the monocolonal antibody milatuzumab directed at CD74, is already being studied in early clinical trials.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New therapeutic modalities including monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab and immunotoxins such as BL22 are now available. Furthermore, progress in the identification of minimal residual disease (MRD) using consensus primer or patient specific polymerase chain reaction for the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region gene (IGHV), as well as multiparameter flow cytometry, allows for the detection and eradication of MRD.

Over the 8 years, the patient has gradually developed severe kidney failure, even though the criteria for B-CLL treatment had not been fulfilled. Kidney biopsy revealed renal damage due to lamda free light chains cast nephropathy as well as an infiltration of renal parenchyma with B-CLL cells. It was not before this biopsy that the presence of monoclonal immunoglobulins has been investigated. Immunofixation identified free monoclonal lamda light chains in the serum and urine. Their serum concentration, quantified by densitometry, was 2.6 g/l and urine concentration was 0.5 g/l. A specific evaluation of free light chains in the serum revealed an extremely high concentration of free X light chains, over 4500 mg/l, and normal concentration of K free light chains, 10 mg/l. The aim of this report is to emphasise that monoclonal immunoglobulin may be present in B-CLL as well as other lymphoprolipherative diseases and that it may cause damage to organs, similar to multiple myeloma or monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. The described case confirms poor prognostic value of monoclonal immunoglobulin free light chains in patients with B-CLL and usefulness of an evaluation of their presence in patients with B-CLL, particularly if the patients have increased creatinine level.

The present article gives the rationale of the recommendations in full detail. The CZEMP diagnostic criteria for ET and PMF are based on histopathological (HP) findings, which must unconditionally be in line with the given clinical and laboratory characteristics of ET or of a certain stage of PMF, respectively. The platelet count is not decisive for diagnosis. In cases lacking an adequately taken and read HP finding, the Polycythemia Vera Study Group (PVSG) criteria are recommended. The diagnosis of typical PV is based on demonstration of the V617F mutation of the JAK2 gene along with a significant increase of red cell parameters. If these are close to borderline, the demonstration of increased total red cell mass (RCM) is required. In atypical cases lacking polyglobulia or elevated RCM, the HP picture of PV (in accordance with WHO description) plus JAK2 V617F mutation is satisfactory for diagnosis, or, in cases lacking JAK2 V617F mutation, the HP picture of PV along with polyglobulia (or increased RCM) is sufficient. The treatment principles of ET and other MPDs with thrombocythemia (MPD-T; i.e., the early stages of PMF and PV) are identical. The patients are stratified by their thrombotic risk (preceding thrombosis, another thrombophilic state, jAK2 mutation), presence of disease symptoms (mainly microcirculatory), platelet count and age. Only patients up to 65 years lacking the above mentioned risks with a platelet count < 1000 x 10(9)/l are considered as low-risk and do not demand cytoreducing therapy. The others are high-risk ones and have an indication for thromboreduction. In patients older than 65 years, the potentially leukemogenic drug hydroxyurea (HU) may be used. In the younger ones, the choice is between anagrelide (ANG) or interferon-alpha (IFN). In high-risk patients, the treatment goal is to maintain platelet counts below 400, and in low-risk ones, below 600 x 10(9)/l. In PV, polycythemia itself is another thrombotic risk factor. The condition is treated by bloodletting or erythrocytaphereses. If hematocrit levels < or =45 are not achieved, cytoreductive therapy using HU in patients over 65 years, or IFN in younger individuals is required. All patients with thrombocythemia in PV are high-risk and have an indication for cytoreduction. Acetylsalicylic acid is given to all patients with MPD-T with platelets < 1000 x 10(9)/l (at higher counts, hemorrhage is imminent), and to all individuals with PV, unless contraindication is present. In case of platelet count normalization, it may be withdrawn in cases of low-risk ET or PMF, not in JAK2+ PV. The treatment of advanced stages of PMF is symptomatic, with substitution of blood derivatives being the basis. The only curative treatment is allogeneic stem cell transplantation, which should not be indicated too early seeing to its risks, but also not too late--we must not allow transition into acute leukemia, which is heralded by blasts in the blood picture. The indication is the presence of any of the following criteria: values of hemoglobin < 10 g/dl, WBC < 4 x 10(9)/l and platelets < 100 x 10(9)/l, any percentage of blasts or > or = 10% immature granulocytes in the differential picture, >1 erythroblast per 100 cells--all at repeated examinations within at least a 2-month interval, and in addition, rapid progression of hepato-/splenomegaly, presence of general symptoms of the disease, portal hypertension and extensive swellings.",,,,,,,,['Vnitr Lek. 2011 Feb;57(2):138-9.

METHODS: Using skin organ cultures, lentiviral vector tropism was compared with that of keratinocytes in cell culture. Furthermore, the tropism of lentiviral vector to mouse and human tissues was compared ex vivo, in attempt to validate the mouse skin as an experimental system for human gene therapy of skin diseases. RESULTS: The results obtained indicated that although early progenitor keratinocytes (keratin 15+ and p63+), when grown in culture are permissive to lentiviral vector, they are resistant to transduction in their native 'niche' in the skin tissue. Transiently amplifying keratinocytes (keratin 14+) on the other hand, are permissive to lentiviral vector transduction, in cell culture and in the skin, after separation of the epidermis from the dermis layer. Keratinocytes (keratin 14+) in the hair follicle of human skin are resistant to lentiviral transduction, even after partial digestion of the extracellular matrix collagen. By contrast, collagenase pretreatment of mouse tissue facilitated transduction of keratinocytes within the hair follicle. Because lentivirus pseudotyped by two envelopes (amphotropic murine leukemia virus and vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein) display the same tropism, we suggest that receptor availability is not the critical factor in the pattern of skin tissue transduction. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the results obtained in the present study indicate that lentiviral vector tropism in the three-dimensional skin tissue is distinct from the tropism to keratinocytes in culture and is dependent on a complex interplay of extracellular restrictions.","['Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Using three color flow cytometry, we identified leukemia-associated phenotypes (LAP) in bone marrow specimens at diagnosis and assessed the relationship between clinical outcomes and the presence of marrow MRD in 33 patients who achieved a morphologic complete remission (CR) and were followed after CR. RESULTS: Of 33 consecutive patients, we detected MRD in 20 patients after achieving CR (Group A) and did not in 13 patients (Group B), with 2-year overall survival (OS) rates of 49.0% and 84.6%, respectively (P =.0317), and relapse-free survival (RFS) rates of 13.7% and 91.7%, respectively (P=.0010). By multivariate analysis, MRD-positivity at post-induction was found to be associated with a shorter duration of RFS (P=.0042). Notably, we achieved MRD negativity in only 2 patients (10%) of Group A in spite of subsequent intensive consolidation therapies and found that the fluctuation of the MRD level during consolidation therapies was not a significant prognostic factor. Four patients in Group A underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) when in the CR state and did not experience relapse at a median follow-up period of 20.5 months after HSCT. CONCLUSIONS: MRD is critical for predicting de novo AML outcomes. Most MRD-positive patients cannot achieve MRD negativity with conventional chemotherapy. Thus, HSCT may be the primary therapeutic option for these patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although HCV has been demonstrated to directly infect peripheral blood mononuclear cells both in vitro and, in some cases, in vivo, a strong body of evidence rather supports the hypothesis of an indirect transformation mechanism by which sustained antigenic stimulation leads from oligoclonal to monoclonal expansion and sometimes to lymphoma, probably through secondary oncogenic events. Here, we review epidemiological and biological studies, as well as clinical data on antiviral therapy, linking HCV-infection to B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because she was otherwise asymptomatic but continued showing elevated neutrophil levels, she sought a second opinion at our facility. Serum protein immunoelectrophoresis with immunofixation revealed an immunoglobulin A (IgA)-kappa monoclonal gammopathy concentration of 1305 mg/dL (normal 80-350 mg/dL) but relatively normal concentrations of IgG of 840 mg/dL (620-1400 mg/dL) and IgM of 36 mg/dL (45-250 mg/dL). Using clonal analysis, we found a polyclonal expression pattern in all cell types analyzed. Comprehensive work-up for multiple myeloma and infectious etiology of neutrophilia was negative. We concluded that our patient's neutrophilia may have been due to the underlying monoclonal gammopathy. This is the first case in the literature of a patient with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance presenting with chronic neutrophilia, mimicking chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL).

It represents one of the most common genetic alterations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However there is still controversy about its clinical relevance on the treatment outcome of this leukemia. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to clarify the biologic and prognostic impact of K-RAS mutations in relation to the dose of cytarabine (ara-C) used in post induction consolidation chemotherapy in adult AML patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study comprised 71de novo AML patients with a male: Female ratio of 1.4: 1; their ages ranged from 21-59 years with a median of 37 years. They were subjected to full clinical evaluation, routine laboratory investigations, cytogenetic studies by G banding and K-RAS mutation detection using realtime PCR. The patients were randomized into 2 groups (gps) according to the ara-C dose used in consolidation treatment, HDAC gp receiving 400 mg ara-C and LDAC gp receiving 100mg ara-C. They were followed over a period of 5 years. RESULTS: Mutations in the K-RAS gene (mutRAS) were detected in 23 patients (32%) with the remaining 48 patients (68%) having wild type RAS (wtRAS). Blast cell percentage was significantly lower in mutRAS compared to wtRAS patients (p</=0.001). The M4 subtype of AML and cases with Inv 16 showed significantly higher frequencies in mutRAS compared to wtRAS patients, (p=0.015, 0.003, respectively). The patients were followed up for a median of 43 months (range 11-57 months). There was no significant difference in overall survival (OS) between mutRAS and wtRAS patients (p=0.326). Within the mutRAS patients treated with HDAC, cumulative OS was significantly higher than those treated with LDAC (p=0.001). This was not the case in the wtRAS group (p=0.285). There was no significant difference in disease free survival (DFS) between mutRAS and wtRAS groups (p=0.923). MutRAS patients treated with HDAC had a statistically higher cumulative DFS than mutRAS patients treated with LDAC (p=0.001). Patients with wtRAS also benefited from HDAC but to a lesser extent. Among patients with wtRAS, those treated with HDAC showed higher cumulative and median DFS than patients treated with LDAC (p=0.031). CONCLUSION: Adult AML patients carrying mutations in the K-RAS gene benefit from higher cytarabine doses more than wtRAS patients, so pretreatment mutation detection could be an important predictor for treatment strategy and survival of adult AML patients. These findings counter the prevailing bias that oncogene mutations lead to more aggressive behavior in human malignancies.

Despite the significant progress in the treatment of infectious complications, infection-related morbidity and mortality continue to be of great importance. Prompt initiation of the appropriate empiric antibiotic treatment has improved infection outcome. The aim of the present study is to assess the type, frequency, and severity of infectious complications in a cohort of pediatric cancer patients treated at a single medical institution. We also aim to identify factors affecting bloodstream infections in newly diagnosed ALL and AML pediatric patients during the induction phase of treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was carried out at the Department of Pediatric Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, during the time period from January 1st to June 30th 2007. Inclusion criteria were pediatric age group (from 0-16 years), newly diagnosed acute leukemia, positive blood culture and documented site of infection. Data were analyzed using the SPSS package version 15. A p-value </=0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: This is a retrospective study including 100 newly diagnosed cases of acute leukemia. Fifty-four patients had ALL, and 46 patients had AML. 348 infectious episodes were recorded. Blood stream infections (BSI) occurred once or twice in 32%, 3-4 episodes in 58%, and five or more episodes in 10% of the cases. Gram-positive cocci were the most frequently observed cause of BSI, accounting for 77.9% of the total isolates followed by Gram negative organisms seen in 18.9% and mixed infections in 8%. The majority of the episodes (n= 208, 58.4%) responded to first-line empirical antibiotic therapy. CONCLUSION: Clinical and laboratory risk factors could be identified and can help prediction of serious BSI.

CD38 expression has also been suggested as a surrogate marker for the IgVH mutation status. AIM: We aimed to investigate the impact of ZAP-70 and CD38 expressions as well as their combined expressions on the treatment outcome and survival of our CLL patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 50 CLL patients as well as10 normal volunteers as a control group. All patients were subjected to complete work up and immunophenotyping to confirm the diagnosis. ZAP-70 and CD38 expressions were studied in (CD19+, CD5+) B cells. Results were expressed as percent expression and mean flourecent index (MFI). Results were correlated to the treatment outcome and survival as well as to other prognostic markers of CLL including TLC, Hb level, platelets count, modified Rai staging at diagnosis, P53 and BCL 2. RESULTS: A significant association was found between ZAP-70 percent expression and the diffuse pattern of bone marrow infiltration (p<0.002) as well as the P53 percent expression (p=0.005). A Significant increase in serum levels of LDH and B2M in ZAP-70 positive as compared to negative groups was detected (p=0.049 and 0.007 respectively). A higher number of non-responding patients was reported in the ZAP70 positive as compared to ZAP70 negative group (p<0.001). ZAP-70 percent expression was significantly associated with shorter time to disease progression (TDP) and shorter overall survival (p=0.025 and 0.029 respectively). A significant increase in serum levels of B2M in CD38 percent positive as compared to negative group was encountered (p=0.045). CD38-MFI showed a significant associations to advanced modified Rai staging at diagnosis (p=0.019) and to higher serum levels of both LDH and B2M (p=0.03 and 0.05 respectively). CD38, either expressed as a percentage or as MFI, showed a significant association with the non-responders (p=0.034 and 0.006 respectively). There was a significant inverse relation between CD38 expression and time to disease progression (p=0.033) while no significant relation was encountered with overall survival (p=0.197). Combined expression of both markers, ZAP-70+ /CD38+ was reported in 5 patients (10%) while ZAP-70- /CD38- expression was encountered in 24 patients (48%). Patients with either ZAP-70+ or CD38+ represented 42% of the cases (21 patients).There were significant differences between the three groups and the initial response to chemotherapy (p=<0.001) and the pattern of bone morrow infiltration (p=0.015), while no significant relation was found with age, sex, modified Rai staging at diagnosis or BCL2 percent expression. Patients with combined expression of ZAP-70 and CD38 had significantly shorter TDP and overall survival (p<0.001 and 0.03 respectively). CONCLUSION: ZAP-70 is one of the most important prognostic markers in CLL, it appears to be more predictive of disease progression and poor outcome than CD38 expression. Semi quantification of the CD38 antigen by flowcytometry greatly improves the prognostic value of its expression. The combination of ZAP-70 and CD38 increases the prognostic power of either alone.

In this invited review article, we reminisce on the discovery of Bcl-2, the first regulator of cell death identified, we discuss the mechanisms that control apoptotic cell death, focussing on how defects in this process promote the development and sustained growth of tumours and also affect their responses to anticancer therapeutics and, finally, we describe how current knowledge of the regulatory networks of apoptosis is exploited to develop novel approaches for cancer therapy.",,['NIHMS283921'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Amino acid R882, located in the methyltransferase domain of DNMT3A, was the most common mutation site, accounting for 4/13 mutations. DNMT3A mutations were expressed in the majority of cells in all tested mutant samples regardless of myeloblast counts, suggesting that DNMT3A mutations occur early in the course of MDS.

Here, we have selected clinically relevant genes and SNPs through literature screening, and on the basis of associations with key pathways, protein-protein interactions or downstream partners that have a role in drug disposition and treatment efficacy in childhood ALL. This allows exploration of pathways, where one of several genetic variants may lead to similar clinical phenotypes through related molecular mechanisms. We have designed a cost-effective, high-throughput capture assay of approximately 25,000 clinically relevant SNPs, and demonstrated that multiple samples can be tagged and pooled before genome capture in targeted enrichment with a sufficient sequencing depth for genotyping.

CD71 (transferring receptor-1) is known to be expressed in the earliest erythroid precursors, and has been useful for flow cytometry. However, CD71 is also regarded as a proliferation marker, and its lineage specificity has not been systemically investigated by immunohistochemistry in detail. In this study, we found that CD71 was strongly expressed in all erythroid precursors in normal and dyspoietic marrows. Staining of CD71 effectively highlighted pronormoblasts in all 4 cases of parvovirus infection and erythroblasts in all 6 cases of acute erythroleukemia, for which staining of glycophorin A and hemoglobin A was either absent or unreliable. CD71 was absent in the background mature red blood cells in general, nonerythroid elements in the normal marrow, myeloid precursors in myeloproliferative disorders, and blasts in nearly all acute myeloid leukemia encompassing all common French-American-British subtypes. Benign lymphoid infiltrates and low-grade lymphomas involving the marrow also lacked detectable CD71. Although weak CD71 expression was found in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and 1 of 2 cases of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, it had little impact on interpretation due to a high signal-to-noise ratio of the staining intensities when compared with erythroid precursors in the same section. We conclude that CD71 is selectively expressed at high levels in erythroid precursors, including those at early maturation stages. It can be reliably used as an independent erythroid marker for immunohistochemical analysis of the marrow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Induction of chronic oxidative stress has been assumed to play an important role in mediating the effect of IR on the haematopoietic system. However, there was no direct evidence to support this hypothesis prior to our studies. In our recent studies, we showed that exposure of mice to total body irradiation (TBI) induces persistent oxidative stress selectively in haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) at least in part via up-regulation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NOX) 4. Now, we found that post-TBI treatment with diphenylene iodonium (DPI), a pan NOX inhibitor, not only significantly reduces TBI-induced increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, oxidative DNA damage and DNA double-strand breaks in HSCs but also dramatically decreases the number of cells with unstable chromosomal aberrations in the clonal progeny of irradiated HSCs. The effects of DPI are comparable to Mn (III) meso-tetrakis (N-ethylpyridinium-2-yl) porphyrin, a superoxide dismutase mimetic and a potent antioxidant. These findings demonstrate that increased production of ROS by NOX in HSCs mediates the induction of haematopoietic genomic instability by IR and that NOX may represent a novel molecular target to inhibit TBI-induced genomic instability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2011 Mar 17.,,,,"Homoharringtonine (HHT) has been reported to be effective in a portion of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). To investigate its mechanism of action, cell growth inhibition and cytotoxicity of HHT were investigated in three AML cell lines, HL-60, NB4, and U937, and in three CML cell lines, K562, KU812, and KCL22. AML cells were more sensitive than CML cells to HHT-induced cytotoxicity. Using HL-60 cells, it was revealed that HHT decreased the levels of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), survivin, and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-homology domain 3 (BH3)-only proteins as well as the mitochondrial membrane potential. The levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), and Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer (Bak) proteins in HL-60 cells were not changed after HHT treatment. U937, K562, KU812, and KCL22 cells expressed B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL) and were less responsive to HHT-induced apoptosis than HL-60 cells. Silencing Mcl-1 or Bcl-xL, but not XIAP or survivin, enhanced HHT-induced apoptosis in U937 cells. The levels of HHT-induced apoptosis in K562, KCL22, and KU812 cells were inversely correlated with the levels of Bcl-xL but not those of Bcl-2 or Mcl-1. K562 cells expressing high levels of Bcl-xL but no Bcl-2 were less responsive to HHT-induced apoptosis than KCL22 cells that expressed lower levels of Bcl-xL and higher levels of Bcl-2 protein. In K562 cells, knockdown of Bcl-xL, but not of Mcl-1, enhanced HHT-induced apoptosis. Transfection of Bcl-xL into KCL22 cells attenuated HHT-induced apoptosis. These data suggest that Bcl-xL plays a more important role than Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 in protecting against HHT-induced apoptosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Combinations of different experimental approaches were used, including immunoblotting to detect phosphorylated/activated forms of elements of the mTOR pathway in leukemic cell lines and primary AML blasts; cell-proliferation assays; direct assessment of mRNA translation in polysomal fractions of leukemic cells; and clonogenic assays in methylcellulose to evaluate leukemic progenitor-colony formation. RESULTS: mTORC2 complexes are active in AML cells and play critical roles in leukemogenesis. RI-mTORC1 complexes are also formed and regulate the activity of the translational repressor 4E-BP1 in AML cells. OSI-027 blocks mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities and suppresses mRNA translation of cyclin D1 and other genes that mediate proliferative responses in AML cells. Moreover, OSI-027 acts as a potent suppressor of primitive leukemic precursors from AML patients and is much more effective than rapamycin in eliciting antileukemic effects in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Dual targeting of mTORC2 and mTORC1 results in potent suppressive effects on primitive leukemic progenitors from AML patients. Inhibition of the mTOR catalytic site with OSI-027 results in suppression of both mTORC2 and RI-mTORC1 complexes and elicits much more potent antileukemic responses than selective mTORC1 targeting with rapamycin.",,['NIHMS282074'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Besides, one of our cases of UELS, in a 58-year-old woman, is an extremely rare presentation of such a tumor in a middle-aged adult. The patient's clinical features, therapy, and pathologic results were reviewed; immunohistochemical analysis and, in 2 cases, electron microscopy were performed. In this study, all 3 patients were females aged 13, 13, and 58 years. Histopathologic evaluation of resected liver tumors confirmed the diagnosis of UELS in all of them. In 2 of the cases, metachronous occurrence of UELS with vaginal embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma in a teenage girl and B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia in a middle-aged woman is described. Careful clinical analysis, histologic studies, and immunohistochemistry are mandatory to distinguish UELS from other hepatic malignancies with similar or overlapping features and to exclude the possibility of other tumors that may be considered in the differential diagnosis.

Still, little is known about the expression of these molecules in different types of leukemia and our study aims to fill this gap. By using an RT-qPCR approach, we have systemically analyzed the expression of three IGF2BP coding genes in normal hematopoietic tissues and distinct acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) entities. We show that low/negative IGF2BP1 and IGF2BP3 and high IGF2BP2 levels are characteristic to healthy donor bone marrow and peripheral blood whereas different B-ALL entities displayed characteristic perturbations of IGF2BP expression patterns. Namely, we have identified significant associations of overexpressed IGF2BP1 with ETV6/RUNX1-positive (r(2)=0.7891, y=0.8105x-0.4471, p<0.0001), underexpressed IGF2BP2 with E2A/PBX1-positive (p<0.01), and overexpressed IGF2BP2 and IGF2BP3 with MLL/AF4-positive (r(2)=0.6571, y=0.1507x-0.2722, p<0.0001, and r(2)=0.7022, y=0.6482x-0.7660, p<0.0001, respectively) leukemia. Secondly, based on transcript expression dynamics during follow-up, we conclude that overexpression of only IGF2BP1 is inherent characteristic of ETV6/RUNX1-positive leukemic blasts in contrast to IGF2BP3 which remained stably expressed throughout the monitoring period and upon the achievement of molecular remission. Finally, our data suggest that IGF2BP3 might be a marker of disease aggressiveness in BCR/ABL1-positive ALL as consistently increasing levels of this transcript during follow-up predicted eventual leukemia relapse by three months. Altogether, our results highlight the potential utility of IGF2BP profiling in precursor B lymphoid neoplasms as the functions of IGF2BPs in normal and malignant hematopoiesis are further delineated.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

To evaluate the risk of XMRV infection during blood transfusion in Japan, we screened three populations--healthy donors (n = 500), patients with PC (n = 67), and patients with CFS (n = 100)--for antibodies against XMRV proteins in freshly collected blood samples. We also examined blood samples of viral antibody-positive patients with PC and all (both antibody-positive and antibody-negative) patients with CFS for XMRV DNA. RESULTS: Antibody screening by immunoblot analysis showed that a fraction of the cases (1.6-3.0%) possessed anti-Gag antibodies regardless of their gender or disease condition. Most of these antibodies were highly specific to XMRV Gag capsid protein, but none of the individuals in the three tested populations retained strong antibody responses to multiple XMRV proteins. In the viral antibody-positive PC patients, we occasionally detected XMRV genes in plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells but failed to isolate an infectious or full-length XMRV. Further, all CFS patients tested negative for XMRV DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. CONCLUSION: Our data show no solid evidence of XMRV infection in any of the three populations tested, implying that there is no association between the onset of PC or CFS and XMRV infection in Japan. However, the lack of adequate human specimens as a positive control in Ab screening and the limited sample size do not allow us to draw a firm conclusion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ) gene, which is encoded by the minus strand of the viral genome, is expressed as an antisense transcript in all ATL cases. By using yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) as an HBZ-interacting protein. ATF3 has been reported to be expressed in ATL cells, but its biological significance is not known. RESULTS: Immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that ATF3 interacts with HBZ. Expression of ATF3 was upregulated in ATL cell lines and fresh ATL cases. Reporter assay revealed that ATF3 could interfere with the HTLV-1 Tax's transactivation of the 5' proviral long terminal repeat (LTR), doing so by affecting the ATF/CRE site, as well as HBZ. Suppressing ATF3 expression inhibited proliferation and strongly reduced the viability of ATL cells. As mechanisms of growth-promoting activity of ATF3, comparative expression profiling of ATF3 knockdown cells identified candidate genes that are critical for the cell cycle and cell death, including cell division cycle 2 (CDC2) and cyclin E2. ATF3 also enhanced p53 transcriptional activity, but this activity was suppressed by HBZ. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, ATF3 expression has positive and negative effects on the proliferation and survival of ATL cells. HBZ impedes its negative effects, leaving ATF3 to promote proliferation of ATL cells via mechanisms including upregulation of CDC2 and cyclin E2. Both HBZ and ATF3 suppress Tax expression, which enables infected cells to escape the host immune system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2011 Apr 14.,,,,"Regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) controls the communication between cells and the extracellular environment. RIP is essential in the nervous system, but also in other tissues. In the RIP process, a membrane protein typically undergoes two consecutive cleavages. The first one results in the shedding of its ectodomain. The second one occurs within its transmembrane domain, resulting in secretion of a small peptide and the release of the intracellular domain into the cytosol. The proteolytic cleavage fragments act as versatile signaling molecules or are further degraded. An increasing number of membrane proteins undergo RIP. These include growth factors, cytokines, cell adhesion proteins, receptors, viral proteins and signal peptides. A dysregulation of RIP is found in diseases, such as leukemia and Alzheimer's disease. One of the first RIP substrates discovered was the amyloid precursor protein (APP). RIP processing of APP controls the generation of the amyloid beta-peptide, which is believed to cause Alzheimer's disease. Focusing on APP as the best-studied RIP substrate, this review describes the function and mechanism of the APP RIP proteases with the goal to elucidate cellular mechanisms and common principles of the RIP process in general.","['(c) 2011 The Authors.

Of the classes of drugs capable of inducing acute pancreatitis, we aimed to evaluate, in which class tyrosine kinase inhibitors can be allocated. A search was carried out using the MEDLINE database in order to select the data existing in the literature on pyrimidines and acute pancreatitis or serum lipase/amylase elevation covering the period from January 1966 to January 2010; thirteen papers were found and utilized for this review. Based on the data in the literature, we found that tyrosine kinase inhibitors may often cause an increase in pancreatic enzymes in plasma and patients treated with these drugs, especially those who are treated with sorafenib, might be at risk of developing acute pancreatitis. Whether acute pancreatitis due to tyrosine kinase inhibitors is associated only with sorafenib or may also be caused by other drugs of the same class remains an open question.

Furthermore, U937 cells were transfected with siRNA-2 of IGFBP7 (as U937R) for 24 hours. Coculture experiment was performed to explore the impact of IGFBP7 gene in U937 cell adhesion, invasion, and migration in existing ECV304 cells, which mimicked the interaction between AML cells and endothelial cells. IGFBP7 expression at the initial diagnosed stage and relapse of AML was significantly higher than that of control (P < .001). The viable cell percentage in transfected cell was significantly decreased by 42% compared with control groups (P < .01). The percentage for U937R cells adherent to ECV304 cells was significantly lower than the control groups (P < .01). Matrigel study to quantify the invasive potential showed that U937R migrated to the lower chamber were significantly less than those in the parental control groups (P < .01).

Patients who develop resistance to imatinib are advised to switch to second-generation TKIs. Although specific mutations in the breakpoint cluster region-v-abl Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene (BCR-ABL) kinase domain may guide treatment selection in such scenarios, the choice is driven by other factors in the majority of patients, including the toxicity profiles of the newer TKIs as well as a patient's comorbidities.",['Copyright (c) 2011 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evaluation of late effects and analysis of factors contributing to their occurrence has become of major importance. Second neoplasm (SN) belongs to the most severe late events. PROCEDURE: We report the incidence of SN which occurred in patients recruited in EORTC trial 58881 for children with ALL or LL. The front-line treatment regimen was adapted from the BFM protocol, but did not include cranial radiotherapy, even in patients with initial involvement of the central nervous system. A total of 2,216 patients were recruited, of whom 2,136 achieved complete remission (CR). RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 7.5 years, 22 (1%) patients developed a SN: 20 during or after completion of front-line therapy and 2 in second CR, after relapse treatment including haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Ten patients developed acute myeloblastic leukaemia. Only one SN, a glioblastoma, was a brain tumour. Other SN were: two Hodgkin lymphomas, one non-Hodgkin lymphoma, two thyroid cancers, one osteosarcoma, two soft tissue sarcomas, one Ewing sarcoma, one cutaneous histiocytosis and one peritoneal carcinomatosis. The cumulative incidences of SN at 5, 8 and 13 years after registration were 0.8% (SE 0.2%), 1.0% (SE 0.2%) and 3.0% (SE 1.9%), respectively. CONCLUSION: The overall incidence rate of SN is comparable to that reported previously. In spite of short follow-up time, the low incidence of brain tumours might be related to the omission of cranial radiotherapy.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,['EORTC Children Leukaemia Group (CLG)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It remains uncertain whether viral vaccinations in these patients are supported by good evidence. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine the effectiveness and safety of viral vaccines in patients with hematological malignancies. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL (June 2010), reference lists of relevant papers, abstracts from scientific meetings and contacted vaccine manufacturers. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating viral vaccines in patients with hematological malignancies were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Relative risk (RR) was used for binary data and mean difference (MD) for continuous data. Primary outcome was incidence of infection. Secondary outcomes were mortality, incidence of complications and severe viral infection, hospitalization, immune response and adverse effects. Fixed-effect model was used in meta-analyses. MAIN RESULTS: Eight RCTs were included, with 305 patients in the intervention groups and 288 in the control groups. They evaluated heat-inactivated varicella zoster virus (VZV) vaccine (two trials), influenza vaccines (five trials) and inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) (one trial). Seven trials had high and one trial had moderate risk of bias.VZV vaccine might reduce herpes zoster compared to no vaccine (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.3 to 1.0, P=0.05), but not statistically significant. Vaccination also demonstrated efficacy in immune response but frequently caused local adverse effects. One trial reported severity score of zoster, which favored vaccination (MD 2.6, 95% CI 0.94 to 4.26, P=0.002).Two RCTs compared inactivated influenza vaccine with no vaccine and reported lower risk of lower respiratory infections (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.78, P=0.008) and hospitalization (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.31, P<0.00001) in vaccine recipients. However, vaccine recipients more frequently experienced irritability and local adverse effects. There was no significant difference in seroconversion between one and two doses of influenza vaccine (one trial), or between recombinant and standard influenza vaccine (one trial), or influenza vaccine given with or without re-induction chemotherapy (one trial).The IPV trial comparing vaccination starting at 6 versus 18 months after stem cell transplant (SCT) found no significant difference in seroconversion. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Inactivated VZV vaccine might reduce zoster severity in adult SCT recipients. Inactivated influenza vaccine might reduce respiratory infections and hospitalization in adults with multiple myeloma or children with leukemia or lymphoma. However, the quality of evidence is low. Local adverse effects occur frequently. Further high-quality RCTs are needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Xpcl1 encodes miR-106a~363, a cluster of microRNAs that are expressed in response to adjacent retroviral integrations. We report the first large-scale profile of microRNA expression in MuLV-induced lymphomas, in combination with microarray gene expression analysis. The source material was T-cell lymphomas induced by M-MuLV in p27(Kip1) knockout mice and normal thymus. Surprisingly, the overall levels of miRNA expression were equivalent in lymphomas and normal thymus. Nonetheless, the expression of specific microRNAs was altered in tumors. The miR-106a~363 miRNA were over-expressed in lymphomas, particularly those with viral integrations at the Xpcl1 locus. In contrast, p27(Kip1) deletion itself was associated with a different pattern of microRNA expression. Gene expression was dramatically altered in lymphomas, yet paralleled data from T-cell lymphomas induced by other mechanisms. Genes with altered expression in association with the p27(Kip1) null genotype were of similar functional classes to those associated with Xpcl1 integration, but with the opposite pattern of expression. Thus, the effect of p27(Kip1) deletion may be to oppose an anti-oncogenic effect of Xpcl1 rather than enhancing its oncogenic functions. A subset of miR-106a~363 target genes was consistently reduced in lymphomas with Xpcl1 integrations, particularly genes with cell cycle and immune functions. We identify four predicted target genes of miR-106a~363 miRNA, including N-Myc (Mycn), and the TGF-beta receptor (Tgfbr2) using 3'UTR reporter assays. Still, bioinformatic miRNA target predictions were poor predictors of altered gene expression in lymphomas with Xpcl1 integration. Confirmation of miR-106a~363 gene targeting relevant to the tumor phenotype requires in vivo validation, because only a subset of predicted targets are consistently reduced in tumors that overexpress miR-106a~363.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently showed that MCL-1 is a critical regulator of autophagy in cell lines and neurons. Our findings indicate that activation of apoptosis and autophagy is controlled in a developmentally regulated manner. In addition, the fact that MCL-1 null neurons die in an autophagy-dependent manner suggests that while a basal level of autophagy is required for neuronal survival, its sustained activation may be detrimental.

The number of patients receiving HSCT in first chronic phase (CP) has declined rapidly, as allogeneic HSCT in CP is now performed in these patients only in case of failure or intolerance of TKIs. Second, those CML patients who undergo allogeneic HSCT represent a selection of high-risk patients due to more advanced disease with high rates of accelerated or blast phase (being associated with an increased relapse risk), advanced age and relevant co-morbidities. Efforts at meeting these special challenges are being developed: treatment with TKIs aims to improve the pre-transplant remission status before HSCT. Dose-reduced conditioning protocols were introduced to decrease transplant-related mortality in patients with co-morbidities or older age. In the post-transplant period, TKIs may be administered for prophylaxis and for treatment of post-transplant relapse. Still, the outcome of patients in advanced CML phases remains guarded, and requires an improvement in current transplant strategies.","['Copyright (c) 2011 S.

CD3-/CD56- cells expressed NK cell-associated molecules, such as CD16, NKp46, NKp30, CD244 (2B4), CD161, and killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors. CD3-/CD56- cells further exhibited the classical functional characteristics of NK cells: cytolysis of target cells lacking HLA class I, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and cytokine production. These results demonstrate that CD56- NK cells are functional, recognize missing self and, like their CD56+ counterparts, may contribute to graft-versus-leukemia reactions.","['Copyright (c) 2011 S.

Binding of NK cell inhibitory receptors to their major histocompatibility complex class I ligands protects the target cells from NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. NK cell alloreactivity has been put to use in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to reduce the rate of relapse and of graft-versus-host disease. A variety of findings have been observed in clinical studies, showing either beneficial or deleterious effects on clinical outcome.

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to compare gene expression between endometrial samples of normal fertile controls and women with PCOS. DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a case control study at university teaching hospitals. PATIENTS: Normal fertile controls and women with PCOS participated in the study. INTERVENTIONS: Endometrial samples were obtained from normal fertile controls and from women with PCOS, either induced to ovulate with clomiphene citrate or from a modeled secretory phase using daily administration of progesterone. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Total RNA was isolated from samples and processed for array hybridization with Affymetrix HG U133 Plus 2 arrays. Data were analyzed using GeneSpring GX11 and Ingenuity Pathways Analysis. Selected gene expression differences were validated using RT-PCR and/or immunohistochemistry in separately obtained PCOS and normal endometrium. RESULTS: ANOVA analysis revealed 5160 significantly different genes among the three conditions. Of these, 466 were differentially regulated between fertile controls and PCOS. Progesterone-regulated genes, including mitogen-inducible gene 6 (MIG6), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), GRB2-associated binding protein 1 (GAB1), S100P, and claudin-4 were significantly lower in PCOS endometrium; whereas cell proliferation genes, such as Anillin and cyclin B1, were up-regulated. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in gene expression provide evidence of progesterone resistance in midsecretory PCOS endometrium, independent of clomiphene citrate and corresponding to the observed phenotypes of hyperplasia, cancer, and poor reproductive outcomes in this group of women.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NK cell activities have been associated with early clearance of viremia in experimental simian immunodeficiency virus and clinical human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infections. We have previously shown that NK cells function as major cytotoxic effector cells in vaccine-induced immune protection against Friend virus (FV)-induced leukemia, and NK cell depletion totally abrogates the above protective immunity. However, how NK cells recognize retrovirus-infected cells remains largely unclear. The present study demonstrates a correlation between the expression of the products of retinoic acid early transcript-1 (RAE-1) genes in target cells and their susceptibility to killing by NK cells isolated from FV-infected animals. This killing was abrogated by antibodies blocking the NKG2D receptor in vitro. Further, the expression of RAE-1 proteins on erythroblast surfaces increased early after FV inoculation, and administration of an RAE-1-blocking antibody resulted in increased spleen infectious centers and exaggerated pathology, indicating that FV-infected erythroid cells are recognized by NK cells mainly through the NKG2D-RAE-1 interactions in vivo. Enhanced retroviral replication due to host gene-targeting resulted in markedly increased RAE-1 expression in the absence of massive erythroid cell proliferation, indicating a direct role of retroviral replication in RAE-1 upregulation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Co-expression of Tax, but not its NF-kappaB-defective mutant, significantly increased the reporter gene expression directed by CD44 promoter. Tax-mediated CD44 activation was largely diminished by disrupting an element similar to the noncanonical kappabeta site found in other IKKalpha target genes, and further, co-transfection of RelB siRNA abolished CD44 induction by Tax, suggesting an involvement of noncanonical NF-kappaB pathway in Tax-mediated transactivation. Consistently, chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed a specific interaction of CD44 promoter with RelB-containing complex.

RESULTS: The subjects consisted of 26 patients with ALL and 12 with brain tumors. Prophylactic cranial irradiation was not performed in patients with ALL, whereas it was done for all those with brain tumor. In patients with ALL, the IQ 1 year later was not changed from the start of treatment. In those with brain tumors, the verbal IQ 1 year later was significantly lower than that at the start of treatment. In patients with ALL, intelligence tests were performed 3 years after the start of treatment and there were no marked changes between the two time-points (n = 11). In those with a brain tumor, intellectual functions further decreased after the completion of treatment to as late as 5 years after the initiation of treatment (n = 7).

For this, they might need to undergo another round of stem cell mobilization. We analyzed retrospectively the outcomes of stem cell mobilization with plerixafor and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in a group of 30 patients who had undergone autoSCT previously, and in 46 other patients. The previously transplanted patients were significantly different from the remaining patients with respect to the intensity and number of previous therapies. We observed that the median peripheral blood concentration of CD34+ cells after the first administration of plerixafor was lower in previously transplanted (19 cells/muL) than in other patients (30 cells/muL, P < 0.05). Despite a comparable number of apheresis sessions being performed, the median total yield of CD34+ cells was significantly lower in the previously transplanted than in the remaining patients (2.8 x 10(6) cells/kg vs. 4.2 x 10(6) cells/kg, P < 0.05). However, successful collection of at least 2.0 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg was achieved finally in a similar proportion of previously transplanted and other patients (70% vs. 82.6%).

High-dose cytarabine (2000 to 3000 mg per square meter of body-surface area) is toxic but results in higher rates of relapse-free survival than does the conventional dose of 100 to 400 mg per square meter. Intermediate dose levels have not been thoroughly evaluated. METHODS: We compared two induction regimens in patients 18 to 60 years of age (median, 49) who had newly diagnosed AML. The intermediate-dose group, totaling 431 patients, received cytarabine at a dose of 200 mg per square meter given by continuous intravenous infusion for 24 hours during cycle 1 of induction therapy and 1000 mg per square meter by infusion for 3 hours twice daily during cycle 2 of induction therapy. The high-dose group, totaling 429 patients, received a dose-escalated regimen of 1000 mg of cytarabine per square meter every 12 hours in cycle 1 and 2000 mg per square meter twice daily in cycle 2. Patients with a complete response did not receive additional cytarabine but received consolidation therapy in a third cycle of chemotherapy (mitoxantrone-etoposide) or underwent autologous or allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. Complete remission rates, survival rates, and toxic effects were assessed for each treatment group. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 5 years, no significant differences were noted between the intermediate-dose group and the high-dose group with respect to complete remission rates (80% and 82%, respectively), probability of relapse, event-free survival at 5 years (34% and 35%), or overall survival (40% and 42%). High-dose cytarabine provided no clear advantage in any prognostic subgroup. The high-dose treatment resulted in higher incidences of grade 3 and grade 4 toxic effects (in cycle 1), prolonged hospitalization, and delayed neutrophil recovery (in cycle 2) and platelet recovery (in cycles 2 and 3). CONCLUSIONS: Induction therapy with cytarabine at the lower dose already produced maximal antileukemic effects for all response end points, suggesting a plateau in the dose-response relationship above this dose level. High-dose cytarabine results in excessive toxic effects without therapeutic benefit.

With constant LPA charge (+4), increasing the alkyl linkage increases the hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance and provides a systematic means of examining combined electrostatic and hydrophobic peptide-membrane interactions. Fluorescently conjugated LPA-C(11) (F-LPA-C(11)) demonstrated significant uptake, whereas there was negligible uptake of the shorter LPAs. By varying temperature (4 degrees C and 37 degrees C) and cell type, the results suggest that LPA-C(11) internalization is nonendocytic and nonspecific. The effect of LPA binding on the phase behavior, structure, and permeability of model membranes composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and dipalmitoylphosphatidylserine (DPPC/DPPS, 85/15) was studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), and fluorescence leakage studies to gain insight into the LPA uptake mechanism. While all LPAs led to phase separation, LPA-C(11), possessing the longest alkyl linkage, was able to penetrate into the bilayer and caused holes to form, which led to membrane disintegration. This was confirmed by rapid and complete dye release by LPA-C(11). We propose that LPA-C(11) achieves uptake by anchoring to the membrane via hydrophobicity and forming transient membrane voids. LPAs may be advantageous as drug transporter ligands because they are small, water soluble, and easy to prepare.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2011 Mar 15.,,,,"Multidrug resistance (MDR) mediated by the over expression of drug efflux protein P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is one of the major impediments to successful treatment of cancer. P-gp acts as an energy-dependent drug efflux pump and reduces the intracellular concentration of structurally unrelated drugs inside the cells. Therefore, there is an urgent need for development of new molecules that are less toxic to normal cell and preferentially effective against drug resistant malignant cells. In this preclinical study we report the apoptotic potential of copper N-(2-hydroxyacetophenone) glycinate (CuNG) on doxorubicin resistant T lymphoblastic leukaemia cells (CEM/ADR5000). To evaluate the cytotoxic effect of CuNG, we used different normal cell lines (NIH 3T3, Chang liver and human PBMC) and cancerous cell lines (CEM/ADR5000, parental sensitive CCRF-CEM, SiHa and 3LL) and conclude that CuNG preferentially kills cancerous cells, especially both leukemic cell types irrespective of their MDR status, while leaving normal cell totally unaffected. Moreover, CuNG involves reactive oxygen species (ROS) for induction of apoptosis in CEM/ADR5000 cells through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. This is substantiated by our observation that antioxidant N-acetyle-cysteine (NAC) and PEG catalase could completely block ROS generation and, subsequently, abrogates CuNG induced apoptosis. On the other hand, uncomplexed ligand N-(2-hydroxyacetophenone) glycinate (NG) fails to generate a significant amount of ROS and concomitant induction of apoptosis in CEM/ADR5000 cells. Therefore, CuNG induces drug resistant leukemia cells to undergo apoptosis and proves to be a molecule having therapeutic potential to overcome MDR in cancer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To characterize the demethylating activity of azacytidine and decitabine we treated colon cancer and leukemic cells with both drugs and used array-based DNA methylation analysis of more than 14,000 gene promoters. Additionally, drug-induced demethylation was compared to methylation patterns of isogenic colon cancer cells lacking both DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and DNMT3B. We show that drug-induced demethylation patterns are highly specific, non-random and reproducible, indicating targeted remethylation of specific loci after replication. Correspondingly, we found that CG dinucleotides within CG islands became preferentially remethylated, indicating a role for DNA sequence context. We also identified a subset of genes that were never demethylated by drug treatment, either in colon cancer or in leukemic cell lines. These demethylation-resistant genes were enriched for Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 components in embryonic stem cells and for transcription factor binding motifs not present in demethylated genes. Our results provide detailed insights into the DNA methylation patterns induced by azacytidine and decitabine and suggest the involvement of complex regulatory mechanisms in drug-induced DNA demethylation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) identified statistically-significant similarities in miRNA expression between activated B cells and CLL cells including upregulation of miR-34a, miR-155, and miR-342-3p and downregulation of miR-103, miR-181a and miR-181b. Additionally, decreased levels of two CLL signature miRNAs miR-29c and miR-223 are associated with ZAP70(+) and IgV(H) unmutated status and with shorter time to first therapy.

Patients with NS have a predisposition for leukemia and certain solid tumors. Data on the incidence of malignancies in NS are lacking. Our objective was to estimate the cancer risk and spectrum in patients with NS carrying a PTPN11 mutation. In addition, we have investigated whether specific PTPN11 mutations result in an increased malignancy risk. We have performed a cohort study among 297 Dutch NS patients with a PTPN11 mutation (mean age 18 years). The cancer histories were collected from the referral forms for DNA diagnostics, and by consulting the Dutch national registry of pathology and the Netherlands Cancer Registry. The reported frequencies of cancer among NS patients were compared with the expected frequencies using population-based incidence rates. In total, 12 patients with NS developed a malignancy, providing a cumulative risk for developing cancer of 23% (95% confidence interval (CI), 8-38%) up to age 55 years, which represents a 3.5-fold (95% CI, 2.0-5.9) increased risk compared with that in the general population. Hematological malignancies occurred most frequently. Two malignancies, not previously observed in NS, were found: a malignant mastocytosis and malignant epithelioid angiosarcoma. No correlation was found between specific PTPN11 mutations and cancer occurrence. In conclusion, this study provides first evidence of an increased risk of cancer in patients with NS and a PTPN11 mutation, compared with that in the general population. Our data do not warrant specific cancer surveillance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is no recent published estimate for childhood cancer in Britain. METHODS: We estimated completeness of ascertainment by the National Registry of Childhood Tumours for cancer diagnosed under age 15 years in residents of Britain during 2003-04. Stratified two-source capture-recapture was applied to notifications from general cancer registries (CRs) and specialist clinicians. Variation in notification patterns was assessed by logistic regression. Results were verified by cross-checking with Hospital Episode Statistics for leukaemia patients from England born in 1998 and diagnosed before 2005. RESULTS: CRs notified 92-96% of registrations, and specialist clinicians 93%. Notification patterns varied slightly according to registry region, age at diagnosis, diagnostic group, socioeconomic status, and whether the patient had died. Irrespective of stratification by these factors, the overall completeness estimate was 99-100% (assuming independence of sources). Estimated completeness was at least 99% within all subgroups, except for one region (Thames 98-99%) and two small diagnostic groups (germ-cell and gonadal cancer 98-99%, melanoma and non-skin cancer 97-98%). INTERPRETATION: The independence assumption cannot be fully justified, as both sources used records from treatment centres. With this caveat, ascertainment of recently diagnosed childhood cancer in Britain appears to be virtually complete.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on quantitative measurements of DNA methylation in 127 JMML cases using mass spectrometry (MassARRAY), we identified 4 gene CpG islands with frequent hypermethylation: BMP4 (36% of patients), CALCA (54%), CDKN2B (22%), and RARB (13%). Hypermethylation was significantly associated with poor prognosis: when the methylation data were transformed into prognostic scores using a LASSO Cox regression model, the 5-year overall survival was 0.41 for patients in the top tertile of scores versus 0.72 in the lowest score tertile (P = .002). Among patients given allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 0.52 in the highest versus 0.10 in the lowest score tertile (P = .007). In multivariate models, DNA methylation retained prognostic value independently of other clinical risk factors. Longitudinal analyses indicated that some cases acquired a more extensively methylated phenotype at relapse. In conclusion, our data suggest that a high-methylation phenotype characterizes an aggressive biologic variant of JMML and is an important molecular predictor of outcome.",,,['European Working Group of Myelodysplastic Syndromes in Childhood (EWOG-MDS)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD23.CAR(+) T cells showed specific cytotoxic activity against CD23(+) tumor cell lines (average lysis 42%) and primary CD23(+) CLL cells (average lysis 58%). This effect was obtained without significant toxicity against normal B lymphocytes, in contrast to CARs targeting CD19 or CD20 antigens, which are also expressed physiologically by normal B lymphocytes. Moreover, CLL-derived CD23.CAR(+) T cells released inflammatory cytokines (1445-fold more TNF-beta, 20-fold more TNF-alpha, and 4-fold more IFN-gamma). IL-2 was also produced (average release 2681 pg/mL) and sustained the antigen-dependent proliferation of CD23.CAR(+) T cells. Redirected T cells were also effective in vivo in a CLL Rag2(-/-)gamma(c)(-/-) xenograft mouse model. Compared with mice treated with control T cells, the infusion of CD23.CAR(+) T cells resulted in a significant delay in the growth of the MEC-1 CLL cell line.

Previously, we have shown that plasma of recent-onset (RO) Type 1 diabetes patients induces a disease-specific proinflammatory transcriptional profile in fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) compared with that of healthy controls (HC). To eliminate assay variance introduced through the use of multiple donors or multiple draws of the same person over time, we evaluated human leukemia cell lines as potential surrogates for fresh PBMC. We 1) tested seven different cell lines in their power to differentiate RO from HC plasma and 2) compared the similarity of the signatures generated across the seven cell lines to that obtained with fresh PBMC. While each cell line tested exhibited a distinct transcriptional response when cultured with RO or HC plasma, the expression profile induced in any single cell line shared little identity with that of the other cell lines or fresh PBMC. In terms of regulated biological pathways, the transcriptional response of each cell line shared varying degrees of functional identity with fresh PBMC. These results indicate that use of human leukemia cell lines as surrogates for fresh PBMC has potential in detecting perturbations to the peripheral cytokine milieu. However, the response of each is distinct, possessing varying degrees of functional relatedness to that observed with PBMC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MYC overexpression targeted to pulmonary alveolar cells was sufficient to induce lung adenomas and carcinomas. Tumorigenesis was assisted by either spontaneous mutations in Kras or experimental introduction of activated RAS, but investigations revealed that additional events were required to circumvent apoptosis, one of the most significant negative functions exerted by MYC. We determined that overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein MCL1 was sufficient to circumvent apoptosis in this setting. Previous clinical studies have indicated that prognosis of human NSCLC is not associated with MCL1, despite its overexpression in many NSCLCs. In reexamining the prognostic value in this setting, we found that MCL1 overexpression does correlate with poor patient survival, but only when accompanied by MYC overexpression. Our findings therefore produce a convergence of mouse and human results that explain how MCL1 can block an important negative consequence of MYC overexpression in both experimental models and clinical cases of NSCLC.",['(c)2011 AACR.'],['NIHMS269276'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2011 Feb 24.,,,PMC5528293,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA species that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally and are aberrantly expressed in many malignancies including lymphoma. However, the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of T-cell lymphoid malignancies is poorly understood. Previously we examined the miRNA profile of Sezary syndrome (Sz), a leukemia of skin-homing memory T cells. In this study we determined the complete miRNome of mycosis fungoides (MF), the most common type of cutaneous T cell lymphoma. The miRNA profile of skin biopsies from 19 patients with tumor stage MF and 12 patients with benign inflammatory dermatoses (eczema and lichen planus) were compared by microarray analysis. We identified 49 miRNAs that are differentially expressed in tumor stage MF compared to benign inflammatory dermatoses using ANOVA analysis (P < 0.05, Benjamini-Hochberg corrected). The majority of the differentially expressed miRNAs (30/49) were up-regulated in tumor stage MF. The most significant differentially expressed were miR-155 and miR-92a (both up-regulated in tumor stage MF), while miR-93 showed the highest up-regulation in tumor stage MF with a fold difference of 5.8. Differential expression of a selection of these miRNAs was validated by miRNA-Q-PCR on additional test groups (tumors and controls). None of the miRNAs up-regulated in tumor stage MF was previously shown to be up-regulated in Sz, and only 2 of the 19 miRNAs down-regulated in tumor stage MF were also down-regulated in Sz. Taken together this report is the first describing the miRNA signature of tumor stage MF.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Federation of European Biochemical Societies. Published by', 'Elsevier B.V.

Boswellic acids appear in the resin exudates of the plant and it makes up 25-35% of the resin. beta-boswellic acid, 11-keto-beta-boswellic acid and acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid have been implicated in apoptosis of cancer cells, particularly that of brain tumors and cells affected by leukemia or colon cancer. These molecules are also associated with potent antimicrobial activities. The present study describes the antimicrobial activities of boswellic acid molecules against 112 pathogenic bacterial isolates including ATCC strains. Acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid (AKBA), which exhibited the most potent antibacterial activity, was further evaluated in time kill studies, postantibiotic effect (PAE) and biofilm susceptibility assay. The mechanism of action of AKBA was investigated by propidium iodide uptake, leakage of 260 and 280 nm absorbing material assays. RESULTS: AKBA was found to be the most active compound showing an MIC range of 2-8 mug/ml against the entire gram positive bacterial pathogens tested. It exhibited concentration dependent killing of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 up to 8 x MIC and also demonstrated postantibiotic effect (PAE) of 4.8 h at 2 x MIC. Furthermore, AKBA inhibited the formation of biofilms generated by S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis and also reduced the preformed biofilms by these bacteria. Increased uptake of propidium iodide and leakage of 260 and 280 nm absorbing material by AKBA treated cells of S aureus indicating that the antibacterial mode of action of AKBA probably occurred via disruption of microbial membrane structure. CONCLUSIONS: This study supported the potential use of AKBA in treating S. aureus infections. AKBA can be further exploited to evolve potential lead compounds in the discovery of new anti-Gram-positive and anti-biofilm agents.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Flow cytometry practitioners completed an electronic survey. Of 134 respondents, 131 met the desired demographics and were analyzed. SETTING: Links to the survey were mailed to 3 listservs (Medlab-L, CLSEduc, Purdue Cytometry) and 2 email groups (ASCLS and AMLI). Participants completed the survey on-line. PARTICIPANTS: The target population was flow cytometry practitioners who had experienced CLS education, earned certification and practiced at least one year in flow. Survey instructions asked participants not to complete the survey if they did not meet the demographic criteria. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A competency was deemed important at entry level if > or = 50% of respondents agreed. RESULTS: There was strong consensus (62-87%) that entry level CLS generalists should be able to 1) perform HIV CD4/CD8 monitoring, 2) gate cell populations using forward/side scatter and CD45/bright/dim markers and 3) evaluate specimen acceptability. Concepts to understand included leukemia immunophenotyping, quality control and instrument principles (61-83%). Most respondents (74%) felt that memorization of the leukemic CD panels was unnecessary. However, survey results indicated that the markers and cell type associations to memorize are CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19/20, CD34, CD45 and light chains. Hands-on experience with instruments was not identified as critical. CONCLUSION: CLS educational programs can deliver almost all flow cytometry content in the didactic portion of the curriculum and can restrict CD marker memorization to a limited list. At minimum, HIV monitoring via CD4/CD8 counts and concepts of leukemia immunophenotyping should be included.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, all the six non-responders to reinduction demonstrated <60% pAkt inhibition (P=0.005). There was no correlation between pERK inhibition and response to therapy. These results indicate that lack of pAkt inhibition in vivo is associated with resistance to reinduction therapy using this regimen.

Susceptibility to infections increases as the neutrophil count decreases. Despite identical treatment patients vary considerably in the number of neutropenic episodes. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) has been shown to have a role in inhibiting apoptosis of neutrophils. Therefore, we hypothesized that polymorphisms in the TLR4 gene may influence the number of chemotherapy-induced neutropenic episodes. Eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the TLR4 gene were determined in 194 children aged 0-17 years, who were diagnosed with ALL. We compared the genotype distributions of the SNPs with the frequency of neutropenic episodes during treatment with chemotherapeutic regimens. The number of neutropenic episodes varied from 0 to 17, with a median of four neutropenic episodes. Four SNPs in the TLR4 gene (rs10759931, rs11536889, rs1927911 and rs6478317) were associated with an increased risk of developing chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, each sustaining correction for multiple testing. Further studies are required to elucidate whether pediatric patients with ALL with the particular SNPs in the TLR4 gene also experience more infections and would benefit from prophylactic antibiotic treatment, by a reduction of morbidity and mortality due to infections.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CCL3 (also known as MIP-1alpha) is a pro-inflammatory chemokine, levels of which in the MM microenvironment correlate with osteolytic lesions and tumor burden. CCL3 and its receptors, CCR1 and CCR5, contribute to the development of bone disease in MM by supporting tumor growth and regulating osteoclast (OC) differentiation. In this study, we identify inhibition of osteoblast (OB) function as an additional pathogenic mechanism in CCL3-induced bone disease. MM-derived and exogenous CCL3 represses mineralization and osteocalcin production by primary human bone marrow stromal cells and HS27A cells. Our results suggest that CCL3 effects on OBs are mediated by ERK activation and subsequent downregulation of the osteogenic transcription factor osterix. CCR1 inhibition reduced ERK phosphorylation and restored both osterix and osteocalcin expression in the presence of CCL3. Finally, treating SCID-hu mice with a small molecule CCR1 inhibitor suggests an upregulation of osteocalcin expression along with OC downregulation. Our results show that CCL3, in addition to its known catabolic activity, reduces bone formation by inhibiting OB function, and therefore contributes to OB/OC uncoupling in MM.",,['NIHMS399649'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rituximab-mediated death in CD40-stimulated CLL cells shows rapid kinetics (within hours), and is caspase and p53 independent, but depends on extracellular Ca(2+) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.

We previously demonstrated that chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients treated with DLI develop high-titer plasma antibodies specific for CML-associated antigens, the majority of which have been reported to bind nucleic acids These observations led us to predict that circulating antibody-antigen complexes in DLI-responsive patients carry nucleic acids that can engage innate immune sensors. Consistent with this, we report here that post-DLI plasma from 5 CML patients that responded to DLI treatment induced massive upregulation of MIP-1alpha, IP-10, and IFN-alpha in normal blood mononuclear cells. Importantly, this was not observed with plasma obtained before DLI and from DLI nonresponders and imatinib-treated patients. This endogenous immunostimulatory activity required nucleic acid and protein for its adjuvant effect and activated antigen-presenting cells through the RNA and DNA sensors TLR8 and TLR9. Presence of the immunoglobulin Fc receptor CD32 enhanced cellular responses, suggesting that immunoglobulins associate with this activity. Finally, a TLR-induced expression signature was detectable in post-DLI but not pre-DLI blood, consistent with an active circulating TLR8/9-stimulating factor. We have therefore demonstrated that effective tumor immunity correlates with the presence of endogenous nucleic acid-immunoglobulin complexes in patient plasma, thus providing a putative mechanism for the induction of potent antigen-specific immunity against malignant cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient and his donor-sister both harbored a germline mutation in CEBPA (584_589dup).

The present study evaluated the relevance of PI(3)Kgamma in donor cells for the pathogenesis of acute GVHD using a model of adoptive transfer of splenocytes from WT or PI(3)Kgamma(-/-) C57BL/6J mice to B6D2F1 mice, and mice that received PI(3)Kgamma(-/-) cells showed reduced clinical signs of disease, bacterial translocation, tissue injury, and lethality rates. This was associated with reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, CCL2, CCL3, and CCL5) and reduced infiltration of CD8(+), CD4(+), and CD11c(+) cells in the small intestine. Mechanistically, in addition to decreasing production of proinflammatory mediators, absence or pharmacological blockade of PI(3)Kgamma was associated with decreased rolling and adhesion of leukocytes to the mesenteric microcirculation, as assessed by intravital microscopy. Despite decreased GVHD, there was maintained GVL activity when PI(3)Kgamma(-/-) leukocytes were transferred into WT mice. In conclusion, PI(3)Kgamma plays a critical role in GVHD by mediating leukocyte influx and activation in tissues. PI(3)Kgamma inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of GVHD in patients undergoing BMT.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article reports that p53 and estrogen receptor alpha were activated in endometrial tissues during implantation to coordinately regulate LIF production. By using human p53 knockin (Hupki) mice carrying a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at codon 72 (arginine/proline), the arginine allele was demonstrated to produce higher uterine LIF levels during implantation than the proline allele. In humans, the diversity of haplotypes of the p53 gene has decreased during evolution, because the arginine allele, existing in only a subset of haplotypes, is under positive selection. This observation is consistent with previous results showing that the proline allele is enriched in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). Studies with p63- and p73-knockout mice have demonstrated the involvement of p63 and p73 in female reproduction and their roles in egg formation and apoptosis (p63) and spindle checkpoint (p73) in female mice. Here, the role of p63 and p73 in human reproduction was investigated. Selected alleles of SNPs in p63 and p73 genes were enriched in IVF patients. These findings demonstrate that the p53 family members are involved in several steps to regulate female reproduction in mice and humans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, in this study we tested the activity of dasatinib in patients with relapsed CLL. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients were eligible for this phase II trial if they had documented CLL/SLL and had failed at least 1 prior therapy with a fludarabine-containing regimen and if they required therapy according to NCI-WG criteria. The starting dose of dasatinib was 140 mg daily. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were enrolled, with a median age of 59 and a median of 3 prior regimens. All patients had received fludarabine, and 5 were fludarabine-refractory. Eleven of the 15 (73%) had high risk del(11q) or del(17p) cytogenetics. The primary toxicity was myelosuppression, with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in 10 and 6 patients, respectively. Partial responses by NCI-WG criteria were achieved in 3 of the 15 patients (20%; 90% CI: 6-44). Among the remaining 12 patients, 5 had nodal responses by physical exam, and 1 patient had a nodal and lymphocyte response but with severe myelosuppression. Pharmacodynamic studies indicated apoptosis in peripheral blood CLL cells within 3 to 6 hours after dasatinib administration, associated with downregulation of Syk (spleen tyrosine kinase) mRNA.

Epub 2011 Mar 14.,,,PMC3091227,"Abnormal vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation contributes to occlusive and proliferative disorders of the vessel wall. Salicylate and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit VSMC proliferation by an unknown mechanism unrelated to anti-inflammatory activity. In search for this mechanism, we have studied the effects of salicylate and other NSAIDs on subcellular Ca(2+) homeostasis and Ca(2+)-dependent cell proliferation in rat aortic A10 cells, a model of neointimal VSMCs. We found that A10 cells displayed both store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) and voltage-operated Ca(2+) entry (VOCE), the former being more important quantitatively than the latter. Inhibition of SOCE by specific Ca(2+) released-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC/Orai) channels antagonists prevented A10 cell proliferation. Salicylate and other NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, indomethacin, and sulindac, inhibited SOCE and thereby Ca(2+)-dependent, A10 cell proliferation. SOCE, but not VOCE, induced mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake in A10 cells, and mitochondrial depolarization prevented SOCE, thus suggesting that mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake controls SOCE (but not VOCE) in A10 cells. NSAIDs depolarized mitochondria and prevented mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake, suggesting that they favor the Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation of CRAC/Orai channels. NSAIDs also inhibited SOCE in rat basophilic leukemia cells where mitochondrial control of CRAC/Orai is well established. NSAIDs accelerate slow inactivation of CRAC currents in rat basophilic leukemia cells under weak Ca(2+) buffering conditions but not in strong Ca(2+) buffer, thus excluding that NSAIDs inhibit SOCE directly. Taken together, our results indicate that NSAIDs inhibit VSMC proliferation by facilitating the Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation of CRAC/Orai channels which normally is prevented by mitochondria clearing of entering Ca(2+).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over-expression of glutathione S-transferase pi (GSTpi) is one of the mechanisms contributing to MDR. In this study, we investigated the reversal of MDR by DLJ14, a ligustrazine derivate, in adriamycin (Adr) resistant human myelogenous leukemia (K562/A02) cells by modulating the expression of GSTpi and the activity of GST-related enzymes. In the MTT test, DLJ14 showed a weak inhibition on proliferation of both K562/A02 and K562 cells, while verapamil at the same concentration showed a much stronger inhibition. The sensitivity of K562/A02 cells to cytotoxic killing by Adr was enhanced by incubation with DLJ14 as a result of the increased intracellular accumulation of Adr. The accumulation of Adr induced by DLJ14 may due to down regulation of GST-related enzyme activity. Western blot analysis and RT-PCR showed that DLJ14 was able to inhibit the protein expression and mRNA expression of GSTpi in K562/A02 cells.

We describe the characterization of a new ETV6 fusion gene in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) FAB M0 as a result of an uncommon translocation involving chromosomes 12 and 15. METHODS: The ETV6 locus at 12p13 was shown to be translocated and to constitute the 5' end of the fusion product by ETV6 break apart fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). To identify a fusion partner 3' rapid amplification of cDNA-ends with polymerase chain reaction (RACE PCR) was performed followed by cloning and sequencing. RESULTS: The NTRK3 gene on chromosome 15 was found to constitute the 3' end of the fusion gene and the underlying ETV6-NTRK3 rearrangement was verified by reverse transcriptase PCR. No RNA of the reciprocal NTRK3-ETV6 fusion gene could be detected. CONCLUSION: We have characterized a novel ETV6-NTRK3 fusion transcript which has not been previously described in AML FAB M0 by FISH and RACE PCR. ETV6-NTRK3 rearrangements have been described in secretory breast carcinoma and congenital fibrosarcoma.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Repair of 8-oxoG by the base excision repair pathway involves the activity of human 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase 1 (hOGG1). Accumulating evidence suggests that the hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism affects the activity of hOGG1 and might serve as a genetic marker for susceptibility to several cancers. To determine whether this polymorphism is associated with risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in Chinese children, we genotyped the hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism (rs1052133) in a case-control study including 415 cases and 511 controls. We found that there was a significant difference in the genotype distributions of the hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism between cases and controls (P = 0.046), and the combined genotypes Ser/Ser and Ser/Cys were associated with a statistically significantly decreased risk of ALL (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.66, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.49-0.88, P = 0.005). Furthermore, we found a decreased risk for high risk ALL (adjusted OR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.40-0.88, P = 0.005), low risk ALL (adjusted OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.47-0.99, P = 0.042), and B-phenotype ALL (adjusted OR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.46-0.86, P = 0.003) among children with the Ser/Ser and Ser/Cys genotypes.

Recently it was reported that CD47 ligation rapidly induces apoptosis in B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is still an incurable hematological malignancy even with the novel therapeutic agents; therefore, new and effective agents for the treatment of CLL in clinical settings are urgently needed. We generated a murine monoclonal antibody against an extracellular domain of human CD47 (designated MABL). Subsequently, we created a disulfide-stabilized dimer of a single-chain antibody fragment of MABL (S-S diabody) to get rid of the adverse effect of MABL such as hemagglutination. In this study, we analyzed the effects of this new antibody on cellular proliferation, and the molecular mechanism of CD47-mediated apoptosis in human lymphoid malignant cells. Treatment with S-S diabody alone induced apoptosis of CD47-positive primary B-CLL and leukemic cells (MOLT-4 and JOK-1). In addition, administration of S-S diabody significantly prolonged the survival of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice inoculated with JOK-1 cells. In gene expression profiling of the S-S diabody-treated MOLT-4 cells, hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha downstream genes (RTP801 and BNIP3) were upregulated, and the mRNA expression levels of HIF-1alpha, RTP801 and BNIP3 were increased. Knockdown of HIF-1alpha by siRNA repressed S-S diabody-induced apoptosis in MOLT4 cells. In conclusion, CD47 will be a molecular target for the treatment of lymphoid malignancies, and S-S diabody might have potential as a novel therapeutic agent for B-CLL.",['(c) 2011 Japanese Cancer Association.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most importantly, large randomized trials (CLL-8 in first line and REACH in relapse) clearly demonstrated superiority of chemoimmunotherapy consisting of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR) over fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) alone, thus establishing FCR regimen as the new gold standard in younger and physically fit patients. However, management of elderly and/or comorbid patients is still a challenging task because they cannot be treated with agressive approaches due to high risk of unacceptable toxicity. To date, no randomized trials in this patient population have improved therapeutic results over chlorambucil; therefore, this agent remains the backbone of treatment against which the new protocols should be tested. When deciding about the intensity of treatment, performance status, biological age and number as well as severity of comorbidities should be taken into account. Emerging treatment concepts for elderly/comorbid patients include combination of chlorambucil with monoclonal antibodies (rituximab, ofatumumab, GA-101), fludarabine-based regimens in reduced doses or protocols based on bendamustine and lenalidomide. Combination of high-dose steroids with rituximab represent a promising option in relapsed/refractory CLL; however, infectious toxicity remains a serious issue. Finally, ofatumumab monotherapy appears to be a safe and effective therapy for heavily pretreated patients with CLL. This article reviews the current and future possibilities in the treatment of elderly and comorbid patients with CLL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proliferation of Bcr-Abl transformed cells is promoted by c-Myc through the activation of Akt, JAK2 and NF-kappaB. However, the mechanism by which c-Myc regulates CML cell proliferation is unclear. In our study, we investigated the role of Thanatos-associated protein 11 (THAP11), which inhibits c-Myc transcription, in CML cell lines and in hematopoietic progenitor cells derived from CML patients. The induction of THAP11 expression by Abl kinase inhibitors in CML cell lines and in CML-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells resulted in the suppression of c-Myc. In addition, over-expression of THAP11 inhibited CML cell proliferation. In colony forming cells derived from CML-aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)(hi) /CD34(+) cells, treatment with Abl kinase inhibitors and siRNA depletion of Bcr-Abl induced THAP11 expression and reduced c-Myc expression, resulting in inhibited colony formation. Moreover, overexpression of THAP11 significantly decreased the colony numbers, and also inhibited the expression of c-myc target genes such as Cyclin D1, ODC and induced the expression of p21(Cip1) . The depletion of THAP11 inhibited JAK2 or STAT5 inactivation-mediated c-Myc reduction in ALDH(hi) /CD34(+) CML cells. Thus, the induced THAP11 might be one of transcriptional regulators of c-Myc expression in CML cell. Therefore, the induction of THAP11 has a potential possibility as a target for the inhibition of CML cell proliferation.",['Copyright (c) 2011 UICC.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aims of this study were to investigate the frequency of common genetic polymorphisms associated with low TPMT activity and correlations of polymorphic variants with 6-MP tolerance in a group of Turkish children with ALL. METHODS: Genotyping for G238C, A719G, and G460A mutations were performed by using NanoChip Technology. Adverse reactions during the first 6 months of maintenance therapy with oral 6-MP and methotrexate were retrospectively analyzed from patient's files. RESULTS: Five (8.6%) of 58 children with ALL had a polymorphic TPMT allele: 4 (3.4%) were heterozygous for TPMT*3A (G460A and A719G), and one (0.9%) was heterozygous for TPMT*3C (A719G). No cases with TPMT*3B (G460A) or TPMT*2 (G238C) variants were identified. Children with TPMT*3A and *3C had significantly lower leukocyte and neutrophil counts and percentage of target 6-MP dosage, and longer periods with >/=grade 2 infections, >/=grade 2 liver toxicity, and chemotherapy interruptions than the children with wild-type TPMT during the first 24 weeks of maintenance therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency and distribution of common TPMT polymorphisms in Turkish children with ALL is similar to other Caucasian populations. Polymorphic variants were associated with excessive 6-MP toxicity supporting the suggestion that TPMT genotyping should be performed before institution of 6-MP therapy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epigenetic silencing of tumor-suppressive microRNAs (miRNAs) is a key oncogenic mechanism for the activation of oncogenes in tumors. In this study, several miRNAs potentially binding to the 3'-untranslated region of human c-kit mRNA were screened by luciferase reporter assays. Among these miRNAs, miR-193a was embedded in a CpG island and epigenetically repressed by promoter hypermethylation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and primary AML blasts, but not in normal bone marrow cells. Importantly, miR-193a levels were inversely correlated with c-kit levels measured in 9 leukemia cell lines and 27 primary AML samples. Restoring miR-193a expression in AML cells harboring c-kit mutation and/or overexpression, either by synthetic miR-193a transfection or by DNA hypomethylating agent 5-azacytidine (5-aza) treatment, resulted in a significant reduction in c-kit expression at both RNA and protein levels and inhibition of cell growth. The growth-inhibitory activity of miR-193a was associated with apoptosis and granulocytic differentiation. Moreover, 5-aza-induced c-kit reduction could be partially blocked by miR-193a inhibitor, leading to a reversal of antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of 5-aza. These data reveal a critical role for methylation-repressed miR-193a in myeloid leukemogenesis and the therapeutic promise of upregulating miR-193a expression for c-kit-positive AML.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The effect of genipin on K562 cell viability was measured using trypan blue dye exclusion and cell counting. Morphological changes were detected using phase-contrast microscopy. Apoptosis was analyzed using DNA ladder, propidium iodide (PI)-labeled flow cytometry (FCM) and Hoechst 33258 staining. The influence of genipin on cell cycle distribution was determined using PI staining. Caspase 3 activity was analyzed to detect apoptosis at different time points. Protein levels of phospho-c-Jun, phosphor-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK), phosphor-p38, Fas-L, p63, and Bax and the release of cytochrome c were detected using Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Genipin reduced the viability of K562 cells with an IC(50) value of approximately 250 mumol/L. Genipin 200-400 mumol/L induced formation of typical apoptotic bodies and DNA fragmentation. Additionally, genipin 400 mumol/L significantly increased the caspase 3 activity from 8-24 h and arrested the cells in the G(2)/M phase. After stimulation with genipin 500 mumol/L, the levels of p-JNK, p-c-Jun, Fas-L, Bax, and cytochrome c were remarkably upregulated, but there were no obvious changes of p-p38. Genipin 200-500 mumol/L significantly upregulated the Fas-L expression and downregulated p63 expression. Dicoumarol 100 mumol/L, a JNK1/2 inhibitor, markedly suppressed the formation of apoptotic bodies and JNK activation induced by genipin 400 mumol/L. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that genipin inhibits the proliferation of K562 cells and induces apoptosis through the activation of JNK and induction of the Fas ligand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is now clear that aberrant signaling through the DDR1 receptor is closely associated with various steps of tumorigenesis, although little is known about the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the role of DDR1 in cancer. Besides the role of DDR1 in tumorigenesis, we previously identified DDR1 kinase as a transcriptional target of tumor suppressor p53. DDR1 is functionally activated as determined by its tyrosine phosphorylation, in response to p53-dependent DNA damage. In this study, we report the characterization of the Notch1 protein as an interacting partner of DDR1 receptor, as determined by tandem affinity protein purification. Upon ligand-mediated DDR1 kinase activation, Notch1 was activated, bound to DDR1, and activated canonical Notch1 targets, including Hes1 and Hey2. Moreover, DDR1 ligand (collagen I) treatment significantly increased the active form of Notch1 receptor in the nuclear fraction, whereas DDR1 knockdown cells show little or no increase of the active form of Notch1 in the nuclear fraction, suggesting a novel intracellular mechanism underlying autocrine activation of wild-type Notch signaling through DDR1. DDR1 activation suppressed genotoxic-mediated cell death, whereas Notch1 inhibition by a gamma-secretase inhibitor, DAPT, enhanced cell death in response to stress. Moreover, the DDR1 knockdown cancer cells showed the reduced transformed phenotypes in vitro and in vivo xenograft studies. The results suggest that DDR1 exerts prosurvival effect, at least in part, through the functional interaction with Notch1.","['(c) 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['J Biol Chem. 2019 Dec 6;294(49):18950.

The RNA editing family member apolipoprotein B (apo B)-editing catalytic subunit 1 (APOBEC1; A1) from a variety of mammalian species, a protein involved in lipid transport and which mediates C-U deamination of mRNA for apo B, has also been shown to modify a range of exogenous retroviruses, but its activity against endogenous retroelements remains unclear. Here, we show in cell culture-based retrotransposition assays that A1 family proteins from multiple mammalian species can also reduce the mobility and infectivity potential of LINE-1 (long interspersed nucleotide sequence-1, L1) and long-terminal repeats (LTRs) retrotransposons (or endogenous retroviruses), such as murine intracisternal A-particle (IAP) and MusD sequences. The anti-L1 activity of A1 was mainly mediated by a deamination-independent mechanism, and was not affected by subcellular localization of the proteins.

These malignant B cells, as well as B cell lines transfected with cDNA for E1A-cd5 or with cDNA for E1B-cd5 produce IL-10, raising the possibility that CD5 participates in the secretion of IL-10. We identified transcription factors involved in this production in CD5(+) B lymphocytes from CLL patients and in E1A-cd5-transfected or E1B-cd5-transfected Jok cells. STAT3 is activated via phosphorylation of serine 727 but also NFAT2 through its translocation into the nucleus. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the role of STAT3 and allowed the discovery of a role for NFAT2 in IL-10 production. Both transcription factors bind not only to the enhancer of the Il-10 gene but also to the promoter of the Il-5 and Il-13 genes. Furthermore, transfection of B cell lines with E1A-cd5 or E1B-cd5 established that activation of STAT3 and NFAT2 is regulated by CD5. The same holds true for the production of IL-10, IL-5, and IL-13 and the expression of the receptors for these cytokines. This interpretation was confirmed by two experiments. In the first, downregulation of CD5 by small interfering RNAs lowered the production of IL-10. In the second experiment, transfection of the GFP-NFAT2 gene into B lymphocytes induced nuclear translocation of NFAT2 in CD5(+) but not in CD5(-) B cells. Thus, CD5 expression is associated with NFAT2 activity (and mildly STAT3 activity), indicating that CD5 controls IL-10 secretion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review will describe these challenges in the context of the major hematologic malignancies affecting this population (acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL], acute myeloid leukemia [AML], Hodgkin lymphoma [HL], and non-Hodgkin lymphoma [NHL]). For example, historical differences in care delivery between pediatric and adult health care systems have created confusion about optimal treatment planning for AYAs, a population that spans the pediatric-adult divide. In the case of ALL, retrospective studies have demonstrated significantly better outcomes when AYAs are treated according to pediatric and not adult protocols. Additional challenges more specific to AYAs include increased treatment-related toxicity relative to younger patients; less access to care and, specifically, access to clinical trials; lower adherence to medications and treatment plans; and psychosocial stressors relevant to individuals at this stage of life. Recognizing and responding to these challenges in AYAs may create opportunities to improve the cancer outcomes of this group.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Forty-three (24 women, 19 men) consecutive patients with indolent lymphoma or CLL were treated with a total dose of 4 Gy (2 x 2 Gy) using 6- 18-MV photons. The median age was 73 years (range, 39-88). Radiotherapy was given either after (n = 32; 75%) or before (n = 11; 25%) chemotherapy. The median time from diagnosis was 48 months (range, 1-249). The median follow-up period was 20 months (range, 1-56). RESULTS: The overall response rate was 90%. Twelve patients (28%) had a complete response, 15 (35%) had a partial response, 11 (26%) had stable disease, and 5 (11%) had progressive disease. The median overall survival for patients with a positive response (complete response/partial response/stable disease) was 41 months; for patients with progressive disease it was 6 months (p = 0.001). The median time to in-field progression was 21 months (range, 0-24), and the median time to out-field progression was 8 months (range, 0-40). The 3-year in-field control was 92% in patients with complete response (median was not reached). The median time to in-field progression was 9 months (range, 0.5-24) in patients with partial response and 6 months (range, 0.6-6) in those with stable disease (p < 0.05). Younger age, positive response to radiotherapy, and no previous chemotherapy were the best factors influencing the outcome.

Epub 2011 Mar 12.,,,,"Central nervous system (CNS) relapse remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in acute leukemia, but the mechanisms of CNS infiltration are poorly understood. Some results have shown the blood-brain barrier (BBB) makes CNS become a refugee to leukemic cells and serves as a resource of cells that seed extraneural sites. The authors ask how can leukemic cells disrupt BBB and then successfully enter the CNS in the process of leukemia metastasis. Tight junctions between brain microvessel endothelial cells (BMECs) of BBB possess an intricate complex of transmembrane proteins with cytoplasmic accessory proteins, and hence act as physiological and pharmacological barrier, thereby preventing influx of molecules from the bloodstream into the brain. So the loss of endothelial tight-junction proteins might be an important event related to the disruption of BBB. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the potent mediators of vascular permeability and the VEGF secreted by leukemic cells may be implicated in this response. Leukemic cells not only produce VEGF, but also express functional VEGFR, resulting in an autocrine loop for tumor growth and dissemination. It has been observed that forced VEGF over expression triggers proliferation and migration/invasion of some leukemic cells, thereby inducing a more invasive tumor phenotype. It has been identified that VEGF-mediated disruption of endothelial transmembrane tight-junction proteins is contributed to the breakdown of BBB in some CNS inflammation disease. Here, we hypothesize that VEGF secreted by leukemic cells also plays an important role in increasing the permeability of BBB by disrupting endothelial tight-junction proteins and give leukemic cells an entrance to the CNS in CNS leukemia. We propose the key tight-junction proteins claudin-5, occludin, and ZO-1 as targets of VEGF action in promoting BBB breakdown, and in interfering with the VEGF/VEGFR pathway using anti-VEGF or anti-VEGFR antibodies can reduce the permeability of BBB. All these will be tested on the BBB model in vitro and in vivo based on an animal model of CNS leukemia. This hypothesis is useful for exploring the mechanism of leukemic CNS infiltration.

The aim of this study was to set a correlation between the intracellular level of GTP and the induction of relevant signaling pathways involved in the cell's fate toward life or death. In that regard, we measured the GTP level among human leukemia K562 cells exposed to mycophenolic acid (MPA) or 3-hydrogenkwadaphnin (3-HK) as two potent inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitors. Our results supported the maturation of the cells when the intracellular GTP level was reduced by almost 30-40%. Under these conditions, 3-HK and/or MPA caused up-regulation of PKCalpha and PI3K/AKT pathways. Furthermore, co-treatment of cells with hypoxanthine plus 3-HK or MPA, which caused a reduction of about 60% in the intracellular GTP levels, led to apoptosis and activation of mitochondrial pathways through inverse regulation of Bcl-2/Bax expression and activation of caspase-3. Moreover, our results demonstrated that attenuation of GTP by almost 60% augmented the intracellular ROS and nuclear localization of p21 and subsequently led to cell death. These results suggest that two different threshold levels of GTP are needed for induction of differentiation and/or ROS-associated apoptosis.",['Copyright (c) 2011.

One strategy to accomplish this is to selectively cripple the involved tumor resistance mechanisms, thereby allowing the affected anticancer drugs to gain therapeutic efficacy. Such an approach is exemplified by our design and synthesis of the intracellular hypoxic cell activated methylating agent, 1,2-bis(methylsulfonyl)-1-methyl-2-[[1-(4-nitrophenyl)ethoxy]carbonyl]hydrazine (KS900) that targets the O-6 position of guanine in DNA. KS900 is markedly more cytotoxic in clonogenic experiments under conditions of oxygen deficiency than the non-intracellularly activated agents KS90, and 90M, when tested in O(6)-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) non-expressing cells (EMT6 mouse mammary carcinoma, CHO/AA8 hamster ovary, and U251 human glioma), and than temozolomide when tested in AGT expressing cells (DU145 human prostate carcinoma). Furthermore, KS900 more efficiently ablates AGT in HL-60 human leukemia and DU145 cells than the spontaneous globally activated methylating agent KS90, with an IC(50) value over 9-fold lower than KS90. Finally, KS900 under oxygen-deficient conditions selectively sensitizes DU145 cells to the chloroethylating agent, onrigin, through the ablation of the resistance protein AGT. Thus, under hypoxia, KS900 is more cytotoxic at substantially lower concentrations than methylating agents such as temozolomide that are not preferentially activated in neoplastic cells by intracellular reductase catalysts. The necessity for intracellular activation of KS900 permits substantially greater cytotoxic activity against cells containing the resistance protein O(6)-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) than agents such as temozolomide. Furthermore, the hypoxia-directed intracellular activation of KS900 allows it to preferentially ablate AGT pools under the oxygen-deficient conditions that are present in malignant tissue.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Studies of affected populations have provided important new data on the links between radiation and cancer-particularly the risk of thyroid tumours from exposure to iodine isotopes-that are important not only for a fuller scientific understanding of radiation effects, but also for radiation protection. It is now well documented that children and adolescents exposed to radioiodines from Chernobyl fallout have a sizeable dose-related increase in thyroid cancer, with the risk greatest in those youngest at exposure and with a suggestion that deficiency in stable iodine may increase the risk. Data on thyroid cancer risks to other age groups are somewhat less definitive. In addition, there have been reported increases in incidence and mortality from non-thyroid cancers and non-cancer end points. Although some studies are difficult to interpret because of methodological limitations, recent investigations of Chernobyl clean-up workers ('liquidators') have provided evidence of increased risks of leukaemia and other haematological malignancies and of cataracts, and suggestions of an increase in the risk of cardiovascular diseases, following low doses and low dose rates of radiation. Further careful follow-up of these populations, including the establishment and long-term support of life-span study cohorts, could provide additional important information for the quantification of radiation risks and the protection of persons exposed to low doses of radiation.","['Copyright (c) 2011 The Royal College of Radiologists.

Using proteomic tools and clinically important leukemia cell lines (REH, 697, Sup-B15, RS4; 11), we have identified potential prognostic protein biomarkers as well as discovered promising regulators of PRED-induced apoptosis. After treatment with PRED, the four cell lines can be separated into resistant (REH) and sensitive (697, Sup-B15, RS4;11). Two dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS identified 77 and 17 significantly differentially expressed protein spots (p<0.05) in PRED-sensitive and PRED-resistant cell lines respectively. Several of these were validated by Western blot including proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), cofilin 1, voltage-dependent anion-channel protein 1 (VDAC1) and proteasome activator subunit 2 (PA28beta). PCNA is a promising protein because of its important roles both in cell cycle regulation and survival control. We subsequently validated PCNA in 43 paired bone marrow samples from children with newly diagnosed ALL (Day 0) and 7 days after PRED treatment (Day 8). ROC curve analysis confirmed that PCNA was highly predictive of PRED response in patients (AUC=0.81, p=0.007) and most interestingly, independent of the molecular subtype, providing a promising universal prognostic marker.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We seek to identify FAT10-targeted proteins, an essential step in elucidating the physiological function of FAT10. To this end, human FAT10 or its non-conjugatable derivative, FAT10DeltaGG, was overexpressed in HEK293 cells. We observed a number of high molecular weight FAT10 conjugates in cells expressing wild-type FAT10, but not in FAT10DeltaGG. The FAT10 conjugates are inducible by TNF-alpha and accumulated significantly when cells were treated with proteasome inhibitor, MG132. Among them, tumor suppressor p53 was found to be FATylated. The p53 transcriptional activity was found to be substantially enhanced in FAT10-overexpressing cells. In addition, overexpressing FAT10 in HEK293 cells also reduced the population of p53 which cross reacted with monoclonal anti-p53 antibody, PAB240, known to recognize only the transcriptionally inactive p53. FAT10 in the nucleus was found co-localized with p53 and altered its subcellular compartmentalization. Furthermore, overexpressing FAT10 led to a reduction in the size of promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) and altered their distribution in the nucleus. Based on these observations, a potential mechanism which correlates FATylation of p53 to its translocation and transcriptional activation is discussed.",['Copyright (c) 2011.

Sixty-four non-febrile neutropenic attacks developed in 29 patients with ALL receiving St Jude XIII maintenance protocol were evaluated retrospectively. The patients were clinically followed up without drugs for shortening the duration of neutropenia in 21 (32.8%) attacs, while HDMP and G-CSF were administered in 26 (40.6%) and 17 (26.6%) attacks, respectively. After the detection of neutropenia, restoration of neutrophil counts at 2nd or 4th days to the levels that allow resuming the chemotherapy were considered as success. While second day and overall success rates in patients administered HDMP and G-CSF were significantly higher than the patients who were observed clinically. Both second day and overall neutrophil counts were significantly higher in patients administered G-CSF than the other groups. Methyl prednisolone and G-CSF treatments were well-tolerated by the patients. The cost-per neutropenic attack was significantly higher in G-CSF group than of the HDMP group. Especially in patients experiencing frequent neutropenic attacks and hence interruptions of the therapy, one of the myelopoiesis induction therapies can be used to shorten the duration of neutropenia. For this indication short-course HDMP therapy can be considered as an alternative to G-CSF in this patients due to its relatively low cost, amenability to outpatient administration, and well-tolerability by children.","['(c) 2011 The Authors Fundamental and Clinical Pharmacology (c) 2011 Societe', 'Francaise de Pharmacologie et de Therapeutique.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its red blood cell (RBC) metabolite concentrations (6-thioguanine [6-TGN] and 6-methylmercaptopurine nucleotides [6-MMPN]) are related to drug response. We investigated the impact of non-genetic covariates and pharmacogenetic polymorphisms affecting thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) and inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPA) on 6-MP metabolism and response. METHODS: Sixty-six children with ALL treated according to EORTC 58951 protocol were included in this study. Six patients had a heterozygous genotype for the most common TPMT polymorphisms, nine for ITPA 94 C > A and 17 for ITPA IVS2+21 A > C. 6-MP metabolites concentrations were analyzed by mixed model analysis. RESULTS: During maintenance, steady-state RBC 6-TGN concentrations were lower in patients aged 6 years or younger (493 pmol/8 x 10(8) RBC) than in older children (600 pmol/8 x 10(8) RBC). 6-MMPN concentrations were low in patients with TPMT variant/wild-type ITPA (1862 pmol/8 x 10(8) RBC), intermediate in wild-type patients and high (16468 pmol/8 x 10(8) RBC) in patients wild-type TPMT/variant ITPA. A 6-MMPN threshold of 5000 pmol/8 x 10(8) RBC was associated with an increased risk of hepatotoxicity. CONCLUSION: In this study, age and both TPMT and ITPA genotypes influenced 6-MP metabolism. High 6-MMPN was associated with hepatotoxicity. These pharmacological tools should be used to monitor ALL treatment in children.","['(c) 2011 The Authors.

Aberrations in the activity of the kinases have been linked to many human diseases such as diabetes, inflammation and cancer. The discovery of more than 518 kinases encoded by the human genome has spurred the development of rapid screening techniques for potential drugs against these enzymes and these have been identified as interesting targets for medicinal chemistry programs, especially in cancer therapy. On the other hand, sulfur and selenium have been increasingly recognized as essential elements in biology and medicine. Converging data from epidemiological and clinical studies have highlighted these elements as effective chemopreventive agents, particularly against various types of cancer (prostate, lung, breast, leukemia, colon, skin, lymphome, thyroid, pancreas, liver). These elements act through a wide range of potential mechanisms where one identified signal pathway event is kinase modulation, which is common for the two elements and emerges as a valid target. The kinases modulated by sulfur and selenium derivatives include MAP, ERK, JNK, Akt, Cdc2, Cyclin B1 and Cdc25c amongst others. Although both of the elements in question are in the same group in the periodic table and have similar biochemistries, there are relevant differences related to redox potentials, stabilities, oxidation states and anticancer activity. Literature data suggest that the replacement of sulfur by selenium in established cancer chemopreventive agents results in more effective chemopreventive analogs. In view of the multi-target kinase mechanisms in preventing cellular transformation, as well as the differences and similarities between them, in this review we focus on the development of new structures that contain selenium and/or sulfur and discuss our understanding of the regulation of antitumoral effects with emphasis on kinase modulation activity and its implications in cancer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite their popularity in HTS, it has been recognized that different assay technologies may generate different hit lists for the same biochemical interaction. Due to the high cost of large-scale HTS campaigns, one has to make a critical choice to employee one assay platform for a particular HTS. Here we report the design and development of a dual-readout HTS assay that combines two assay technologies into one system using the Mcl-1 and Noxa BH3 peptide interaction as a model system. In this system, both FP and FRET signals were simultaneously monitored from one reaction, which is termed ""Dual-Readout F(2) assay"" with F(2) for FP and FRET. This dual-readout technology has been optimized in a 1,536-well ultra-HTS format for the discovery of Mcl-1 protein inhibitors and achieved a robust performance. This F(2) assay was further validated by screening a library of 102,255 compounds. As two assay platforms are utilized for the same target simultaneously, hit information is enriched without increasing the screening cost. This strategy can be generally extended to other FP-based assays and is expected to enrich primary HTS information and enhance the hit quality of HTS campaigns.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) after stem cell transplantation can contribute to complete donor chimerism and graft-versus-tumor/leukemia effect. We evaluate cytokine secretion at the single-cell level using ELISpot in relation to DLI effect on disease response. PATIENTS & METHODS: Blood samples were collected from four patients with solid tumors and four with hematological malignancies before DLI, and 1 and 3 weeks after DLI. Tumor response was evaluated according to the international Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) method. Indications for DLI were stable disease or MC and/or progressive disease in solid tumors, and molecular or early relapse, or MC in hematological malignancies. ELISpot was performed for TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-12, IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13 cytokines. RESULTS: Depending on the disease response, patients were divided into two groups: responders and nonresponders. Responders were patients who achieved partial response (one renal cell cancer) or stable disease (one prostate cancer) or clinical remission (two acute myeloid leukemia). Patients who relapsed, progressed or rejected the graft were the nonresponders. DLI rescued the renal cell cancer patient, who has partial response, and two acute myeloid leukemia patients, who are in clinical remission. Patients who responded tended to have a higher expression of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-12 and IL-10 than those who did not respond. CONCLUSIONS: DLI can act when the patients' mononuclear cells have normal or increased capacity to produce TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-12 and IL-10. Assessment of these cytokines may be useful to predict those patients who will respond to DLI therapy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The disease is heterogeneous and outcomes vary dramatically depending on the prognostic factors present in an individual patient. An important determinant of outcome is the age of the patient. The stunning success of therapy in paediatric ALL has led to the use of intensive paediatric regimens in adolescents and young adults with what appear to be improved outcomes. For patients who relapse or have high-risk features, blood and marrow transplantation (BMT) continues to play an important role in the therapeutic armamentarium. The use of reduced-intensity conditioning regimens for allogeneic BMT suggests that outcomes may be improved by this approach. Monoclonal antibodies are showing benefit as single agents in the relapsed setting or in combination with chemotherapy in newly diagnosed patients. In recent years, several new chemotherapeutic agents have shown promise as single agents and are being incorporated into multi-agent chemotherapy. The development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors for Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukaemias has significantly improved outcomes. The molecular revolution has led to the identification of new aberrant molecular pathways in the pathogenesis of ALL, and drugs targeting these aberrancies are in various stages of development preclinically and clinically. These developments bring the hope that therapeutic outcomes in adult ALL can begin to approach those seen in the paediatric setting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: From January 1996 to November 2002, 429 eligible children with ALL were enrolled in a protocol with BFM-based back-bone, followed by a randomized continuation phase in standard (SRG) and intermediate (IRG) risk groups. Patients were randomized between Arms A and B for SRG and B or C for IRG. Arms A and C consisted of 6-MP and MTX and in Arm C, six pulses of VCR and dexamethasone were added. Arm B combined four pairs of drugs rotated weekly. All risk-groups received maintenance until completing 2 years of therapy from diagnosis. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 138 (range: 96-178) months, the overall pEFS (SE) was 72 (6)% for all patients and the different risk groups showed: SRG: 85 (3)%, IRG: 71 (1)%, and HRG: 42 (7)% (P-value </= 0.0001).

The expressions of both truncated and full length OSMRbeta proteins were analyzed in ESCC tissues and patients' sera using western blotting and immunoprecipitation. By immunoprecipitation we have also shown direct interaction between sOSMRB and OSM. We also explored the relationship between expression of OSM and its receptors, OSMRbeta and LIFRbeta, in primary human ESCCs and normal epithelia using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Overexpression of alternatively spliced OSMR beta transcript was detected by RT-PCR in 9 of 11 ESCCs. Analysis of the soluble receptor revealed absence of sOSMRbeta protein in esophageal tissues, however, immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis showed its presence in sera of ESCC patients further confirming expression of the alternatively spliced OSMR beta in ESCC patients. Immunohistochemical analysis in tissue microarray (TMA) format showed expression of OSMR beta, LIFR and OSM in 11/50 (23%), 47/50 (94%) and 47/50 (94%) ESCCs, respectively. Strong correlation was observed between cytoplasmic expression of LIFRbeta and OSM in tumor cells (p = 0.000, O.R = 50, 95%CI = 8-31.9), and nuclear expression of LIFRbeta and OSM (p = 0.039 OR = 3.1, 95% CI = 1.1-8.2), suggesting that LIFRbeta serves as the major receptor in ESCCs. CONCLUSION: An alternatively spliced variant of OSMR transcribing a soluble form of this receptor has been characterized in ESCC. We speculate that the truncated OSMR characterized here in may act as a neutralizing receptor for OSM. Our immunohistochemical study showed that OSMRbeta and its pathway is not activated in ESCCs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nutlin-3a is a small molecule that activates the p53 pathway by disrupting p53-MDM2 interaction. We show that nutlin-3a activates p53 in DLBCL cells associated with t(14;18)(q32;q21), BCL2 overexpression and wt p53, resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Nutlin-3a treatment had similar effects on DLBCL cells of activated B-cell phenotype with wt p53. Cell cycle arrest was associated with upregulation of p21. Nutlin-3a-induced apoptosis was accompanied by BAX and PUMA upregulation, BCL-XL downregulation, serine-70 dephosphorylation of BCL2, direct binding of BCL2 by p53, caspase-9 upregulation and caspase-3 cleavage. Cell death was reduced when p53-dependent transactivation activity was inhibited by pifithrin-alpha (PFT-alpha), or PFT-mu inhibited direct p53 targeting of mitochondria. Nutlin-3a sensitized activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway by BCL2 inhibitors in t(14;18)-positive DLBCL cells with wt p53, and enhanced doxorubicin cytotoxicity against t(14;18)-positive DLBCL cells with wt or mutant p53, the latter in part via p73 upregulation. Nutlin-3a treatment in a xenograft animal lymphoma model inhibited growth of t(14;18)-positive DLBCL tumors, associated with increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation. These data suggest that disruption of the p53-MDM2 interaction by nutlin-3a offers a novel therapeutic approach for DLBCL associated with t(14;18)(q32;q21).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to elucidate the signal transduction-based antitumor mechanism(s) of action for the anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody dacetuzumab (SGN-40) in NHL. We report that dacetuzumab activates two distinct proapoptotic signaling pathways, overcoming transformation events key to the pathogenesis of NHL. Dacetuzumab-mediated CD40 signaling constitutively activated the nuclear factor-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways producing the sustained downregulation of B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL-6), an oncoprotein implicated in lymphomagenesis. Loss of BCL-6 resulted in c-Myc downregulation and activation of a transcriptional program characteristic of early B-cell maturation, concomitant with reduced proliferation and cell death. In a second mechanism, dacetuzumab signaling induced the expression of the proapoptotic p53 family member TAp63alpha and downstream proteins associated with the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic machinery. Dacetuzumab was synergistic in combination with DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic drugs, correlating with TAp63alpha upregulation. Furthermore, dacetuzumab augmented the activity of rituximab in combination with multiple chemotherapies in the xenograft models of NHL. The ability of dacetuzumab signaling to circumvent oncogenic events and potentiate the activity of chemotherapy regimens provides a unique therapeutic approach to NHL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Depending on the etiology, the clinical presentation can be with fever, pallor or infection. Knowing the exact etiology is important for specific treatment and prognostication. AIMS: To evaluate the etiological and clinico-hematological profile in children with bicytopenia and pancytopenia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review of bicytopenic and pancytopenic children referred for bone marrow examination from January 2007 to December 2008 was done. Detailed history, clinical examination and hematological parameters at presentation were recorded. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: During the study period, a total of 990 children were referred for bone marrow examination for different indications. Of these, 571 (57.7%) had either pancytopenia (17.7%) or bicytopenia (40%). Commonest form of bicytopenia was anemia and thrombocytopenia seen in 77.5% cases, followed by anemia and leukopenia in 17.3% and leukopenia and thrombocytopenia in 5.5% cases. Most common etiology was acute leukemia (66.9%) in bicytopenic children and aplastic anemia (33.8%) in pancytopenic children. Children with bicytopenia had a higher incidence of underlying malignancy (69.5% vs. 26.6%), splenomegaly (60.5% vs. 37.4%), lymphadenopathy (41.8% vs. 15.1%) and circulating blasts (64.6% vs. 20.1%) and a lower incidence of bleeding manifestations (12.1% vs. 26.6%) as compared to children with pancytopenia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therapeutic strategies that specifically target hypoxic cells and promote apoptosis are particularly appealing, as few normal tissues experience hypoxia. We have found that the compound ABT-737, a Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH-3) mimetic, promotes apoptotic cell death in human colorectal carcinoma and small cell lung cancer cell lines exposed to hypoxia. This hypoxic induction of apoptosis was mediated through downregulation of myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1), a Bcl-2 family protein that serves as a biomarker for ABT-737 resistance. Downregulation of Mcl-1 in hypoxia was independent of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) activity and was consistent with decreased global protein translation. In addition, ABT-737 induced apoptosis deep within tumor spheroids, consistent with an optimal hypoxic oxygen tension being necessary to promote ABT-737-induced cell death. Tumor xenografts in ABT-737-treated mice also displayed significantly more apoptotic cells within hypoxic regions relative to normoxic regions. Synergies between ABT-737 and other cytotoxic drugs were maintained in hypoxia, suggesting that this drug may be useful in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. Taken together, these findings suggest that Mcl-1-sparing BH-3 mimetics may induce apoptosis in hypoxic tumor cells that are resistant to other chemotherapeutic agents and may have a role in combinatorial chemotherapeutic regimens for treatment of solid tumors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Actin cytoskeleton genes regulated by serum response factor (SRF) and its coactivator megakaryoblastic leukemia 1 (MKL1) had increased expression in T2D and FH(+) groups. Furthermore, striated muscle activator of Rho signaling (STARS), an activator of SRF, was upregulated in T2D and FH(+) and was inversely correlated with insulin sensitivity. Skeletal muscle from insulin-resistant mice recapitulated this gene expression pattern and showed reduced G-actin and increased nuclear localization of MKL1, each of which regulates SRF activity. Overexpression of MKL1 or reduction in G-actin decreased insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation, whereas reduction of STARS expression increased insulin signaling and glucose uptake. Pharmacological SRF inhibition by CCG-1423 reduced nuclear MKL1 and improved glucose uptake and tolerance in insulin-resistant mice in vivo. Thus, SRF pathway alterations are linked to insulin resistance, may contribute to T2D pathogenesis, and could represent therapeutic targets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2011 Mar 10.,,,,"RATIONALE: Acquisition of a procalcific phenotype by resident or circulating cells is important for calcification of atherosclerotic plaques, which is common in diabetes. OBJECTIVE: We aim to identify and characterize circulating calcifying cells, and to delineate a pathophysiological role for these cells in type 2 diabetes. METHODS AND RESULTS: We demonstrate for the first time that a distinct subpopulation of circulating cells expressing osteocalcin and bone alkaline phosphatase (OC(+)BAP(+)) has procalcific activity in vitro and in vivo. The study of naive patients with chronic myeloid leukemia indicated that OC(+)BAP(+) cells have a myeloid origin. Myeloid calcifying OC(+)BAP(+) cells (MCCs) could be differentiated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and generation of MCCs was closely associated with expression of the osteogenic transcription factor Runx2. In gender-mismatched bone marrow-transplanted humans, circulating MCCs had a much longer half-life compared with OC(-)BAP(-) cells, suggesting they belong to a stable cell repertoire. The percentage of MCCs was higher in peripheral blood and bone marrow of type 2 diabetic patients compared with controls but was lowered toward normal levels by optimization of glycemic control. Furthermore, diabetic carotid endoarterectomy specimens showed higher degree of calcification and amounts of cells expressing OC and BAP in the alpha-smooth muscle actin-negative areas surrounding calcified nodules, where CD68(+) macrophages colocalize. High glucose increased calcification by MCCs in vitro, and hypoxia may regulate MCC generation in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: These data identify a novel type of blood-derived procalcific cells potentially involved in atherosclerotic calcification of diabetic patients.",,,,,,,,['Circ Res. 2011 Apr 29;108(9):1038-9.

ATRA induces CD38 antigen during HL-60 cell differentiation, which interacts with CD31 antigen on the vascular EC surface and may induce disadvantages in the therapy. We here examined the mechanisms of the ATRA-mediated CD38 induction and compared the difference between ATRA- and tamibarotene-mediated induction. Tamibarotene-induced HL-60 cell adhesion to ECs was 38% lower than ATRA, and NB4 cell adhesion to ECs by tamibarotene was equivalent to ATRA, which induced CD38 gene transcription biphasically in HL-60 cells, the early-phase induction via DR-RARE containing intron 1, and the delayed-phase induction via RARE lacking the 5'-flanking region. In contrast to ATRA, tamibarotene induced only the early-phase induction, resulting in its lower CD38 induction than ATRA. A PKCdelta inhibitor, rottlerin, and siRNA-mediated PKCdelta knockdown suppressed the ATRA-induced CD38 promoter activity of the 5'-flanking region, whereas a RAR antagonist, LE540, or RAR knockdown did not affect it. Cycloheximide and rottlerin suppressed the delayed-phase induction of CD38 expression by ATRA but did not affect the early-phase induction. Moreover, ATRA, but not tamibarotene, induced PKCdelta expression without affecting its mRNA stability. The diminished effect of tamibarotene on CD38-mediated HL-60 cell adhesion to ECs compared with ATRA is likely a result of the lack of its delayed-phase induction of CD38 expression, which may be advantageous in antineoplastic therapy.",,,,,,,,['J Leukoc Biol. 2011 Aug;90(2):217-9.

Patients discharged early spent a median of 8 days (range 3-36 days), or 54% of their study time, as outpatients. These patients required less time on intravenous antibiotics (6 vs. 16 days; P=0.11), received fewer red blood cell transfusions (0.25 vs. 0.48 units/day; P=0.08), and incurred lower median daily charges ($3,270 vs. $5,467; P=0.01) than controls.

While there has been a tremendous effort towards the development of specific JAK inhibitors, mutations conferring resistance to such drugs have not yet been observed. DESIGN AND METHODS: Taking advantage of a model of spontaneous cellular transformation, we sequenced JAK1 in selected tumorigenic BaF3 clones and identified 25 de novo JAK1 activating mutations, including 5 mutations already described in human leukemias. We further used this library of JAK1 mutation-positive cell lines to assess their sensitivity to ATP-competitive inhibitors. RESULTS: While most JAK1 mutants were sensitive to ATP-competitive JAK inhibitors, mutations targeting Phe958 and Pro960 in the hinge region of the kinase domain rendered JAK1 constitutively active but also resistant to all tested JAK inhibitors. Furthermore, mutation of the homologous Tyr931 in JAK2 wild-type or JAK2 V617F mutant found in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms also conferred resistance to JAK inhibitors, such as INCB018424, which is currently in clinical use. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that some activating mutations not only promote autonomous cell proliferation but also confer resistance to ATP-competitive inhibitors. In vivo, such a mutation can potentially occur as primary JAK-activating mutations but also as secondary mutations combining oncogenicity with drug resistance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2011 Mar 8.,,,,"OBJECTIVE: As a better understanding of the molecular basis of carcinogenesis has emerged, oncogene-specific cell-signaling pathways have been successfully targeted to treat human malignances. Despite impressive advances in oncogene-directed therapeutics, genetic instability in cancer cells often manifest acquired resistance. This is particularly noted in the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors therapies and not more evident than for chronic myeloid leukemia. Therefore, it is of great importance to understand the molecular mechanisms affecting cancer cell sensitivity and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we used continuous exposure to stepwise increasing concentrations of imatinib (0.6-1 muM) to select imatinib-resistant K562 cells. RESULTS: Expression of BCR-ABL increased both at RNA and protein levels in imatinib-resistant cell lines. Furthermore, expression levels of sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) were increased significantly in resistant cells, channeling sphingoid bases to the SphK1 pathway and activating sphingosine-1-phosphate-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation pathways that include the adaptor protein Crk. The partial inhibition of SphK1 activity by N,N-dimethylsphingosine or expression by small interfering RNA increased sensitivity to imatinib-induced apoptosis in resistant cells and returned BCR-ABL to baseline levels. To determine the resistance mechanism-induced SphK1 upregulation, we used pharmacological inhibitors of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway and observed robust downmodulation of SphK1 expression and activity when AKT2, but not AKT1 or AKT3, was suppressed. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that SphK1 is upregulated in imatinib-resistant K562 cells by a pathway contingent on a phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT2/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway. We propose that SphK1 plays an important role in development of acquired resistance to imatinib in chronic myeloid leukemia cell lines.","['Copyright (c) 2011 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

The purpose of our work was to provide insight into the mechanism of action characterizing the cytotoxic effect of IKA in HL-60 leukemia cells in order to evaluate its potential as an antineoplastic agent. Cell viability was reduced in response to IKA (IC(50) of 221.3nM), while the amount of HL-60 cells with a subdiploid DNA content increased significantly after 24h. Apoptotic cell death was confirmed by the cleavage of caspase-9, -8 and -3 using immunoblotting. Single cell gel electrophoresis pointed to an early genotoxic effect. Monitoring of intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) levels by flow cytometric analysis of Fluo-3-AM fluorescence indicated an increase in cytosolic calcium that correlated with the cleavage of caspases. In addition, IKA triggered the activation of p38 MAP kinase which was partly dependent on elevated [Ca(2+)](i) concentrations and contributed to caspase activation. The data demonstrate that IKA induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells through genotoxicity and caspase activation which was in part correlated to an increase in intracellular calcium levels and activation of p38 MAP kinase.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The clinical pictures and outcomes of this virus are not entirely clear. METHOD: Consecutive cases of CMV infection (17 patients with 20 episodes) were compiled for study over a six year period. RESULTS: CMV infection occurred in patients of various ages and with a number of underlying hematological diseases, including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma (MM), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myeloproliferative neoplasm, No single laboratory assay was sensitive enough to serve as a screening test in the diagnosis of CMV infection. A combination of laboratory assays, clinical features and radiographic findings were required for diagnosis. All patients with AML or MM had received various chemotherapies before CMV infection. All but one lymphoma patient had received steroids and rituximab treatment prior to CMV infection. CMV infection episodes were accompanied by various co-infections in 60% (12/20) of cases. Bacterial lobar pneumonia was the most common form of co-infection. We used ganciclovir as the sole antiviral treatment in most of the infection episodes (18/20). Anti-CMV immunoglobulin (cytotect) was also provided to one patient because of persistent fever and dyspnea. Treatment was successful in all but one of the cases, which occurred when ganciclovir was initiated after respiratory failure. This patient died of CMV pneumonia. The other patients had good initial responses to antiviral treatment, but their long-term outcome was poor. Only five patients survived after a short follow-up duration. CONCLUSIONS: In an era of intensive immuno-chemotherapy, CMV infection may become a serious threat for hematology patients. Physicians dealing with hematological malignancies should be aware of CMV infection, especially for patients receiving rituximab and steroids.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Melatonin is an indolamine without relevant side effects. It has been shown previously to exhibit synergism with several chemotherapeutic drugs in Ewing sarcoma cells by potentiating the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. It also sensitizes human glioma cells against TRAIL by increasing DR5 expression. Here, we report the induction of cell death by melatonin in several human malignant haematological cell lines through the activation of the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Such activation was mediated by the increase in the expression of the death receptors Fas, DR4 and DR5 and their ligands Fas L and TRAIL, with a remarkable rise in the expression of Fas and Fas L. The cytotoxic effect and the increase in Fas and Fas L were dependent on Akt activation. Results were corroborated in blasts from bone marrow and peripheral blood of acute myeloid leukaemia patients, where melatonin induced cell death and increased both Fas and Fas L expressions. We conclude that melatonin may be considered as a potential antileukaemic agent and its therapeutic use, either alone or in combination with current chemotherapeutic drugs, should be taken into consideration for further research.",['(c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The levels of sTfR reflect the receptor density on cells (tissue iron status) and the number of cells with receptors (erythropoietic activity). Currently assays for the measurements of sTfR are standardized using different reference materials, give different results, and have different reference ranges.

The relation between (T ( o )) and (T ( n ) in most instances strongly depends on the PCR conditions. This difficult situation is caused by two main properties of PCR: first, the huge over-all amplification factor makes PCR very sensitive to small variations of the experimental conditions; the second problem is caused by the saturation phenomenon, i.e., the gradual decrease of the amplification efficiency that starts in the later stages of PCR, usually following the accumulation of some threshold amount of product.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RT-PCR, real-time RT-PCR, flow cytometry, and confocal microscopy assay were performed to detect the Fas level of mRNA and protein in the two cell lines. The sensitivities to Fas-mediated apoptosis of the two cell lines were evaluated by flow cytometry with Alexa Fluor 488 annexin V/PI staining in vitro. Tumor xenograft models were prepared with Jurkat and Jurkat-Fas cells for in vivo study. Fas mRNA and protein levels in Jurkat-Fas cell line were higher than that in Jurkat cell line. Compared to Jurkat cells, apoptosis rates of Jurkat-Fas cells were remarkably higher in vitro, and the tumor growth of Jurkat-Fas cells in nude mice was significantly inhibited in vivo. Stable over-expression of extrinsic Fas gene can significantly ameliorate the sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis in human malignant T-cell, which indicates a novel strategy to improve therapeutic effects on precursor T-cell malignancy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, methods are available to enable efficient derivation of footprint-free human iPSCs. However, each of these methods has its limitations. We have previously derived footprint-free human iPSCs by employing episomal vectors for transgene delivery, but the process was inefficient and required feeder cells. Here, we have greatly improved the episomal reprogramming efficiency using a cocktail containing MEK inhibitor PD0325901, GSK3beta inhibitor CHIR99021, TGF-beta/Activin/Nodal receptor inhibitor A-83-01, ROCK inhibitor HA-100 and human leukemia inhibitory factor. Moreover, we have successfully established a feeder-free reprogramming condition using chemically defined medium with bFGF and N2B27 supplements and chemically defined human ESC medium mTeSR1 for the derivation of footprint-free human iPSCs. These improvements enabled the routine derivation of footprint-free human iPSCs from skin fibroblasts, adipose tissue-derived cells and cord blood cells.

RAF265 inhibited 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-d-glucose (FDG) accumulation in cell culture at 28 hours in a dose-dependent manner. RAF265 also inhibited FDG accumulation in tumor xenografts after 1 day of drug treatment. This decrease persisted for the remaining 2 weeks of treatment. DNA microarray analysis of treated tumor xenografts revealed significantly decreased expression of genes regulating glucose and thymidine metabolism and revealed changes in apoptotic genes, suggesting that the imaging tracers FDG, 3-deoxy-3-[(18)F]fluorothymidine, and annexin V could serve as potential imaging biomarkers for RAF265 therapy monitoring. We concluded that RAF265 is highly efficacious in this xenograft model of human melanoma and decreases glucose metabolism as measured by DNA microarray analysis, cell culture assays, and small animal FDG PET scans as early as 1 day after treatment. Our results support the use of FDG PET in clinical trials with RAF265 to assess early tumor response. DNA microarray analysis and small animal PET studies may be used as complementary technologies in drug development.

Recent genome-wide profiling of structural DNA alterations in ALL have identified multiple submicroscopic somatic mutations targeting key cellular pathways, and have demonstrated substantial evolution in genetic alterations from diagnosis to relapse. However, DNA sequence mutations in ALL have not been analysed in detail. To identify novel mutations in relapsed ALL, we resequenced 300 genes in matched diagnosis and relapse samples from 23 patients with ALL. This identified 52 somatic non-synonymous mutations in 32 genes, many of which were novel, including the transcriptional coactivators CREBBP and NCOR1, the transcription factors ERG, SPI1, TCF4 and TCF7L2, components of the Ras signalling pathway, histone genes, genes involved in histone modification (CREBBP and CTCF), and genes previously shown to be targets of recurring DNA copy number alteration in ALL. Analysis of an extended cohort of 71 diagnosis-relapse cases and 270 acute leukaemia cases that did not relapse found that 18.3% of relapse cases had sequence or deletion mutations of CREBBP, which encodes the transcriptional coactivator and histone acetyltransferase CREB-binding protein (CREBBP, also known as CBP). The mutations were either present at diagnosis or acquired at relapse, and resulted in truncated alleles or deleterious substitutions in conserved residues of the histone acetyltransferase domain. Functionally, the mutations impaired histone acetylation and transcriptional regulation of CREBBP targets, including glucocorticoid responsive genes. Several mutations acquired at relapse were detected in subclones at diagnosis, suggesting that the mutations may confer resistance to therapy. These results extend the landscape of genetic alterations in leukaemia, and identify mutations targeting transcriptional and epigenetic regulation as a mechanism of resistance in ALL.",,['NIHMS258256'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abnormal CRAC channel function in T cells has been linked to severe combined immunodeficiency and autoimmune diseases. Studying CRAC channel function in human T cells may uncover new molecular mechanisms regulating normal immune responses and unravel the causes of related human diseases. Electrophysiological recordings of membrane currents provide the most accurate assessment of functional channel properties and their regulation. Electrophysiological assessment of CRAC channel currents in Jurkat T cells, a human leukemia T cell line, was first performed more than 20 years ago, however, CRAC current measurements in normal human T cells remains a challenging task. The difficulties in recording CRAC channel currents in normal T cells are compounded by the fact that blood-derived T lymphocytes are much smaller in size than Jurkat T cells and, therefore, the endogenous whole-cell CRAC currents are very low in amplitude. Here, we give a step-by-step procedure that we routinely use to record the Ca(2+) or Na(+) currents via CRAC channels in resting human T cells isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers. The method described here was adopted from the procedures used for recording the CRAC currents in Jurkat T cells and activated human T cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, Flt3 is also one of the most frequently mutated receptors in hematologic malignancies and is currently a major prognostic factor and clinical target for acute myeloid leukemia. Here, we report the structural basis for the Flt3 ligand-receptor complex and unveil an unanticipated extracellular assembly unlike any other RTKIII/V complex characterized to date. FL induces dimerization of Flt3 via a remarkably compact binding epitope localized at the tip of extracellular domain 3 of Flt3, and it invokes a ternary complex devoid of homotypic receptor interactions. Comparisons of Flt3 with homologous receptors and available mutagenesis data for FL have allowed us to rationalize the unique features of the Flt3 extracellular assembly. Furthermore, thermodynamic dissection of complex formation points to a pronounced enthalpically driven binding event coupled to an entropic penalty. Together, our data suggest that the high-affinity Flt3:FL complex is driven in part by a single preformed binding epitope on FL reminiscent of a ""lock-and-key"" binding mode, thereby setting the stage for antagonist design.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its efficacy is likely the consequence of its broad range of biologic activities, including direct effects on malignant cells, enhancement of anti-tumor immune responses, induction of proapoptotic genes, inhibition of angiogenesis, and promotion of the cycling of dormant malignant stem cells. Because of the recent development of ""targeted"" therapies, the use of IFN has been dramatically reduced over the last decade. The increasing awareness of the multistep pathogenesis of many malignancies has suggested, however, that such an approach using target-specific agents is not universally effective. These observations have resulted in a number of recent clinical trials utilizing IFNalpha in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), systemic mast cell disease, hypereosinophilic syndrome and the Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) with promising outcomes. These reports provide evidence that IFNalpha, alone or in combination with other agents, can induce surprisingly robust molecular response rates and possibly improve survival. Although IFNalpha at present remains an experimental form of therapy for patients with myeloid malignancies, these promising results suggest that it may become again an important component of the therapeutic arsenal for this group of hematologic malignancies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells (HSPCs) represent probable targets for transformation. Here, we explored in vitro and in vivo the impact of the enforced expression of MLL-AF4 in human cord blood-derived CD34(+) HSPCs. Intrabone marrow transplantation into NOD/SCID-IL2Rgamma(-/-) mice revealed an enhanced multilineage hematopoietic engraftment, efficiency, and homing to other hematopoietic sites on enforced expression of MLL-AF4. Lentiviral transduction of MLL-AF4 into CD34(+) HSPCs increased the in vitro clonogenic potential of CD34(+) progenitors and promoted their proliferation. Consequently, cell cycle and apoptosis analyses suggest that MLL-AF4 conveys a selective proliferation coupled to a survival advantage, which correlates with changes in the expression of genes involved in apoptosis, sensing DNA damage and DNA repair. However, MLL-AF4 expression was insufficient to initiate leukemogenesis on its own, indicating that either additional hits (or reciprocal AF4-MLL product) may be required to initiate ALL or that cord blood-derived CD34(+) HSPCs are not the appropriate cellular target for MLL-AF4-mediated ALL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this prospective observational study, we investigate the effect of platelet transfusion on the systemic levels of platelet-derived cytokines, chemokines and interleukins in an unselected group of acute leukaemia patients with severe chemotherapy-induced cytopenia. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated 31 platelet transfusions involving pre-storage, white blood cell-reduced, gamma-irradiated or pathogen-inactivated, photochemically-treated platelet concentrates received by 10 unselected patients. Peripheral blood plasma samples were collected before, immediately after, one hour, and 24 hours after the transfusions. Sampling from platelet concentrates was performed immediately before transfusion. A total of 31 soluble mediators were examined. Ten healthy controls matched for age and gender were included. RESULTS: Despite heterogeneity in patients and platelet concentrates, significantly increased plasma concentrations were detected for the platelet-derived mediators, platelet-derived growth factor, beta-thromboglobulin, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), CCL5, and CXCL4, 1 hour and/or immediately after platelet transfusions. The plasma levels of vascular endothelial growth factor and soluble CD40 ligand were not altered by platelet transfusion. Certain interleukins (IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-9, and IL-12), as well as interferon-gamma showed a minor, transient decrease in systemic plasma levels during the first hour following transfusion.

Subjects were administered a standardized questionnaire and underwent physical exam. RESULTS: HTLV-1 infected subjects were significantly more likely than controls to report complaints of hand and foot numbness (OR=5.3; 95% CI: 1.8-15.3; p=0.002 and OR=4.0; 95% CI: 1.3-12; p=0.013 respectively), difficulty running (OR=4.0; 95% CI: 1.1-14.2; p=0.032), nocturia (OR=5.0; 95% CI: 1.1-22.8; p=0.038), arthralgia (OR=3.3; 95% CI: 1.4-7.7; p=0.006), and photophobia (OR=3.3; 95% CI: 1.4-7.7; p=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Neurologic, ocular and rheumatologic complaints may be the first manifestations of HTLV-1 infection. Therefore, all patients presenting with initial diagnosis should be rigorously screened for these symptoms.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We herein prospectively included consecutive patients with MRI-confirmed cerebral arterial infarctions among individuals admitted in our stroke unit during a 32 month period to determine the clinical and neuroradiological features of ischemic stroke due to HD. Patients with both HD and other identified sources of stroke were excluded. Among patients who were admitted for suspected stroke, 590 had diffusion-weighted MRI confirmed acute arterial infarcts. Cause of the cerebral infarction was HD in 13 patients (2.2%): myeloproliferative disorders (n=4), multiple myeloma (1), lymphoma (1), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (1), disseminated intravascular coagulation (2), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (1), antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (2) and homozygous Q506 factor V mutation associated with lupus anticoagulant (1). The HD were previously known in 6 patients. The only significant difference between the groups of patients with or without HD was the prevalence of multiple acute infarcts in different vascular territories, detected in 53.8% of patients with HD versus 7.8% of patients without HD (mostly due to atherosclerosis, small vessel disease or cardioembolism) (p<0.0001; Fisher exact test). Initial treatment in stroke unit included anticoagulation, steroids, chemotherapy, phlebotomy or plasmatic exchanges, according to etiology. Rankin score at six months was </=2 in 8 patients. A large spectrum of hematological diseases can be associated with cerebral infarction.

To determine the relevance of PML-mTOR antagonism in tumourigenesis, we have intercrossed Pml null mice with Tsc2 heterozygous mice, which develop kidney cysts and carcinomas exhibiting mTOR upregulation. We find that combined inactivation of Pml and Tsc2 results in aberrant TORC1 activity both in pre-tumoural kidneys as well as in kidney lesions. Such increase correlates with a marked acceleration in tumour progression, impacting on both the biology and histology of kidney carcinomas. Also, Pml inactivation decreases the rate of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for the wt Tsc2 allele. Interestingly, however, aberrant TORC1 activity does not accelerate renal cystogenesis in Tsc2/Pml mutants.

Epub 2011 Mar 8.,,,,"BACKGROUND: Methotrexate (MTX) is an important component of the therapy for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Treatment with high-dose MTX often causes toxicity, recommending a dose reduction and/or cessation of treatment. Polymorphisms in genes involved in the MTX metabolism have been associated with toxicity with controversial results. The discrepancies could be due to differences in treatment protocols among studies, small, or non-homogeneous populations or the use of different toxicity criteria. The aim of the present study was to analyze the possible correlation of polymorphisms of genes involved in the MTX metabolism with the toxicity during therapy with the well-established LAL/SHOP protocol. PROCEDURE: We analyzed 10 polymorphisms in seven genes (MTHFR, TS, SHMT1, RFC1, ABCB1, ABCG2, and SLCO1B1) from the MTX metabolism in 115 Spanish pediatric B-ALL patients, using MTX plasma concentration as an objective and quantifiable marker of toxicity. RESULTS: We confirmed the suitability of MTX plasma levels as a toxicity marker. We found a statistically significant association between MTX plasma concentration and the SLCO1B1 rs11045879 CC genotype (P = 0.030). The rs4149081 AA genotype, in the same gene, could also be an indicator for high-MTX plasma concentrations. We did not find any significant association in the other genetic polymorphisms analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of the rs4149081 and rs11045879 SLCO1B1 polymorphisms in children with ALL could be a useful tool for monitoring patients at risk of low-MTX clearance in order to avoid MTX-related toxicity.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We correlated the impact of FLT3 mutations and its expression with age, WHO 2008 classification and treatment outcome in 531 childhood acute leukaemias. Of 150 acute myeloid leukaemia (AMLs), 18 (12%) harboured FLT3-ITD while nine (6%) had FLT3-TKD. FLT3-ITD and -TKD were rare in acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia (AMKL; FLT3-ITD 0/26, FLT3-TKD 1/26) and children below 3 years (n = 2/48). Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) with t(15;17);PML-RARalpha (n = 7/18; 39%) harboured the highest frequency of FLT3 mutations, followed by myelomonocytic (n = 4/18; 22%) and AML with t(8;21);RUNX1-RUNX1T1 (n = 2/21; 9%). FLT3 expression levels were also lowest in AMKL, both in Down's and non-Down's (p = 0.002) followed by patients <3 years (p = 0.001). The rarity of FLT3 mutations and expression levels in AMKL were independent of age. Conversely, only 2% of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) harboured FLT3 mutations (ITD = 1/381; TKD = 6/381). FLT3 was highly expressed in hyperdiploid ALL (p < 0.001). Of the 121 AMLs with clinical history, there were no significant differences in 4-year event-free survival (EFS) (46% vs. 38%; p = 0.46) and overall-survival (OS) (55% vs. 43%; p = 0.30) between FLT3-wildtype and ITD+ patients. Similarly, FLT3 expression levels did not influence survival in AML in both the good risk and non-good risk subgroups. FLT3 does not appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of AMKL, both in Down's and non-Down's. Therapeutic targets using FLT3 inhibitors may not be useful in AMKL and in young children with AML.","['Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this retrospective study, we report the results on 25 'real life' patients with MDS, CMML or AML treated with azacitidine between 2005 and 2009. All patients fulfilled the World Health Organization criteria for MDS and AML. No eligibility criteria other than diagnosis were considered. Complete response (CR) rate was observed in three of the 25 'real life' patients (12%) with a median duration of CR of 5 months (4-6 months). Seven patients (28%) had mono- or bi-lineage haematologic improvement and 15 patients (60%) showed neither morphologic nor haematologic response. Among 17 non-AML patients, the median time from onset of Aza-C treatment to AML transformation was 10 months (4-15 months). Overall death rate was 72%. All of the eight AML patients died. The death rate under Aza-C among non-AML patients was 59%. Unlike the results of the clinical trials, our data show that Aza-C has a limited activity in 'real-life' patients with MDS and AML. It is obvious that Aza-C can induce complete or partial responses in a considerable number of MDS patients but responses are usually not durable as we observed in our patients.","['Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using data from the Cancer Registry and the Medical Birth Registry of Norway, postcancer pregnancy rates were analyzed in 27,556 survivors and compared to those from a matched comparison group (""controls"") from the general population. All were born after 1950, diagnosed from 1967 to 2004 at age of 16-45, and had an observation time from the date of diagnosis (assigned date for controls), until pregnancy, death, age 46, or December 31, 2006. Cox regression was used to estimate pregnancy rates, after adjusting for educational level, parity and diagnostic period. Overall, cancer survivors had a lower pregnancy rate than the controls, but the rate for survivors was higher in males than in females [hazard rate (HR)=0.74 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71-0.78) and HR=0.61 (95% CI 0.58-0.64), respectively]. However, the rates did not differ between controls and survivors of malignant melanoma or thyroid cancer. By contrast, the lowest HRs for pregnancy occurred in survivors of leukemia, cervical or breast cancer. Increased pregnancy rates during the study period were detected for ovarian cancer [HR=0.2 (95% CI 0.1-0.3) to HR=0.7 (95% CI 0.5-0.9)], testicular cancer [HR=0.6 (95% CI 0.4-0.9) to HR=0.8 (95% CI 0.7-0.8)], and Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosed in men [HR=0.7 (95% CI 0.5-0.9) to HR=0.9 (95% CI 0.7-1.0)].

Population-based data avoid patient selection and may therefore substitute for lack of randomized trials. METHODS: We evaluated alloSCT rates within the Swedish Acute Leukemia Registry, including 3899 adult patients diagnosed from 1997 through 2006 with a coverage of 98% and a median follow-up of 6.2 years. RESULTS: AlloSCT rates and survival decreased rapidly with age >55 years. The 8-year overall survival (OS) was 65% in patients <30 years and 38% in patients <60 years and was similar for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Among 1073 patients <60 years, alloSCT was performed in 42% and 49% of patients with AML and ALL, respectively. Two-thirds of the alloSCTs were performed in first complete remission, and half used unrelated donors, the same in AML and ALL. Regional differences in management and outcome were found: 60% of AML patients <40 years received alloSCT in all parts of Sweden, but two-thirds of AML patients 40-59 years had alloSCT in one region compared with one-third in other regions (P<.001), with improved 8-year OS among all AML patients in this age cohort (51% vs 30%; P = .005). CONCLUSIONS: More Swedish AML patients received alloSCT, and long-term survival was better than in recently published large international studies, despite our lack of selection bias.

We analyzed the event-free survival (EFS) and hospital treatment charges of older adult patients with different cytogenetic risk profiles. In patients with a better/intermediate risk profile, the average total treatment cost of HiDAC was similar to that of DNR (P = 0.11). A 5-year follow-up of patients with better/intermediate cytogenetic risk profiles revealed that the median EFS of patients who received HiDAC was significantly longer than for patients who received the DNR-based regimen (27 vs. 20 months, P = 0.03). Average cost per year of life saved was 18,746.84 USD for HiDAC, compared to 32,733.37 USD for DNR. In contrast, for patients with a poor cytogenetic risk profile, the average total treatment cost for HiDAC was higher than for DNR (P < 0.005). In addition, the median EFS in the HiDAC protocol group was significantly lower than in the DNR group (11 vs. 20 months, P = 0.003). Meanwhile, in this risk group, the average cost per year of life saved was 103,237.70 USD compared to 32,277.93 USD, respectively, in the HiDAC and DNR regimens. We conclude that HiDAC is a more efficacious and cost-effective consolidation treatment regimen in the better/intermediate risk group, while the DNR-based regimen is more cost-effective in the poor risk group.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that 154 genes were methylated in more than 10% of ALL samples. Interestingly, the expression of 13 genes implicated in the TP53 pathway was downregulated by hypermethylation. Direct or indirect activation of TP53 pathway with 5-aza-2'-deoxycitidine, Curcumin or Nutlin-3 induced an increase in apoptosis of ALL cells. The results obtained with the initial group of 48 patients was validated retrospectively in a second cohort of 200 newly diagnosed ALL patients. Methylation of at least 1 of the 13 genes implicated in the TP53 pathway was observed in 78% of the patients, which significantly correlated with a higher relapse (p = 0.001) and mortality (p<0.001) rate being an independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival (DFS) (p = 0.006) and overall survival (OS) (p = 0.005) in the multivariate analysis. All these findings indicate that TP53 pathway is altered by epigenetic mechanisms in the majority of ALL patients and correlates with prognosis.

Here, we identified a unique phenotype of exhausted T cells in mice with advanced acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). This phenotype is characterized by the coexpression of Tim-3 and PD-1 on CD8(+) T cells in the liver, the major first site of AML metastases. PD-1 and Tim-3 coexpression increased during AML progression. PD-1(+)Tim-3(+) CD8(+) T cells were deficient in their ability to produce IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-2 in response to PD-1 ligand (PDL1) and Tim-3 ligand (galectin-9) expressing AML cells. PD-1 knockout (KO), which were partially resistant to AML challenge, up-regulated Tim-3 during AML progression and such Tim-3(+)PD-1- KO CD8(+) T cells had reduced cytokine production. Galectin-9 KO mice were more resistant to AML, which was associated with reduced T-regulatory cell accumulation and a modest induction of PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on CD8(+) T cells. Whereas blocking the PD-1/PDL1 or Tim-3/galectin-9 pathway alone was insufficient to rescue mice from AML lethality, an additive effect was seen in reducing-albeit not eliminating-both tumor burden and lethality when both pathways were blocked. Therefore, combined PD-1/PDL1 and Tim-3/galectin-9 blockade may be beneficial in preventing CD8(+) T-cell exhaustion in patients with hematologic malignancies such as advanced AML.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dasatinib treatment is associated with mild thrombocytopenia and an increased risk of bleeding, but its biological effect on megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet production is unknown. In this study, we show that dasatinib causes mild thrombocytopenia in mice without altering platelet half-life, suggesting that it inhibits platelet formation. Conversely, the number of megakaryocytes (MKs) in the bone marrow of dasatinib-treated mice was increased and the ploidy of MKs derived from bone marrow progenitor cells in vitro was elevated in the presence of dasatinib. Furthermore, a significant delay in platelet recovery after immune-induced thrombocytopenia was observed in dasatinib-treated mice even though the number of MKs in the bone marrow was increased relative to controls at all time points. Interestingly, the migration of MKs toward a gradient of stromal cell-derived factor 1alpha (SDF1alpha) and the formation of proplatelets in vitro were abolished by dasatinib. We propose that dasatinib causes thrombocytopenia as a consequence of ineffective thrombopoiesis, promoting MK differentiation but also impairing MK migration and proplatelet formation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding the biology of CLL cells, particularly cell maturation and growth in vivo, has been impeded by lack of a reproducible adoptive transfer model. We report a simple, reproducible system in which primary CLL cells proliferate in nonobese diabetes/severe combined immunodeficiency/gammac(null) mice under the influence of activated CLL-derived T lymphocytes. By co-transferring autologous T lymphocytes, activated in vivo by alloantigens, the survival and growth of primary CFSE-labeled CLL cells in vivo is achieved and quantified. Using this approach, we have identified key roles for CD4(+) T cells in CLL expansion, a direct link between CD38 expression by leukemic B cells and their activation, and support for CLL cells preferentially proliferating in secondary lymphoid tissues. The model should simplify analyzing kinetics of CLL cells in vivo, deciphering involvement of nonleukemic elements and nongenetic factors promoting CLL cell growth, identifying and characterizing potential leukemic stem cells, and permitting preclinical studies of novel therapeutics. Because autologous activated T lymphocytes are 2-edged swords, generating unwanted graph-versus-host and possibly autologous antitumor reactions, the model may also facilitate analyses of T-cell populations involved in immune surveillance relevant to hematopoietic transplantation and tumor cytoxicity.",,,,,,,,['Blood. 2011 May 19;117(20):5273-4.

Here, we show that TEAD2 and its transcriptional co-activator, the Yes-associated protein YAP, co-operate in a signaling pathway downstream of Yes. We show that YAP, TEAD2 and Yes are highly expressed in self-renewing ES cells, are activated by LIF and serum, and are downregulated when cells are induced to differentiate. We also demonstrate that kinase-active Yes binds and phosphorylates YAP, and activates YAP-TEAD2-dependent transcription. We found that TEAD2 associates directly with the Oct-3/4 promoter. Moreover, activation of the Yes pathway induced activity of the Oct-3/4 and Nanog promoters, whereas suppression of this pathway inhibited promoter activity. Nanog, in turn, suppressed TEAD2-dependent promoter activity, whereas siRNA-mediated knockdown of Nanog induced it, suggesting a negative regulatory feedback loop. Episomal supertransfection of cells with inhibitory TEAD2-EnR induced endodermal differentiation, which suggests that this pathway is necessary for ES cell maintenance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Primary engraftment was achieved in all 44 patients. The cumulative incidence of transplant-related mortality (TRM) was 2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0%-16%) at 100 days and 18% (95% CI 10%-34%) at 2 years. The 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 19% (95% CI 8%-41%) for those transplanted in CR1, and 48% (29%-80%) for those with more advanced disease. After a median follow-up of 32 months (range: 15-69 months), the 2-year overall survival (OS) was 54% (95% CI 39%-69%). Relapse-free survival (RFS) at 2 years was 63% (95% CI 45%-81%) for patients transplanted in CR1 and 34% (95% CI 11%-57%) for patients transplanted in more advanced disease.

These expression systems can be costly, yield heterogeneously phosphorylated protein samples and present difficulties when metabolic labeling is required for structural studies. Therefore, many attempts have been made to develop bacterial purification systems for SFKs. So far, high-yield bacterial expression systems have only been achieved for SFK kinase domains or for inactive mutants of constructs containing the regulatory SH3 and SH2 domains, but not for their active forms. Herein described is a bacterial expression system for the wild type, active SFK Hck containing SH3, SH2 and kinase domains. Hck plays an important role in phagocyte function as well as the etiology of chronic myeloid leukemia as Hck is an interaction partner of Bcr-Abl. Structural studies of Hck are essential to fully understand the signaling processes involved in host defense and leukemogenesis. Successful bacterial expression of Hck was possible by a dual strategy: (1) co-expression with YopH phosphatase in order to control host toxicity, and (2) expression in a bacterial strain that is RNase E deficient, which dramatically increased overall expression levels. The expressed Hck construct is unphosphorylated and appears to be in an open conformation. Bacterially expressed Hck is capable of autophosphorylation, phosphorylates substrate at rates comparable to insect cell expressed Hck, and can be inhibited by staurosporine and Csk.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Here we report an unusual adverse experience in a patient receiving a combination of TKIs. SUMMARY: The patient was a 62-year-old man with chronic myloid leukemia (CML) and thyroid carcinoma that did not concentrate iodide and had metastases. He was started on imatinib for his CML. About 5 months later he was started on sorafenib for his thyroid cancer. At this time he had no risk factors for cardiac disease except moderate obesity. He had a complete cytogenetic response in his CML, and a partial response in his thyroid cancer. Twenty-one months after starting the combination of TKIs, he manifested signs of coronary artery disease. He received a combination of medications and his TKIs were continued. He died of a sudden myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock 28 months after starting the combination of TKIs. A retrospective analysis of sequential 18-fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scans (18-FDG PET scans) were indicative of cardiac toxicity developing during the period of concomitant administration of TKIs. CONCLUSION: We report the first case of apparent lethal cardiotoxicity with imatinib-sorafenib combined therapy. Combination TKI treatment may enhance the risk of adverse effects. Our experience with this patient suggests that cardiac PET scan should be monitored closely in these type of patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to investigate the determinants of the TD in Turkish cancer patients. PROCEDURE: A retrospective analysis was performed on 329 children diagnosed with cancer, excluding leukemia. The TD, including parent/patient time and physician time, was defined as the interval between the onset of symptoms and the final diagnosis. RESULTS: The median times for parent/patient, physician, and TD were 3, 28, and 53 days, respectively. For patient in the 1-9 years age group, physician time and TD were significantly shorter than in infants and those over 10 years. The longest median TD was recorded for children with germ cell tumors and retinoblastoma; the shortest was in children with renal tumors. When the first point of contact was a pediatrician, a private hospital or physician's office, a governmental educational hospital or a university hospital physician time was short. The longest TD was noted in patients who first contacted a non-pediatric specialist. The most significant predictors of parent/patient, physician time, and TD were metastases at diagnosis, first medical center, and first health professional contacted, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The TD for childhood lymphomas and solid tumors was related to patient age, tumor type and location, the presence of distance metastases, first health professional, and center contacted. All physicians, especially other specialists seeing pediatric patients, need to be further sensitized to the signs and symptoms of childhood cancer.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SG2057 is the corresponding dimer containing a pentyldioxy linkage. SG2057 has multilog differential in vitro cytotoxicity against a panel of human tumour cell lines with a mean GI(50) of 212 pM. The agent is highly efficient at producing DNA interstrand cross-links in cells which form rapidly and persist over a 48 h period. Significant antitumor activity was demonstrated in several human tumor xenograft models. Cures were obtained in a LOX-IMVI melanoma model following a single administration and dose-dependent activity, including regression responses, observed in SKOV-3 ovarian and HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia models following repeat dose schedules. In the advanced stage LS174T model, SG2057 administered either as a single dose, or in two repeat dose schedules, was superior to irinotecan.

Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 Array (Affymetrix, CA, USA) was performed in 118 patients having CML, chronic phase. Thirty-nine clonal aberrations (CAs) were identified (35 losses, two gains, two copy neutral loss of heterozygosity) that were not detected by metaphase cytogenetics in 25 patients (21%). The 9q34 deletions were found in 10% of cases, while 22q11.2 deletions were observed in 12% of cases. Seven patients (6%) harbored both 5'-ABL and 3'-BCR deletions adjacent to the t(9;22) breakpoint. Copy number gains were identified at 8p and 9p, and losses at 2q, 7q, 8q, 9q, 11q, 13q, 16p, and 22q. When we compared the treatment outcome of imatinib therapy between patients with and without CAs identified by SNP-A, treatment failure and progression to advanced disease were not significantly different (p > 0.05). In addition, according to the presence of deletions of 9q34 and/or 22q11.2 identified by SNP-A, the treatment outcome did not show any significant differences (p > 0.05). Our data suggests that SNP-A analysis is a useful tool for detection of clonal aberrations including deletions adjacent to the t(9;22) breakpoint in the CML cancer genome. However, clonal aberrations detected by SNP-A could not improve a prognostic stratification in CML patients with chronic phase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2011 Mar 9.,,,,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) maintain hematopoietic homeostasis throughout a mammal's lifespan through self-renewal and differentiation into mature blood cells. Within a bone marrow niche, HSCs adopt a quiescent state and remain in the non-dividing, G0 phase of the cell cycle. It was recently shown that maintenance of genomic integrity is crucial for the preservation of self-renewal capacity of HSCs. In this review, we focus on progress in elucidating the roles of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA damage responses (DDR) in maintaining genomic integrity, and thus HSC function. Several studies have demonstrated that inappropriate ROS levels arising from disruption of the Atm, PI3K-Akt, or Mdm2-p53 pathways impair HSC function in vivo. Intriguing evidence that stem cells use specific DDR mechanisms is also accumulating. Although murine HSCs are more resistant than progenitor cells to mild DNA damage in vivo, the surviving HSCs frequently acquire genetic aberrations that can lead to leukemogenesis. Indeed, non-dividing HSCs employ the error-prone non-homologous end-joining pathway of DNA repair to fix DNA breaks, whereas progenitors undergo apoptosis; proliferating HSCs employ the high-fidelity homologous recombination mechanism. Dissection of HSC-specific mechanisms for the maintenance of genomic integrity may provide valuable insights into the biology of both HSCs and leukemia stem cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNAM-1 is a co-receptor involved in the activation of NK cell cytotoxicity after its interaction with its ligands CD112 and CD155 on target cells. Here we study the expression of DNAM-1 on NK cells and DNAM-1 ligands on blasts from AML patients stratified by age. The results demonstrate that NK cells from AML patients younger than 65 years have a reduced expression of DNAM-1 compared with age-matched controls. The analysis of DNAM-1 ligands showed a high expression of CD112 and CD155 on leukemic blasts. An inverse correlation between CD112 expression on leukemic blasts and DNAM-1 expression on NK cells was found. Furthermore, downregulation of DNAM-1 was induced on healthy donors' NK cells after in vitro culture with leukemic blasts expressing DNAM-1 ligands. In conclusion, these results support the hypothesis that receptor-ligand crosslinking downregulates DNAM-1 expression on NK cells from patients <65 years of age. Considering the relevance of DNAM-1 in NK recognition and killing of leukemic cells, the reduced expression of this receptor on NK cells from AML patients can represent an additional mechanism of tumor escape.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 370 consecutive pediatric patients with solid tumors and leukemia treated at the University of Florida from 1963 to 2006 with curative CNS radiotherapy. The median age was 8.1 years (range, 0.2 to 19.0 y). One hundred seventy-two (47%), 79 (21%), and 119 (32%) patients received focal, whole-brain, and craniospinal irradiation, respectively. Variables analyzed for prognostic value included primary tumor histology, patient age at primary treatment, volume of tissue irradiated, dose to the tumor bed, treatment with chemotherapy, and location of the primary tumor. RESULTS: Eighteen second tumors were diagnosed in 16 patients. The actuarial incidences of second tumors were 3%, 8%, and 24% at 10, 20, and 30 years of follow-up, respectively. On univariate analysis, no single variable was found to be predictive of second tumor incidence. The most common second tumor after radiation for a primary solid CNS tumor was meningioma (63%), for which successful salvage was common (89%). Second gliomas were most common among patients treated for leukemia and were uniformly fatal. The most common cause of death among 5-year survivors was late relapse of their primary tumor. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of second tumors after CNS radiation is significant and does not plateau with long-term follow-up. Most second tumors after radiotherapy for solid CNS tumors are meningiomas that can be successfully salvaged.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, we show that promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger and IL-4 are also required for the generation of this ILL population.

We report here the identification of TIM3 as an AML stem cell surface marker more highly expressed on multiple specimens of AML LSC than on normal bone marrow HSC. TIM3 expression was detected in all cytogenetic subgroups of AML, but was significantly higher in AML-associated with core binding factor translocations or mutations in CEBPA. By assessing engraftment in NOD/SCID/IL2Rgamma-null mice, we determined that HSC function resides predominantly in the TIM3-negative fraction of normal bone marrow, whereas LSC function from multiple AML specimens resides predominantly in the TIM3-positive compartment. Significantly, differential TIM3 expression enabled the prospective separation of HSC from LSC in the majority of AML specimens with detectable residual HSC function.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At least in part, this regulation is achieved by core-clock or clock-controlled transcription factors whose abundance and/or activity oscillate during the day. The clock-controlled proline- and acidic amino acid-rich domain basic leucine zipper proteins D-site-binding protein, thyrotroph embryonic factor, and hepatic leukemia factor have previously been shown to participate in the circadian control of xenobiotic detoxification in liver and other peripheral organs. Here we present genetic and biochemical evidence that the three proline- and acidic amino acid-rich basic leucine zipper proteins also play a key role in circadian lipid metabolism by influencing the rhythmic expression and activity of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha). Our results suggest that, in liver, D-site-binding protein, hepatic leukemia factor, and thyrotroph embryonic factor contribute to the circadian transcription of genes specifying acyl-CoA thioesterases, leading to a cyclic release of fatty acids from thioesters. In turn, the fatty acids act as ligands for PPARalpha, and the activated PPARalpha receptor then stimulates the transcription of genes encoding proteins involved in the uptake and/or metabolism of lipids, cholesterol, and glucose metabolism.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA topoisomerase (topo) poisons are commonly prescribed anticancer drugs that kill cancer cells by inducing topo-DNA complexes. Using purified topoisomerases, previous in vitro studies have shown that EGCG induces the formation of topo-DNA complexes. Because the activity of a drug on purified topoisomerases does not always represent the activity in a cell, we have used an immunofluorescence technique that allows the visualisation of topo I- and topo II-DNA complexes produced in individual cells to evaluate the activity of EGCG on both enzymes. High levels of topo I- and topo II-DNA complexes were observed in K562 leukaemia cells exposed to EGCG. Similar levels of topo I- and topo II-DNA complexes were visualised in cells treated with gallic acid (GA) (the acid part of the EGCG ester). Pyrogallol (PG) also induced topo-DNA complexes with both enzymes, therefore suggesting that the activity of EGCG and GA is mediated by their PG moieties. Catalase prevented both the cytotoxicity and the formation of topo I- and topo II-DNA complexes induced by EGCG, GA, PG and myricetin (a PG-containing flavonoid recently shown to induce topo I- and topo II-DNA complexes in cells), indicating that hydrogen peroxide mediates these activities. Hydrogen peroxide induced topo I- and topo II (alpha and beta)-DNA complexes in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The formation of topo I- and topo II-DNA complexes in cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide correlated well with the induction of apoptosis, suggesting that the topo-DNA complexes induced at long exposure times by the compounds tested in our study may be apoptotic topo-DNA complexes. Finally, we report results suggesting that PG-containing drugs may selectively kill tumour cells by generating hydrogen peroxide.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Molecular modeling studies indicate that these new compounds possess a 'twisted' conformation similar to CA-4. The new analogs effectively inhibit the growth of human and murine cancer cells. The most potent compounds 6k, 6s and 6t, have IC(50) values in the sub-muM range. Analog 6t has an IC(50) of 182 nM in MDA-MB-435 cells and has advantages over earlier analogs due to its enhanced water solubility (456 muM). This compound initiates microtubule depolymerization with an EC(50) value of 1.8 muM in A-10 cells. In a murine L1210 syngeneic tumor model 6t had antitumor activity and no apparent toxicity.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2011 Mar 5.,,,,"BACKGROUND: Agaricus blazei Murrill (ABM) has been shown to exhibit immunostimulatory and anti-cancer activities; however, its mechanism of action is poorly understood. We recently found that the diffusible fraction of hot-water extract of ABM exhibits anti-tumor activity toward leukemic cells, and identified it as agaritine, a hydrazine-containing compound. In the present study, we examined the morphological and cytochemical effects of agaritine on U937 cells to elucidate the tumoricidal mechanism of agaritine. METHODS: Surface expression of phosphatidylserine (evaluated by annexin V binding), Fas antigen, DNA cleavage using TUNEL staining, changes in caspase activities and cytochrome c release, before and after treatment with agaritine, were examined using U937 cells. RESULTS: Nuclear damage, DNA fragmentation, was observed by Wright-Giemsa, TUNEL staining and agarose gel electrophoresis when U937 cells were incubated with 10mug/mL of agaritine for 48h. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that agaritine augments the proportion of annexin V-positive U937 cells without significant change in Fas antigen expression. Activities of caspase-3, -8 and -9 were gradually increased after the addition of agaritine. In the presence of caspase-3 or granzyme B inhibitor, except for the caspase-8 inhibitor, annexin V expression was significantly decreased, suggesting that mainly caspase-3 and -9 participate in the apoptotic pathway. Furthermore, cytochrome c release was detected by western blotting analysis after agaritine treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These results strongly suggest that the ABM constituent agaritine moderately induces apoptosis in U937 leukemic cells via caspase activation through cytochrome c release from mitochondria. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first report suggesting that the anti-tumor effect of agaritine is mediated through apoptosis. The present results might provide helpful suggestions for the design of anti-tumor drugs toward leukemia patients.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2011 Mar 4.,,,,"Environmental links to disease are difficult to uncover because environmental exposures are variable in time and space, contaminants occur in complex mixtures, and many diseases have a long time delay between exposure and onset. Furthermore, individuals in a population have different activity patterns (e.g., hobbies, jobs, and interests), and different genetic susceptibilities to disease. As such, there are many potential confounding factors to obscure the reasons that one individual gets sick and another remains healthy. An important method for deducing environmental associations with disease outbreak is the retrospective case-control study wherein the affected and control subject cohorts are studied to see what is different about their previous exposure history. Despite success with infectious diseases (e.g., food poisoning, and flu), case-control studies of cancer clusters rarely have an unambiguous outcome. This is attributed to the complexity of disease progression and the long-term latency between exposure and disease onset. In this article, we consider strategies for investigating cancer clusters and make some observations for improving statistical power through broader non-parametric approaches wherein sub-populations (i.e., whole towns), rather than individuals, are treated as the cases and controls, and the associated cancer rates are treated as the dependent variable. We subsequently present some ecological data for tungsten and cobalt from studies by University of Arizona researchers who document elevated levels of tungsten and cobalt in Fallon, NV.

We present retrospective outcome data on 306 recipients of myeloablative, human leucocyte antigen-matched UD allografts using pre-transplant in-vivo Alemtuzumab. Transplants were performed between 2000 and 2007 for chronic myeloid leukaemia in first chronic phase and acute leukaemia in first or second complete remission; 184 patients received BM and 122 PBSC. The median age was 28.9 years (<1-58) and the median follow-up was 48 months. Overall survival at 8 years was 53%. The incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) was significantly higher in PBSC (65%) than BM recipients (49%; P=0.012). This represented only grade 1 GvHD with no difference in grade II-IV aGvHD (BM 23% PBSC 24%). The incidence of chronic GvHD, either overall (BM 47%, PBSC 49%) or extensive (BM 15%, PBSC 13%) was not increased with PBSC. The incidence of relapse, non-relapse mortality and survival were not significantly different. Whilst accepting the limitations of retrospective analyses, we suggest the increased risk of GvHD in recipients of PBSC in T-replete transplants is offset by in-vivo Alemtuzumab, and that either stem cell source can be used with good outcomes in this setting.",['(c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2011 Mar 8.,,,,"INTRODUCTION: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and dysplasia in one or more lineages, produce life-threatening cytopenias and progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Growing evidence suggests that targeting epigenetic mechanisms improves MDS/AML pathophysiology. AREAS COVERED: This review provides an understanding of studies investigating novel agents published up to January 2011 aimed at normalizing and monitoring the epigenetic profile of the MDS cancer cell. The authors discuss how non-intensive epigenetic therapy can 're-programme' gene expression patterns of abnormal hematopoiesis in MDS. Recently FDA-approved DNA-methyltransferase inhibitors, 5-azacytidine and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine or decitabine, represent frontline nonablative treatments, while combinations with histone deacetylase inhibitors show promising synergism in preclinical and Phase I/II trials in tumor suppressor gene re-expression and overall survival. Additional epigenetic mechanisms including non-encoding transcripts with inhibitory posttranscriptional regulatory functions, such as microRNAs, though not fully understood, present novel molecular and clinical implications in these disorders. EXPERT OPINION: Alongside current single-agent epigenetic regimens, combination therapies represent potentially effective options for intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS. Methylation profiles and gene mutation predictors provide promising areas of development for monitoring MDS disease progression and outcome, while targeting microRNA dysregulation represents an important therapeutic goal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2011 Mar 7.,,,,"Updated analyses of mortality data are presented on 46,970 workers employed 1948-1999 at Rocketdyne (Atomics International). Overall, 5,801 workers were involved in radiation activities, including 2,232 who were monitored for intakes of radionuclides, and 41,169 workers were engaged in rocket testing or other non-radiation activities. The worker population is unique in that lifetime occupational doses from all places of employment were sought, updated and incorporated into the analyses. Further, radiation doses from intakes of 14 different radionuclides were calculated for 16 organs or tissues using biokinetic models of the International Commission on Radiation Protection (ICRP). Because only negligible exposures were received by the 247 workers monitored for radiation activities after 1999, the mean dose from external radiation remained essentially the same at 13.5 mSv (maximum 1 Sv) as reported previously, as did the mean lung dose from external and internal radiation combined at 19.0 mSv (maximum 3.6 Sv). An additional 9 years of follow-up, from December 31,1999 through 2008, increased the person-years of observation for the radiation workers by 21.7% to 196,674 (mean 33.9 years) and the number of cancer deaths by 50% to 684. Analyses included external comparisons with the general population and the computation of standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and internal comparisons using proportional hazards models and the computation of relative risks (RRs). A low SMR for all causes of death (SMR 0.82; 95% CI 0.78-0.85) continued to indicate that the Rocketdyne radiation workers were healthier than the general population and were less likely to die. The SMRs for all cancers taken together (SMR 0.88; 95% CI 0.81-0.95), lung cancer (SMR 0.87; 95% CI 0.76-1.00) and leukemia other than chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (SMR 1.04; 95% 0.67-1.53) were not significantly elevated. Cox regression analyses revealed no significant dose-response trends for any cancer. For all cancers excluding leukemia, the RR at 100 mSv was estimated as 0.98 (95% CI 0.82-1.17), and for all leukemia other than CLL it was 1.06 (95% CI 0.50-2.23). Uranium was the primary radionuclide contributing to internal exposures, but no significant increases in lung and kidney disease were seen. The extended follow-up reinforces the findings in the previous study in failing to observe a detectable increase in cancer deaths associated with radiation, but strong conclusions still cannot be drawn because of small numbers and relatively low career doses. Larger combined studies of early workers in the United States using similar methodologies are warranted to refine and clarify radiation risks after protracted exposures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The procedure consists of co-infusing hematopoietic stem cells selected from the blood of a third-party donor; it is conceived as a tool to shorten the engraftment period without preventing the engraftment of the UCB, even when using units with relatively low cell content and a low HLA compatibility. Between 1999 and 2008 we performed 64 transplantations in 60 adult patients (35 men and 25 women) with a median age of 34 years (range: 76-60) and a median weight of 70 kg (range: 43-95), all of whom were diagnosed with a high risk hematologic neoplasm (leukemia in most cases). Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, ATG, and whole body irradiation or busulfan were used as conditioners. UCB was infused at medians of 2.4 x 107 CNT/kg (range: 1.14-4.30 x 107), 0.11 x 106 CD34+/kg (range: 0.035-0.37 x 106). Then, hematopoietic stem cells selected from the third-party donor were infused (2.43 x 106/kg [range: 1.05-3.34 x 106], with 0.3 x 104 CD3+/kg [range: 0.05-1.56 x 104]). Granulocyte engraftment occurred (ANC > 0.5 x 109/L) at a median of 10 days (range: 9-34 days), and the granulocyte engraftment of the UCB occurred in 21 days (range: 13-57 days). Complete UCB chimerism was observed in 37 days (range: 11-186 days) (previously double complete chimerism, presence of third-party donor and of cord) and platelet engraftment > 20 x 109/L in 33 days (range: 13 98 days) and > 50 x 109/L in 58 days (range: 14-106 days). Overall 3-year survival reached 51%, and 5 10 year-survival was 47% (plateau). Disease-free survival was 48% at three years, and 45% at 5 to 10 years; the mean follow-up of survivors was 48 months (range: 13-123 months). (Kaplan-Meier). In conclusion, early granulocyte recovery occurred thanks to a foster engraftment of hematopoietic stem from the third-party donor, which are not HLA-restricted; this is associated with a lower morbidity and mortality from infections secondary to neutropenia. There was also a high rate of engraftment and final full UCB chimerism, even with non-histocompatible UCB units (2/6 HLA mismatches) and with relatively low cell counts. In most cases, a single unit of UCB was sufficient. The incidence of severe GVHD and the percentage of relapses have been low. Opportunistic infections have occurred over a long period of time. This procedures makes allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation accessible to almost all patients.",,,,,,,,,Trasplante de sangre de cordon umbilical mas donante auxiliar: trasplante dual.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that GCS and MDR1 may interact. In this study, we used RNA interference (RNAi) to silence the GCS or MDR1 gene in K562/AO2 drug-resistant cells. The sensitivity of cells to different treatments with doxorubicin was evaluated. We used Taqman probe fluorescence real-time quantitative PCR, and detected expression of GCS and MDR1 mRNAs in different interfering groups. Intracellular mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), which represents rhodamine123 (rh123) retention, was determined by flow cytometry (FCM). An MTT cytotoxicity assay showed that the 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) of doxorubicin of K562/AO2 cells (138.25 +/- 3.75 microg/ml) was significantly higher than that of K562 drug-sensitive cells (2.125 +/- 0.125 microg/ml), and that IC50 was evidently lower in K562/AO2 cells, whether it was transfected with a small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting GCS (GCSsiRNA) or one targeting MDR1 (MDR1siRNA). Compared with untreated K562/AO2 cells, the inhibition rates of GCS mRNA in the cells transfected with GCSsiRNA for 9 and 36 h were 56.67 +/- 9.29% (p < 0.05) and 74 +/- 6.38% (p < 0.05), respectively. Interestingly, the expression of MDR1 mRNA was also inhibited to 51.7 +/- 4.5% (p < 0.05) 36 h after transfection with GCSsiRNA, but there was no significant difference in MDR1 expression at 9 h post-transfection in cells treated with GCSsiRNA and a negative control. It is well known that rh123 retention in cells results from an efflux function of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). In K562 cells, rh123 retention was much higher than in K562/AO2 cells (p < 0.01). We also noted that rh123 retention in the K562/AO2 cells transfected with GCSsiRNA for 48 h was significantly higher than in the negative control group. In conclusion, we show in the present study that inhibition of the GCS gene affects the expression of MDR1 mRNA and P-gp function.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-1 cells, the sesquiterpenes strongly inhibited 5-lipoxygenase-catalyzed leukotrienes production. In addition, they inhibited beta-hexosaminidase release by antigen-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells, with valencene having the highest inhibitory effect. CRE inhibited leukotrienes production and beta-hexosaminidase release at 300 mug/mL. It was also found that the most active sesquiterpene (valencene) and CRE inhibited beta-hexosaminidase degranulation by inhibiting the initial activation reaction, Lyn phosphorylation, in IgE-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells. Moreover, CRE, valencene and nootkatone significantly inhibited the delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction in mice when administered orally at 50-300 mg/kg.

Using combination of either 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) or ATRA and chemotherapy, adverse effects 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) or ATRA such as hypercalcemic effects have decreased, and long-term survival has improved. In a previous study, we demonstrated that santonin could be chemically modified into a diacetoxy acetal derivative of santonin with strong differentiation-inducing activity. In this study, we further synthesized C(6)-epimer derivatives of diacetoxy acetal derivative of santonin and tested their effects on HL-60 cell differentiation. Some of the C(6)-epimer derivatives themselves induced increases in cell differentiation. Especially, (11S)-3,3-(ethylenedioxy) eudesmano-13-ol-6beta-acetate (7) was demonstrated to induce differentiation with larger than 80% of the cells attaining a differentiated phenotype. Importantly, 7 strongly enhanced differentiation of HL-60 cells in a dose-dependent manner when combined with either low doses of 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) or ATRA. The ability to enhance the differentiation potential of 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) or ATRA by 7 may improve outcomes in the therapy of acute promyelocytic leukemia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using even a minute amount of DNA or RNA and choosing a thermostable enzyme from a large variety of sources, one can enlarge the amount of the gene of interest, which can be analyzed and sequenced. Therefore, genes, or segments of gene sequences present only in a small sample of cells or small fraction of mixed cellular populations can be examined. One of the major drawbacks of the solution-based PCR technique is that the procedure does not allow for the association of amplified signals of a specific gene segment with the histological cell type(s) (1-2). For example, it would be advantageous to determine what types of cells in the peripheral blood circulation or in pathological specimens carry HIV-1 gene sequences, a vector used for gene therapy, an aberrant gene in a leukemia patient, or to determine the percentage of leukemia cells present following antitumor therapy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The value of 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC(50)) of trihaloacetylazulenes against human oral squamous cell carcinoma (HSC-2, HSC-3, HSC-4) and human promyelocytic leukaemia (HL-60) cell lines was calculated from the dose-response curve by the MTT method. CONFLEX/CAChe PM5 was used for the calculation of 11 physico-chemical features for each compound. RESULTS: When all 26 compounds were analysed together, the CC(50) values correlated well with the dipole moment, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy and the reactivity index, and somewhat with the heat of formation, the stability of hydration and the absolute electron negativity, but not with other features. When these 26 compounds were separated into two groups with or without substituents of the 7-membered ring, the correlation coefficient was increased. When the 26 compounds were separated into a different set of two groups with different halogen atoms in the 5-membered ring, no improvement of correlation coefficient was observed. CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that appropriate grouping of test compounds may further increase the correlation coefficient. The QSAR approach was useful in the design of azulene compounds that are expected to show higher potency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrant cytokine signalling underlies numerous pathologies and adequate, temporary receptor activation is therefore under tight control. Negative-feedback mechanisms are very well studied, but cellular sensitivity also depends on the number of receptors exposed at the cell surface. This is determined by the equilibrium between receptor synthesis and transport to the plasma membrane, internalisation and recycling, degradation and ectodomain shedding, but the molecular basis of how cells establish steady state receptor levels is poorly understood. Here, we report that ring finger protein 41 (RNF41, also known as E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Nrdp1) interacts with JAK2-associated cytokine receptor complexes and modulates their cell surface exposure and signalling. Moreover, ectopic expression of RNF41 affected turnover of leptin, leukaemia inhibitory factor and interleukin-6 receptor in a dual way: it blocked intracellular cathepsin-L-dependent receptor cleavage and concomitantly enhanced receptor shedding by metalloproteases of the ADAM family. Receptor degradation and shedding are thus interconnected phenomena with a single protein, RNF41, determining the balance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibition of PI3K-delta signaling by the PI3K-delta-inhibiting drug, CAL-101, or by siRNA knockdown of p110delta, abrogates CLL cell activation, costimulatory molecule expression, and vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor gene expression that is induced by lenalidomide. In addition, CAL-101 attenuates lenalidomide-mediated increases in immunoglobulin M production by normal B cells. Collectively, these data demonstrate the importance of PI3K-delta signaling for lenalidomide immune modulation. These findings may guide development of strategies for the treatment of CLL that combine lenalidomide with CAL-101, with other inhibitors of the PI3K-delta pathway, or with other agents that target downstream kinases of this signaling pathway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have shown that the combination of tipifarnib, a nonpeptidomimetic farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI), with bortezomib, a proteosome inhibitor, promotes synergistic death and overcomes de novo drug resistance in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines. Experiments were undertaken to identify the molecular mechanisms by which tipifarnib produces cell death in acute myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma cell lines (U937 and 8226, respectively). Tipifarnib, but not other FTIs tested [N-[4-[2(R)-amino-3-mercaptopropyl]amino-2-phenylbenzoyl]methionine methyl ester trifluoroacetate salt (FTI-277) and 2'-methyl-5-((((1-trityl-1H-imidazol-4-yl)methyl)amino)methyl)-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2- carboxylic acid (FTI-2153), promotes elevations in intracellular free-calcium concentrations ([Ca(2+)](i)) in both cell lines. These elevations in [Ca(2+)](i) were accompanied by highly dynamic plasmalemmal blebbing and frequently resulted in membrane lysis. The tipifarnib-induced elevations in [Ca(2+)](i) were not blocked by thapsigargin or ruthenium red, but were inhibited by application of Ca(2+)-free extracellular solution and by the Ca(2+) channel blockers Gd(3+) and La(3+). Conversely, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) potentiated the tipifarnib-evoked [Ca(2+)](i) overload. Preventing Ca(2+) influx diminished tipifarnib-evoked cell death, whereas 2-APB potentiated this effect, demonstrating a link between tipifarnib-induced Ca(2+) influx and apoptosis. These data suggest that tipifarnib exerts its effects by acting on a membrane channel with pharmacological properties consistent with store-operated channels containing the Orai3 subunit. It is noteworthy that Orai3 transcripts were found to be expressed at lower levels in tipifarnib-resistant 8226/R5 cells. Our results indicate tipifarnib causes cell death via a novel mechanism involving activation of a plasma membrane Ca(2+) channel and intracellular Ca(2+) overload.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to evaluate BMD in ALL patients with GH deficiency (GHD), with and without GH therapy. DESIGN: Case-control study. METHODS: We examined 44 (21 women) GHD patients (median 25 years) treated with cranial radiotherapy (18-24 Gy) and chemotherapy and matched population controls for BMD with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. For 5 and 8 years, two subgroups with (0.5 mg/day) (n=16) and without GH therapy (n=13) and matched controls were followed respectively. RESULTS: At baseline, no significant differences in BMD or Z-scores at femoral neck and L2-L4 were recorded (all P>0.3). After another 8 years with GHD, the Z-scores at femoral neck had significantly decreased compared with baseline (0.0 to -0.5; P<0.03) and became lower at the femoral neck (P=0.05), and at L2-L4 (P<0.03), compared with controls. After 5 years of GH therapy, only female ALL patients had a significantly lower femoral neck Z-scores (P=0.03). The female ALL patients reached an IGF1 level of -0.7 s.d. and male patients reached the level of +0.05 s.d. CONCLUSIONS: On average, 25 years after diagnosis, GH-deficient ALL patients experienced a significant decrease in Z-scores at femoral neck, and if Z-scores continue to decrease, there could be a premature risk for osteoporosis. GH therapy was not shown to have a clear beneficial effect on BMD. Whether higher GH doses, particularly in women, will improve Z-scores needs further investigation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Improper polarization of T cells has been proposed as one of the mechanism involved. Mounting data implicates chromatin regulation, namely promoter methylation, in the plasticity of naive human T cells. Recent in vitro evidence indicates that this plasticity may be phenotypically altered by using methylation inhibitors which are approved for clinical use in certain types of cancer. These results beg the question: can the ineffective polarization of T lymphocytes in the context of CLL be effectively modulated using methylation inhibitors in a sustainable therapeutic fashion? To answer this question our laboratory has studied the effects of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5A2) in helper and cytotoxic T lymphocytes from healthy donors and CLL patients in well characterized molecular and epigenetic signaling pathways involved in effective polarization. Moreover, we sought to investigate the consequences of methylation inhibitor treatment on lymphocyte survival, activation intensity, and naive cell polarization. Our data indicates that 5A2 treatment can depolarize Th2 cells to effectively secrete interferon gamma, signal via T-bet, and achieve demethylation of critical Th1 specific promoters. Moreover, we demonstrate that 5A2 can force Th1 polarization of naive T cells despite a strong IL-4 stimuli and a lack of IL-12. In conclusion our data seeks to define a modality in which improper or ineffective T cell polarization can be altered by 5AZA and could be incorporated in future therapeutic interventions.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the underlying mechanisms responsible for the reduced allergenicity displayed by heat-treated egg white allergens. METHODS: C3H/HeJ mice were orally sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA) or ovomucoid and challenged with native or heated proteins to evaluate their allergenicity. Immunoreactivity was assessed by immunoblotting using sera from children with egg allergy. In vitro gastrointestinal digestion of native and heated OVA and ovomucoid was studied by SDS-PAGE and liquid chromatography. Intestinal uptake of intact native and heated OVA and ovomucoid by human intestinal epithelial (Caco-2) cells was investigated. Rat basophil leukemia cells passively sensitized with mouse serum and human basophils passively sensitized with serum from children with egg allergy were used to assess the effector cell activation by heated, digested, and transported OVA and ovomucoid. RESULTS: Heated OVA and ovomucoid did not induce symptoms of anaphylaxis in sensitized mice when administered orally. Heating did not completely destroy IgE-binding capacity of OVA or ovomucoid but enhanced in vitro digestibility of OVA. Digestion of both OVA and ovomucoid diminished mediator release in rat basophil leukemia assay and basophil activation. Heating of allergens prevented transport across human intestinal epithelial cells in a form capable of triggering basophil activation or T-cell activation. CONCLUSION: Heat treatment reduces allergenicity of OVA and ovomucoid. This is partially a result of the enhanced gastrointestinal digestibility of heated OVA and the inability of heated OVA or ovomucoid to be absorbed in a form capable of triggering basophils.","['Copyright (c) 2011 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

Epub 2011 Mar 3.,,,,"Hyperforin is an abundant phloroglucinol-type constituent isolated from the extract of the flowering upper portion of the plant Hypericum perforatum L. The dicyclohexylammonium salt of hyperforin (DCHA-HF) has exhibited antitumor and antiangiogenic activities in various cancer cells. Here, the antitumor effects of DCHA-HF on the chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cell line were investigated for the first time. DCHA-HF exhibited dose- and time-dependent inhibitory activities against K562 cells, with IC(50) values of 8.6 and 3.2 muM for 48 h and 72 h of treatment, respectively, which was more effective than that of the hyperforin. In contrast, little cytotoxic activity was observed with DCHA-HF on HUVECs. DCHA-HF treatment resulted in induction of apoptosis as evidenced from DNA fragmentation, nuclear condensation and increase of early apoptotic cells by DAPI staining analysis, TUNEL assay and Annexin V-FITC/PI double-labeled staining analysis, respectively. Moreover, DCHA-HF elicited dissipation of mitochondrial transmembrane potential that commenced with the release of cytochrome c through down-regulation of expression of anti-apoptotic proteins and up-regulation of expression of pro-apoptotic proteins. DCHA-HF treatment induced activation of the caspase 3, 8, and 9 cascade and subsequent PARP cleavage, and DCHA-HF-induced apoptosis was significantly inhibited by caspase inhibitors. Treated cells were arrested at the G1 phase of the cell cycle and the expression of p53 and p27(Kip1), two key regulators related to cell cycle and apoptosis, was up-regulated. These results suggest that DCHA-HF inhibits K562 cell growth by inducing caspase-dependent apoptosis mediated by a mitochondrial pathway and arresting the cell cycle at the G1 phase. Therefore, DCHA-HF is a potential chemotherapeutic antitumor drug for chronic myeloid leukemia therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Melanin is synthesized in melanocytes and accumulates in special organelles, melanosomes, which upon maturation are transferred to keratinocytes. Melanocytes differentiate from undifferentiated precursors, called melanoblasts, which are derived from neural crest cells. Melanoblast/melanocyte proliferation and differentiation are regulated by the tissue environment, especially by keratinocytes, which synthesize endothelins, steel factor, hepatocyte growth factor, leukemia inhibitory factor and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Melanocyte differentiation is also stimulated by alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone; in the mouse, however, this hormone is likely carried through the bloodstream and not produced locally in the skin. Melanoblast migration, proliferation and differentiation are also regulated by many coat color genes otherwise known for their ability to regulate melanosome formation and maturation, pigment type switching and melanosome distribution and transfer. Thus, melanocyte proliferation and differentiation are not only regulated by genes encoding typical growth factors and their receptors but also by genes classically known for their role in pigment formation.",['2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Co-administration of sub-micromolar concentrations of belinostat with low nanomolar concentrations of bortezomib sharply increased apoptosis in both AML and ALL cell lines and primary blasts. Synergistic interactions were associated with interruption of both canonical and non-canonical nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB signalling pathways, e.g. accumulation of the phosphorylated (S32/S36) form of IkappaBalpha, diminished belinostat-mediated RelA/p65 hyperacetylation (K310), and reduced processing of p100 into p52. These events were accompanied by down-regulation of NF-kappaB-dependent pro-survival proteins (e.g. XIAP, Bcl-xL). Moreover, belinostat/bortezomib co-exposure induced up-regulation of the BH3-only pro-death protein Bim. Significantly, shRNA knock-down of Bim substantially reduced the lethality of belinostat/bortezomib regimens. Administration of belinostat +/- bortezomib also induced hyperacetylation (K40) of alpha-tubulin, indicating histone deacetylase inhibitor 6 inhibition. Finally, in contrast to the pronounced lethality of belinostat/bortezomib toward primary leukaemia blasts, equivalent treatment was relatively non-toxic to normal CD34(+) cells. Together, these findings indicate that belinostat and bortezomib interact synergistically in both cultured and primary AML and ALL cells, and raise the possibilities that up-regulation of Bim and interference with NF-kappaB pathways contribute to this phenomenon. They also suggest that combined belinostat/bortezomib regimens warrant further attention in acute leukaemias.",['(c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],['NIHMS376610'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in HSC gene therapy clinical trials, genotoxicity mediated by integrated vector proviruses has led to clonal expansion, and in some cases frank leukemia. Numerous studies have been performed to understand the molecular basis of vector-mediated genotoxicity with the aim of developing safer vectors and safer gene therapy protocols. These genotoxicity studies are critical to advancing HSC gene therapy. AREAS COVERED: This review provides an introduction to the mechanisms of retroviral vector genotoxicity. It also covers advances over the last 20 years in designing safer gene therapy vectors, and in integration site analysis in clinical trials and large animal models. Mechanisms of retroviral-mediated genotoxicity, and the risk factors that contribute to clonal expansion and leukemia in HSC gene therapy are introduced. EXPERT OPINION: Continued research on virus-host interactions and next-generation vectors should further improve the safety of future HSC gene therapy vectors and protocols.",,['NIHMS402219'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gene recombinant expression is an important tool for production of pharmaceutical protein. In this paper, the gene encoding human soluble TRAIL (114-281aa fragment) was cloned by PCR and then inserted into the Pichia Pastoris expression vector pPIC9K. The transformants were double-screened on plates containing neomycin G418 and many clones with high levels of G418-resistance were selected for further studies on protein expression. The recombinant human soluble TRAIL was secreted into the BMMY media under the condition of 3% methanol. And the recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity (-80% purity) by using Ni-agarose affinity chromatography. The yield of this protein is about 1-2 mg per liter culture. Cell viability assays demonstrated that human soluble TRAIL was cytotoxic in both leukemia cells Jurkat and lung cancer cells A549. After treatment with 0.05 microg/ml TRAIL, the survival rate of Jurkat cells was about 10%. The expressed TRAIL showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity in A549 cells within the range of 0.1-1 microg/ml. When the protein concentration reached 1 microg/ml, the survival rates of A549 cells were about 30%. However, the recombinant human soluble TRAIL did not show obvious cytotoxicity in human skin fibroblast cells (HSF) at concentrations tested. There results demonstrate that human soluble TRAIL is selectively cytotoxic in tumor cells.

When screened against class I (maize HD1-B and human HDAC1) and class II (maize HD1-A and human HDAC4) HDACs, most hydroxamates and 2-aminoanilides displayed potent and selective inhibition toward class I enzymes. Immunoblotting analyses performed in U937 leukemia cells generally revealed high acetyl-H3 and low acetyl-alpha-tubulin levels. Exceptions are compounds 3 f-i, 3 m-o, and 4 k, which showed higher tubulin acetylation than SAHA. In U937 cells, cell-cycle blockade in either the G(2)/M or G(1)/S phase was observed with 1-4. Five hydroxamates (compounds 1 h-l) effected a two- to greater than threefold greater percent apoptosis than SAHA, and in the CD11c cytodifferentiation test some 2-aminoanilides belonging to both series 2 and 4 were more active than MS-275. The highest-scoring derivatives in terms of apoptosis (1 k, 1 l) or cytodifferentiation (2 c, 4 n) also showed antiproliferative activity in U937 cells, thus representing valuable tools for study in other cancer contexts.","['Copyright (c) 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Bioactive food components encapsulated in nanoparticles may have increased bioavailability and bioactivities. METHODS AND RESULTS: Self-assembled nanoparticles made of partially purified pomegranate ellagitannins (PPE) and gelatin were fabricated using three PPE-to-gelatin mass ratios (1:5, 5:5, and 7:5). The PPE contained 16.6% (w/w) of punicalagin A, 32.5% (w/w) of punicalagin B, and a small amount of ellagic acid-hexoside and ellagic acid (1%, w/w). Nanoparticles fabricated using the ratio 5:5 had a particle size of 149.3+/-1.8 nm, positive zeta-potential of 17.8+/-0.9 mV, production efficiency 53.0+/-4.2%, and spherical morphology under scanning electron microscopy. Loading efficiency of punicalagin A and punicalagin B in these particles were 94.2+/-0.4% and 83.8+/-0.5 %, respectively. Loading capacity was 14.8+/-1.5% and 25.7+/-2.2%, respectively. Only punicalagin anomers were able to bind with gelatin to form nanoparticles, whereas ellagic acid-hexoside or ellagic acid could not. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy suggested that the interactions between ellagitannins and gelatin were hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. PPE-gelatin nanoparticle suspension was less effective than PPE in inducing the early stage of apoptosis on human promyelocytic leukemia cells HL-60. But they had similar effects in inducing late stage of apoptosis and necrosis. CONCLUSION: Pomegranate ellagitannins bind with gelatin to form self-assembled nanoparticles. Ellagitannins encapsulated in nanoparticles had decreased apoptotic effects on leukemia cells HL-60.","['Copyright (c) 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As neurons in cranial sensory ganglia and dorsal root ganglia transiently express Ngn1, NeuroD, and Brn3a during embryonic development, we hypothesized that Wnt proteins could instructively promote a sensory neuronal fate from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) directed to differentiate into neurons. Consistent with our hypothesis, Wnt1 induced expression of sensory neuron markers including Ngn1, NeuroD, and Brn3a, as well as glutamatergic markers in neurally induced MSCs in vitro and promoted engraftment of transplanted MSCs in the inner ear bearing selective loss of sensory neurons in vivo. Given the consensus function of T-cell leukemia 3 (Tlx3), as a glutamatergic selector gene, we postulated that the effects of canonical Wnt signaling on sensory neuron and glutamatergic marker gene expression in MSCs may be mediated by Tlx3. We first confirmed that Wnt1 indeed upregulates Tlx3 expression, which can be suppressed by canonical Wnt inhibitors. Next, our chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that T-cell factor 3/4, Wnt-activated DNA binding proteins, interact with a regulatory region of Tlx3 in MSCs after neural induction. Furthermore, we demonstrated that forced expression of Tlx3 in MSCs induced sensory and glutamatergic neuron markers after neural induction. Together, these results identify Tlx3 as a novel target for canonical Wnt signaling that confers somatic stem cells with a sensory neuron phenotype upon neural induction.",['Copyright (c) 2011 AlphaMed Press.'],['NIHMS392263'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many commonly used clinical agents, such as members of the nitrogen mustard, chloroethylnitrosourea, dimethane-sulphonate and platinum classes, are bifunctional. DNA interstrand crosslinks (ISC) formed in cells are clearly critical cytotoxic lesions and the formation of DNA ISC has been shown to correlate with cytotoxicity in vitro (1-5). Acquired resistance in vitro to such agents can occur by a number of mechanisms, for example altered drug transport (6), intracellular detoxification via enhanced glutathione and glutathione-S-transferase activity (7), but enhanced DNA repair capacity can also play an important role (3). Clinically the mechanisms of acquired resistance to DNA damaging agents are less clear but enhanced repair of ISC has been suggested to play a role in the acquired resistance of some cancers, e.g., chronic lymphocytic leukaemia to nitrogen mustards (8). In addition, the inherent sensitivity (and curability) of some tumors, e.g., testicular cancer, to DNA damaging agents may result in part from their inability to repair critical DNA lesions (9).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many autistic subjects display a dysregulation of the immune system which is compatible with an unresolved viral infection with prenatal onset, potentially due to vertical viral transmission. Recently, the xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) has been implicated in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and in prostate cancer by several, though not all studies. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We assessed whether XMRV or other murine leukemia virus (MLV)-related viruses are involved in autistic disorder. Using nested PCR targeted to gag genomic sequences, we screened DNA samples from: (i) peripheral blood of 102 ASD patients and 97 controls, (ii) post-mortem brain samples of 20 ASD patients and 17 sex- and age-matched controls, (iii) semen samples of 11 fathers of ASD children, 25 infertile individuals and 7 fertile controls. No XMRV gag DNA sequences were detected, whereas peripheral blood samples of 3/97 (3.1%) controls were positive for MLV. CONCLUSIONS| SIGNIFICANCE: No MLV-related virus was detected in blood, brain, and semen samples of ASD patients or fathers. Hence infection with XMRV or other MLV-related viruses is unlikely to contribute to autism pathogenesis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The US and UK cooperative groups began randomised thiopurine trials and agreed prospectively to a meta-analysis. All randomised trials of TG versus MP were sought, and data on individual patients were analysed by standard methods. Combining three trials (from US, UK and Germany), the overall event-free survival (EFS) was not significantly improved with TG (odds ratio (OR)=0.89; 95% confidence interval 0.78-1.03). Apparent differences in results between trials may be partly explained by the different types of patients studied. The larger treatment effect reported in males in the US trial was confirmed in the other trials. There was heterogeneity between sex/age subgroups (P=0.001), with significant EFS benefit of TG only observed for males aged <10 years old (OR=0.70; 0.58-0.84), although this did not result in a significant difference in overall survival (OR=0.83; 0.62-1.10). Additional toxicity occurs with TG.

This study compared the susceptibility of unmutated (UM) and mutated (M) CLL B cells to spontaneous apoptosis and prosurvival signals. UM CLL B cells showed a significantly higher rate of spontaneous apoptosis than M CLL B cells. Nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) was rapidly inactivated, and B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) expression progressively down-regulated in the UM CLL B cells. CD40-Ligand, interleukin-4 and stromal cells significantly improved their viability and partially recovered Bcl-2, but not NF-kB expression. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells also offered protection of UM CLL B cells, and recovered both NF-kB and Bcl-2 expression. T cells, rather than nurse-like cells, were responsible for protecting UM CLL B cells by means of cell-to-cell contact and soluble factors. Despite their more aggressive features, UM CLL B cells are more susceptible to spontaneous apoptosis and depend from environmental prosurvival signals. This vulnerability of UM CLL B cells can be exploited as a selective target of therapeutic interventions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we investigated whether HDB would inhibit the ODC pathway to enhance apoptosis in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. We found ODC enzyme activity was reduced during HDB treatment. Overexpression of ODC in HL-60 parental cells could reduce HDB-induced apoptosis, which leads to loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsi(m)), through lessening intracellular ROS. Furthermore, ODC overexpression protected cytochrome c release and the activation of caspase-3 following HDB treatment. The results demonstrated HDB-induced apoptosis was through a mechanism of down-regulation of ODC and occurred along a ROS-dependent mitochondria-mediated pathway.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Flow cytometric analyses and transmission electron microscope (TEM) observations revealed that HSC-T6 treated with RosA underwent apoptosis in a time dependent manner and displayed typical apoptotic features in the cells. The phosphorylation in signal transducer and activator of transcription protein-3 (STAT3), which regulates cell survival, proliferation and differentiation in a variety of tissues, was markedly decreased as the result of Western blot assay and correlated with downregulation of CyclinD1 and B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2).

Integrative prognostic risk score (IPRS) was modeled in 181 patients based on age, white blood cell count, mutation status of NPM1, FLT3-ITD, CEBPA, single nucleotide polymorphism rs16754, and expression levels of BAALC, ERG, MN1, and WT1 to represent low, intermediate, and high risk of death. Complete remission (P = .005), relapse-free survival (RFS, P < .001), and overall survival (OS, P < .001) were significantly different for the 3 risk groups. In 2 independent validation cohorts of 94 and 131 patients, the IPRS predicted different OS (P < .001) and RFS (P < .001).

Implantation is a very intricate process, which is controlled by a number of complex molecules like hormones, cytokines, and growth factors and their cross talk. A network of these molecules plays a crucial role in preparing receptive endometrium and blastocyst. Furthermore, timely regulation of the expression of embryonic and maternal endometrial growth factors and cytokines plays a major role in determining the fate of embryo. Most of the existing data comes from animal studies due to ethical issues. In this study, we comprehend the data from both animal models and humans for better understanding of implantation and positive outcomes of pregnancy.

Data about a direct comparison of cerebrospinal fluid cytology (CSF-cytology) and MRI are very limited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare these two diagnostic modalities in diagnosing meningitis in patients with hematopoietic and solid malignancies. METHODS: In 68 patients suspicious for neoplastic meningitis, cytology and MRI (1.5 T) was performed. The meningeal, pial or intraparenchymal hyperintense signal or contrast enhancement was correlated to the final CNS diagnosis and to cytology. RESULTS: 44 patients (64.7%) had neoplastic meningitis, 21 patients (30.9%) had non-neoplastic meningitis. The sensitivity to diagnose meningeal disease was 49.2% for MRI and 95.4% for cytology (p<0.001). In patients with neoplastic meningitis, sensitivity was 45.5% for MRI and 93.2% for cytology (p<0.001). In patients with infectious meningitis, sensitivity was 57.1% for MRI and 100% for cytology (p=0.0013). In patients with solid tumors, the sensitivity was 84.6% for both diagnostic methods. The sensitivity for MRI was low in patients with leukemia (20.0%) and lymphoma (37.5%). The positive predictive value (PPV) for MRI to differentiate infectious from neoplastic meningitis was high in patients with infectious meningitis (75.0%), in patients with lymphoma (83.3%), and in patients with solid tumors (72.7%). Ppv was low in patients with leukemia (33.3%). CONCLUSION: Diagnostic value of MRI for diagnosing meningitis is especially limited in patients with hematopoietic malignancies. MRI better detected leptomeningeal involvement caused by solid tumors than by leukemia or lymphoma.

Considering the ever-increasing demand of nutraceuticals for anti-cancer therapy, we investigated the apoptosis-inducing effects of marine carotenoids, including siphonaxanthin, on human leukemia (HL-60) cells. METHODS: Apoptotic effects were evaluated by cell viability assay, TUNEL assay, and caspase-3 activity. The expression of apoptosis-inducing death receptor-5 (DR5), Bcl-2 and Bax were assayed by Western blot analysis, and mRNA expression of GADD45alpha was assayed by quantitative RT-PCR analysis. RESULTS: Siphonaxanthin potently inhibited the viability of HL-60 cells compared with the other carotenoids evaluated. In comparison with fucoxanthin, siphonaxanthin at a concentration of 20muM markedly reduced cell viability (p<0.05) as early as within 6h of treatment. The effective apoptotic activity of siphonaxanthin was observed by increases in TUNEL-positive cells, and by increased chromatin condensation in HL-60 cells. This induction of apoptosis was associated with the decreased expression of Bcl-2, and the subsequently increased activation of caspase-3. In addition, siphonaxanthin up-regulated the expression of GADD45alpha and DR5. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the dietary carotenoid siphonaxanthin could be potentially useful as a chemo-preventive and/or chemotherapeutic agent.

The median age was 66 years (range 39-85). Forty-three percent of patients had relapsed and 57% were resistant (median previous therapies = 3; range 1-8). Twenty-two patients received bendamustine alone and 87 patients received R-B (median B dosage: 100 mg/m(2) per day, range 90-130 mg/m(2) per day). The overall response rate was 69.6% (complete response 28.6%; partial response 41%), and was significantly higher in patients treated with R-B (P = 0.014) and in those responsive to the previous treatment (P=0.04). After a median follow-up of 7.9 months (range 1-148), the median progression-free survival was 16 months and the median duration of response was 13 months. Median overall survival (OS) was 16.8 months for the whole cohort; patients not responding to the treatment had a significantly worse outcome than those who attained a response (P = 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, only resistant disease status at start of bendamustine treatment (HR 3.2, 95% CI 1.4-7.3, P = 0.006) had an independent prognostic value for OS. Toxicity was manageable and mostly haematological. In conclusion, in our experience R-B was an effective and well-tolerated treatment for relapsed/refractory CLL patients, producing a remarkable high CR rate and mild toxicity.",['(c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, overexpression of Bmi-1 has been reported in various human cancers and proved to be associated with poor survival. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of Bmi-1 protein in human uterine cervical cancer (UCC) and explore its associations with clinicopathological factors and prognosis. METHODS: Western blot was used to detect the expression of Bmi-1 in 4 human cervical cancer cell lines (Hela, SiHa, CasKi, and C33A) and a normal cervical epithelial cell line. In addition, 152 UCC and 30 adjacent normal cervical paraffin-embedded samples were collected to detect Bmi-1 expression by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Western blot analysis showed Bmi-1 was overexpressed in 4 human UCC cell lines but not in the normal cervical epithelial cell line. Moreover, immunohistochemical staining revealed Bmi-1 was overexpressed in 63.2% UCC tissues (Bmi-1 ++ or +++), and the overexpression of Bmi-1 protein was significantly correlated with tumor size (P = 0.046), clinical stage (P = 0.021), and regional lymph nodes metastasis (P = 0.010). Survival analysis showed a significant difference between Bmi-1 protein overexpression and poor survival (P = 0.021). Cox proportional hazards risk analysis indicated that Bmi-1 protein overexpression was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 is overexpressed in UCC and correlated with adverse clinical characteristics and poor prognosis, which suggests that the Bmi-1 might participate in the development and progression of UCC and have clinical potential not only as a useful predictor of aggressive phenotype but also a promising prognostic predictor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2011 Feb 15.,,,,"High-risk (HR) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains one of the greatest challenges in pediatric oncology. Relapsed ALL is a leading cause of death in young people, and further improvements in outcome will required the development of therapeutic approaches directed against rational therapeutic targets, as escalation of the intensity of existing therapies is limited by toxicity. This review summarizes advances in the biology and treatment of HR and relapsed ALL presented at a symposium at the 2010 American Society for Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Annual Meeting. Analysis of large patient cohorts has identified several factors associated with HR of relapse including older age, T-lineage disease, and persisting minimal residual disease (MRD) early in therapy. As the results of salvage therapy remain poor, new treatment approaches are needed. BCR-ABL1-positive (Ph+) ALL has historically had a very poor outcome, but recent studies have demonstrated the impressive improvements in treatment outcome with the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). High-resolution genomic profiling of genetic alterations and gene expression has revolutionized our understanding of the genetic basis of ALL, and has identified several alterations associated with poor outcome, including mutations of the lymphoid transcription factor gene IKZF1 (IKAROS), activating mutations of Janus kinases, and rearrangement of the lymphoid cytokine receptor gene CRLF2. These data indicated that the genetic basis of HR-ALL is multifactorial, and have also provided a new potential therapeutic option directed at JAK inhibition.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Eligibility criteria for inclusion in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort (SJLIFE) study include: (1) diagnosis of childhood malignancy treated at SJCRH; (2) survival >/= 10 years from diagnosis; and (3) current age >/= 18 years. Three levels of participation are offered: (1) comprehensive evaluation on SJCRH campus; (2) limited home evaluation; or (3) completion of health surveys only. A systematic recruitment structure based upon blocks of 50 patients initially focused on leukemia and lymphoma survivors and patients eligible for pilot studies. RESULTS: As of January 1, 2010, 1,625 (42%) of 3,900 eligible >/= 10-year survivors have been contacted. Among the first 1,000 potentially eligible survivors selected for recruitment, 971 were subsequently confirmed to fulfill eligibility criteria. To date, 898/971 (92.5%) have been successfully contacted of whom 825 (91.8%) have agreed to participate. Among participants, 88.6% agreed to comprehensive medical evaluation, 0.4% limited local evaluation, and 11.0% survey only. Anticipated minimum overall participation rate for medical evaluation is 75.3% (731/971). Comparison of those contacted who agreed versus declined to participate revealed a greater proportion of males who declined participation (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Early results of the SJLIFE study support its feasibility to recruit aging childhood cancer survivors to research investigations evaluating late health outcomes by medical assessments.","['Copyright (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['NIHMS280978'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to examine the feasibility of an in-hospital physical therapy- and home exercise program during the first four phases of medical treatment, for children with newly diagnosed ALL. PROCEDURE: Nine patients, between the ages of 2-14 years old were enrolled within 2 weeks of diagnosis in the study. Each patient was evaluated at study entry, after each of the first four phases of therapy and each time patients were re-admitted to the hospital. Following the initial physical therapy evaluation an individualized home exercise program was developed, consisting of stretching, strengthening, and aerobic exercises. The following end points were measured at each evaluation: gross motor assessment as measured by gross motor function measure (GMFM), health-related quality of life as measured by the PedsQL and parent satisfaction questionnaire. RESULTS: This study was feasible with 98% of the evaluation sessions completed. The GMFM and PedsQL improved steadily throughout the study; however, the PedsQL slightly decreased from interim maintenance to delayed intensification. The parents reported being satisfied with the physical therapy program. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that an in-hospital- and home exercise physical therapy program during the first four phases of medical treatments is feasible for children with ALL. Future randomized studies are needed to confirm whether an initial physical therapy program at diagnosis in children with ALL will limit functional impairments, improve overall fitness and increase health-related quality of life.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to assess surgical complications and outcomes in this patient group and to re-evaluate the age threshold of 6 months for recommending primary nephrectomy. PROCEDURE: A retrospective file review of all cases of MN registered in UK Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group renal tumour trials between October 1991 and March 2008. Data from the trials were compared with data held by the National Registry of Childhood Tumours, Oxford. RESULTS: Forty-seven (3.5%) confirmed cases of MN were found among 1346 registered renal tumours. Median age at diagnosis was 30 days (range birth-3.8 years). MN was significantly more common in the first 3 months of life compared to between 3 and 6 months (33 vs. 2 cases). Seven cases occurred between 6 months and 1 year and only five cases occurred beyond 1 year of age. There was a significant difference in the age of diagnosis by histological subtype. There were 11 complications in the series; no registered patient developed a recurrent tumour; and all were alive at last follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Outcome for children with MN is excellent at all ages, with little indication for adjuvant chemotherapy. Children presenting at <3 months of age, should be treated by primary nephrectomy. In those presenting aged >3 months, alternative diagnoses should be considered, especially in the presence of surgical risk factors.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytogenetic and molecular genetic data now form an integral part of current lymphoma classifications (1) and provide important information for diagnosis, tumor biology, and in some cases prognosis. The t(14;18)(q32;q21) abnormality is the most common translocation detected in B-lineage lymphoma and results in juxtaposition of the BCL-2 gene (18q21) and the JH locus of the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain gene (14q32) (2-5). More specifically, in the North American population, alterations of the BCL-2 gene are detected in approx 75 to 85% of low-grade follicular lymphomas, 20-30% of aggressive large B-cell lymphomas, and rarely in other B-cell tumors (e.g., chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), acute lymphoblastic leukemia) (2,6-9). As a consequence of the BCL-2/JH fusion, deregulated overexpression of the antiapoptotic bcl-2 protein occurs owing to constitutive transcriptional activation of the BCL-2 gene by the Ig heavy chain gene enhancer. The unbridled expression of bcl-2 protein in lymphoid tumors confers resistance to programmed cell death (10,11) and is implicated in primary therapeutic failure and a less favorable prognosis (12-14). Although karyotypic detection of lymphoma-associated translocations such as the t(14;18) has proved to be useful in disease diagnosis and subcategorization, molecular genetic approaches including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) have gained substantial popularity owing to their rapidity, relatively low cost, and increased sensitivity (6,15-22).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is growing awareness that the clinical features and subclassification of morphologic leukemia types is often highly correlated with tumor genetics. Furthermore, distinct genetic subgroups of AML are associated with improved therapeutic sensitivity and a more favorable clinical outcome. These observations have prompted suggestions for a revision of the current French-American-British leukemia classification (1), utilizing genetically defined principles (2). Three recurrent chromosomal translocations are identified in approx 25-30% of de novo adult AMLs. These include the t(15;17), associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia ([APL]; AML-M3); the inv(16) and related t(16;16), associated with AML-M4Eo; and the t(8;21), associated most commonly with AML-M2. Each of these abnormalities results in the formation of a chimeric leukemia-specific fusion gene, which is transcribed and expressed as a fusion protein. The widespread genetic deregulation caused by such fusion proteins is thought to interfere with proliferative control and cell differentiation mechanisms, leading to the leukemic state. The presence of these and other fusion gene events can be specifically and sensitively detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Calibration and validation are two important steps for moving a mathematical model to a computational model. While calibration refers to finding numerical value of the coefficients such as rate constants in a mathematical model, validation refers to verifying that the calibrated model behaves the same as the biological system under previously unseen conditions such as environmental changes (e.g., drug treatment) or mutations. In lieu of direct measurements of rate constants, modeling of the molecular mechanisms that govern biological behaviors may be able to use dynamic expression profiles of reactant biomolecules for calibration. For validation, similar data, obtained under new conditions, are probably better than direct measurements of rate constants. In any case, direct measurement of rate constants is almost always impractical and difficult or impossible. Here, we show a computer-assisted methodology to extract embedded dynamic profiles of cell-cycle proteins from statically sampled, multivariate cytometry data guided by heuristics assembled from canonical cell-cycle knowledge. The methodology is implemented using standard ""list mode"" cytometry data-processing software followed by CytoSys - a software tool with an easy-to-use graphical interface.

Y-box protein (YBX1) is a transcription factor which is widely expressed throughout development and is involved in erythroid cell development; however, its role in early hematopoietic differentiation is not known. This study aims to investigate the role of YBX1 expression in early hematopoietic differentiation and leukemia. Here, we show that YBX1 is highly expressed in mouse erythroid myeloid lymphoid-clone 1 (EML), a hematopoietic precursor cell line, but is down-regulated in myeloid progenitors and GM-CSF-treated EML cells during the course of myeloid differentiation. Moreover, we found that lineage(-)/IL-7R(-)/c-kit(+)/Sca1(+) (LKS; enriched fraction of hematopoietic stem cells) and lineage(-)/IL-7R(-)/c-kit(+)/Sca1(-) myeloid progenitor cells showed high level of YBX1 expression as compared to the differentiated cells like granulocytes in mouse bone marrow. Also, YBX1 protein was expressed at high levels in myeloid leukemic cell lines blocked at different stages of myeloid development. We further investigated the role of YBX1 in leukemic cells by knockdown studies and observed that down-regulation of YBX1 expression in K562 leukemic cells inhibited their proliferation ability, induced apoptosis, and differentiation towards megakaryocytic lineage upon arsenic trioxide treatments relative to untreated. Overall, our data indicates that YBX1 is down-regulated during myeloid differentiation and the aberrant YBX1 expression in leukemic cells could be a contributing factor in the development of leukemia by blocking their differentiation. Thus, YBX1 protein could be an excellent molecular target for therapy in myeloproliferative disorders and leukemia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2011 Mar 1.,,,,"The persistence of Bcr-Abl-positive cells in patients on imatinib therapy indicates that inhibition of the Bcr-Abl kinase activity alone might not be sufficient to eradicate the leukemia cells. Many downstream effectors of Bcr-Abl have been described, including activation of both the Grb2-SoS-Ras-MAPK and Grb2-Gab2-PI3K-Akt pathways. The Bcr-Abl-Grb2 interaction, which is mediated by the direct interaction of the Grb2 SH2 domain with the phospho-Bcr-Abl Y177, is required for activation of these signaling pathways. Therefore, disrupting their interaction represents a potential therapeutic strategy for inhibiting the oncogenic downstream signals of Bcr-Abl. Adenovirus Ad-SH2-HA expressing the Grb2 SH2 domain was constructed and applied in this study. As expected, Ad-SH2-HA efficiently infected CML cells and functioned by binding to the phospho-Bcr-Abl Y177 site, competitively disrupting the Grb2 SH2-phospho-Bcr-Abl Y177 complex. They induced potent anti-proliferation and apoptosis-inducing effects in CML cell lines. Moreover, the Ras, MAPK and Akt activities were significantly reduced in the Ad-SH2-HA treated cells. These were not observed with the point-mutated control adenovirus Ad-Sm-HA with abolished phospho-Bcr-Abl Y177 binding sites. These data indicate that, in addition to the direct targeting of Bcr-Abl, selective inhibition of its downstream signaling pathways may be a therapeutic option for CML, and the Ad-SH2-HA-mediated killing strategy could be explored as a promising anti-leukemia agent in CML.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, SIRPalpha1 expression is significantly reduced in the majority of myeloid malignancies. SIRPalpha1 is a negative regulator of signaling and its reduced expression is considered to play a role in the pathogenesis of these diseases through aberrant signaling. To identify SIRPalpha1 downstream target genes, we established SIRP alpha1-knockdown chronic myeloid leukemia K562 (K562SIRPalpha1KD) cells expressing reduced levels of SIRPalpha1 by stably transfecting SIRPalpha1 siRNAs. Microarray analysis demonstrated that several genes, including beta-catenin, were significantly induced in K562SIRPalpha1KD cells. Real-time PCR and Western blot analyses, confirmed the induction of this gene. Phosphorylation of Ser9 of glycogen synthesis kinase (GSK) -3beta, results in the inactivation of GSK-3beta, leading to the induction of beta-catenin. We found significant phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Akt, as well as of GSK-3beta-Ser9, which may play a role in the up-regulation of beta-catenin in K562SIRPalpha1KD cells. To our knowledge, this is a first report demonstrating the relationships between SIRPalpha1 and beta-catenin in leukemia cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Obatoclax is a pan-BCL-2 family inhibitor currently in clinical development. Here we show that, although obatoclax can induce mitochondrial apoptosis dependent on BCL-2 associated x protein/BCL-2 antagonist killer (BAX/BAK) consistent with its on-target pharmacodynamics, simultaneous silencing of both BAX and BAK did not abolish acute toxicity or loss of clonogenicity. This is despite complete inhibition of apoptosis. Obatoclax dramatically reduced viability without inducing loss of plasma membrane integrity. This was associated with rapid processing of light chain-3 (LC3) and reduction of S6 kinase phosphorylation, consistent with autophagy. Dramatic ultrastructural vacuolation, not typical of autophagy, was also induced. Silencing of beclin-1 failed to prevent LC3 processing, whereas knockout of autophagy-related (Atg)7 abolished LC3 processing but failed to prevent obatoclax-induced loss of clonogenicity or ultrastructural changes. siRNA silencing of Atg7 in BAX/BAK knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts did not prevent obatoclax-induced loss of viability. Cells selected for obatoclax resistance evaded apoptosis independent of changes in BCL-2 family expression and displayed reduced LC3 processing. In summary, obatoclax exhibits BAX- and BAK-dependent and -independent mechanisms of toxicity and activation of autophagy. Mechanisms other than autophagy and apoptosis are blocked in obatoclax resistant cells and contribute significantly to obatoclax's anticancer efficacy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we determined whether CRT exposure at the cell surface (ecto-CRT) occurs in human cancer in response to anthracyclines in vivo, focusing on acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is currently treated with a combination of aracytine and anthracyclines. Most of the patients benefit from the induction chemotherapy but relapse within 1-12 months. In this study, we investigated ecto-CRT expression on malignant blasts before and after induction chemotherapy. We observed that leukemic cells from some patients exhibited ecto-CRT regardless of chemotherapy and that this parameter was not modulated by in vivo chemotherapy. Ecto-CRT correlated with the presence of phosphorylated eIF2alpha within the blasts, in line with the possibility that CRT exposure results from an endoplasmic reticulum stress response. Importantly, high levels of ecto-CRT on malignant myeloblasts positively correlated with the ability of autologous T cells to secrete interferon-gamma on stimulation with blast-derived dendritic cell. We conclude that the presence of ecto-CRT on leukemia cells facilitates cellular anticancer immune responses in AML patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The PI3K/Akt pathway is activated by Bcr-Abl and is specifically required for the growth of CML cells. To identify targets of this pathway, we undertook a proteomic screen and identified several proteins that differentially bind 14-3-3, dependent on Bcr-Abl kinase activity. An siRNA screen of candidates selected by bioinformatics analysis reveals cold-shock domain protein A (CSDA), shown previously to regulate cell cycle progression in epithelial cells, to be a positive regulator of proliferation in a CML cell line. We show that Akt can phosphorylate the serine 134 residue of CSDA but, downstream of Bcr-Abl activity, this modification is mediated through the activation of MEK/p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) signaling. Inhibition of RSK, similarly to treatment with imatinib, blocked proliferation specifically in Bcr-Abl-positive leukemia cell lines, as well as cells from CML patients. Furthermore, these primary CML cells showed an increase in CSDA phosphorylation. Expression of a CSDA phospho-deficient mutant resulted in the decrease of Bcr-Abl-dependent transformation in Rat1 cells. Our results support a model whereby phosphorylation of CSDA downstream of Bcr-Abl enhances proliferation in CML cells to drive leukemogenesis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure of ESCs to low concentrations (2-20 muM) of the NO donor diethylenetriamine NO adduct confers protection from apoptosis elicited by leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) withdrawal. NO blocked caspase 3 activation, PARP degradation, downregulation of the pro-apoptotic genes Casp7, Casp9, Bax and Bak1 and upregulation of the anti-apoptotic genes Bcl-2 111, Bcl-2 and Birc6. These effects were also observed in cells overexpressing eNOS. Exposure of LIF-deprived mESCs to low NO prevented the loss of expression of self-renewal genes (Oct4, Nanog and Sox2) and the SSEA marker. Moreover, NO blocked the differentiation process promoted by the absence of LIF and bFGF in mouse and human ESCs. NO treatment decreased the expression of differentiation markers, such as Brachyury, Gata6 and Gata4. Constitutive overexpression of eNOS in cells exposed to LIF deprivation maintained the expression of self-renewal markers, whereas the differentiation genes were repressed.

Microtubule-targeted agents such as Taxol and vincristine are prescribed widely for various malignancies, including ovarian and breast adenocarcinomas, non-small-cell lung cancer, leukaemias and lymphomas. These agents arrest cells in mitosis and subsequently induce cell death through poorly defined mechanisms. The strategies that resistant tumour cells use to evade death induced by antitubulin agents are also unclear. Here we show that the pro-survival protein MCL1 (ref. 3) is a crucial regulator of apoptosis triggered by antitubulin chemotherapeutics. During mitotic arrest, MCL1 protein levels decline markedly, through a post-translational mechanism, potentiating cell death. Phosphorylation of MCL1 directs its interaction with the tumour-suppressor protein FBW7, which is the substrate-binding component of a ubiquitin ligase complex. The polyubiquitylation of MCL1 then targets it for proteasomal degradation. The degradation of MCL1 was blocked in patient-derived tumour cells that lacked FBW7 or had loss-of-function mutations in FBW7, conferring resistance to antitubulin agents and promoting chemotherapeutic-induced polyploidy. Additionally, primary tumour samples were enriched for FBW7 inactivation and elevated MCL1 levels, underscoring the prominent roles of these proteins in oncogenesis. Our findings suggest that profiling the FBW7 and MCL1 status of tumours, in terms of protein levels, messenger RNA levels and genetic status, could be useful to predict the response of patients to antitubulin chemotherapeutics.",,,,,,,,['Pharmacogenomics. 2011 Oct;12(10):1379-80.

Loss of FBW7, which encodes a tumour-suppressor protein, is frequently found in various types of human cancer, including breast cancer, colon cancer and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL). In line with these genomic data, engineered deletion of Fbw7 in mouse T cells results in T-ALL, validating FBW7 as a T-ALL tumour suppressor. Determining the precise molecular mechanisms by which FBW7 exerts antitumour activity is an area of intensive investigation. These mechanisms are thought to relate in part to FBW7-mediated destruction of key proteins relevant to cancer, including Jun, Myc, cyclin E and notch 1 (ref. 9), all of which have oncoprotein activity and are overexpressed in various human cancers, including leukaemia. In addition to accelerating cell growth, overexpression of Jun, Myc or notch 1 can also induce programmed cell death. Thus, considerable uncertainty surrounds how FBW7-deficient cells evade cell death in the setting of upregulated Jun, Myc and/or notch 1. Here we show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF(FBW7) (a SKP1-cullin-1-F-box complex that contains FBW7 as the F-box protein) governs cellular apoptosis by targeting MCL1, a pro-survival BCL2 family member, for ubiquitylation and destruction in a manner that depends on phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3. Human T-ALL cell lines showed a close relationship between FBW7 loss and MCL1 overexpression. Correspondingly, T-ALL cell lines with defective FBW7 are particularly sensitive to the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib but resistant to the BCL2 antagonist ABT-737. On the genetic level, FBW7 reconstitution or MCL1 depletion restores sensitivity to ABT-737, establishing MCL1 as a therapeutically relevant bypass survival mechanism that enables FBW7-deficient cells to evade apoptosis. Therefore, our work provides insight into the molecular mechanism of direct tumour suppression by FBW7 and has implications for the targeted treatment of patients with FBW7-deficient T-ALL.",,['NIHMS256405'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Primary activation by presentation of cognate antigen is coupled to rapid T-cell cycling and progressive epigenetic changes that guide the cell down distinct T-cell lineages, either effector (Th1, Th2, Th17) or tolerogenic (Treg). Fate choice is influenced both by strength of the priming activation signal and by cues from the micro-environment that are integrated with lineage-specific gene expression profiles, eventually becoming hard-wired in the fully differentiated cell. The micro-environmental cues include cytokines, and the discovery that leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and interleukin (IL)-6 counter-regulate development of the Treg and Th17 lineages places LIF within the core regulatory circuitry of T cells.

Although Aven orthologs have been identified in most vertebrate species, no Aven gene has been reported in invertebrates. Here, we describe a Drosophila melanogaster open reading frame (ORF) that shares sequence and functional similarities with vertebrate Aven genes. The protein encoded by this ORF, which we named dAven, contains several domains that are highly conserved among Aven proteins of fish, amphibian, bird and mammalian origins. In flies, knockdown of dAven by RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in lethality when its expression was reduced either ubiquitously or in fat cells using Gal4 drivers. Animals undergoing moderate dAven knockdown in the fat body had smaller fat cells displaying condensed chromosomes and increased levels of the mitotic marker phosphorylated histone H3 (PHH3), suggesting that dAven was required for normal cell cycle progression in this tissue. Remarkably, expression of dAven in Xenopus egg extracts resulted in G2/M arrest that was comparable to that caused by human Aven. Taken together, these results suggest that, like its vertebrate counterparts, dAven plays a role in cell cycle regulation.

As previously reported for CLL, evidence of canonical SHM was observed in HCLc rearrangements, including: (1) a higher ratio of replacement to silent mutations in the complementarity determining regions than in the framework regions (2.83 vs 1.41, P < .001), (2) higher transition to transversion ratio than would be expected if mutations were random (1.49 vs 0.5, P < .001), and (3) higher than expected concentration of mutations within RGYW hot spots (13.92% vs 3.33%, P < .001).

As altered CD40/CD40L interactions have been associated with neutropenia, we investigated the role of CD40/CD40L on human granulopoiesis using immunomagnetically sorted CD34(+), CD34(-)/CD33(+), and CD34(-)/CD33(-)/CD15(+) BM cells, which represent sequential stages of the granulocytic development, the KG-1 cells that constantly express CD34 and CD33, and LTBMCs that mimic the BM microenvironment. CD40 and CD40L were minimally expressed on CD34(+), CD34(-)/CD33(+), and CD34(-)/CD33(-)/CD15(+) cells, but CD40 was substantially induced in the presence of TNF-alpha. Cross-linking of CD40 in the above cell populations resulted in induction of apoptosis that was enhanced further in the presence of FasL. CD40 activation in primary as wells as in KG-1 cells resulted in Fas up-regulation, providing a mechanism for the CD40-mediated apoptosis. Addition of CD40L in clonogenic assays resulted in a significant decrease in the colony-forming capacity of BMMCs from patients with chronic neutropenia, presumably expressing high levels of CD40 in the progenitor cells, and this effect was reversed upon CD40 blockade. CD40 was constitutively expressed on LTBMC stromal cells and upon activation, resulted in an increase in G-CSF and GM-CSF production. These data show that CD40/CD40L interactions may promote granulopoiesis under steady-state conditions by inducing the stromal release of granulopoiesis-supporting cytokines, whereas under inflammatory conditions, they may affect the granulocytic progenitor/precursor cell survival by accelerating the Fas-mediated apoptosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2011 Mar 2.,,,,"PURPOSE: To elucidate new molecular mechanisms able to downregulate the mRNA levels of key oncogenes, such as B-Myb and E2F1, in a therapeutic perspective. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: B-Myb and E2F1 mRNA levels were evaluated in primary B chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL, n = 10) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML, n = 5) patient cells, in a variety of p53(wild-type) and p53(mutated/deleted) leukemic cell lines, as well as in primary endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Knockdown experiments with siRNA for p53 and E2F1 and overexpression experiments with miR34a were conducted to elucidate the role of these pathways in promoting B-Myb downregulation. RESULTS: In vitro exposure to Nutlin-3, a nongenotoxic activator of p53, variably downregulated the expression of B-Myb in primary leukemic cells and in p53(wild-type) myeloid (OCI, MOLM) and lymphoblastoid (SKW6.4, EHEB) but not in p53(mutated) (NB4, BJAB, MAVER) or p53(deleted) (HL-60) leukemic cell lines. The transcriptional repression of B-Myb was also observed in primary normal endothelial cells and fibroblasts. B-Myb downregulation played a critical role in the cell-cycle block in G(1) phase induced by Nutlin-3, as shown by transfection experiments with specific siRNA. Moreover, we have provided experimental evidence suggesting that miR-34a is a central mediator in the repression of B-Myb both directly and through E2F1.

Individuals with acquired, iatrogenic or congenital immunodeficiency are at increased risk of PCNSL, which is commonly associated with EBV. In our patient, the expression of latent infection membrane protein 1 (LMP1), EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2), and EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER) in tumor cells confirmed a type III latency of EBV infection. Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) can induce immunodeficiency before the overt development of ATLL. The HTLV-I infection led to suppression of the immune system and the development of EBV-associated PCNSL.

High-dose methotrexate is a common component of many chemotherapeutic protocols for childhood with ALL. Our objective was to retrospectively evaluate the pharmacokinetics and plasma levels of high-dose methotrexate as it relates to event-free survival (EFS) in children with ALL. METHODS: Relapsed patients and subjects in EFS were compared for MTX serum concentrations 24, 36, 48 and 72 h after the start of 24 h infusion. Clearance (Cl), area under the curve (AUC) and volume of distribution (V(d) ) of the drug were estimated by the NONMEM computer program and also compared between both groups. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Among 69 children included, 54 (78.3%) were still in EFS, whereas 15 (21.7%) relapsed. The difference between relapsed and EFS patients for the pharmacokinetic parameters studied was not significant. On the contrary, the cohort studied was representative and known prognostic factors for relapse in ALL were significantly associated with relapse. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Serum concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters of MTX are not associated with outcome in ALL. Prognoses based on single-drug pharmacokinetic estimates within a complex multiple-agent protocol appear to be unreliable. However, therapeutic drug monitoring of high-dose methotrexate remains a useful tool for early detection of impaired elimination and for avoiding systemic toxicity.",['(c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to study the epidemiology of IFI in neutropenic patients and estimate the economic impact of treatment of those infections. METHODS: All patients hospitalized in onco-haematology, and treated with antifungal agents, in 2005 were investigated. Four features were studied: the diagnosis for each patient, the antifungal drugs used, the thoracic densitometry reports and the sero-mycological data. Infectious episodes were stratified according to the EORTC 2008 classification criteria (10). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Of the 1130 patients surveyed, 192 patients received systemic antifungal agents. Of these 46% had acute leukaemia, 29% bone-marrow allografts, 7% lymphoma and 18% other malignant haemopathies. Using the EORTC 2008 criteria (10), there were 8 proved IFI (3 aspergillosis, 3 candidosis and 2 other IFI), 17 probable IFI (11 aspergillosis, 6 candidosis) and 16 possible aspergillosis. The incidence of IFI was 2.1%. Eighty patients (41.7%) had received prophylaxis: 56 with fluconazole and 24 with voriconazole. Treatment was most often empirical (n = 127, 66.1%). Combination of two antifungals was used in 17 cases. The mean duration of prophylactic, empirical, proved/probable aspergillosis-directed, candidaemia-directed and combination treatment was 19, 19, 46, 32 and 27 days, respectively. The cost of antifungal treatment in 2005 reached almost 2,000,000 euro, including 427,000 euro for documented infections (proved and probable), 1,246,000 euro for empirical treatment and 58,300 euro for prophylaxis. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: The incidence of IFI is low but the pharmacoeconomic impact is extremely high. Improved strategies are required to reduce the frequency and duration of empirical treatment without compromising beneficial outcome.",['(c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In a retrospective, population-based study, using data from the Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario (POGO), Ontario, Canada, and the WHO, we examined yearly and population-adjusted mortality rates in Canada, the US, and several European countries. RESULTS: Our analysis demonstrates that there has been a decreasing trend in ALL mortality numbers and rates between 1999 and 2005 in the US and Canada, in a similar degree to those in European countries where folate fortification is not implemented. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that folate fortification does not appear to have caused an increase in therapeutic failures in children with ALL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2011 Mar 2.,,,,"Bacteria produce a wide array of metabolites to protect themselves from competing microbes. These antimicrobial compounds include peptides with an S-[(Z)-2-aminovinyl]-d-cysteine (AviCys) or S-[(Z)-2-aminovinyl]-(3S)-3-methyl-d-cysteine (AviMeCys) residue, which have been isolated from several different bacterial species. The peptides are structurally diverse: some feature polycyclic backbones, such as the lantibiotic epidermin, and others feature a mostly linear structure, such as cypemycin. Each of the AviCys-containing peptides characterized to date exhibit highly potent biological activities, ranging from antimicrobial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) to anticancer activity against mouse leukemia cells. The AviCys-containing peptides gallidermin and mutacin 1140 have been suggested as possible treatments of acne and of throat infections, respectively. Unfortunately, their low production yield in fermentation (typically only 10-200 mg/L) remains a major hindrance to the widespread use and clinical testing of AviCys-containing peptides for human therapeutics. Although scientists have made great strides in the total chemical synthesis of polycyclic peptides on solid support, an efficient method to form the AviCys ring has yet to be developed. In light of these difficulties, it may be possible to draw inspiration from the natural biosynthesis of AviCys-containing peptides within the producer organisms. In this Account, we examine the characteristics of the enzymes responsible for constructing AviCys to evaluate possibilities for generating high yields of bioactive AviCys- or AviMeCys-containing peptides for research and clinical use. The gene cluster for the biosynthesis of epidermin has been studied in depth, leading to the proposal for a mechanism of AviCys formation. First, a serine residue upstream of the C-terminus is enzymatically dehydrated to form a dehydroalanine residue. Then, the C-terminal cysteine residue is oxidatively decarboxylated to form an enethiolate, which subsequently cyclizes onto the dehydroalanine to give the AviCys ring. Extensive research on EpiD, the enzyme responsible for the oxidative decarboxylation reaction, has led to its purification and cocrystallization with a model substrate peptide, yielding an X-ray crystal structure. An in vitro assay of the enzyme with a library of synthetic heptapeptides has resulted in the discovery that EpiD has low absolute substrate specificity and can oxidatively decarboxylate a wide variety of C-terminal cysteine-containing peptides. Recently, the gene cluster for the biosynthesis of cypemycin was also identified. Despite certain structural similarities between cypemycin and the lantibiotic peptides, analysis of the biosynthetic genes suggests that cypemycin production is quite different from that of the lantibiotics. In particular, the AviCys residue in cypemycin is formed from two cysteine residues instead of one serine and one cysteine, and the CypD enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of the C-terminal cysteine shows little homology to EpiD. The knowledge accrued from studying EpiD and CypD could be used to develop a semisynthetic methodology to produce AviCys-containing peptides. In particular, suitable precursor peptides could be synthesized on solid support before being fed to either of these enzymes in vitro to generate the C-terminal AviCys moiety. Exploring the potential of this methodology could lead to the efficient production of epidermin, cypemycin, and analogues thereof.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present work was to assess the beneficial properties of skin, seeds and pulp of red table grapes (RTG) (Vitis vinifera, Palieri Cadiz variety). Two potential beneficial activities of red table grapes (RTG) were analyzed: (i) The maintenance of genomic stability studying their genotoxic/antigenotoxic effects, and (ii) the in vitro cytotoxic effect against tumor cells of RTG components. The genotoxic and/or antigenotoxic effect was measured applying the somatic mutation and recombination test on wing imaginal discs of Drosophila melanogaster. The cytotoxic effect was monitored using the HL60 human leukemia model to evaluate the antiproliferative potential of the different parts of RTG. The three major parts (skin, seeds and pulp) are not genotoxic. When antigenotoxicity assays were performed using hydrogen peroxide as the oxidative genotoxin, skin, seed and pulp exerted a desmutagenic effect, with seeds and skin showing the most potent effect. The cytotoxicity tests using HL60 cells indicated that only skin and pulp fractions are able to inhibit the tumor growth, with skin having the lowest IC50 (1.8 mg/mL versus 8 mg/mL of pulp). These results suggest that RTG are potent anti-mutagens that protect DNA from oxidative damage as well as being cytotoxic toward the HL60 tumor cell line.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Regulation of SHP2 activity is, in part, achieved by an intramolecular interaction between the PTP domain of the protein, which contains the catalytic site, and the N-SH2 domain leading to a ""closed"" protein conformation and autoinhibition. Accordingly, ""opening"" of the N-SH2 and PTP domains is required for the protein to become active. Binding of phosphopeptides to the N-SH2 domain is known to induce the opening event, while a number of gain-of-function (GOF) mutants, implicated in Noonan's Syndrome and childhood leukemias, are thought to facilitate opening. In the present study, a combination of computational and experimental methods are used to investigate the structural mechanism of opening of SHP2 and the impact of three GOF mutants, D61G, E76K, and N308D, on the opening mechanism. Calculated free energies of opening indicate that opening must be facilitated by effector molecules, possibly the protein substrates themselves, as the calculated free energies preclude spontaneous opening. Simulations of both wild type (WT) SHP2 and GOF mutants in the closed state indicate GOF activity to involve increased solvent exposure of selected residues, most notably Arg362, which in turn may enhance interactions of SHP2 with its substrate proteins and thereby aid opening. In addition, GOF mutations cause structural changes in the phosphopeptide-binding region of the N-SH2 domain leading to conformations that mimic the bound state. Such conformational changes are suggested to enhance binding of phosphopeptides and/or decrease interactions between the PTP and N-SH2 domains thereby facilitating opening. Experimental assays of the impact of effector molecules on SHP2 phosphatase activity against both small molecule and peptide substrates support the hypothesized mechanism of GOF mutant action. The present calculations also suggest a role for the C-SH2 domain of SHP2 in stabilizing the overall conformation of the protein in the open state, thereby aiding conformational switching between the open active and closed inactive states.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['NIHMS263852'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The prognostic significance of these parameters was assessed in the context of intensive tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-based chemotherapy. METHODS: The authors studied 65 adult patients with Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who received treatment with TKI-based therapy, correlated their clinicopathologic heterogeneity with patient outcome, and compared the findings with those from 60 adult patients with diploid B-cell ALL who received similar chemotherapy without a TKI. RESULTS: Ph-positive ALL was associated with older age (P = .01), the common-B immunophenotype characterized by a greater frequency of CD13 (alanine aminopeptidase) coexpression (P = .004), CD66c (carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 3) expression (P = .007), and CD25 (interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain) expression (P < .001) and with a lower frequency of CD15 (3-fucosyl-N-acetyl-lactosamine) expression (P < .001). Conventional karyotypic analyses indicated that the Ph chromosome was the sole abnormality in 19 patients (30%), was present with other aberrancies in 43 patients (65%), and was absent (detectable only by fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH] or quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] analysis) in 3 patients (5%). The presence of the breakpoint cluster region-v-Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog fusion gene (BCR-ABL) was confirmed in all patients by FISH or RT-PCR (the 190-kDa protein [p190] construct was present in 49 patients [77%], and the p210 fusion transcript construct was present in 15 patients [23%]). The presence of a supernumerary Ph chromosome was correlated with a higher incidence of CD20 (B-lymphocyte antigen, nonglycosylated phosphoprotein) expression (P < .001), whereas the p210 construct was correlated with aberrant CD25 expression (P = .05). Outcomes were not influenced by the degree of karyotypic complexity (including the presence or absence of a supernumerary Ph chromosome), CD20 expression, or myeloid antigen expression (CD13, CD33 [myeloid lineage transmembrane receptor], CD66c). CD25 expression was associated with inferior survival in univariate analysis (P = .051) but not in multivariate analysis (P = .092). CONCLUSIONS: In the context of intensive, TKI-based chemotherapy, the immunophenotypic, karyotypic, and molecular heterogeneity of Ph-positive ALL no longer influences outcome.",['Cancer 2011 (c) 2011 American Cancer Society.'],['NIHMS883187'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, the specificity of c-Myb is dramatically different in small subpopulations of cells, for example cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, than in the bulk population. The repositioning of c-Myb during the cell cycle is not due to changes in its expression and also occurs with ectopically expressed, epitope-tagged versions of c-Myb. The repositioning occurs in established cell lines, in primary human CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors and in primary human acute myeloid leukemia cells. The combination of fixation, sorting and ChIP analysis sheds new light on the dynamic nature of gene regulation during the cell cycle and provides a new type of tool for the analysis of gene regulation in small subsets of cells, such as cells in a specific phase of the cell cycle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report we have used Jurkat and Raji cell lines as a model for studies of the NKG2D receptor-ligand system in T-and B cell leukemia/lymphoma. Using real-time quantitative RT-PCR and immunoflow cytometry we show that Jurkat and Raji cells constitutively express mRNA and protein for the stress-inducible NKG2D ligands MICA/B and ULBP1 and 2, and up-regulate the expression in a cell-line specific and stress-specific manner. Furthermore, we revealed by electron microscopy, immunoflow cytometry and western blot that these ligands were expressed and secreted on exosomes, nanometer-sized microvesicles of endosomal origin. Acting as a decoy, the NKG2D ligand-bearing exosomes downregulate the in vitro NKG2D receptor-mediated cytotoxicity and thus impair NK-cell function. Interestingly, thermal and oxidative stress enhanced the exosome secretion generating more soluble NKG2D ligands that aggravated the impairment of the cytotoxic response. Taken together, our results might partly explain the clinically observed NK-cell dysfunction in patients suffering from leukemia/lymphoma. The adverse effect of thermal and oxidative stress, enhancing the release of immunosuppressive exosomes, should be considered when cytostatic and hyperthermal anti-cancer therapies are designed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The BCL-2 family has an essential role in regulating GC-induced cell death. Here we show that downregulation of antiapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins, especially MCL-1, enhances GC-induced cell death. Thus we target MCL-1 by using GX15-070 (obatoclax) in ALL cells. Treatment with GX15-070 in both dexamethasone (Dex)-sensitive and -resistant ALL cells shows effective growth inhibition and cell death. GX15-070 induces caspase-3 cleavage and increases the Annexin V-positive population, which is indicative of apoptosis. Before the onset of apoptosis, GX15-070 induces LC3 conversion as well as p62 degradation, both of which are autophagic cell death markers. A pro-apoptotic molecule BAK is released from the BAK/MCL-1 complex following GX15-070 treatment. Consistently, downregulation of BAK reduces caspase-3 cleavage and cell death, but does not alter LC3 conversion. In contrast, downregulation of ATG5, an autophagy regulator, decreases LC3 conversion and cell death, but does not alter caspase-3 cleavage, suggesting that apoptosis and autophagy induced by GX15-070 are independently regulated. Downregulation of Beclin-1, which is capable of crosstalk between apoptosis and autophagy, affects GX15-070-induced cell death through apoptosis but not autophagy. Taken together, GX15-070 treatment in ALL could be an alternative regimen to overcome glucocorticoid resistance by inducing BAK-dependent apoptosis and ATG5-dependent autophagy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High expression of the small heat-shock protein-27 (Hsp27) in leukemia contributes to the resistance of these cells to cancer treatments. Changes in Hsp27 phosphorylation have been associated with heat and metabolic stress, but its role in flavonoid anticancer activity has not been investigated. In this study, we examined the effect of apigenin in the regulation of Hsp27 on leukemia. We showed that apigenin does not affect Hsp27 expression but induces a bimodal phosphorylation on Ser78 and Ser82. The phosphorylation at early times was regulated by p38. At later times, Hsp27 phosphorylation was dependent on p38 activity and for some residues on PKCdelta. Silencing of p38 expression reduced apigenin-induced phosphorylation on Ser15, Ser78, and Ser82, whereas silencing of PKCdelta expression reduced the phosphorylation on Ser15 and Ser82 without affecting Ser78. In addition, we found that apigenin-induced PKCdelta activity is mediated by p38. We also showed that the phosphorylation of Hsp27 significantly increased the susceptibility of leukemia cells to apigenin-induced apoptosis. Together, these results identify a complex signaling network regulating the cytotoxic effect of apigenin through Hsp27 phosphorylation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein we show that the common dietary flavonoid apigenin has anticancer activity, but also may decrease chemotherapy sensitivity, depending on the cell type. We analyzed the molecular consequences of apigenin treatment in two types of leukemia, the myeloid and erythroid subtypes. Apigenin blocked proliferation in both lineages through cell-cycle arrest in G(2)/M phase for myeloid HL60 and G(0)/G(1) phase for erythroid TF1 cells. In both cell lines the JAK/STAT pathway was one of major targets of apigenin. Apigenin inhibited PI3K/PKB pathway in HL60 and induced caspase-dependent apoptosis. In contrast, no apoptosis was detected in TF1 cells, but initiation of autophagy was observed. The block in cell cycle and induction of autophagy observed in this erythroleukemia cell line resulted in a reduced susceptibility toward the commonly used therapeutic agent vincristine. Thus, this study shows that although apigenin is a potential chemopreventive agent due to the induction of leukemia cell-cycle arrest, caution in dietary intake of apigenin should be taken during disease as it potentially interferes with cancer treatment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lesions are usually intra-axial and supratentorial; several radiologic patterns have been reported. CASE REPORT: A 65-year-old patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia presented with fever, headache, and a pontocerebellar syndrome. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a ring-enhancing left pontocerebellar mass consistent with an infectious disease. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, the patient worsened. A follow-up MRI examination disclosed a concomitant acute ischemic lesion in the ipsilateral thalamus and an irregular narrowing of the posterior cerebral artery close to the lesion. A retrospective analysis of the first MRI revealed a small mesencephalic ischemic lesion, contiguous to the extra-axial pontocerebellar mass. At surgical inspection the mass was found to be an extra-axial granuloma, with purulent components, attached to the petrous-tentorial angle, surrounded by a thick capsule. The lesion was only partially removed because of the tight relationship with the leptomeninges of the brain stem. Cerebral aspergillosis was the final histologic and microbiological diagnosis. CONCLUSION: In immunocompromised patients, the coexistence of an infectious lesion with involvement of contiguous vessels and consequent ischemic infarction should raise the suspicion of aspergillosis, even in unusual locations such as the pontocerebellar angle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2011 Apr 1.,,,PMC3100767,"Heterogeneous DNA methylation leads to difficulties in accurate detection and quantification of methylation. Methylation-sensitive high resolution melting (MS-HRM) is unique among regularly used methods for DNA methylation analysis in that heterogeneous methylation can be readily identified, although not quantified, by inspection of the melting curves. Bisulfite pyrosequencing has been used to estimate the level of heterogeneous methylation by quantifying methylation levels present at individual CpG dinucleotides. Sequentially combining the two methodologies using MS-HRM to screen the amplification products prior to bisulfite pyrosequencing would be advantageous. This would not only replace the quality control step using agarose gel analysis prior to the pyrosequencing step but would also provide important qualitative information in its own right. We chose to analyze DAPK1 as it is an important tumor suppressor gene frequently heterogeneously methylated in a number of malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). A region of the DAPK1 promoter was analyzed in ten CLL samples by MS-HRM. By using a biotinylated primer, bisulfite pyrosequencing could be used to directly analyze the samples. MS-HRM revealed the presence of various extents of heterogeneous DAPK1 methylation in all CLL samples. Further analysis of the biotinylated MS-HRM products by bisulfite pyrosequencing provided quantitative information for each CpG dinucleotide analyzed, and confirmed the presence of heterogeneous DNA methylation. Whereas each method could be used individually, MS-HRM and bisulfite pyrosequencing provided complementary information for the assessment of heterogeneous methylation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multiple prior mouse models of APL constitutively express PML-RARA from a variety of non-Pml loci. Typically, all animals develop a myeloproliferative disease, followed by leukemia in a subset of animals after a long latent period. In contrast, human APL is not associated with an antecedent stage of myeloproliferation. To address this discrepancy, we have generated a system whereby PML-RARA expression is somatically acquired from the mouse Pml locus in the context of Pml haploinsufficiency. We found that physiologic PML-RARA expression was sufficient to direct a hematopoietic progenitor self-renewal program in vitro and in vivo. However, this expansion was not associated with evidence of myeloproliferation, more accurately reflecting the clinical presentation of human APL. Thus, at physiologic doses, PML-RARA primarily acts to increase hematopoietic progenitor self-renewal, expanding a population of cells that are susceptible to acquiring secondary mutations that cause progression to leukemia. This mouse model provides a platform for more accurately dissecting the early events in APL pathogenesis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that in both mice and humans, NKp46 expression marks a minute population of WT NKT cells with higher activity and potency to become leukemic. Virtually 100% of T-LGL leukemias in IL-15 transgenic mice expressed NKp46, as did a majority of human T-LGL leukemias. The minute NKp46+ NKT population, but not the NKp46(-) NKT population, was selectively expanded by overexpression of endogenous IL-15. Importantly, IL-15 transgenic NKp46(-) NKT cells did not become NKp46+ in vivo, suggesting that NKp46+ T-LGL leukemia cells were the malignant counterpart of the minute WT NKp46+ NKT population. Mechanistically, NKp46+ NKT cells possessed higher responsiveness to IL-15 in vitro and in vivo compared with that of their NKp46(-) NKT counterparts. Furthermore, interruption of IL-15 signaling using a neutralizing antibody could prevent LGL leukemia in IL-15 transgenic mice. Collectively, our data demonstrate that NKp46 identifies a functionally distinct NKT subset in mice and humans that appears to be directly susceptible to leukemic transformation when IL-15 is overexpressed. Thus, IL-15 signaling and NKp46 may be useful targets in the treatment of patients with T-LGL or NKT leukemia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DATA SOURCE: A MEDLINE search was conducted (1977-November 2010) using the terms APL, DS, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), retinoic acid syndrome, and arsenic trioxide (ATO). METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: English articles identified from the MEDLINE search were evaluated. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: With ATRA, ATO, and chemotherapy, a complete remission is achievable for most newly diagnosed APL patients. However, treatment with the differentiating agents, ATRA and ATO, can lead to the development of DS. Signs and symptoms of this syndrome include hyperleukocytosis and cardiorespiratory compromise. Severe complications can develop, if DS is not recognized early and treated promptly with corticosteroids. In addition, patients with a high white blood cell count at diagnosis may benefit from prophylactic steroids. CONCLUSIONS: Early recognition and prompt initiation of corticosteroids are key factors in the management of DS. Healthcare professionals need to be familiar with this complication which can arise from differentiation agents.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because CLL cells harbor high levels of unphosphorylated STAT-3 (USTAT-3) and USTAT-3 was reported to activate NF-kappaB, we sought to determine whether USTAT-3 activates NF-kappaB in CLL. Using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), we studied peripheral blood low-density cells from 15 patients with CLL and found that CLL cell nuclear extracts from all the samples bound to an NF-kappaB DNA probe, suggesting that NF-kappaB is constitutively activated in CLL. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that STAT-3 bound NF-kappaB p65, and confocal microscopy studies detected USTAT-3/NF-kappaB complexes in the nuclei of CLL cells, thereby confirming these findings. Furthermore, infection of CLL cells with retroviral STAT-3-short hairpin RNA attenuated the binding of NF-kappaB to DNA, as assessed by EMSA, and downregulated mRNA levels of NF-kappaB-regulated genes, as assessed by quantitative PCR. Taken together, our data suggest that USTAT-3 binds to the NF-kappaB p50/p65 dimers and that the USTAT-3/NF-kappaB complexes bind to DNA and activate NF-kappaB-regulated genes in CLL cells.",['(c)2011 AACR.'],['NIHMS592799'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we used sensitive and resistant sublines from a Bcr-Abl positive cell line to investigate the putative involvement of telomerase in the promotion of imatinib resistance. We showed that sensitivity to imatinib can be partly restored in imatinib-resistant cells by targeting telomerase expression, either by the introduction of a dominant-negative form of the catalytic protein subunit of the telomerase (hTERT) or by the treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid, a clinically used drug. Furthermore, we showed that hTERT overexpression favors the development of imatinib resistance through both its antiapoptotic and telomere maintenance functions. Therefore, combining antitelomerase strategies to imatinib treatment at the beginning of the treatment should be promoted to reduce the risk of imatinib resistance development and increase the probability of eradicating the disease.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The association of TCFs with serum response elements (SREs) on IEG promoters has been widely studied and a role for Elk-1 in promoting cell cycle entry has been determined. However, the presence of the ETS domain transcription factor Elk-1 in axons and dendrites of post-mitotic adult brain neurons has implications for an alternative function for Elk-1 in neurons other than controlling proliferation. In this study, possible alternative roles for Elk-1 in neurons were investigated, and it was demonstrated that blocking TCF-mediated transactivation in neuronal cells leads to apoptosis through a caspase-dependent mechanism. Indeed RNAi-mediated depletion of endogenous Elk-1 results in increased caspase activity. Conversely, overexpression of either Elk-1 or Elk-VP16 fusion proteins was shown to rescue PC12 cells from chemically-induced apoptosis, and that higher levels of endogenous Elk-1 correlated with longer survival of DRGs in culture. It was shown that Elk-1 regulated the Mcl-1 gene expression required for survival, and that RNAi-mediated degradation of endogenous Elk-1 resulted in elimination of the mcl-1 message. We have further identified the survival-of-motor neuron-1 (SMN1) gene as a novel target of Elk-1, and show that the ets motifs in the SMN1 promoter are involved in this regulation.",['2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Detection of the minimal residual disease (MRD) before and after allo-HCT is associated with higher relapse rate. Early administration of imatinib after allo-HCT may prevent recurrent Ph(+) ALL. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of imatinib in preventing hematological relapse when imatinib was administrated in the first 90 days after allo-HCT. METHODS: Patients with Ph(+) ALL that underwent allo-HCT were enrolled in a prospective study. A TaqMan-based real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) technique was used to detect the MRD (bcr-abl transcript levels). Imatinib therapy was initiated prior to 90 days after allo-HCT if the patient's absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was above 1.0 x 10(9)/L (without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) administration) and the platelet count was greater than 50.0 x 10(9)/L, or if the bcr-abl transcript levels were elevated in two consecutive tests, or if the bcr-abl transcript levels were >/= 10(-2) after the initial engraftment. The initial daily dose of imatinib was 400 mg/d for adults and 260 mg/m(2) for children (younger than 17 years). Imatinib was administered for at least 1 month and the bcr-abl TaqMan results were negative for 3 consecutive tests, or complete molecular remission (CR(mol)) was sustained for at least 3 months. RESULTS: From May 2005 to October 2008, 29 patients were enrolled in this study, of whom, 19 patients were male and 10 were female. The median age of the enrolled patients was 33 years (range 6 - 50 years). Imatinib therapy was started at a median time of 60 days (range 20 - 122 days) post HCT (only one patient started Imatinib therapy at 122nd day after HCT). Twenty-five adult patients could tolerate a dose of 300 - 400 mg/d of imatinib, and three children tolerated a dose of 260 mgxm(-2)xd(-1). Sixty-eight percent of the patients experienced various adverse events during imatinib therapy, hematological toxicity being the most common adverse event. The median duration of imatinib treatment was 3 months (range 7 days-18 months). During the median follow-up of 24 months (range 16.0 - 54.5 months), 3 out of 27 patients that could be evaluated for efficacy died from relapse. The 3-year probability of relapse for the evaluated patients was (11.3 +/- 0.61)%. The relapse rates among the subgroup of positive and negative bcr-abl patients before allo-HCT were 13.6% and 0, respectively (P > 0.05). The relapse rates among the subgroups of bcr-abl positive and negative patients after allo-HCT were 20.0% and 5.9%, respectively (P > 0.05). The relapse rates among the patients in first complete remission (CR(1)) and second complete remission/non-remission (CR(2)/NR) before transplantation were 0 and 31.4%, respectively (P < 0.05). The 3-year probability of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) for the all enrolled patients were (75.3 +/- 8.1)%. The 3-year probabilities for OS and DFS among the subgroup of patients in CR(1) and CR(2)/NR before transplantation were (87.7 +/- 8.2)% and (54.6 +/- 15.0)%, respectively (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Administration of imatinib at a dose of 300 - 400 mg/d in the first 90 days after allo-HCT is feasible in Ph(+) ALL patients. With this treatment, bcr-abl positive patients before or after transplantation do not have a higher relapse rate after allo-HCT compared with the bcr-abl negative patients. Because of lower relapse rate and better OS and DFS, we recommend that Ph(+) ALL patients receive allo-HCT in CR(1).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro insulin can stimulate cell proliferation and differentiation. Insulin is also an important growth regulator in vivo, which has been proved in more and more studies. The role of insulin at the cellular level is triggered by the binding of insulin to its receptor located in the cell surface. However, insulin at the higher concentration can also been triggered by insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor. Its role varies in different cell lines. Insulin receptor and insulin-like growth factor receptor-1 are widely expressed in human MDS and AML cell membranes. Recently, many studies related to the relationship between hyperinsulinemia and cancer have been reported. In this review the role and its possible mechanism in promoting human leukemia cell proliferation and inhibiting human leukemia cell proliferation are summarized. Furthermore, the potential application prospect of insulin analogues also will be described.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Generally, chemotherapy for sAML hardly has any efficacy. The only way to cure the patients with sAML is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, but unfortunately, only few patients are appropriate for transplantation. So it is important to study the mechanisms of progression of MDS to AML and to explore the potent drug for clinical use.

Glucocorticoid (GC)-induced apoptosis in 3 different cell lines was detected by flow cytometry. Cell growth in Jurkat cells treated with cortisol was analyzed by trypan blue dye exclusion. Flow cytometry was performed to observe GC-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells treated by combination of GC with 11beta-HSD2 inhibition 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid (18beta-GA). The results demonstrated that 11beta-HSD2 highly expressed in Jurkat cells, but not in Daudi, Raji cells and normal blood T cells.

The results showed that the rate of chromosome abnormality was 32.1% in 53 cases. Among these abnormalities, 82.4% were involved in 3 or more than 3 chromosome aberrations, the mode of chromosome was from 44 to 90. The chromosome karyotype abnormality was involved in all of 24 chromosomes, and 70.6% chromosome aberrations involved at least one of 1q21 amplification, 13q14 deletion, 17p13 deletion and 14q32 translocation.

The 3 shRNA targeting human vegf gene were synthesized, then transfected into K562/A02 cells by lipofectamine 2000 reagent. RT-PCR was used to detect the expression of vegf and mrp1 at the mRNA level;Western blot was used to analyze the expression of VEGF, MRP1, AKT, P-AKT at the protein level; MTT was used to determine the IC(50) value of transfected cells to doxorubicin (DOX); flow cytometry was used to detect cell apoptosis and intracellular Rho123 retention. The results showed that after vegf shRNA were transfected into K562/A02 cells, the expression of vegf at the mRNA level decreased, and the difference between vegf shRNA2 group or vegf shRNA3 group and HK group was statistically significant (p < 0.05), the greatest decrease was observed in the cells transfected with vegf shRNA3; and the protein level of VEGF was also down-regulated. The IC(50) value of positively transfected group was lower than that of control groups, and the difference between vegf shRNA2 group or vegf shRNA3 group and HK group was significant (p < 0.05). The retention of intracellular Rho123 was enhanced in three positively transfected groups (p < 0.05).

Those with granulocytic colony-stimulating factor occurred after prolonged therapy and there was a rise in total leukocyte count unlike that in our patient who received just a single injection for the first time. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 64-year-old Egyptian man with chronic lymphatic leukemia who developed progressive cutaneous vasculitic lesions following injection of a single dose of a granulocytic colony stimulating factor before a third cycle of chemotherapy to improve neutropenia. This is an unusual case and the pathogenesis is not fully understood. Our patient was not on any medical treatment except for bisoprolol for ischemic heart disease. Although aggressive management with steroids, anticoagulation and plasmapheresis had been carried out, the condition was aggressive and the patient's consciousness deteriorated.

Epub 2011 Mar 1.,,,,"OBJECTIVE: To analyse the incidence and the determinants of severe oral mucositis (OM) in young cancer patients treated by standard chemotherapy. METHODS: The study was carried out at the Pediatric Hemato-Oncology unit of Children's Hospital of Rabat. Patients under 16 years of age with malignant disease treated by chemotherapy between January 2001 and December 2006 were recorded. RESULTS: Consecutive patients (n = 970) with malignant disease were studied. The age ranges from 2 months to 16 years (mean, 6.8 +/- 4.1 years). OM occurred in 540 (55.6%) patients, and 17.9% of them encountered severe grades. Mean time to onset of the lesions was 10.5 +/- 6.8 (range, 1-22 days) and mean duration was 6.8 +/- 3.1 (range, 2-23 days). All chemotherapeutic protocols were associated with OM development (range, 20-100%). Patients with severe OM were more likely to have undifferentiated carcinoma of nasopharyngeal type (RR = 2.6, 95% IC 1.1-6.1), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (RR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.2-2.4) and acute leukaemia (RR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.5-3.6). Methotrexate-based therapies were also associated with the worsening of OM (RR = 1.7, 95% IC 1.2-2.6). CONCLUSION: Underlying disease and chemotherapy regimens are the principal risk factors of OM development. This model can help in the identification of patients at risk for adequate preventive and therapeutic measures.","['(c) 2011 The Authors.

Epub 2011 Apr 7.,,,,"BACKGROUND: Mastocytosis is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by the excessive proliferation of mast cells. Mast cell leukaemia (MCL), the aggressive form of this disease, requires cytoreductive therapy, such as cladribine, interferon-alpha-2b and, most recently, tyrosine kinase inhibitors - dasatinib or imatinib. PATIENT AND METHODS: We present a case of a 56-yr-old female patient with aleukaemic MCL in whom the typical KIT-D816V mutation was not detected. Sequencing of the entire coding sequence of KIT gene revealed a somatic mutation in exon 9 (p.A502_Y503dup). This mutation was previously reported in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST). Considering the good response to imatinib in such patients, therapy with imatinib was attempted in our patient. The treatment tolerance and outcomes were very good, with reduced mast cell infiltration of the bone marrow, normalization of the serum tryptase concentration and resolution of the clinical signs and symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of the KIT-D816V in systemic forms of mast cell proliferation, a search for other mutations is indicated, preferably by sequencing the entire KIT gene, as this can influence the choice of treatment. The finding of the p.A502_Y503dup in exon 9, a mutation which has been observed in GIST but not previously reported in any form of aggressive mastocytosis, can be associated with a good response to imatinib in both diseases.",['(c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Time- (5, 12, 23, 48 h) and dose- (0-8 Gy) dependent changes in gene expression were examined in C57BL/6 mice. A training set was used to derive weighted voting classification algorithms (nonirradiated/irradiated) and continuous regression (dose assessment) models that were tested in a separate validation set of mice. Of eight biodosimetry genes identified in cancer patients ( ACTA2 , BBC3 , CCNG1 , CDKN1A , GADD45A , MDK , SERPINE1 , Tnfrsf10b ), expression of BBC3 , CCNG1 , CDKN1A , SERPINE1 and Tnfrsf10b was significantly (P < 0.05) increased in irradiated mice. CCNG1 and CDKN1A expression segregated irradiated mice from controls with an accuracy, specificity and sensitivity of 96.3, 100.0 and 94.4%, respectively, at 48 h.

The ultimate goal of this work is to use these methods for optically-based clinical and preclinical cancer treatment monitoring. Optical coherence tomography data were acquired from acute myeloid leukemia cells undergoing three modes of cell death. Significant increases in integrated backscatter were observed for cells undergoing apoptosis and mitotic arrest, while necrotic cells induced a decrease. These changes appear to be linked to structural changes observed in histology obtained from the cell samples. Signal envelope statistics were analyzed from fittings of the generalized gamma distribution to histograms of envelope intensities. The parameters from this distribution demonstrated sensitivities to morphological changes in the cell samples. These results indicate that OCT integrated backscatter and first order envelope statistics can be used to detect and potentially differentiate between modes of cell death in vitro.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that ormeloxifen induces apoptosis in dose-dependent manner in a variety of leukemia cells, more strikingly in K562. 2-DE-gel electrophoresis of K562 cells induced with ormeloxifen showed that 57 and 30% of proteins belong to apoptosis and cell-cycle pathways, respectively. Our data demonstrate that ormeloxifen-induced apoptosis in K562 cells involves activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and subsequent cytochrome c release, leading to mitochondria-mediated caspase-3 activation. Ormeloxifen-induced apoptosis via ERK activation was drastically inhibited by prior treatment of K562 cells with ERK inhibitor PD98059. Ormeloxifen also inhibits proliferation of K562 cells by blocking them in G0-G1 phase by inhibiting c-myc promoter via ormeloxifen-induced MBP-1 (c-myc promoter-binding protein) and upregulation of p21 expression. We further show that ormeloxifen-induced apoptosis in K562 is translatable to mononuclear cells isolated from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. Thus, ormeloxifen induces apoptosis in K562 cells via phosphorylation of ERK and arrests them in G0-G1 phase by reciprocal regulation of p21 and c-myc. Therefore, inclusion of ormeloxifen in the therapy of chronic myeloid leukemia can be of potential utility.","['Copyright (c) 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

PROCEDURE: In a series of 14 consecutive bone marrow investigations from children with precursor B-cell ALL, morphological evaluations of smears and flow cytometric measurements of minimal residual disease in sequentially aspirated small (2 ml) and large (5-10 ml) volumes of bone marrow were compared, at various time points during therapy. RESULTS: The density of nucleated cells was markedly reduced in the large volume aspirate. The percentage of erythroblasts measured by flow cytometry was smaller, indicating dilution with peripheral cells. Similarly, the blast percentage was reduced with 54% in large aspirates, and in four instances with minimal residual disease of >0.1% in the small volume, the level of blasts in the large aspirate was below this limit. CONCLUSIONS: The amount of minimal residual disease should be measured in the first 2.5 ml of bone marrow aspirated from one puncture site.

It is unclear whether withholding therapy in HR-ALL children is justified by echocardiogram findings. We reviewed the initial echocardiograms in a cohort of children with HR-ALL to determine the incidence of contraindications for anthracycline treatment. PROCEDURE: We identified 50 consecutive children (<21 years old) with HR-ALL presenting at our institution over a 10-year period. One didn't have an initial echocardiogram, 39 had pre-therapy studies, and 10 were studied within 6 days of beginning chemotherapy. These 49 studies were reviewed to determine the incidence and clinical significance of abnormalities. RESULTS: All 49 patients had normal cardiac function. Initial echocardiogram findings had no impact on induction chemotherapy administration in any patient. However, only 22(45%) of the studies were completely normal. Echocardiographic abnormalities included pericardial effusion (17/49), trivial or mild mitral or aortic insufficiency (13/49), left ventricular enlargement (3/49), and structural heart disease (4/49). Twelve percent of the children had a patent foramen ovale. None of the cardiac findings required therapeutic intervention other than repositioning of indwelling lines (6/49) due to intracardiac positioning. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, findings on echocardiograms in childhood HR-ALL did not impact anthracycline administration. This study suggests that induction chemotherapy should not be delayed for an echocardiogram. However, whenever possible, a pre-therapy echocardiogram is still recommended for determining baseline function and to identify associated problems like pericardial effusions which were common in this study.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our study is designed to assess survival of childhood ALL at King Hussein Cancer Center (KHCC) using modified St. Jude Children's Research Hospital protocols. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of children 1-18 years of age who were diagnosed with ALL and treated at KHCC from January 2003 through December 2009. Disease characteristics and outcome were analyzed. RESULTS: Over a 7-year period, 300 children with ALL were treated. One hundred and seventy-three (57.7%) were males and 127 (42.3%) were females. The median age at diagnosis was 5 years. One hundred and fifty-seven (52.3%) children were classified as low-risk, 118 (39.3%) were standard-risk and 25 (8.3%) were high-risk. Two hundred and sixty-two (88.5%) children had pre-B cell phenotype and 34 (11.5%) had T-cell phenotype. Two hundred and seventy-three (91.3%) children were classified as having CNS I disease, 24 (8%) had CNS II, and 2 (0.67%) had CNS III. Cytogenetic abnormalities included: t(12;21) in 30 (12%) children and t(9;22) in 18 (7.4%). Four (1.3%) children died in induction, 6 (2%) died in first remission and 27 (9%) relapsed. After a median follow-up of 34.5 months (range 0.32-84.5), the estimated 5-year event free survival and overall survival were 80% and 89%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Treatment protocols developed by major cooperative groups and institutions to treat childhood ALL was successfully adapted and suggest that such an approach may be useful in other low- and middle-income countries.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURES: Children's Oncology Group trial P9906 evaluated a modified augmented BFM regimen in 267 patients with particularly high risk B-precursor ALL. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was assessed in blood at day 8 and in marrow at day 29 of induction and correlated with outcome. RESULTS: The 5-year CCR probability for patients in P9906 was significantly better than that observed for similar patients on POG trials 8602/9006 (62.2 +/- 3.7% vs. 50.6 +/- 2.4%; P = 0.0007) but similar to POG 9406 (63.5 +/- 2.4%; P = 0.81). Interim analysis showed poor central nervous system (CNS) control, especially in patients with initial WBC >/= 100,000/microliter. Day 29 marrow MRD positive (>/= 0.01%) vs. negative patients had 5 year CCR rates of 37.1 +/- 7.4% vs. 72.6 +/- 4.3%; day 8 blood MRD positive vs. negative patients had 5 year CCR rates of 57.1 +/- 4.6% vs.83.6 +/- 6.3%. End induction marrow MRD predicted marrow but not CNS relapse. In multivariate analysis, day 29 MRD > 0.01%, initial WBC >/= 100,000/microl, male gender, and day 8 blood MRD > 0.01% were significant prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: Augmented BFM therapy improved outcome for children with higher risk ALL. Day 8 blood and day 29 marrow MRD were strong prognostic factors in these patients.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['NIHMS254662'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In proliferating stem cells, Pml-nuclear body, along with transcription factors TR2, steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) and Sp1, and Brg1-dependent chromatin remodeling complex (BRGC), associates with conserved region 1 (CR1) of this promoter to maintain a nucleosome-free region for gene activity. Retinoic acid (RA) rapidly downregulates Pml, resulting in the replacement of BRGC with Brm-containing remodeling complex, disassociation of SF1 and Sp1, retaining of TR2, recruitment of receptor-interaction protein 140, G9a and HP1gamma, and sequential insertion of two nucleosomes on CR1 that progressively displays repressive heterochromatin marks. This study demonstrates a functional role for Pml in maintaining a specific open chromatin conformation of the Oct4 promoter region for its constant expression in stem cells; and illustrates the mechanism underlying RA-induced chromatin remodeling of Oct4 gene in differentiating cells, in which Pml plays a critical role.

The classical PKC isoforms alpha and beta generally support survival signaling and have emerged as important targets for anti-cancer therapy. Enzastaurin is a PKC beta inhibitor and is in clinical trials for lymphomas, gliomas, and lung cancer. Presently, it is not known if enzastaurin could be effective against AML. In the current study, we found that high dose enzastaurin was found to promote apoptosis in the AML-derived cell lines and in blast cells from AML patients. The mechanism of cell death, however, likely does not involve PKC beta as another PKC beta inhibitor was not toxic to AML cell lines and did not promote enzastaurin-induced cell killing. While enzastaurin is fairly specific for PKC beta, the agent can inhibit other PKC isoforms at higher concentrations. Enzastaurin was effective at inhibiting PKC alpha phosphorylation and membrane localization in the AML cell lines and suppressed phosphorylation of BCL2. Furthermore, enzastaurin suppressed activation of ERK (which can be activated by PKC alpha). Analysis of the serine/threonine phosphorylation profile in HL60 cells after enzastaurin treatment revealed that the drug inhibits the phosphorylation of a distinct set of proteins while promoting phosphorylation of another set of proteins. This suggests the drug may regulate multiple signaling pathways. Taken together, these findings suggest that enzastaurin could be effective in the therapy of AML.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['NIHMS378352'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In view of the significance of the type I interferon pathway in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), this study was undertaken to investigate a possible association between SPI1 polymorphisms and SLE. METHODS: A case-control association study was performed using 6 tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as well as a SNP located upstream of SPI1 previously found to be associated with acute myelogenous leukemia, in 400 Japanese patients with SLE and 450 healthy controls. Resequencing of all exons and known regulatory regions was performed to identify functional polymorphisms. Association of genotype and SPI1 expression was examined using the GENEVAR database and reporter assays. RESULTS: A significant association was detected in 2 SNPs in intron 2 (rs10769258 and rs4752829) (P = 0.005 and P = 0.008, respectively, under the dominant model). The association was stronger in patients with nephropathy. Resequencing identified a potentially functional polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR), rs1057233, which was in strong linkage disequilibrium with the SNPs in intron 2. The number of risk alleles at rs1057233 was strongly correlated with SPI1 messenger RNA (mRNA) level in the database analysis (P = 0.0002), and was confirmed by a reporter assay. Interestingly, rs1057233 alters a target sequence for microRNA hsa-miR-569 (miR-569). Transfection experiments demonstrated that miR-569 inhibits expression of a reporter construct with the 3'-UTR sequence containing the nonrisk allele but not the risk allele. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that a SNP in the 3'-UTR of SPI1 is associated with elevated SPI1 mRNA level and with susceptibility to SLE.",['Copyright (c) 2011 by the American College of Rheumatology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is a strong correlation between certain BCR-ABL1 levels and the cytogenetic response, which means that molecular monitoring may act as a surrogate for cytogenetic response, but only if the BCR-ABL1 values are converted to the international reporting scale. Furthermore, improvements in the limit of BCR-ABL1 detection and reduction of intra-assay variability are ongoing issues of importance for molecular monitoring. Standardization of molecular methods to accurately assess the patient response also remains a challenge, despite the recent certification of international scale reference materials.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence now points to their involvement in the malignant phenotype of transformed cells and heightens their importance for being targeted by different treatments. TAA vary in their nature and pattern of expression and this influences the way therapy is directed towards them. While large numbers of these antigens have been isolated from solid tumours, fewer are linked with haematological malignancies. Those TAA found in this latter group of cancers, referred to as leukaemia-associated antigens (LAA), also appear to have significant potential for promoting the malignant phenotype and have been described in detail in terms of expression and therapy. Interestingly, the action of some of LAA in blood cancers, which are stem cell derived, could act as model for solid tumours, which are increasingly thought to be also derived from a cancer stem cell origin. In this review, TAA and their use in immunotherapy will be discussed. The nature and expression of these antigens will be described together with the events that provide tumours, including haematological cancers, with the ability to avoid immune deletion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first complex, termed the 7SK snRNP, acts as a reservoir where active P-TEFb can be withdrawn by Tat to stimulate HIV-1 transcription. The second complex, termed the super elongation complex (SEC), represents the form of P-TEFb delivered by Tat to the paused RNA polymerase II at the viral long terminal repeat during Tat transactivation. Besides P-TEFb, SEC also contains other elongation factors/co-activators, and they cooperatively stimulate HIV-1 transcription. Recent data also indicate SEC as a target for the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) protein to promote the expression of MLL target genes and leukemogenesis. Given their roles in HIV-1/AIDS and cancer, further characterization of 7SK snRNP and SEC will help develop strategies to suppress aberrant transcriptional elongation caused by uncontrolled P-TEFb activation. As both complexes are also important for normal cellular gene expression, studying their structures and functions will elucidate the mechanisms that control metazoan transcriptional elongation in general.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In biochemical and cellular assays, LY2457546 demonstrates potent activity against targets that include VEGFR2 (KDR), PDGFRbeta, FLT-3, Tie-2 and members of the Eph family of receptors. With activities against both Tie2 and Eph receptors, LY2457546 possesses an activity profile that distinguishes it from multikinase inhibitors. When compared head to head with sunitinib, LY2457546 was more potent for inhibition of endothelial tube formation in an in vitro angiogenesis co-culture model with an intermittent treatment design. In vivo, LY2457546 inhibited VEGF-driven autophosphorylation of lung KDR in the mouse and rat in a dose and concentration dependent manner. LY2457546 was well tolerated and exhibited efficacy in a 13762 syngeneic rat mammary tumor model in both once and twice daily continuous dosing schedules and in mouse human tumor xenograft models of lung, colon, and prostate origin. Additionally, LY2457546 caused complete regression of well-established tumors in an acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) FLT3-ITD mutant xenograft tumor model. The observed efficacy that was displayed by LY2457546 in the AML FLT3-ITD mutant tumor model was superior to sunitinib when both were evaluated using equivalent doses normalized to in vivo inhibition of pKDR in mouse lung. LY2457546 was well tolerated in non-clinical toxicology studies conducted in rats and dogs. The majority of the toxicities observed were similar to those observed with other multi-targeted anti-angiogenic kinase inhibitors (MAKs) and included bone marrow hypocellularity, hair and skin depigmentation, cartilage dysplasia and lymphoid organ degeneration and necrosis. Thus, the unique spectrum of target activity, potent in vivo anti-tumor efficacy in a variety of rodent and human solid tumor models, exquisite potency against a clinically relevant model of AML, and non-clinical safety profile justify the advancement of LY2457546 into clinical testing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Invest New Drugs. 2012 Jun;30(3):1270-1'],,,,,,,

PTEN protein plays an important role in regulating proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and migration of many cancer cells. PTEN also modulates angiogenesis mediated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) via down-regulating PI3K/Akt pathway in many solid tumors. However, the effects of PTEN on VEGF and VEGFR1 (FLT1)-mediated angiogenesis, migration, invasion of leukemia cells, and its clinical significance are still unknown in myeloid leukemia. Therefore, we investigated the effect of PTEN on PI3K/Akt and VEGF/FLT1 pathways by transfecting wild-type PTEN gene to induce high expression of wild-type PTEN gene and protein in chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 cells. We also observed the correlation between the expression levels of PTEN and VEGF/FLT1 and its clinical significance in myeloid leukemia patients. We found that the expression reconstitution of wild-type PTEN had significant effect on inhibiting proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities of K562 cells via down-regulation of Akt phosphorylation and inhibition of VEGF/FLT1 expression. In myeloid leukemia patients, a negative correlation was found between the expression level of PTEN mRNA and that of VEGF and FLT1 mRNA. Down-regulation of PTEN expression accompanied by up-regulation of VEGF and FLT1 mRNA indicated a higher tendency of extramedullary disease in acute myeloid leukemia patients. In conclusion, PTEN could modulate the function of VEGF/VEGFR signaling pathway down-regulation of Akt phosphorylation and that PTEN would be a candidate target to be addressed for inhibiting angiogenesis along with the treatment of myeloid leukemia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most common HIV-associated lymphomas include Burkitt lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (that often involves the CNS), primary effusion lymphoma, and plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL). Of these, PBL is relatively uncommon and displays a distinct affinity for presentation in the oral cavity. In this manuscript we report a previously undescribed primary leptomeningeal form of PBL in a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. A 40-year-old HIV positive man presented with acute onset confusion, emesis, and altered mental status. Lumbar puncture showed numerous nucleated cells with atypical plasmocyte predominance. CSF flowcytometry showed kappa restriction with CD8 and CD38 positivity and negative lymphocyte markers, while the MRI showed diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement. As the extensive systemic work-up failed to reveal any disease outside the brain, an en bloc diagnostic brain and meningeal biopsy was performed. The biopsy specimen showed sheets of plasmacytoid cells with one or more large nuclei, prominent nuclear chromatin, scattered mitoses, and abundant cytoplasm, highly suggestive of plasmablastic lymphoma. HIV-associated malignancies have protean and often confusing presentations, which pose diagnostic difficulties posed to the practicing neurological-surgeons. Even in cases where an infectious cause is suspected for the meningeal enhancement, neoplastic involvement should be considered, and cytology and flow-cytometry should be routinely ordered on the CSF samples.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the case of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the juxtamembrane (named ITD for internal tandem duplication) and TKD Flt3 mutants differ in their spectra of clinical outcomes. Although the mechanism of aberrant activation has been largely elucidated by biochemical and structural analyses of mutant kinases, the differences in disease presentation cannot be attributed to a change in substrate specificity or signaling strength of the catalytic domain.

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) have been reported to be promising therapeutic targets for treating AML. However, HDAC family members that are involved in chemotherapy sensitivities remain unknown. In this study, we sought to identify members of the HDAC family that are involved in cytarabine sensitivities, and to select the optimal HDACI that is most efficacious when combined with cytarabine for treating children with AML. METHODOLOGY: Expression profiles of classes I, II, and IV HDACs in 4 pediatric AML cell lines were determined by Western blotting. Inhibition of class I HDACs by different HDACIs was measured post immnunoprecipitation. Individual down-regulation of HDACs in pediatric AML cells was performed with lentiviral shRNA. The effects of cytarabine and HDACIs on apoptosis were determined by flow cytometry analysis. RESULTS: Treatments with structurally diverse HDACIs and HDAC shRNA knockdown experiments revealed that down-regulation of both HDACs 1 and 6 is critical in enhancing cytarabine-induced apoptosis in pediatric AML, at least partly mediated by Bim. However, down-regulation of HDAC2 may negatively impact cytarabine sensitivities in the disease. At clinically achievable concentrations, HDACIs that simultaneously inhibited both HDACs 1 and 6 showed the best anti-leukemic activities and significantly enhanced cytarabine-induced apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Our results further confirm that HDACs are bona fide therapeutic targets for treating pediatric AML and suggest that pan-HDACIs may be more beneficial than isoform-specific drugs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This involves both Trisomy 21 mosaicism occurring in the germ line and Trisomy 21 mosaicism documented in different somatic tissues, or indeed a combination of both in the same subjects. Information on the incidence of Trisomy 21 mosaicism in different tissue samples from people with clinical features of Down syndrome as well as in the general population is, however, still limited. One of the main reasons for this lack of detailed knowledge is the technological problem of its identification, where in particular low grade/cryptic Trisomy 21 mosaicism, i.e. occurring in less than 3-5% of the respective tissues, can only be ascertained by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) methods on large cell populations from the different tissue samples.In this review we summarize current knowledge in this field with special reference to the question on the likely incidence of germinal and somatic Trisomy 21 mosaicism in the general population and its mechanisms of origin. We also highlight the reproductive and clinical implications of this type of aneuploidy mosaicism for individual carriers. We conclude that the risk of begetting a child with Trisomy 21 Down syndrome most likely is related to the incidence of Trisomy 21 cells in the germ line of any carrier parent. The clinical implications for individual carriers may likewise be dependent on the incidence of Trisomy 21 in the relevant somatic tissues. Remarkably, for example, there are indications that Trisomy 21 mosaicism will predispose carriers to conditions such as childhood leukemia and Alzheimer's Disease but there is on the other hand a possibility that the risk of solid cancers may be substantially reduced.",,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's Disease."", 'Trisomy 21', 'cancer', 'childhood leukemia', 'fetus', 'germ line', 'mosaicism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Microarray-based transcriptional profiling of circulating CLL cells was carried out before and after the first infusion of SPC2996 in 18 patients. Statistically significant transcriptomic changes were observed at doses >/=4 mg/kg and occurred as early as 24 h after the first infusion of the oligonucleotide. SPC2996 induced the upregulation of 466 genes including a large number of immune response and apoptotic regulator molecules, which were enriched for Toll-like receptor response genes. Serum measurements confirmed the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines including chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3 (macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, thereby validating the in vivo transcriptomic data at the protein level. SPC2996 caused a >/=50% reduction of circulating lymphocytes in five of 18 (28%) patients, which was found to be independent of its immunostimulatory and anti-Bcl-2 effects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, regulation of NK cell response to G-CSF remains unclear. This study assayed G-CSF effects in both HSCT donors and NK-92MI cells. The donors who received G-CSF had significantly decreased NK cell cytotoxicity. Levels of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and phosphorylated (p)-Akt, but not mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), were downregulated in NK cells from G-CSF-injected donors. G-CSF also decreased cytotoxicity without affecting viability and NF-kappaB of NK-92MI cells. PI3K and p-ERK expression were also decreased in G-CSF-treated NK-92MI cells, and their inhibitors, wortmannin and PD98059, respectively, both enhanced the downregulation of cytotoxicity. These effects were accompanied by decreased expression of a cytotoxicity-related gene, triosephosphate isomerase (TPI). Wortmannin, but not PD98059, enhanced the downregulation of TPI in G-CSF-treated NK-92MI cells, indicating a correlation between PI3K and TPI. We conclude that G-CSF-impaired NK cell cytotoxicity may accompany PI3K/Akt signaling. The effect is transient and NK cells may recover after G-CSF clearance, suggesting that G-CSF-mobilized HSCT may benefit both acute GVHD prevention and late-phase GVL promotion in HSCT recipients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even the newest antineoplastic agents have demonstrated limitations in their efficacy. For this reason, further research of new compounds must be done. New pharmacological properties can be obtained from a great diversity botanical species. Among these products, Magnolia Grandiflora receives our attention since it mainly contains Honokiol which had demonstrated effect against B-CLL cells activating different cell death pathways. AIM: To test the ability of Magnolia Grandiflora extracts to induce apoptosis of B-CLL cells in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Herb's extraction: Twenty grams of powdered material were submitted to three consecutives decoctions with 500 ml of distilled water (96 degrees C), filtered and followed by ultrafiltration with cellulose membrane, lyophilized and reconstituted in AIM-V medium at a final concentration of 10 mg/ml solution. B-CLL chlorambucil-resistant cells were separated and cultivated in the presence of Magnolia's extract. Samples of cells were taken from the cultures at 24, 48 and 72 h for apoptosis analysis by flow cytometry measuring positive annexin V (0.1 mug/ml) cells. STATISTICS: Apoptosis values were represented by the mean plus or minus SD (+/- SD) for five independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t-test. A P value of 0.05 or less was considered as significant. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: This article discusses the apoptosis properties of Magnolia on B-CLL cells. The evidence suggests a potentially effective repertoire for B-CLL treatment. This herb extract might have promising therapy strategies in treating B-CLL or other hematological disease resistant to alkylating agents in clinical practice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the basis of previous analyses of T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement patterns, we hypothesized that some late recurrences of T-ALL might in fact represent second leukemias. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 22 patients with T-ALL who had late relapses (at least 2.5 years from diagnosis), we studied TCR gene rearrangement status at first and second presentation, NOTCH1 gene mutations, and the presence of the SIL-TAL1 gene fusion. We performed genome-wide copy number and homozygosity analysis by using oligonucleotide- and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) -based arrays. RESULTS: We found evidence of a common clonal origin between diagnosis and relapse in 14 patients (64%). This was based on concordant TCR gene rearrangements (12 patients) or concordant genetic aberrations, as revealed by genome-wide copy number analysis (two patients). In the remaining eight patients (36%), TCR gene rearrangement sequences had completely changed between diagnosis and relapse, and gene copy number analysis showed markedly different patterns of genomic aberrations, suggesting a second T-ALL rather than a resurgence of the original clone. Moreover, NOTCH1 mutation patterns were different at diagnosis and relapse in five of these eight patients. In one patient with a second T-ALL, SNP analysis revealed a germline del(11)(p12;p13), a known recurrent aberration in T-ALL.

This study evaluated the implementation of a geriatric assessment tool in the cooperative group setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients age >/= 65 with cancer, who enrolled on cooperative group cancer trials, were eligible to enroll on Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 360401. They completed a geriatric assessment tool before initiation of protocol therapy, consisting of valid and reliable geriatric assessment measures which are primarily self-administered and require minimal resources and time by healthcare providers. The assessment measures functional status, comorbidity, cognitive function, psychological state, social support, and nutritional status. The protocol specified criteria for incorporation of the tool in future cooperative group trials was based on the time to completion and percent of patients who could complete their portion without assistance. Patient satisfaction with the tool was captured. RESULTS: Of the 93 patients who enrolled in this study, five (5%) met criteria for cognitive impairment and three did not complete the cognitive screen, leaving 85 assessable patients (median age, 72 years). The median time to complete the geriatric assessment tool was 22 minutes, 87% of patients (n = 74) completed their portion without assistance, 92% (n = 78) were satisfied with the questionnaire length, 95% (n = 81) reported no difficult questions, and 96% (n = 82) reported no upsetting questions. One hundred percent of health care professionals completed their portion. CONCLUSION: This brief, primarily self-administered geriatric assessment tool met the protocol specified criteria for inclusion in future cooperative group clinical trials.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We surveyed a population-based cohort of leukemia, bladder, and colorectal cancer survivors diagnosed 2 to 5 years previously in northern California (N = 623; participation rate, 69.2%; overall response rate, 49.2%). Data were collected between April 2003 and November 2004. Ten scales assessed survivors' perceptions of different aspects of care in the last 12 months, and an eleventh scale measured their overall ratings of care. RESULTS: On nine of the 11 scales, mean scores ranged from 88 to 97 on a 0 to 100 response format, indicating very positive experiences. The two areas where quality perceptions were lower were discussions about health promotion and the physician's knowledge of the whole patient. In adjusted analyses, those without private health insurance (P = .02) and Hispanic and Asian survivors compared with whites (P < .001) reported worse timeliness of care. Survivors who had multiple comorbidities reported better scores on timeliness of care (P < .01) and physicians' knowledge (P = .05) than survivors without any comorbidity. Length of the patient-physician relationship was the variable most consistently found to be significantly associated with survivors' quality assessments. Physicians' information exchange had the strongest relationship with overall ratings of care, followed by physicians' affective behavior, their knowledge of the survivor, and survivors' perceptions of coordination of care (P < .001 for all). CONCLUSION: Delivery of quality follow-up care to cancer survivors may require efforts to improve patient-centered communication and coordination. Special emphasis may need to be placed on health promotion discussions and adoption of a whole-person orientation.",,,,,,,,['J Urol. 2011 Dec;186(6):2349. PMID: 22078617'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have identified a previously unrecognized downstream effect of FLT3 activation, namely up-regulation of the homeodomain genes, DLX1 and DLX2. DESIGN AND METHODS: MV4;11 cells with FLT3-internal tandem duplication mutation, RS4;11 cells with wild-type FLT3 and blasts from patients with acute myeloid leukemia were used to pursue the relation between FLT3, DLX1/2 and transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta). Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, western blot and reverse-phase protein array were performed to detect changes in gene and protein expression. RNA interference and MTS assays were used to study the interaction of PKC412, FLT3 inhibitor and TGFbeta1. RESULTS: A direct relationship between FLT3 activity and DLX1/2 expression was revealed by both inhibition and up-regulation of FLT3 signaling in MV4;11 and RS4;11 cell lines, respectively, in isolated blast cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia, and in reverse-phase protein array assays of samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Mechanistically, the link between FLT3 and DLX1 expression appears to involve MAPK signaling through the ERK and JNK pathways. To determine whether elevated DLX1 had a functional consequence, we explored the reported inhibition by DLX1 on TGFbeta/Smad signaling. Indeed, TGFbeta responses were blunted by FLT3 activation in a DLX1-dependent manner and FLT3 inhibition resulted in a time-dependent increase in nuclear phospho-Smad2. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that alterations in DLX1/2 contribute to the biological consequences of FLT3 activation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Once chosen, drug interactions should be evaluated for all patients. New drugs are being studied to prevent disease progression and for patients with T315I mutations.

CD1d-restricted invariant NKT (iNKT) cells are innate-like, lipid-reactive T lymphocytes controlling infections, cancer, and autoimmunity. Adult mature iNKT cells are divided in two functionally distinct CD4(+) and CD4(-) subsets that express the NK receptor CD161 and derive from thymic CD4(+)CD161(-) precursors. We investigated iNKT cell reconstitution dynamics in 33 pediatric patients given hHSCT for hematological malignancies, with a follow-up reaching 6 y posttransplantation, and correlated their emergence with disease relapse. iNKT cells fully reconstitute and rapidly convert into IFN-gamma-expressing effectors in the 25 patients maintaining remission. CD4(+) cells emerge earlier than the CD4(-) ones, both displaying CD161(-) immature phenotypes. CD4(-) cells expand more slowly than CD4(+) cells, though they mature with significantly faster kinetics, reaching full maturation by 18 mo post-hHSCT. Between 4 and 6 y post-hHSCT, mature CD4(-) iNKT cells undergo a substantial expansion burst, resulting in a CD4(+)<CD4(-) NKT cell ratio similar to that found in healthy adults. In contrast with patients maintaining remission, iNKT cells failed to reconstitute in all eight patients experiencing disease relapse. These findings define the peripheral dynamics of human iNKT cells and suggest a contribution of these cells to maintain remission, possibly via early IFN-gamma provision. Adoptive transfer of donor-derived iNKT cells into HLA-haploidentical patients failing to reconstitute these cells might represent a novel therapeutic option to prevent leukemia recurrence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, the cells presented reduction of surface CXCR3 chemokine receptor expression and IFN-gamma production. In this study, to confirm that these findings are suitable for clinical translation, surface CXCR3 and IFN-gamma expression were analyzed using freshly isolated human CD4(+) T cells derived from healthy donors and patients with pleural plaque (PP) or MM. The results revealed that CXCR3 and IFN-gamma expression in the ex vivo model were reduced in some cases. Additionally, CXCR3 expression in CD4(+) T cells from PPs and MMs was significantly reduced compared with that from healthy donors, and CD4(+) T cells from patients with MMs exhibited a marked reduction in IFN-gamma mRNA levels after stimulation in vitro. Moreover, CD4(+)CXCR3(+) T cells in lymphocytes from MMs showed a tendency for an inverse correlation with its ligand CXCL10/IP10 in plasma.

Here we examined whether trophoblast invasion is affected by decidual differentiation of endometrial stromal cells (ESC) and modulated locally by cytokines and growth factors. Trophoblast spheroids were generated from the EVT-derived cell line AC-1M88 and placed onto monolayers of either undifferentiated or decidualized ESC, or directly onto tissue culture surface. Co-cultures were treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF), hepatocyte growth factor, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Expansion of spheroids over 2-3 days was significantly enhanced by a monolayer of undifferentiated ESC compared with tissue culture surface and further increased if ESC had been decidualized. HB-EGF and IL-1beta, alone or in combination with LIF, stimulated spheroid expansion but only on undifferentiated ESC. CEACAM1, an adhesion molecule implicated in trophoblast invasion, was up-regulated in AC-1M88 cells by conditioned medium from decidualized ESC, and by HB-EGF, IL-1beta and LIF in combination. Treatment of ESC with HB-EGF or IL-1beta increased the level of the tetraspanin CD82, a metastasis suppressor found in decidual cells at the implantation site. We suggest that decidualized ESC support trophoblast invasion by paracrine signals that may include HB-EGF, IL-1beta and LIF.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: A total of 25 subjects were assessed after receiving HSCT until discharge. The Japanese Cancer Fatigue Scale and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory were used to assess fatigue and anxiety. Relationships of fatigue and anxiety status respective to walking ability variables: leg muscle strength (knee extension, ankle plantar flexion and ankle dorsiflexion strength) and average number of daily steps, and physical condition variables (food intake, febrile days, body mass index, and serum albumin) were examined with correlations and stepwise multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: Subjects with later achievement of adequate food intake after HSCT (beta = 0.62) and weaker knee extension strength per body mass at discharge (beta = -0.42) reported higher fatigue (adjusted R(2) = 0.53, p = 0.00). Knee extension strength per body mass at discharge was correlated with an average step-count from 51 to 80 days after HSCT (r = 0.51, p = 0.01). In subjects whose Body Mass Index was above 23.5, weaker ankle dorsiflexion strength per body mass prior to transplantation reported higher fatigue at discharge (adjusted R(2) = 0.97, p = 0.00). Subjects with later achievement of food intake after HSCT (beta = 0.59) and more days with fever reported higher anxiety (adjusted R(2) = 0.47, p = 0.00). CONCLUSION: Post-HSCT fatigue was affected by a delay in adequate food intake and diminished muscle strength. The results of this study show the importance of encouraging walking for maintaining muscle endurance.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it remains unclear how integrated retroviral promoter activity is influenced by the upstream or downstream sequences and how the host cell phenotype is influenced by the integrated promoter activity. Herein, we analyzed a set of pre-B lymphoma clones in which the MLV genome was integrated into the signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 5a (Stat5a) gene. Among the clones, the lymphoma clones with a provirus integrating into the middle position of the palindromic target sequences showed significantly higher transcription of the Stat5a gene; and p300 and other transcriptional factors formed complexes, with binding to the proviral-host junctional DNA segment. By using a luciferase assay, the upstream and downstream sequences of the provirus contributed to the up-regulation of proviral promoter activity. In concomitance with the higher Stat5a transcription, the immunoglobulin gene recombination was arrested. Antiapoptotic activity was significantly higher, with an increase in Bcl-xL, one of the targets of STAT5A, when IL-7 was supplied. Thus, a minute difference between MLV integration sites can lead to large differences in the host phenotype through the formation of transcription factor complexes on the proviral-host junctional DNA segment, suggesting that caution is necessary in monitoring integration sites when working with MLV vectors.","['Copyright (c) 2011 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

The mechanisms of tumor progression underlying the clinical behavior of HNSCC remain unclear. CD44 comprises a family of transmembrane receptors that can give rise to multiple CD44 variant isoforms. Hyaluronan (HA), a major extracellular matrix component is the primary ligand for CD44 receptors. HA and CD44 signaling play an important role in HNSCC progression. Several CD44 variant isoforms (including v3-, v6-, and v10-containing isoforms) are associated with advanced disease, possibly through unique growth factor interactions with binding domains in the inserted variant regions of the cytoplasmic domain of CD44. In HNSCC, HA mediates the formation of a complex including CD44 and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) which is overexpressed in a large proportion of HNSCCs. Downstream effectors under EGFR regulation are activated, promoting promote cell growth and tumor survival. The leukemia-associated Rho-guanine nucleotide exchange factor (LARG) also associates with CD44 and EGFR to promote several Ras and RhoA pathway effectors, leading to cell migration, growth, and tumor survival. The secretion of matrix metalloproteinases, necessary for tumor cell invasion, is also regulated by these HA/CD44-mediated pathways. Finally, EGFR-mediated pathways play major roles in the HA/CD44 promotion of chemoresistance in HNSCC.

The induction of P-glycoprotein expression that occurred in response to adriamycin treatment was accompanied by increased phosphorylation of BCR-ABL and STAT5, as well as increased telomerase protein expression. Intriguingly, a ChIP assay using an anti-STAT5 antibody revealed direct binding of STAT5 to the promoter regions of both the human TERT gene and the MDR1 gene in K562-ADM cells. Conversely, silencing of endogenous STAT5 expression by siRNA significantly reduced both the expression of P-glycoprotein and telomerase activity and resulted in the recovery of the imatinib sensitivity of K562-ADM cells. These findings indicate a critical role for STAT5 in the induction of P-glycoprotein and in the modulation of telomerase activity in drug-resistant CML cells. Furthermore, primary leukemic cells obtained from patients in blast crisis showed increased levels of phospho-STAT5, P-glycoprotein and telomerase. In contrast, none of these proteins were detectable in the cells obtained from patients in the chronic phase. Together, these findings indicate a novel mechanism that contributes toward multidrug resistance involving STAT5 as a sensor for cytotoxic drugs in CML patients.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We validated the Illumina HumanHap550 BeadChip array for clinical use by analyzing 127 pediatric leukemia and lymphoma samples that had previously been characterized by means of standard cytogenetic analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization. A higher resolution Illumina HumanHap610 BeadChip array was ultimately used for clinical testing. To date, 180 samples from children with a suspected or confirmed hematologic malignancy have been analyzed. Of the 180 clinical samples, 130 (72%) bone marrow or lymphoma specimens had aberrations revealed by the array that were not seen in the karyotypes. These typically included deletions in genes associated with B- or T-cell malignancies, such as CDKN2A/B, PAX5, and IKZF1. There were also 75 regions of copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity (>5 Mb threshold) detected in 49 samples in this cohort, which could be categorized as constitutional or acquired abnormalities.

Although there is no cure for CLL, the disease is treatable and current standard chemotherapy regimens have been shown to prolong survival. There is no obvious survival advantage to early treatment versus observation but the timing as to when a patient will require treatment is highly unpredictable. Thus, there has been great interest in identifying prognostic markers that can be used to distinguish those patients who may have an aggressive form of CLL and might benefit from early intervention. While clinical staging systems have been used to stratify patients into risk categories, they lack the ability to predict disease progression or response to therapy. Recent advances in our understanding of the biology of CLL have led to the identification of numerous cellular and molecular markers with potential prognostic and therapeutic significance. This review provides a concise overview of prognostic markers in CLL and a discussion of how those markers have impacted the clinical management of the disease.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical success of the targeted agent Imatinib mesylate as an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase associated with the breakpoint cluster region-Abelson oncogene locus (BCR-ABL) in the treatment of Philadelphia-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) has served as a paradigm. While intellectually gratifying, the selective targeting of a single driver event by a small molecule, e.g., kinase inhibitor, to dampen a tumor-promoting pathway in the treatment of solid tumors is limited by many factors. Focus can alternatively be placed on targeting fundamental cellular processes that regulate multiple events, e.g., protein degradation, through the Ubiquitin (Ub)+Proteasome System (UPS). The UPS plays a critical role in modulating numerous cellular proteins to regulate cellular processes such as signal transduction, growth, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Clinical success with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib revolutionized treatment of B-cell lineage malignancies such as Multiple Myeloma (MM). However, many patients harbor primary resistance and do not respond to bortezomib and those that do respond inevitably develop resistance (secondary resistance). The lack of clinical efficacy of proteasome inhibitors in the treatment of solid tumors may be linked mechanistically to the resistance detected during treatment of hematologic malignancies. Potential mechanisms of resistance and means to improve the response to proteasome inhibitors in solid tumors are discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we show that RAD18 binds FANCD2 and is required for efficient monoubiquitylation and chromatin localization of both FANCD2 and FANCI. Human RAD18-knockout cells display increased sensitivity to mitomycin C and a delay in FANCD2 foci formation compared with their wild-type counterparts. In addition, RAD18-knockout cells display a unique lack of FANCD2 and FANCI localization to chromatin in exponentially growing cells. FANCD2 ubiquitylation is normal in cells containing a ubiquitylation-resistant form of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and chromatin loading of FA core complex proteins appears normal in RAD18-knockout cells. Mutation of the RING domain of RAD18 ablates the interaction with and chromatin loading of FANCD2. These data suggest a key role for the E3 ligase activity of RAD18 in the recruitment of FANCD2 and FANCI to chromatin and the events leading to their ubiquitylation during S phase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because telomere length has been reported to be a valuable prognosis criteria, there is a great interest in a deep understanding of the origin and consequences of telomere dysfunction in this pathology. Cases of chromosome fusion involving extremely short telomeres have been reported at advanced stage. In the present study, we address the question of the existence of early telomere dysfunction during the B-CLL time course. In a series restricted to 23 newly diagnosed Binet stage A CLL patients compared with 12 healthy donors, we found a significant increase in recruitment of DNA-damage factors to telomeres showing telomere dysfunction in the early stage of the disease. Remarkably, the presence of dysfunctional telomeres did not correlate with telomere shortening or chromatin marks deregulation but with a down-regulation of 2 shelterin genes: ACD (coding for TPP1; P = .0464) and TINF2 (coding for TIN2; P = .0177). We propose that telomeric deprotection in the early step of CLL is not merely the consequence of telomere shortening but also of shelterin alteration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated in vivo changes of these proteins with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four core biopsies were taken from 100 breast cancer patients at baseline, during and upon completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Immunohistochemical expression of these proteins were evaluated and correlated with clinicopathological features, clinical response and progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: There was a statistically significant change from positivity to negativity in COX-2 expression with chemotherapy (P = 0.002), predominantly in clinical responders (P = 0.002). COX-2-positive tumours that remained positive had shorter PFS than those that turned negative. Estrogen receptor (ER)+ and COX-2+ tumours at baseline that remained COX-2+ fared worse than those that became COX-2 negative (PFS 27 versus 52 months, P = 0.002). No significant changes in IHC expression were observed for ER, progesterone receptor, ErbB2, EGFR, p53 or Ki67. CONCLUSIONS: Chemotherapy induced change in COX-2 expression from positivity to negativity predominantly among clinical responders and is associated with longer PFS. Interaction between COX-2 and ER was observed, suggesting that some hormone receptor-positive patients may benefit from combining COX-2 inhibition with hormonal therapy.",,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00212082'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All the patients were conditioned with cyclophosphamide and busulfan, and treated with cyclosporin (CsA)/methotrexate (MTX)/mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Eleven of these 15 patients (73.3%) achieved complete hematologic response to pre-transplant imatinib, and six (40%) achieved a cytogenetic response. No engraftment failure was observed and the early transplant-related mortality was only 6.7%. Grade 3/4 acute GVHD occurred in 13.3% of patients. Chronic GVHD was observed in 61.5%, including 23.1% suffered from extensive disease. The 5-year estimated rates of relapse, transplant-related mortality and overall survival were 21.0+/-10.8% 13.7+/-10.8% and 66.0+/-12.4%, respectively. Ten (66.7%) of 15 patients are alive with complete molecular remission, even after a median follow-up of 25 months after withdrawal of imatinib. In conclusion, even CML in advanced phases may have a satisfactory outcome after myeloablative allo-HSCT combined with imatinib, which may provide good remission prior to transplantation and reduce relapse risk, with low toxicity.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2011 Feb 25.,,,,Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a heterogeneous disease comprising several clinico-biological entities. Karyotyping of leukemic cells identifies recurrent chromosome rearrangements. These are usually translocations that activate genes encoding transcription factor regulating B- or T-cell differentiation. Gene expression-array confirms the prognostic relevance of ALL subgroups identified by specific chromosomal rearrangements and isolates new subgroups. Analysis of genomic copy number changes and high throughput sequencing reveal new cryptic deletions. The challenge is now to understand how these cooperative genetic lesions interact in order to have the molecular rationales needed to select new therapeutic targets and to develop and combine inhibitors with high levels of anti-leukemic specificity.

Different cell types within complex organs are often characterised by means of genome-wide gene expression profiling, but analogous information for early developmental as well as adult stem and progenitor cells is largely missing because their identity is commonly unknown or they are present in prohibitively small numbers. Here we show that maximum parsimony approaches previously used to reconstruct evolutionary trees from gene content of extant species can be adapted to reconstruct cellular hierarchies both during development and steady state homeostasis of complex mammalian tissues. Using haematopoiesis as a model, we show that developmental trees reconstructed from expression profiles of mature cells are not only consistent with current experimentally validated trees but also have predictive value in determining progenitor cell specific transcriptional programmes and lineage determining transcription factors. Subsequent analysis across diverse developmental systems such as neuronal development and endoderm organogenesis demonstrated that maximum parsimony-based reconstruction of developmental trees represents a widely applicable approach to infer developmental pathways as well as the transcriptional control mechanisms underlying cell fate specification.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Next-generation deep pyrosequencing, principally, allows for the highly sensitive detection of molecular mutations. However, standard 454 chemistry laboratory procedures lack efficient amplification of guanine-cytosine (GC)-rich amplicons during the emulsion PCR (emPCR) steps allowing direct massively parallel clonal amplification of PCR products. To solve this problem, we investigated six distinct emPCR conditions. The coding sequence of CEBPA was subdivided into four overlapping amplicons: GC content for amplicon 1, 74%; amplicon 2, 76%; amplicon 3, 77%; and amplicon 4, 69%. A new emPCR condition, improving the standard titanium assay, presents a robust solution to sequence amplicons with a GC content of up to 77%. Moreover, this assay was subsequently tested on a larger independent cohort of 23 AML patients. For each patient, a median of 737 reads was generated (coverage range, 397-fold to 1194-fold) and therefore allowed a robust detection of insertions, deletions, and point mutations. In conclusion, next-generation amplicon sequencing enables the highly sensitive detection of molecular mutations and is a feasible assay for routine assessment of GC-rich content amplicons.","['Copyright (c) 2011 American Society for Investigative Pathology and the', 'Association for Molecular Pathology.

Previous studies have shown that oncogenic H-Ras can induce proliferative arrest or senescence, depending on the cellular context. Here, we show that deregulated H-Ras activity can also lead to caspase-independent cell death with features of autophagy. Ras-induced autophagy was associated with upregulation of the BH3-only protein Noxa as well as the autophagy regulator Beclin-1. Silencing of Noxa or Beclin-1 expression reduced Ras-induced autophagy and increased clonogenic survival. Ras-induced cell death was also inhibited by coexpression of Bcl-2 family members that inhibit Beclin-1 function. Ras-induced autophagy was associated with Noxa-mediated displacement of the Bcl-2 family member, Mcl-1, from Beclin-1. Thus, Ras-induced expression of Noxa and Beclin-1 promotes autophagic cell death, which represents a mechanism to limit the oncogenic potential of deregulated Ras signals.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

STUDY DESIGN: We extracted data on oncology patients 15 to 24 years of age who were discharged from 35 hospitals in the Pediatric Hospital Information System (PHIS) between 2001 and 2008. RESULTS: Of 9721 unique patients, VTE occurred in 511 (5.3%). An elevated OR of VTE occurred in patients 18 to 20 and 21 to 24 years of age (OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.36-2.00 and OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.21-2.32, respectively) compared with that in patients 15 to 17 years old. Patients with leukemia (OR, 5.53; 95% CI, 3.63-8.42) and bone/soft tissue sarcomas (OR, 4.32; 95% CI, 2.80-6.69) had a higher risk of VTE compared with patients with brain tumors. The number of adolescent and young adult oncology admissions to pediatric hospitals increased 31.9%, from 5409 admissions in 2001 to 7134 admissions in 2008. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent and young adult oncology patients, a growing population at pediatric hospitals, experience VTE as a common complication.

Red blood cell transfusions--a conventional treatment of MDS--have been associated with high costs and decreased quality of life compared with transfusion independence. Phase III clinical trial data suggest that decitabine may offer an improved AML-free survival versus best supportive care (BSC), which consists of red blood cell transfusions, deferoxamine, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, platelet transfusions, and colony-stimulating factors. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved a 5-day outpatient decitabine dosing regimen, which might reduce administration costs compared with the standard 3-day inpatient regimen. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of 5-day dosing of decitabine versus BSC in US patients with intermediate- and high-risk MDS from a US payer perspective. METHODS: A Markov model with 3 health states (MDS, AML, and death) was constructed to simulate natural disease progression. The model followed patients in 4-week cycles for </= 5 years. Clinical inputs and patient characteristics were based on decitabine Phase III clinical trial data. Costs of supportive care and adverse events were based on trial resource utilization data. Drug and AML costs were obtained from published sources. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the impact of model parameters on results. RESULTS: In the base-case model, decitabine yielded 0.276 additional year of AML-free survival and 0.052 more quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) compared with BSC. Total decitabine and administration costs over the 5-year time horizon were $28,933. Total direct medical costs were $122,940 in the decitabine arm and $122,666 in the BSC arm. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for decitabine versus BSC was $5277 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses indicated that decitabine had a higher probability than BSC of being cost-effective despite the uncertainty around some model parameters, including survival. CONCLUSION: In this study, decitabine administered on a 5-day dosing schedule was likely a cost-effective treatment option in patients with intermediate- and high-risk MDS from a US payer perspective.","['Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

We examined the temporal and spatial patterning of the leukemia case homes in comparison to the distribution of the general population at risk, other cancer incidence, and features of land use. Leukemia cases were predominantly diagnosed during the early to mid summer, exhibiting a seasonal bias. Leukemia cases lived outside of the ""developed/urban"" area of Fallon, predominantly in the ""agriculture/pasture"" region of Churchill County, circumscribing downtown Fallon. This pattern was different from the distribution of the underlying population (p-value<0.01) and different from the distribution of other cancers, which were evenly distributed when compared to the population (p-value=0.74). The unusual space-time patterning of childhood leukemia is consistent with the involvement of an infectious disease. A possible mode of transmission for such an infectious disease is by means of a vector, and mosquitoes are abundant in Churchill County outside of the urban area of Fallon. This region harbors a US Navy base, and a temporally concordant increase in military wide childhood leukemia rates suggests the base a possible source of the virus.

Central to the hypothesis of XMRV as a human pathogen is the description of integration sites in DNA from prostate tumour tissues. Here we demonstrate that 2 of 14 patient-derived sites are identical to sites cloned in the same laboratory from experimentally infected DU145 cells. Identical integration sites have never previously been described in any retrovirus infection. We propose that the patient-derived sites are the result of PCR contamination. This observation further undermines the notion that XMRV is a genuine human pathogen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the effects of the Src/c-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib on BCR signal transduction in CLL cells. Treatment of CLL cells with 100 nmol/l dasatinib induced apoptosis by an average reduction in viability of 33.7% at 48 h, with dasatinib sensitivity correlating with inhibition of Syk(Y348) phosphorylation. Dasatinib inhibited calcium flux, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation following BCR crosslinking, and blocked the Mcl-1-dependent increase in CLL cell survival on prolonged BCR stimulation. However, the pro-apoptotic effect of dasatinib was abrogated by stromal cell contact alone or in the presence of CD154 and interleukin (IL)-4 (CD154L/IL-4 system). Whilst dasatinib retained the ability to sensitize CLL cells in stromal co-culture to both fludarabine and chlorambucil, the addition of CD154 and IL-4 rendered cells resistant to these drug combinations. We demonstrate that the HSP90 inhibitor 17-DMAG exhibited synergy with dasatinib in vitro, and moreover, induced apoptosis of CLL cells in the CD154L/IL-4 system. Our data provide evidence that dasatinib would be most clinically effective in combination with agents able to target antigen-independent microenvironmental signals.",['(c) 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It accounts for 10 ? 15% of clinically relevant CML mutations. Licensed tyrosine kinase inhibitors are ineffective against this mutation and its development reduces life expectancy of CML in chronic phase from 10 years to just 22 months. Extensive work is ongoing to establish the most effective therapy to overcome this mutation, including the development of novel specific agents and also re-examination of established therapies. AREAS COVERED: This review examines the agents in development, dividing them into Bcr-Abl-dependant and -independent groups. It looks at the progress of this research, updating the reader on the status of agents previously reported and introducing emerging therapeutic possibilities only recently announced. EXPERT OPINION: Development of the T315I mutation is a devastating event for some patients with CML. There are potential therapeutic agents at all stages of the drug development cycle to target this patient subpopulation. Clinical activity has been demonstrated and a number of agents are on the cusp of being licensed and available for use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apoptosis has been shown to be induced in HCC by several agents, including sorafenib as well as by the naturally occurring K vitamins (VKs). As few nontoxic agents have activity against HCC growth, we evaluated the activity of sorafenib and VKs, both independently and together on the growth of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. We found that when VK was combined with sorafenib, the concentration of sorafenib required for growth inhibition was substantially reduced. Conversely, VK enhanced sorafenib effects in several HCC cell lines on growth inhibition. Growth could be inhibited at doses of VK plus sorafenib that were ineffective with either agent alone, using vitamins K1, K2 and K5. Combination of VK1 plus sorafenib induced apoptosis on FACS, TUNEL staining and caspase activation. Phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) levels were decreased as was myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1), an ERK target. Sorafenib alone inhibited growth of transplantable HCC in vivo. At subeffective sorafenib doses in vivo, addition of VK1 caused major tumor regression, with decreased phospho-ERK and Mcl-1 staining. Thus, combination of VK1 plus sorafenib strongly induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in rodent and human HCC and inhibited the RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/ERK pathway. VK1 alone activated PKA, a mediator of inhibitory Raf phosphorylation. Thus, each agent can antagonize Raf: sorafenib as a direct inhibitor and VK1 through inhibitory Raf phosphorylation. As both agents are available for human use, the combination has potential for improving sorafenib effects in HCC.",['Copyright (c) 2010 UICC.'],['NIHMS216122'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other disease features include leukocytosis, splenomegaly, thrombohemorrhagic complications, vasomotor disturbances, pruritus, and a small risk of disease progression into acute leukemia or myelofibrosis. DIAGNOSIS: Diagnosis is based on JAK2 mutation status (PV and ET), serum erythropoietin (Epo) level (PV), and bone marrow histopathology (ET). The presence of a JAK2 mutation and subnormal serum Epo level confirm a diagnosis of PV. Differential diagnosis in ET should include chronic myelogenous leukemia and prefibrotic myelofibrosis. RISK STRATIFICATION: Current risk stratification in PV and ET is designed to estimate the likelihood of thrombotic complications: high-risk-age > 60 years or presence of thrombosis history; low-risk-absence of both of these two risk factors. Presence of extreme thrombocytosis (platelet count > 1,000 x 10(9)/L) might be associated with acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AvWS) and, therefore, risk of bleeding. Risk factors for shortened survival in both PV and ET include age > 60 years, leukocytosis, history of thrombosis, and anemia. RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: Survival is near-normal in ET and reasonably long in PV. The 10-year risk of leukemic/fibrotic transformation is < 1%/1% in ET and < 5%/10% in PV. In contrast, the risk of thrombosis exceeds 20%. The main goal of therapy is therefore to prevent thrombohemorrhagic complications and this is effectively and safely accomplished by the use of low-dose aspirin (PV and ET), phlebotomy (PV), and hydroxyurea (high risk PV and ET). Treatment with busulfan or interferon-a is usually effective in hydroxyurea failures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this meta-analysis was to synthesize current evidence regarding the association between birth weight with primarily the risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), given its similarity to acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and any category of lymphoma. Two cohort (278,751 children) and seven case-control studies (2,660 cases and 69,274 controls) were included. Effects estimates regarding NHL, HL and any lymphoma were appropriately pooled using fixed or random effects model in two separate analyses: specifically, high was compared to normal or any birth weight. Similarly, low was compared to normal or any birth weight. No statistically significant association was found between high birth weight, as compared to normal birth weight, and risk for NHL plus Burkitt lymphoma (OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 0.76-1.80, random effects), HL (OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.64-1.38, fixed effects) or any plus Burkitt lymphoma (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.76-1.56, fixed effects). A null association emerged when low was compared with normal birth weight for NHL plus Burkitt lymphoma (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.71-1.62, random effects), HL (OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.54-1.65, fixed effects) or any plus Burkitt lymphoma (OR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.79-1.33, fixed effects). Accordingly, no association was found when high or low birth weight was compared to any birth weight.

In the present study, we demonstrate that advancing maternal age is independently associated with reduced bone mass in the young adult male offspring. INTRODUCTION: In Sweden the maternal age in both primi- and multipara mothers has steadily increased during the last three decades. It has been previously reported that advancing maternal age increases the risk of fetal death, but also of morbidity in the offspring, such as chromosome abnormalities, leukemia, diabetes mellitus type 1, and schizophrenia. Whether or not maternal age influences peak bone mass has not been reported. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether a high maternal age was associated with lower peak bone mass, as measured using DXA in a large cohort of male offspring [the Gothenburg Osteoporosis and Obesity Determinants study (GOOD)]. METHODS: Through the Swedish multi-generation register, we identified the mothers of 1,009 GOOD study subjects. From the Swedish medical birth register detailed information about the medical circumstances at the time of child birth were obtained, including maternal and offspring anthropometrics (birth height and weight), maternal age, and smoking habits, parity and length of pregnancy. RESULTS: Maternal age was inversely correlated to areal BMD (aBMD) at the total body (r =-0.07, p = 0.03) and the lumbar spine (r =-0.09, p < 0.01). Using a linear regression model (with covariates including current physical activity, smoking, calcium intake, weight, present height and birth height, total body lean and fat mass in the offspring, and length of pregnancy), we found that maternal age negatively independently predicted lumbar spine aBMD (beta =-0.08, p < 0.01) in the male offspring. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our results suggest that advancing maternal age could negatively affect bone mass in young adult men.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2011 Feb 25.,,,,"UNLABELLED: Progress in the care of the hematologic malignancies of childhoond has been one of the proudest success stories in modern pediatrics. The cure rates of these diseases have improved from essentially zero in the 1950's and early 1960's to cure rates that range from 65%-90% in modern centers. While the largest improvements have been made in the most common (and the lower risk subtypes) of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), there has also been significant progress in both the higher risk forms of ALL (i.e. Philadelphia chromosome positive, Ph+ ALL) and in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). This progress has been achieved by the careful and stepwise identification of clinical, cytogenetic, molecular, and most recently response-based prognostic criteria, that now allow oncologists to focus the intensity of the therapy more closely to what is required to cure individual subgroups of patients. CONCLUSION: Pediatricians need to be familiar with the changes in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, because these changes have impact on: the laboratory tests that should be ordered at the time of specialist referral; counseling of patients and their families; and with the advent of ""shared care models"" pediatricians will need to be more involved in the general, supportive, and long-term care of these patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The response to MI-219 is associated with the downregulation of c-Myc and the induction of p21(WAF1). The p53 target and pro-apoptotic proteins PUMA, Noxa and Bax are induced, whereas full length Bid protein decreases with increased activity of pro-apoptotic cleaved Bid, and decrease of Mcl-1 is observed by increased caspase activity. CD95/FAS (FAS antigen) receptor is also induced by MI-219, indicating that both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic responses are transcriptionally induced. In addition, p53 protein accumulates in the mitochondrial fraction of treated cells involved in transcription-independent induction of apoptosis. We conclude that HDM-2 inhibition with MI-219 effectively induces p53-dependent apoptosis in most blast crisis CML cells, with or without BCR-ABL mutation(s).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Besides chemotherapy and radiotherapy, a special focus was laid on targeted therapies such as small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and other immunomodulatory drugs, which have become standard therapies and important combination partners in a variety of malignancies. In contrast to the widely established use of these often anti-angiogenic drugs, many functional molecular mechanisms are yet not completely understood. Recent analyses focused not only on their direct anti-tumor responses, but also on their influence on tumor microenvironment, as well as on their effects on malignant and healthy cells. Different anti-angiogenic compounds targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or platelet-derived growth factor pathways seem to be capable of modulating immune responses, in a positive, as well as apparently harmful manner. For an optimal clinical anti-cancer treatment, a better understanding of these immunomodulatory effects is necessary. Here we summarize recent reports on the immunomodulatory function of lately introduced clinically applied anti-angiogenic compounds, such as the humanized monoclonal antibody against VEGF bevacizumab, the small molecule TKIs sunitinib, sorafenib, imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cumulative incidence of EBV reactivation at 6 months after allo-HSCT defined as an EBV PCR load above 1000 copies of EBV DNA/10(5) cells was 15%, and none of these patients experienced any sign or symptom of LPD. A total of 17 patients, who had EBV DNA levels exceeding 1000 copies/10(5) cells on two or more occasions, were pre-emptively treated with rituximab. With a median follow-up of 655 (range, 92-1542) days post allo-HSCT, there was no statistically significant difference in term of outcome between those patients who experienced an EBV reactivation and those who did not. In multivariate analysis, the use of antithymocyte globulin as part of the RIC regimen was the only independent risk factor associated with EBV reactivation (relative risk=4.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-21.0; P=0.03). We conclude that patients undergoing RIC allo-HSCT using anti-thymocyte globulin as part of the preparative regimen are at higher risk for EBV reactivation.

Integrin(s) are known to be necessary for the transactivation of EGFR. The roles of EGFR and integrin(s) in allergic inflammation were investigated. Antigen stimulation induced activation of EGFR and interaction between EGFR and integrin alpha(5) in Rat Basophilic Leukemia (RBL2H3) cells and bone marrow-derived mouse mast cells (BMMCs). Flow cytometry revealed increased phosphorylation of EGFR on cell surfaces. Antigen stimulation induced interaction between EGFR and FcvarepsilonRI in both RBL2H3 cells and BMMCs. Blocking of EGFR or integrin alpha exerted negative effects on rac1 activity and secretion of beta-hexosaminidase in both RBL2H3 cells and BMMCs. EGFR and integrin alpha(5) were found to be necessary for IgE-dependent cutaneous anaphylaxis. FAK (focal adhesion kinase), interacted with EGFR and with FcvarepsilonRI upon antigen stimulation, and it was necessary for the increased secretion of beta-hexosaminidase in both RBL2H3 cells and BMMCs. EGFR and integrin alpha(5) were necessary for interactions between activated RBL2H3 cells, BMMCs and rat aortic endothelial cells (RAECs). Conditioned medium of antigen-stimulated RBL2H3 cells promoted RAECs tube formation, rat aortic ring formation and blood vessel formation. Conditioned medium of antigen-stimulated BMMCs also had the same effects on RAECs. This enhanced angiogenic potential of RAECs was dependent on EGFR and integrin alpha(5).

In this study, a duplex quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay was developed to detect and quantify avian leukosis virus subgroups A and B (ALVA/B). The assay was optimised to measure viral gp85 and chicken housekeeping (beta-actin) genes. The result showed that the assay was specific for reference strains of ALVA/B subtype and no cross-reaction was detected with ALV subtypes E and J or with four other non-ALV viruses. The assay detected as few as 56 gp85 cDNA copies and was 100-fold more sensitive than a conventional RT-PCR. Seventy clinical blood samples were evaluated by both the qRT-PCR and the conventional RT-PCR assay, and the results show that 65 samples were positive by the qRT-PCR compared with 43 by the conventional RT-PCR. When this assay was used to quantify the viral load in ALV-inoculated embryos from three congenic chicken lines, the embryos from the B21 line showed the highest viral load, whereas the lowest load was found in the B5 line. This assay provides a powerful tool for quantitative detection of the ALVA/B and for the study of host genetic resistance to avian leukosis.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The cell cycle is an essential and tightly regulated four-stage process that effects the accurate duplication and transmission of genetic content to cells' progeny. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are key elements of the mammalian cell cycle machinery. Their activity is normally regulated via cyclin binding, phosphorylation events, and interactions with endogenous CDK inhibitors. Malfunctions in the control of the cell cycle can be specifically countered using pharmacological CDK inhibitors. Importantly, CDK inhibitors are very effective against both rapidly dividing and quiescent cancer cells; this is particularly relevant in the treatment of malignancies such as chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL) and multiple myeloma (MM) that exhibit both a low mitotic index and apoptotic defects. The high efficacy of pharmacological CDK inhibitors against CLL and MM is attributable to their ability to eliminate leukemic cells by apoptosis. Indeed, not only do pharmacological CDK inhibitors block cell cycle progression; they also promote apoptosis and thereby destroy irrevocably malignant cells. This article focuses on the impact of inhibiting individual cellular CDKs on apoptosis. We discuss in detail the molecular mechanisms by which CDK inhibitors are able to bypass chemoresistance in tumor cells and trigger apoptosis. Remarkably, recent findings suggest that the pharmacological utility of CDK inhibitors may not be restricted to the treatment of cancer: some may be efficacious in the treatment of patients with neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For each antigen, evaluation was based on the percentage of positive leukemic cells and the degree of antigen expression by mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) and antibody binding capacity (ABC) that were correlated with age, immunophenotype, and presence/absence of particular molecular markers. We can document that some of the analyzed antigens showed a degree of expression related to the B-cell maturation profile, and that the antigen expression intensity appeared to vary according to the presence of specific genetic markers. These findings suggest that the possible clinical use of a given MoAb in patients with ALL should take into account both the maturation profile of the leukemic cells and the presence of a given molecular transcript.

The estimated occupational inhalation exposure concentrations (ppm) corresponding to specified extra risks of lymphoid mortality to age 70 years in a population of male and female EO workers are based on Cox proportional hazards models of the most recent updated epidemiology cohort mortality studies of EO workers and a standard life-table calculation. An occupational exposure at an inhalation concentration of 2.77 ppm EO is estimated to result in an extra risk of lymphoid mortality of 4 in 10,000 (0.0004) in the combined worker population of men and women from the two studies. The corresponding estimated concentration decreases slightly to 2.27 ppm when based on only the men in the updated cohorts combined.

Laboratory tests revealed hypothyroidism; the patient was euthyroid prior to introduction of nilotinib. After further examination, we attributed this hypothyroidism to nilotinib. His edema regressed dramatically after thyroid hormone replacement therapy, with continued treatment with nilotinib. Laboratory examination of thyroid function also improved markedly. Although sunitinib, a multi-targeted TKI, is associated with a high incidence of hypothyroidism, TKIs targeting Bcr-Abl have rarely been reported to cause hypothyroidism. We report nilotinib-induced hypothyroidism, and suggest that hypothyroidism should be considered as a possible etiology when patients receivingTKIs suffer from edema.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the activation and roles of volume-activated chloride channels under normal isotonic conditions are not clarified, especially in lymphatic cells. In this study, the activation of basal and volume-activated chloride currents and their roles in maintenance of basal cell volume under isotonic conditions were investigated in human acute lymphoblastic leukemia Molt4 cells. The patch-clamp technique and time-lapse image analysis were employed to record whole-cell currents and cell volume changes. Under isotonic conditions, a basal chloride current was recorded. The current was weakly outward-rectified and volume-sensitive and was not inactivated obviously in the observation period. A 47% hypertonic bath solution and the chloride channel blockers NPPB and tamoxifen suppressed the current. Exposure of cells to 47% hypotonic bath solution activated further the basal current. The hypotonicity-activated current possessed properties similar to those of the basal current and was inhibited by NPPB, tamoxifen, ATP and hypertonic bath solution. Furthermore, extracellular hypotonic challenges swelled the cells and induced a regulatory volume decrease (RVD). Extracellular applications of NPPB, tamoxifen and ATP swelled the cells under isotonic conditions and inhibited the RVD induced by hypotonic cell swelling. The results suggest that some volume-activated chloride channels are activated under isotonic conditions, resulting in the appearance of the basal chloride current, which plays an important role in the maintenance of basal cell volume in lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Chloride channels can be activated further to induce a regulatory volume recovery when cells are swollen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ATL cells, which constitutively express CD25, resemble CD25+CD4+ regulatory T cells (T(reg)). Approximately 60% of ATL cases indeed harbor leukemic cells that express FoxP3, a key transcription factor for T(reg) cells. HTLV-1 encodes an antisense transcript, HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ), which is expressed in all ATL cases. In this study, we show that transgenic expression of HBZ in CD4+ T cells induced T-cell lymphomas and systemic inflammation in mice, resembling diseases observed in HTLV-1 infected individuals. In HBZ-transgenic mice, CD4+Foxp3+ T(reg) cells and effector/memory CD4+ T cells increased in vivo. As a mechanism of increased T(reg) cells, HBZ expression directly induced Foxp3 gene transcription in T cells. The increased CD4+Foxp3+ T(reg) cells in HBZ transgenic mice were functionally impaired while their proliferation was enhanced. HBZ could physically interact with Foxp3 and NFAT, thereby impairing the suppressive function of T(reg) cells. Thus, the expression of HBZ in CD4+ T cells is a key mechanism of HTLV-1-induced neoplastic and inflammatory diseases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main target of this study was to address the effects of the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib (BZ) on the maintenance of stem or progenitor cells in hypoxic primary cultures (LC1), by determining the capacity of LC1 cells to repopulate normoxic secondary cultures (LC2) and the kinetics of this repopulation. Unselected K562 cells from day-2 hypoxic LC1 repopulated LC2 with rapid, progenitor-type kinetics; this repopulation was suppressed by BZ addition to LC1 at time 0, but completely resistant to day-1 BZ, indicating that progenitors require some time to adapt to stand hypoxia. K562 cells selected in hypoxic day-7 LC1 repopulated LC2 with stem-type kinetics, which was largely resistant to BZ added at either time 0 or day 1, indicating that hypoxia-selectable stem cells are BZ-resistant per se, i.e. before their selection. Furthermore, these cells were completely resistant to day-6 BZ, i.e. after selection. On the other hand, hypoxia-selected stem cells from CD34-positive cells of blast-crisis CML patients appeared completely resistant to either time-0 or day-1 BZ. To exploit in vitro the capacity of CML cells to adapt to hypoxia enabled to detect a subset of BZ-resistant leukemia stem cells, a finding of particular relevance in light of the fact that our experimental system mimics the physiologically hypoxic environment of bone marrow niches where leukemia stem cells most likely home and sustain minimal residual disease in vivo. This suggests the use of BZ as an enhanced strategy to control CML. in particular to prevent relapse of disease, to be considered with caution and to need further deepening.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The NLS function of BCR-ABL is re-activated by a kinase inhibitor, imatinib, and in a kinase-defective BCR-ABL mutant. The mechanism of this kinase-dependent inhibition of the NLS function is not understood. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By examining the subcellular localization of mutant BCR-ABL proteins under conditions of imatinib and/or leptomycin B treatment to inhibit nuclear export, we have found that mutations of three specific tyrosines (Y232, Y253, Y257, according to ABL-1a numbering) in the kinase domain can inhibit the NLS function of kinase-proficient and kinase-defective BCR-ABL. Interestingly, binding of imatinib to the kinase-defective tyrosine-mutant restored the NLS function, suggesting that the kinase domain conformation induced by imatinib-binding is critical to the re-activation of the NLS function. The C-terminal region of ABL contains an F-actin binding domain (FABD). We examined the subcellular localization of several FABD-mutants and found that this domain is also required for the activated kinase to inhibit the NLS function; however, the binding to F-actin per se is not important. Furthermore, we found that some of the C-terminal deletions reduced the kinase sensitivity to imatinib. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Results from this study suggest that an autophosphorylation-dependent kinase conformation together with the C-terminal region including the FABD imposes a blockade of the BCR-ABL NLS function. Conversely, conformation of the C-terminal region including the FABD can influence the binding affinity of imatinib for the kinase domain. Elucidating the structural interactions among the kinase domain, the NLS region and the FABD may therefore provide insights on the design of next generation BCR-ABL inhibitors for the treatment of CML.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, several computational methods have been proposed to prioritize candidate disease genes by integrating different data types, including sequence information, biomedical literature, and pathway information. Recently, molecular interaction networks have been incorporated to predict disease genes, but most of those methods do not utilize invaluable disease-specific information available in mRNA expression profiles of patient samples. RESULTS: Through the integration of protein-protein interaction networks and gene expression profiles of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, we identified subnetworks of interacting proteins dysregulated in AML and characterized known mutation genes causally implicated to AML embedded in the subnetworks. The analysis shows that the set of extracted subnetworks is a reservoir rich in AML genes reflecting key leukemogenic processes such as myeloid differentiation, CONCLUSION: We showed that the integrative approach both utilizing gene expression profiles and molecular networks could identify AML causing genes most of which were not detectable with gene expression analysis alone due to their minor changes in mRNA.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pathological analysis of the tumor mass showed an infiltrate of immature cells which were positive for CD13, CD33, CD15, CD11b, and CD64, and negative for CD34, CD117, and HLA-DR. The patient achieved complete remission following a 1-week course of chemotherapy, however, 7 months later she developed a second granulocytic sarcoma in the left soleus muscle. The absolute CD4+ count had now reduced to 3 cells/ml with an inversion in the Th/Ts index (0.01), and she died of gram-negative sepsis 1 month later.

We have previously shown that C/EBPalpha or its AML mutants synergize with NF-kappaB p50 to activate antiapoptotic genes, including BCL2 and FLIP. Furthermore, p50 binds and activates the CEBPA gene in myeloid cells. We now report that C/EBPalpha or C/EBPalpha leucine zipper AML mutants bind in vivo to the nfkb1 (p50) promoter and induce its expression even in the presence of cycloheximide. Induction of p50 by C/EBPalpha depends on 2 conserved kappaB sites in the nfkb1 promoter. C/EBPalpha did not induce p65 expression. Thus, C/EBPalpha and p50 reciprocally regulate each other's expression, establishing a positive feedback relationship. Although p50 homodimers inhibit transcription, C/EBPalpha and p50 synergistically activate antiapoptotic genes. ChIP analysis showed that C/EBPalpha diminishes the occupation of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) or HDAC3 on the endogenous FLIP promoter but not in mice lacking p50.

We analyzed polymorphic variants of DNA repair and detoxification genes in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who developed secondary acute promyelocytic leukemia (sAPL), in most cases after treatment with mitoxantrone (MTZ). METHODS: Using MassARRAY high-throughput DNA analysis with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, we genotyped patients with sAPL (n=20) developed after treatment of MS (18 out 20 treated with MTZ) for the presence of 210 SNPs of 22 genes mostly involved in DNA repair and drug detoxification. Patients with MS who did not develop sAPL including 41 treated with MTZ (n=253 and 41, respectively) and healthy blood donors (n=310) were also genotyped as controls. RESULTS: We observed risk allele frequency between MS and sAPL for BRCA2 (rs1801406): 6% and 26%, p=0.007; XRCC5 (rs207906): 2.5% and 15%, p=0.016; CYP3A4 (rs2740574): 4.5% and 25%, p=0.0035. The association of homozygous variants of BRCA2 and XRCC5 yielded higher risk of sAPL (MS vs sAPL: 0.4% and 18%, p=0.001). We also observed a significant association between a SNP in the promoter region (rs2740574) of CYP3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of chemotherapeutic agents and development of sAPL. CONCLUSIONS: Increased susceptibility to develop sAPL in patients with MS receiving MTZ may be linked to genetic variants in DNA repair and drug-metabolizing enzymes that result in impaired detoxification of chemotherapy or inefficient repair of drug-induced genetic damage.","['(c) 2011 by AAN Enterprises, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have shown that supranutritional doses of sodium selenite promote apoptosis in human leukemia NB4 cells. Here, we report that selenite treatment triggers opposite patterns of autophagy in the NB4, HL60, and Jurkat leukemia cell lines during apoptosis and provide evidence that the suppressive effect of selenite on autophagy in NB4 cells is due to the decreased expression of the chaperone protein Hsp90 (heat shock protein 90), suggesting a novel regulatory function of Hsp90 in apoptosis and autophagy. Excessive or insufficient expression indicates that Hsp90 protects NB4 cells from selenite-induced apoptosis, and selenite-induced decreases in the expression of Hsp90, especially in NB4 cells, inhibit the activities of the IkappaB kinase/nuclear factor-kappaB (IKK/NF-kappaB) signaling pathway, leading to less nuclear translocation and inactivation of NF-kappaB and the subsequent weak binding of the becn1 promoter, which facilitates the transition from autophagy to apoptosis. Taken together, our observations provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying the balance between apoptosis and autophagy, and we also identified Hsp90-NF-kappaB-Beclin1 as a potential biological pathway for signaling the switch from autophagy to apoptosis in selenite-treated NB4 cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We characterized the activities of TRIM5alpha proteins from two distant lemurs against exogenous retroviruses and a chimeric PSIV. TRIM5alpha from gray mouse lemur, which carries PSIV in its genome, exhibited the narrowest restriction activity. One allelic variant of gray mouse lemur TRIM5alpha restricted only N-tropic murine leukemia virus (N-MLV), while a second variant restricted N-MLV and, uniquely, B-tropic MLV (B-MLV); both variants poorly blocked PSIV. In contrast, TRIM5alpha from ring-tailed lemur, which does not contain PSIV in its genome, revealed one of the broadest antiviral activities reported to date against lentiviruses, including PSIV. Investigation into the antiviral specificity of ring-tailed lemur TRIM5alpha demonstrated a major contribution of a 32-amino-acid expansion in variable region 2 (v2) of the B30.2/SPRY domain to the breadth of restriction. Data on lemur TRIM5alpha and the prediction of ancestral simian sequences hint at an evolutionary scenario where antiretroviral specificity is prominently defined by the lineage-specific expansion of the variable loops of B30.2/SPRY.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2011 Feb 23.,,,,"BACKGROUND: Preimplantation cross-talk between a functional blastocyst and the endometrium is critical for successful blastocyst implantation. This interaction is mediated in part by endometrial cytokines/growth factors secreted by glandular epithelium into the uterine cavity. Recent evidence suggests that blastocyst-derived hCG may influence the endometrial milieu in conception cycles thereby enhancing receptivity and implantation success. This study investigated the effect of hCG on the secretory profile of a select cohort of 44 cytokines/growth factors from primary human endometrial epithelial cells (hEECs). These factors included those with both known and unknown roles during receptivity and implantation. The expression of one previously unknown hCG-regulated factor, fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), in human endometrium and its effects on hEEC function were further examined. METHODS: hEECs isolated from endometrial biopsies collected from fertile cycling women (n = 15) were treated +/- recombinant hCG (0.2-20 IU/ml) for 48 h and conditioned media was quantitatively analysed using Luminex multiplex technology. FGF2 was further investigated by immunohistochemistry, western blot and cell-adhesion assays. RESULTS: Of 44 cytokines/growth factors examined, 39 were produced by hEECs with a distinct profile. hCG (2 IU/ml) significantly increased the production of six factors, including those with known roles in receptivity and trophoblast function (interleukin-11), blastocyst migration and adhesion (CXCL10), blastocyst development (granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor) and one unknown with respect to receptivity and implantation (FGF2). Up-regulation of known hCG-regulated proteins, vascular endothelial growth factor and leukaemia inhibitory factor, validated this study. Immunoreactive epithelial FGF2 increased across the menstrual cycle, being highest in secretory and first trimester pregnancy endometrium in vivo. FGF2 (100 ng/ml) stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in hEEC with no effect on ERK1/2 abundance and stimulated hEEC adhesion to fibronectin and collagen IV (components of blastocyst/trophectoderm extracellular matrix). CONCLUSIONS: These findings clearly support roles for hCG and FGF2 in the blastocyst-endometrial cross-talk important for endometrial receptivity and blastocyst implantation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the past few years, it has become more evident that the alloreactivity of transplanted donor immunocompetent cells against host tumor cells (graft-versus-tumor effects, GVT effects) plays a major role in eradicating malignancies after allogeneic HSCT. Based on these observations, several groups of investigators have developed reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens allowing patients who are ineligible for conventional HSCT to benefit from the potentially curative GVT effects of allogeneic transplantation. Retrospective studies have suggested that, in comparison with myeloablative allogeneic HSCT, in patients aged 40-60 years, RIC HSCT was associated with a higher risk of relapse but a lower incidence of transplant-related mortality leading to similar progression-free and overall survivals. Prospective studies are ongoing to define which patients might most benefit from RIC HSCT, and to increase the anti-tumoral activity of the procedure while reducing the incidence and the severity of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

Epub 2011 Feb 21.,,,,"BACKGROUND: Multiple myeloma is the second most prevalent haematological malignancy and is incurable. Our aim was to assess the response and safety of the combination of temsirolimus (an mTOR inhibitor) and bortezomib in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. METHODS: We did an open-label, dose-escalation study in three centres in the USA. Patients were enrolled from June, 2007, to December, 2009. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma after one or more treatment (including lenalidomide, bortezomib, or thalidomide), with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2. Patients were assigned a dose level in the order of their entry into the study. Phase 1 was to assess the safety and establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination and phase 2 was to assess overall response rate at the MTD. Intravenous temsirolimus was given at 15 or 25 mg and intravenous bortezomib at 1.3 or 1.6 mg/m(2) once a week, with dose escalation until dose-limiting adverse events were recorded in two of the three people in the dose cohort. Use of steroids were not permitted. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a partial response or better. Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis, with all patients who had been enrolled included. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00483262. FINDINGS: 20 patients were enrolled into the phase 1 study and 43 into phase 2. All patients were heavily pretreated (median five lines in the phase 1 cohort, and four lines in the phase 2 cohort). The MTD was determined to be 1.6 mg/m(2) bortezomib on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 in combination with 25 mg temsirolimus on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29, for a cycle of 35 days. In the phase 2 study, the proportion of patients with a partial response or better was 33% (14 of 43; 90% CI 21-47). Long-term follow-up of patients is ongoing. There were three deaths during treatment in the phase 1 and 2 studies: one patient died of septic shock in the phase 1 study; one patient died with H1N1 influenza infection and one died with cardiac amyloid and ventricular arrhythmia unrelated to treatment in the phase 2 study. In the phase 1 study, the most common treatment-related grade 3-4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia (13 patients), lymphopenia (ten), neutropenia (nine), leucopenia (seven), and anaemia (five). In the phase 2 study, the most common treatment-related grade 3-4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia (25 patients), lymphopenia (24), neutropenia (17), leucopenia (ten), anaemia (seven), and diarrhoea (five). Four patients in the phase 1 study had sensory peripheral neuropathy (grade 2 or less); in the phase 2 study, 11 had sensory peripheral neuropathy (all grade 2 or less) and seven motor peripheral neuropathy (one grade 3, six grade 2 or less). INTERPRETATION: mTOR inhibitors could have a role in combination with weekly bortezomib for the treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma without the addition of steroids.

Therefore, measuring antibody persistence might identify the best platelets for transfusion. Lymphocytotoxic (LCT) antibody duration was evaluated for association with patient age, sex, prior transfusion and pregnancy history, study-assigned platelet transfusions, and percentage LCT panel reactive antibodies. During the Trial to Reduce Alloimmunization to Platelets, 145 patients became antibody positive; and 81 (56%) of them subsequently became antibody negative. Using Kaplan-Meier estimates, projected antibody loss was 73% at 1 year. Major factors associated with antibody persistence were prior pregnancy and percentage panel reactive antibody positivity, whereas neither the assigned type of platelets transfused during the 8 weeks of the trial nor prior transfusion history was predictive. After 5 to 8 weeks, the number and type of blood products transfused had no effect on either antibody development or loss.

Epub 2011 Feb 22.,,,,"Celecoxib is a paradigmatic selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). This anti-inflammatory drug has potent anti-tumor activity in a wide variety of human epithelial tumor types, such as colorectal, breast, non-small cell lung, and prostate cancers. Up to now, the drug found application in cancer prevention in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. Moreover, the use of Celecoxib is currently tested in the prevention and treatment of pancreatic, breast, ovarian, non-small cell lung cancer and other advanced human epithelial cancers. Induction of apoptosis contributes to the anti-neoplastic activity of Celecoxib. In most cellular systems Celecoxib induces apoptosis independently from its COX-2 inhibitory action via a mitochondrial apoptosis pathway which is however, not inhibited by overexpression of Bcl-2. In addition, Celecoxib exerts antagonistic effects on the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and survivin. Consequently, the use of Celecoxib may be of specific value for the treatment of apoptosis-resistant tumors with overexpression of Bcl-2, Mcl-1, or survivin as single drug or in combination with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or targeted pro-apoptotic drugs that are inhibited by survivin, Bcl-2 or Mcl-1. As COX-2 inhibition has been associated with cardiovascular toxicity, the value of drug derivatives without COX-2 inhibitory action should be validated for prevention and treatment of human epithelial tumors to reduce the risk for heart attack or stroke. However, its additional COX-2 inhibitory action may qualify Celecoxib for a cautious use in COX-2-dependent epithelial tumors, where the drug could additionally suppress COX-2-mediated growth and survival promoting signals from the tumor and the stromal cells.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Haematopoiesis represents one of the best understood developmental systems where multipotent blood stem cells give rise to a range of phenotypically distinct mature cell types, all characterised by their own distinctive gene expression profiles. Small combinations of lineage-determining transcription factors drive the development of specific mature lineages from multipotent precursors. Given their powerful regulatory nature, it is imperative that the expression of these lineage-determining transcription factors is under tight control, a fact underlined by the observation that their misexpression commonly leads to the development of leukaemia. Here we review recent studies on the transcriptional control of key haematopoietic transcription factors, which demonstrate that gene loci contain multiple modular regulatory regions within which specific regulatory codes can be identified, that some modular elements cooperate to mediate appropriate tissue-specific expression, and that long-range approaches will be necessary to capture all relevant regulatory elements.

Recent studies have highlighted a previously unappreciated role for the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on T cells and their effects on cell survival and proliferation. TLRs can bind exogenous molecules derived from pathogens as well as endogenous self-ligands released from damaged cells. Recent reports demonstrate that TLR engagement on primary mouse or human T cells enhances proliferation and/or cell survival. The mechanisms by which TLR stimulation on T cells influences these parameters and the different T-cell subsets that are affected by TLR stimulation are currently under investigation. Furthermore, neither the biological importance of stimulating TLRs on neoplastic T cells nor the prevalence of TLR expression in T-cell malignancies have yet to be characterized. Based on published reports and compelling preliminary data, we propose that the activation of the TLR-MyD88 signaling pathway in neoplastic T cells contributes to disease progression by reducing cell death and enhancing cell division.

In clinical trials, nilotinib has proven to be a useful agent in the treatment of imatinib-refractory disease and was initially approved by both the US FDA and EMA in 2007 for use in adults as a second-line therapy. More recently, data from the first randomized controlled trials of the front-line use of nilotinib in newly diagnosed patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia have demonstrated superiority in the rates of major molecular responses at 12 months over the gold standard-imatinib 400 mg. As such, in June 2010, the FDA granted accelerated approval for its use in newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia. Nilotinib is well tolerated, with a favorable side-effect profile.

Sixteen patients with t(8;21) and inv(16) had similar outcome with those without favorable cytogenetics (pOS 66% +/- 12% versus 65% +/- 7%, P = .39; pEFS 60% +/- 11% versus 54% +/- 8%, P = .45). Patients who achieved CR after 2 or more courses of chemotherapy and presenting white blood cell count (WBC) >/= 100 x 10(9)/L had poorer outcome (pOS 40% versus 80%P < .01; 43% versus 70%, P = .02, respectively). Intensified chemotherapy improved outcome of Chinese AML children. CR after first course of chemotherapy and WBC at diagnosis were important prognostic factors.",,,,,,,,['Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2011 May;28(4):253-6. PMID: 21524155'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2011 Mar 16.,,,,"Multipotent adult germline stem cells (maGSCs) are pluripotent cells that can be differentiated into somatic cells of the three primary germ layers. To highlight the protein profile changes associated with stem cell differentiation, retinoic acid (RA) treated mouse stem cells (maGSCs and ESCs) were compared to nontreated stem cells. 2-DE and DIGE reference maps were created, and differentially expressed proteins were further processed for identification. In both stem cell types, the RA induced differentiation resulted in an alteration of 36 proteins of which 18 were down-regulated and might be potential pluripotency associated proteins, whereas the other 18 proteins were up-regulated. These might be correlated to stem cell differentiation. Surprisingly, eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (Eif5a), a protein which is essential for cell proliferation and differentiation, was significantly down-regulated under RA treatment. A time-dependent investigation of Eif5a showed that the RA treatment of stem cells resulted in a significant up-regulation of the Eif5a in the first 48 h followed by a progressive down-regulation thereafter. This effect could be blocked by the hypusination inhibitor ciclopirox olamine (CPX). The alteration of Eif5a hypusination, as confirmed by mass spectrometry, exerts an antiproliferative effect on ESCs and maGSCs in vitro, but does not affect the cell pluripotency. Our data highlights the important role of Eif5a and its hypusination for stem cell differentiation and proliferation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the intensive treatment may increase the risk of late complications which may impair the patients' quality of life. In order to decrease the incidence of late complications the protocol with limited use of IF-RT was introduced in centers of Polish Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group (PPLLSG). This study presents the treatment results of patients treated with CT only in comparison with the therapy results of children treated with CT and IF-RT. From 1997 to 2006, 634 children (age: 2-22,5 years) with HD were treated in 14 oncological centers of PPLLSG. Majority of patients received CT (3-8 cycles of MVPP/B-DOPA) combined with IF-RT. In 45 patients with IA-IIA stages presenting favorable risk factors (small mediastinal tumor, peripheral nodular mass of a maximum diameter < 6 cm, involvement of less than three nodular regions, ESR < 50 mm after 1 h, histologic type other than lymphocyte depletion and very good treatment response assessed after 3 CT cycles) IF-RT was omitted. Among 634 children first complete remission (RC) was not achieved in 2.4% of patients. Relapses occurred in 24 children (3.9%). The rates of 5-year overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS) and event-free survival (EFS) were 97%, 96% i 92%, respectively. All patients treated with CT only remain in first CR. All serious late complications (including 7 second neoplasms) occurred in patients treated with CT combined with RT. Seven children died because of severe complications, among them two in first CR (aplastic anemia, sepsis). Our results show that the use of CT only in precisely selected group of patients with HD do not impair the treatment results and may decrease the risk of late life threatening complications. Treatment response assessment with the use of PET may in future increase the number of patients treated without RT and limit the need of the use of invasive diagnostic methods in patients with residual mass.",,,,,,,,,Czy dzieci z choroba Hodgkina moga byc leczone wylacznie chemioterapia?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sequential monitoring of MRD (minimal residual disease) in a set time points during the induction therapy in ALL proves to be a powerful and independent predictor of treatment outcome. Crucial limitation of MRD monitoring by flow cytometry is immunophenotypic changes seen at relapse. Up to now there are single publications about immunophenotypic changes during treatment of ALL in children. Objective was to assess changes in expression of cell antigens during induction treatment of ALL. From May 2005 to January 2008, from among 78 patients with ALL treated in Oncology and Hematology Department, Children's University Hospital in Krakow according to international treatment protocol ALL IC-BFM-2002, 42 were enrolled in assessment of antigens' cells modulation expression during induction. Finally, 24 boys and 18 girls were eligible for evaluation. For MRD detection 4-colour flow cytometry with FACS Diva Software v.5.1 (BD Immunocytometry Systems) was used. The panel of monoclonal antibodies used for MRD detection was based on ALL IC-BFM-2002 standard, modified by additional antibodies combinations from ALL-BFM-2000 protocol. Identification of leukemia associated phenotype (LAP), used for cell analysis in sequential time points, with a set monoclonal antibodies panel, was possible in all analyzed patients. Superficial and cytoplasmic antigens modulation was observed in most of the patients during MRD monitoring. Changes of antigens were seen mostly in PB on day 8 and on day 15 both in PB and BM. The most common antigen modulation found in children with cALL was: downmodulation of CD10, CD34, CD19, and upmodulation of CD45, CD11a, CD20. Unequivocal character of modulation of CD66c, CD58, CD38 was difficult to define (up and downmodulation). Introduction of treatment monitoring based on flow cytometry MRD measurement could lead to further individualization of therapy and improovement of cure rates in ALL, as well as to reducing side effects of ALL treatment and decrease total cost of patient therapy.",,,,,,,,,Zmiany ekspresji determinant komorkowych w trakcie leczenia indukcyjnego dzieci z ostra bialaczka limfoblastyczna.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hyperleukocytosis and the age (less than 1 year and more than 10 years) are known as unfavorable risk factors. The study was designed to assess the long-term treatment results in children with ALL and the initial leukocytosis over 50 000/mm3 with the use of the modified ""New York"" protocols. We present the treatment results of 340 children with ALL treated in nine centers of Polish Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group (PPLLSG) according to three consecutive versions of modified ""New York"" protocol (group I, II, and III) between 1987 and 2003. Within the analyzed groups the first complete remission (I CR) was achieved in 91%, 95% and 96% of the patients, respectively. Relapses occurred in 37%, 21.5% and 26% of the patients and 3.7%, 1.8% and 5.7% of children died in the I CR due to complications, in the I, II and III therapeutic group, respectively. Obtained 5-and 10-year event-free survival (EFS) were 56% and 53.5% for the group I and 73% and 73% for the group II. Five-year EFS for the group III was 67%. The implementation of the New York protocol in 1987 and New York I in 1997 has improved the treatment results in children with ALL and initial leukocytosis over 50 000/mm3. Protocol New York II did not further improve the treatment results. Among analyzed parameters (age, gender, the initial leukocytosis, the blast cells immunophenotype) only age had the statistical significance.

This process is difficult to elucidate since variables are interrelated and require simultaneous evaluation, rendering conventional statistical methods inappropriate. PROCEDURE: We used principal components analysis (PCA) and projection of latent structures (PLS) to evaluate immune competence in 32 children treated for ALL. One or 6 months after completion of therapy, the relation between lymphocyte subpopulations, lymphocyte function and response to vaccination with tetanus, diphtheria and hemophilus influenzae, was investigated. RESULTS: PCA demonstrated that increasing treatment intensity correlated with progressive immune dysfunction. Children treated with high intensity had poor response to vaccination associated with loss of humoral memory, decreased CD4(+) 45RA(+) T-lymphocytes and increased CD5+ B-lymphocytes. Patients treated with intermediate intensity had better preservation of humoral memory but decreased CD4(+) 45RA(+) T-cells. Patients with a low intensity regimen had similar vaccination response and lymphocyte levels as controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate the utility of PCA and PLS in detecting hidden structures in complex data and suggest that, even 6 months after therapy, patients treated with intermediate and high intensity have attenuated responses to de novo antigens whereas those with high intensity also respond poorly to recall antigens.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective was to assess the incremental cost-effectiveness per life-month gained of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) genotyping to guide doses of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) compared to enzymatic testing and standard weight-based dosing. PROCEDURE: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from a health care system perspective comparing costs and consequences over 3 months. Decision analysis was used to evaluate the impact of TPMT tests on preventing myelosuppression and improving survival in ALL patients receiving 6-MP. Direct medical costs included laboratory tests, medications, physician services, pharmacy and inpatient care. Probabilities were derived from published evidence. Survival was measured in life-months. The robustness of the results to variable uncertainty was tested in one-way sensitivity analyses. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis examined the impact of parameter uncertainty and generated confidence intervals around point estimates. RESULTS: Neither of the testing interventions showed a benefit in survival compared to weight-based dosing. Both test strategies were more costly compared to weight-based dosing. Incremental costs per child (95% confidence interval) were $277 ($112, $442) and $298 ($392, $421) for the genotyping and phenotyping strategies, respectively, compared to weight-based dosing. CONCLUSIONS: The present analysis suggests that screening for TPMT mutations using either genotype or enzymatic laboratory tests prior to the administration of 6-MP in pediatric ALL patients is not cost-effective.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2011 Dec 15;57(7):1247.

However, the role of collagen I in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) is not well-known. Therefore, in the present study we examined the effect of collagen I on mESC self-renewal and related signal pathways. Collagen I (10 microg/ml) maintained mESCs in an undifferentiated state (Nanog, OCT4, and SSEA-1) and did not affect differentiation (GATA4, Tbx5, Fgf5, and Cdx2) in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Treatment with collagen I bound both alpha2beta1 integrin and discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1), and stimulated intracellular signaling pathways. Collagen I-bound alpha2beta1 integrin increased integrin-linked kinase (ILK) phosphorylation, cleaved Notch protein expression in the nuclear fraction, and Gli-1 mRNA expression. In addition, collagen I-bound DDR1 increased GTP-bound Ras, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) p85alpha catalytic subunit protein expression, and Akt and ERK phosphorylation. Importantly, collagen I increased Bmi-1 protein expression in the nucleus which was blocked by small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific for Gli-1 and ERK, showing that parallel pathways of integrins and DDR1 merge at Bmi-1. Furthermore, collagen I-induced p16 decrease and p-Rb increase were reversed by Bmi-1-specific siRNA. Moreover, Bmi-1 silencing abolished the collagen I-induced increase of proliferation indices and undifferentiation markers. These results indicate that collagen I stimulates the self-renewal of mESCs mediated by Bmi-1 through alpha2beta1 integrin-dependent ILK, Notch, Gli-1, and DDR1-dependent Ras, PI3K/Akt, and ERK.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the effects of 2-(3-(methylamino)phenyl)-6-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)quinolin-4-one (Smh-3) on viability, cell cycle and apoptotic cell death which occurred in different leukemia cell lines (HL-60, U937 and K562) in a dose- and time-dependent manner, but which did not obviously impair the viability of normal human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in vitro. The approximate IC50 was 103.26 +/- 4.59 nM for a 48 h treatment in HL-60 cells. Cell cycle analysis showed that 100 nM Smh-3 induced signi-ficant G2/M arrest in examined cells. Within 0, 12, 24 and 48 h of treatment, Smh-3 inhibited CDK1 activity and decreased protein levels of CDK1, cyclin A and cyclin B. Smh-3-induced chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation were determined by DAPI and TUNEL staining. Cell apoptosis was significantly reduced after pretreatment with a pan-caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-fmk) and results indicated that Smh-3-induced apoptosis was mainly mediated by activation of the caspase cascade in HL-60 cells. Results from colorimetric assays and Western blot analysis indicated that activities of caspase-9, -7 and -3 were promoted in Smh-3-treated HL-60 cells during cell apoptosis. Smh-3-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells was accompanied by an apparent increase in ROS production, and protein levels of cytosolic cytochrome c, apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Strikingly, Smh-3 induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells by simultaneously suppressing protein levels of AKT, p-AKT, p-mTOR and p-BAD and inducing BAD protein levels. Taken together, we conclude that Smh-3 acts against leukemia cells in vitro via G2/M phase arrest, down-regulation of AKT activity and induction of mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathways.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fact that ES cell-derived precursors do not repopulate bone marrow without HoxB4 underscores an important role for HoxB4 in the maturation of ES-derived hematopoietic precursors into long-term repopulating HSCs. However, the precise molecular mechanism underlying this process is barely understood. In this study, we performed a genome-wide analysis of HoxB4 using ES cell-derived hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. The results revealed many of the genes essential for HSC development to be direct targets of HoxB4, such as Runx1, Scl/Tal1, Gata2, and Gfi1. The expression profiling also showed that HoxB4 indirectly affects the expression of several important genes, such as Lmo2, Erg, Meis1, Pbx1, Nov, AhR, and Hemgn. HoxB4 tended to activate the transcription, but the down-regulation of a significant portion of direct targets suggested its function to be context-dependent. These findings indicate that HoxB4 reprograms a set of key regulator genes to facilitate the maturation of developing HSCs into repopulating cells. Our list of HoxB4 targets also provides novel candidate regulators for HSCs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Diagnostic samples from 945 patients (age 18 to 60 years) were analyzed for RUNX1 mutations. In a subset of cases (n = 269), microarray gene expression analysis was performed. RESULTS: Fifty-nine RUNX1 mutations were identified in 53 (5.6%) of 945 cases, predominantly in exons 3 (n = 11), 4 (n = 10), and 8 (n = 23). RUNX1 mutations clustered in the intermediate-risk cytogenetic group (46 of 640, 7.2%; cytogenetically normal, 34 of 538, 6.3%), whereas they were less frequent in adverse-risk cytogenetics (five of 109, 4.6%) and absent in core-binding-factor AML (0 of 77) and acute promyelocytic leukemia (0 of 61). RUNX1 mutations were associated with MLL-partial tandem duplications (P = .0007) and IDH1/IDH2 mutations (P = .03), inversely correlated with NPM1 (P < .0001), and in trend with CEBPA (P = .10) mutations. RUNX1 mutations were characterized by a distinct gene expression pattern; this RUNX1 mutation-derived signature was not exclusive for the mutation, but also included mostly adverse-risk AML [eg, 7q-, -7, inv(3), or t(3;3)]. RUNX1 mutations predicted for resistance to chemotherapy (rates of refractory disease 30% and 19%, P = .047, for RUNX1-mutated and wild-type patients, respectively), as well as inferior event-free survival (EFS; P < .0001), relapse-free survival (RFS, P = .022), and overall survival (P = .051). In multivariable analysis, RUNX1 mutations were an independent prognostic marker for shorter EFS (P = .007).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four-hundred twenty-seven patients with CN-AML were analyzed for TET2 mutations by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing and for established prognostic gene mutations. Gene- and microRNA-expression profiles were derived using microarrays. RESULTS: TET2 mutations, found in 23% of patients, were associated with older age (P < .001) and higher pretreatment WBC (P = .04) compared with wild-type TET2 (TET2-wt). In the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) favorable-risk group (patients with CN-AML who have mutated CEBPA and/or mutated NPM1 without FLT3 internal tandem duplication [FLT3-ITD]), TET2-mutated patients had shorter event-free survival (EFS; P < .001) because of a lower complete remission (CR) rate (P = .007), and shorter disease-free survival (DFS; P = .003), and also had shorter overall survival (P = .001) compared with TET2-wt patients. TET2 mutations were not associated with outcomes in the ELN intermediate-I-risk group (CN-AML with wild-type CEBPA and wild-type NPM1 and/or FLT3-ITD). In multivariable models, TET2 mutations were associated with shorter EFS (P = .004), lower CR rate (P = .03), and shorter DFS (P = .05) only among favorable-risk CN-AML patients. We identified a TET2 mutation-associated gene-expression signature in favorable-risk but not in intermediate-I-risk patients and found distinct mutation-associated microRNA signatures in both ELN groups. CONCLUSION: TET2 mutations improve the ELN molecular-risk classification in primary CN-AML because of their adverse prognostic impact in an otherwise favorable-risk patient subset. Our data suggest that these patients may be candidates for alternative therapies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result, gPr80(gag) contains 88 unique N-terminal amino acids that include a signal peptide that conducts gPr80(gag) into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where it is glycosylated, exported to the cell surface, and cleaved into two proteins of 55 and 40 kDa. The amino-terminal 55-kDa protein remains cell associated with the 88 unique amino acids exposed to the cytosol. We previously showed that gPr80(gag) facilitates efficient M-MuLV release through lipid rafts. In this report, we found that the unique N-terminal domain of gPr80(gag) is sufficient to facilitate enhanced M-MuLV particle release from transfected 293T cells. A search for cellular proteins involved in gPr80(gag) function led to cellular La protein. Overexpression of mouse or human La enhanced M-MuLV particle release in the absence of glyco-gag, and the released virus had a reduced buoyant density characteristic of increased cholesterol content. Moreover, small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of human La abolished glyco-gag enhancement of M-MuLV release. These results implicate La as a cellular protein involved in M-MuLV glyco-gag function. We also found that overexpression of mouse or human La could enhance HIV-1 release in the absence of gPr80(gag). Therefore, M-MuLV and HIV-1 may share a pathway for release through lipid rafts involving La.",['Copyright (c) 2011 Nitta et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MTT assay was utilized to observe the effect of NDV on the proliferation of SHI-1 cells. In vivo, the effect of NDV on the tumor inhibition was assessed using SHI-1 xenografts subcutaneously established in CD-1 nude mice. NDV was given by intra-tumor injections, and the tumor inhibition rate and toxic effects were evaluated. RESULTS: In the control group, the SHI-1 cells were observed using an inverted microscope to be regular in morphology and intensive in distribution. In the NDV-infected group, the SHI-1 cells were irregular and sparsate, and the aggregate and fused cells were common. MTT assay showed that the proliferation of SHI-1 cells were significantly inhibited by NDV at different concentrations (P<0.01) and in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The tumor inhibition rate in the NDV group was 84.7%, which was significantly higher than that in the control group (P<0.01). No toxic effects were observed in the nude mice.

Serum levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 in the ALL group increased to 30+/-3 ng/mL and 1941+/-164 ng/mL respectively 6 months after complete remission, which were significantly higher than those before treatment (P<0.01) and were similar to the levels of the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Serum levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 are reduced in children with ALL, but increase significantly after complete remission, suggesting that IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 might serve as useful markers for the diagnosis and evaluation of therapeutic effects of childhood ALL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A seventh study recently found polytropic MuLV sequences, but not XMRV, in a high proportion of persons with CFS. Here we tested blood specimens from 45 CFS cases and 42 persons without CFS from over 20 states in the United States for both XMRV and MuLV.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that hLIF is a pleiotropic cytokine with multiple effects on different types of cells and tissues. The optimal chemical synthesis of the hLIF gene has been previously reported to increase the expression of the recombinant inclusion body protein in E. coli. However, the required refolding step limits the recovery rate. In this report, a novel strategy was designed to produce a soluble recombinant human LIF (rhLIF) in the prokaryotic system in order to obtain higher yields of the bioactive protein with simpler steps. This optimal hLIF gene was cloned, and it successfully expressed the soluble recombinant protein in E. coli using the thioredoxin (Trx) protein as a fusion partner. A simple purification procedure is established to purify the recombinant fusion protein from the soluble supernatant of the lysed culture cells. This procedure yields up to 5 mg/L rhLIF with above 95? purity. The strategy allows the protease to release target cytokines without additional N-terminus amino acids, which is an important consideration for maintaining its bioactivity. Functional analysis of the purified rhLIF by murine myeloblastic leukemia M1 cell proliferation assay demonstrates biological activity that is similar and comparable to that of hLIF. These results present a sound strategy for the soluble production of rhLIF and other homologous tertiary structure cytokines consisting of four alpha-helices in a bundle for basic research, as well as clinical applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper considers the situation where these observation times may be random variables and more importantly, they may be related to the underlying longitudinal variable or process of interest. Furthermore, covariate effects may be time-varying. For the analysis, a joint modeling approach is proposed and in particular, for estimation of time-varying regression parameters, an estimating equation-based procedure is developed. Both asymptotic and finite sample properties of the proposed estimates are established.

Katsahianbiet al. extended their model to clustered time to event data, by including random center effects or frailties in the subdistribution hazard. We first introduce an alternate estimation procedure to the one proposed by Katsahian et al. This alternate estimation method is based on the penalized partial likelihood approach often used in fitting Gaussian frailty proportional hazards models in the standard survival analysis context, and has the advantage of using standard survival analysis software. Second, four hypothesis tests for the presence of center effects are given and compared via Monte-Carlo simulations. Statistical and numerical considerations lead us to formulate pragmatic guidelines as to which of the four tests is preferable.

Moreover, combination treatment inhibited cyto-protective signaling pathways, including inactivation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) and Akt pathways, and activated stress-related signaling pathway, including the c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38) pathways. In addition, this regimen significantly caused G2/M phase arrest, while downregulating the expression of phospho-CDC2 and CyclinD1 as well as increasing p21(cip1). Furthermore, combination treatment efficiently induced apoptosis in primary AML/MDS cells, with little effect on normal cells.

Little is known about SEL in patients with hematologic malignancies who require frequent lumbar punctures and corticosteroid treatment that places them at risk. Records and radiologic images of patients with SEL and leukemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) treated at a single institution from 1999-2009 were reviewed. Risk factors were compared with 405 control patients with leukemia. Fourteen patients with leukemia or NHL were diagnosed with SEL. The majority of patients underwent diagnostic imaging after unsuccessful lumbar punctures within 1 month of their primary diagnosis. Prior to SEL diagnosis, all patients received systemic and/or intrathecal corticosteroids. SEL diagnosis led to modification of intrathecal administration in eight patients, including Ommaya reservoir placement in four patients. All patients completed protocol-specified chemotherapy without neurologic symptoms or surgical intervention. Risk factors for developing SEL include older age and high body mass index. Investigation for SEL in leukemia or lymphoma patients with difficult lumbar punctures is warranted. Placement of an Ommaya reservoir may facilitate safe CNS-directed therapy in severely affected patients.",,['NIHMS317714'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given these data, we sought to study the methylation status of the specific gene in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and to correlate it with clinical and genetic features. Using methylation-specific PCR MSP, we analyzed the methylation profile of 45 cases of AML and 43 cases of MDS. We also studied the distribution of MTHFR A1298C and MTHFR C677T polymorphisms and FLT3 mutations in AML patients and correlated the results with hypermethylation in the SNK/PLK2 CpG island. The SNK/PLK2 CpG island was hypermethylated in 68.9% and 88.4% of AML and MDS cases, respectively. Cases with hypermethylation had a trend towards more favorable overall survival (OS). There was no association between different MTHFR genotypes and susceptibility to develop AML. SNK/PLK2 hypermethylation combined with the MTHFR AA1298 genotype was associated with a tendency for a better OS. Similarly, patients with SNK/PLK2 hypermethylation combined with the MTHFR CT677 polymorphism had a better OS (HR = 0.34; p = 0.017). SNK/PLK2 methylation associated with unmutated FLT3 cases had a trend for better OS compared to patients with mutated FLT3 gene. SNK/PLK2 is a novel epigenetically regulated gene in AML and MDS, and methylation occurs at high frequency in both diseases. As such, SNK/PLK2 could represent a potential pathogenetic factor, although additional studies are necessary to verify its exact role in disease pathogenesis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Chemical modifications of genistein have been introduced to improve its solubility and efficacy. The anti-tumor effects were tested in ovarian cancer cells using proliferation assays, cell cycle analysis, immunofluorescence, and microscopy. RESULTS: In this work, we show that a unique glycoside of genistein, ITB-301, inhibits the proliferation of SKOv3 ovarian cancer cells. We found that the 50% growth inhibitory concentration of ITB-301 in SKOv3 cells was 0.5 muM. Similar results were obtained in breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and acute myelogenous leukemia cell lines. ITB-301 induced significant time- and dose-dependent microtubule depolymerization. This depolymerization resulted in mitotic arrest and inhibited proliferation in all ovarian cancer cell lines examined including SKOv3, ES2, HeyA8, and HeyA8-MDR cells. The cytotoxic effect of ITB-301 was dependent on its induction of mitotic arrest as siRNA-mediated depletion of BUBR1 significantly reduced the cytotoxic effects of ITB-301, even at a concentration of 10 muM. Importantly, efflux-mediated drug resistance did not alter the cytotoxic effect of ITB-301 in two independent cancer cell models of drug resistance. CONCLUSION: These results identify ITB-301 as a novel anti-tubulin agent that could be used in cancers that are multidrug resistant. We propose a structural model for the binding of ITB-301 to alpha- and beta-tubulin dimers on the basis of molecular docking simulations. This model provides a rationale for future work aimed at designing of more potent analogs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
