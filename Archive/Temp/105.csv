The controversial discussion about the virus being detected in PCA tissue, blood samples from patients suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), as well as from a significant number of healthy controls prompted us to deepen our studies about detection of XMRV infection applying different detection methods (PCR, cocultivation and immunohistochemistry [IHC]). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 92 PCA and 7 healthy controls were isolated, PHA activated and cocultivated with LNCaP cells for up to 8 weeks. Supernatant of these cells was applied to a reporter cell line, DERSE-iGFP. Furthermore, the PBMCs and cocultivated LNCaP cells were tested for the presence of XMRV by PCR as well as Western Blot analysis. While all PCR amplifications and Western Blot analyses were negative for signs of XMRV infection, DERSE-iGFP cells displayed isolated GFP positive cells in three cases. In all three cases XMRV presence could not be confirmed by PCR technology. In addition, we performed XMRV specific IHC on PCA tissue sections. Whole tissue sections (n = 20), as well as tissue microarrays (TMA) including 50 benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), 50 low grade and 50 high grade PCA sections and TMAs including breast cancer, colon cancer and normal tissues were stained with two XMRV specific antisera. XMRV protein expression was not detected in any cancer sections included. One BPH tissue displayed XMRV specific protein expression in random isolated basal cells. CONCLUSION: We were unable to conclusively detect XMRV in the blood from PCA patients or from healthy controls and there is no conclusive evidence of XMRV protein expression in PCA, breast cancer and colon cancer tissue sections tested by IHC staining.","['Stieler, Kristin', 'Schindler, Sarah', 'Schlomm, Thorsten', 'Hohn, Oliver', 'Bannert, Norbert', 'Simon, Ronald', 'Minner, Sarah', 'Schindler, Michael', 'Fischer, Nicole']","['Stieler K', 'Schindler S', 'Schlomm T', 'Hohn O', 'Bannert N', 'Simon R', 'Minner S', 'Schindler M', 'Fischer N']","['Institute for Medical Microbiology and Virology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111012,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,['0 (Viral Proteins)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Separation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Europe', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/virology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prostate/*pathology/*virology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*blood/pathology/*virology', 'Retroviridae Infections/virology', 'Viral Proteins/metabolism', 'Virus Replication', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/genetics/*isolation & purification/physiology']",PMC3192048,2011/10/25 06:00,2012/02/18 06:00,['2011/10/25 06:00'],"['2011/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0025592 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-09958 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(10):e25592. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0025592.

It is mutated in the genetic condition called Blepharophimosis Ptosis Epicantus inversus Syndrome (BPES) and in cases of isolated premature ovarian failure. We and others have previously shown that FOXL2 undergoes several post-translational modifications. METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, using cells in culture, we show that interference with FOXL2 SUMOylation leads to a robust inhibition of its transactivation ability, which correlates with a decreased stability. Interestingly, FOXL2 SUMOylation promotes its transient recruitment to subnuclear structures that we demonstrate to be PML (Promyelocytic Leukemia) Nuclear Bodies. Since PML bodies are known to be sites where post-translational modifications of nuclear factors take place, we used tandem mass spectrometry to identify new post-translational modifications of FOXL2. Specifically, we detected four phosphorylated, one sulfated and three acetylated sites. CONCLUSIONS: By analogy with other transcription factors, we propose that PML Nuclear Bodies might transiently recruit FOXL2 to the vicinity of locally concentrated enzymes that could be involved in the post-translational maturation of FOXL2. FOXL2 acetylation, sulfation, phosphorylation as well as other modifications yet to be discovered might alter the transactivation capacity of FOXL2 and/or its stability, thus modulating its global intracellular activity.","['Georges, Adrien', 'Benayoun, Berenice A', 'Marongiu, Mara', 'Dipietromaria, Aurelie', ""L'Hote, David"", 'Todeschini, Anne-Laure', 'Auer, Jana', 'Crisponi, Laura', 'Veitia, Reiner A']","['Georges A', 'Benayoun BA', 'Marongiu M', 'Dipietromaria A', ""L'Hote D"", 'Todeschini AL', 'Auer J', 'Crisponi L', 'Veitia RA']","['Programme de Pathologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, Institut Jacques Monod, UMR 7592 CNRS-Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111012,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (FOXL2 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein L2)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Forkhead Box Protein L2', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/chemistry/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/*metabolism', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Peptides/chemistry', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein Stability', 'Protein Transport', '*Sumoylation', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation/*genetics']",PMC3192040,2011/10/25 06:00,2012/02/18 06:00,['2011/10/25 06:00'],"['2011/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0025463 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-15174 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(10):e25463. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0025463.

Here we utilize gp350 to generate tailored exosomes with an identical tropism. These exosomes can be used for the targeted co-transfer of functional proteins to normal and malignant human B cells. We demonstrate here the co-transfer of functional CD154 protein on tailored gp350+ exosomes to malignant B blasts from patients with B chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), rendering B blasts immunogenic to tumor-reactive autologous T cells. Intriguingly, engulfment of gp350+ exosomes by B-CLL cells and presentation of gp350-derived peptides also re-stimulated EBV-specific T cells and redirected the strong antiviral cellular immune response in patients to leukemic B cells. In essence, we show that gp350 alone confers B-cell tropism to exosomes and that these exosomes can be further engineered to simultaneously trigger virus- and tumor-specific immune responses. The simultaneous exploitation of gp350 as a tropism molecule for tailored exosomes and as a neo-antigen in malignant B cells provides a novel attractive strategy for immunotherapy of B-CLL and other B-cell malignancies.","['Ruiss, Romana', 'Jochum, Simon', 'Mocikat, Ralph', 'Hammerschmidt, Wolfgang', 'Zeidler, Reinhard']","['Ruiss R', 'Jochum S', 'Mocikat R', 'Hammerschmidt W', 'Zeidler R']","['Department of Gene Vectors, Helmholtz-Zentrum, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111010,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (EBV-associated membrane antigen, Epstein-Barr virus)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",IM,"['Antigens, Viral/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology/virology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD40 Ligand/metabolism', 'Exosomes/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Tropism/*immunology', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/*metabolism', 'Virus Assembly']",PMC3189918,2011/10/25 06:00,2012/02/18 06:00,['2011/10/25 06:00'],"['2011/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0025294 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-14535 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(10):e25294. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0025294.

RESULTS: Three major groups of murine endogenous gammaretroviruses were identified. The third group encompassed both exogenous and endogenous Murine Leukemia Viruses (MLVs), and most XMRV/HMRV sequences reported from patients suffering from myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Two sensitive real-time PCRs for this group were developed. The predicted and observed amplification range for these and three published XMRV/HMRV PCRs demonstrated conspicuous differences between some of them, partly explainable by a recombinatorial origin of XMRV. Three reverse transcription real-time PCRs (RTQPCRs), directed against conserved and not overlapping stretches of env, gag and integrase (INT) sequences of XMRV/HMRV were used on human samples. White blood cells from 78 patients suffering from ME/CFS, of which 30 patients also fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia (ME/CFS/FM) and in 7 patients with fibromyalgia (FM) only, all from the Gothenburg area of Sweden. As controls we analyzed 168 sera from Uppsala blood donors. We controlled for presence and amplifiability of nucleic acid and for mouse DNA contamination. To score as positive, a sample had to react with several of the XMRV/HMRV PCRs. None of the samples gave PCR reactions which fulfilled the positivity criteria. CONCLUSIONS: XMRV/HMRV like proviruses occur in the third murine gammaretrovirus group, characterized here. PCRs developed by us, and others, approximately cover this group, except for the INT RTQPCR, which is rather strictly XMRV specific. Using such PCRs, XMRV/HMRV could not be detected in PBMC and plasma samples from Swedish patients suffering from ME/CFS/FM, and in sera from Swedish blood donors.","['Elfaitouri, Amal', 'Shao, Xingwu', 'Mattsson Ulfstedt, Johan', 'Muradrasoli, Shaman', 'Bolin Wiener, Agnes', 'Golbob, Sultan', 'Ohrmalm, Christina', 'Matousek, Michael', 'Zachrisson, Olof', 'Gottfries, Carl-Gerhard', 'Blomberg, Jonas']","['Elfaitouri A', 'Shao X', 'Mattsson Ulfstedt J', 'Muradrasoli S', 'Bolin Wiener A', 'Golbob S', 'Ohrmalm C', 'Matousek M', 'Zachrisson O', 'Gottfries CG', 'Blomberg J']","['Section of Clinical Virology, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111012,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nucleic Acids)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Computational Biology', 'Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic/*complications/*virology', 'Fibromyalgia/*complications/*virology', 'Gammaretrovirus/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Gene Products, env/genetics', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics', 'Genome/genetics', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acids/genetics', 'Phylogeny', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proviruses/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recombination, Genetic/genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sweden']",PMC3192035,2011/10/25 06:00,2012/02/18 06:00,['2011/10/25 06:00'],"['2011/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0024602 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-08685 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(10):e24602. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0024602.

Transcription factor AML1/RUNX1 is one of the most frequent targets of chromosomal abnormalities in human leukemia and altered function of AML1 is closely associated with malignant transformation of hematopoietic cells. However, the molecular basis and therapeutic targets of AML1-related leukemia are still elusive. Here, we explored immediate target pathways of AML1 by in vitro synchronous inactivation in hematopoietic cells. We found that AML1 inhibits NF-kappaB signaling through interaction with IkappaB kinase complex in the cytoplasm. Remarkably, AML1 mutants found in myeloid tumors lack the ability to inhibit NF-kappaB signaling, and human cases with AML1-related leukemia exhibits distinctly activated NF-kappaB signaling. Furthermore, inhibition of NF-kappaB signaling in leukemic cells with mutated AML1 efficiently blocks their growth and development of leukemia. These findings reveal a novel role for AML1 as a cytoplasmic attenuator of NF-kappaB signaling and indicate that NF-kappaB signaling is one of the promising therapeutic targets of hematologic malignancies with AML1 abnormality.","['Nakagawa, Masahiro', 'Shimabe, Munetake', 'Watanabe-Okochi, Naoko', 'Arai, Shunya', 'Yoshimi, Akihide', 'Shinohara, Akihito', 'Nishimoto, Nahoko', 'Kataoka, Keisuke', 'Sato, Tomohiko', 'Kumano, Keiki', 'Nannya, Yasuhito', 'Ichikawa, Motoshi', 'Imai, Yoichi', 'Kurokawa, Mineo']","['Nakagawa M', 'Shimabe M', 'Watanabe-Okochi N', 'Arai S', 'Yoshimi A', 'Shinohara A', 'Nishimoto N', 'Kataoka K', 'Sato T', 'Kumano K', 'Nannya Y', 'Ichikawa M', 'Imai Y', 'Kurokawa M']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111021,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Boronic Acids/pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mutation', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Pyrazines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2011/10/25 06:00,2012/03/17 06:00,['2011/10/25 06:00'],"['2011/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40294-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-12-326710 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Dec 15;118(25):6626-37. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-12-326710.

AMPK kinase is a metabolic sensor that exhibits suppressive effects on the mTOR pathway and negatively regulates mTOR activity. We report that AMPK activators, such as metformin and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide, suppress activation of the mTOR pathway in BCR-ABL-expressing cells. Treatment with these inhibitors results in potent suppression of chronic myeloid leukemia leukemic precursors and Ph(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, including cells expressing the T315I-BCR-ABL mutation. Altogether, our data suggest that AMPK is an attractive target for the treatment of BCR-ABL-expressing malignancies and raise the potential for use of AMPK activators in the treatment of refractory chronic myeloid leukemia and Ph(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Vakana, Eliza', 'Altman, Jessica K', 'Glaser, Heather', 'Donato, Nicholas J', 'Platanias, Leonidas C']","['Vakana E', 'Altman JK', 'Glaser H', 'Donato NJ', 'Platanias LC']","['Robert H.

Structural equation modeling revealed that higher treatment intensity during childhood (indicated by treatment with high-dose CRT, low-dose IT-MTX, and adjusted by younger age at diagnosis) predicted more health- compromising behaviors as adults through lower educational achievement. Additionally, higher childhood treatment intensity predicted current negative mood both directly and via changes in perceived limitations. The present study's findings suggest that higher treatment intensity during childhood may serve as a risk factor for adult survivors' health-compromising behaviors through neuropsychological deficits that arise from cancer treatment.","['Chen, E', 'Zeltzer, L K', 'Bentler, P M', 'Byrne, J', 'Nicholson, H S', 'Meadows, A T', 'Mills, J L', 'Haupt, R', 'Fears, T R', 'Robison, L L']","['Chen E', 'Zeltzer LK', 'Bentler PM', 'Byrne J', 'Nicholson HS', 'Meadows AT', 'Mills JL', 'Haupt R', 'Fears TR', 'Robison LL']","['Departments of Psychology and Pediatrics, University of California, Los Angeles, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,J Health Psychol,Journal of health psychology,9703616,,,,,1998/01/01 00:00,1998/01/01 00:01,['2011/10/25 06:00'],"['2011/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '1998/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['3/1/23 [pii]', '10.1177/135910539800300102 [doi]']",ppublish,J Health Psychol. 1998 Jan;3(1):23-38. doi: 10.1177/135910539800300102.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We extrapolated leukemia mortality related to community air pollution levels and to cigarette smoking from data from the US Environmental Protection Agency and the US Surgeon General. We also estimated relative decline in total exposures to benzene (a known human leukemogen) owing to the CAA amendments and to smoking prevention and cessation efforts. RESULTS: We estimated that because of the CAA, there will be approximately 300 fewer leukemia deaths in the United States during the period 2000 through 2020. During the closest comparable period (1987-2007), we estimated that decline in cigarette smoking led to 7120 fewer leukemia deaths, of which 1282 to 3702 were attributable to benzene. Similarly, the decline in smoking led to about a tenfold greater decrease in total-population benzene exposure than did the 1990 CAA amendments. CONCLUSIONS: Both the CAA and smoking cessation activities contribute to a decrease in leukemia incidence. Smoking cessation activities have had a greater effect in the past.","['Goldstein, Bernard D', 'Liu, Yan', 'Wu, Felicia', 'Lioy, Paul']","['Goldstein BD', 'Liu Y', 'Wu F', 'Lioy P']","['Graduate School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh, PA, USA. bgold@pitt.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20111020,United States,Am J Public Health,American journal of public health,1254074,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants/*adverse effects', 'Air Pollution/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Benzene/*adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/*mortality', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking/*adverse effects', 'Smoking Cessation', 'Smoking Prevention', 'United States/epidemiology']",PMC3222429,2011/10/25 06:00,2011/12/30 06:00,['2011/10/25 06:00'],"['2011/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/30 06:00 [medline]']","['AJPH.2011.300256 [pii]', '10.2105/AJPH.2011.300256 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Public Health. 2011 Dec;101(12):2357-61. doi: 10.2105/AJPH.2011.300256.

Despite conjugation to polyethylene glycol to reduce immunogenicity, allergic reactions still occur and may be severe. Traditionally, PEG is given via intramuscular (IM) injection but recent protocols have shown it can be safely given intravenously (IV), which may be preferred by patients. There is a potential concern that the IV route may result in more severe allergic reactions due to immediate exposure to reactive antibodies in the blood, which is delayed after IM administration. The purpose of our study is to compare the severity and incidence of allergic reactions with IV versus IM PEG. We are unaware of any prior studies examining this. PROCEDURE: We reviewed all patients with ALL diagnosed from 2005 to 2010 inclusive who received PEG and had an allergic reaction. Reactions were graded using both common toxicity criteria (CTC) 3.0 and 4.0. RESULTS: Allergic reactions were seen in 17 of 186 (9%) newly diagnosed patients receiving IM PEG and 4 of 11 (36%) receiving IV PEG; P = 0.019. The severity of reaction was not increased with IV versus IM. Allergic reactions occurred more frequently in high-risk patients (14 of 85; 16%) versus standard risk (7 of 112; 6%), P = 0.034. CONCLUSIONS: There appears to be an increased incidence of allergic reactions in patients who receive IV PEG compared with IM although the severity is similar. In addition high-risk patients appear to have more allergic reactions than standard risk.","['Pidaparti, Mahati', 'Bostrom, Bruce']","['Pidaparti M', 'Bostrom B']","[""Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55404, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20111020,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Asparaginase/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Hypersensitivity/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Injections, Intramuscular/*adverse effects', 'Injections, Intravenous/*adverse effects', 'Male', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Risk']",,2011/10/25 06:00,2012/09/18 06:00,['2011/10/25 06:00'],"['2011/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.23380 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Sep;59(3):436-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.23380.

At the crux of this issue is a dysregulation of energy intake and energy expenditure. This review will provide an overview on energy and nutrient balance. We discuss energy balance studies in children using indirect and direct measures, and focus particularly on obesity as a deleterious consequence in childhood survivors of cancer. Obesity affects 11-57% of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, probably due to increased energy intake and reduced energy expenditure secondary to reduced habitual activity caused by fatigue. However, most of the studies in children with leukemia are retrospective, use BMI as a measure of obesity, and are inconclusive about the impact of the type of treatment on the development of obesity later in life. To better understand the etiology of obesity in both healthy and sick children, we need to undertake nutrient balance studies with appropriate measures of fat mass and fat distribution while keeping in mind the influence of normal tissue growth and puberty on energy balance.","['Tam, Charmaine S', 'Ravussin, Eric']","['Tam CS', 'Ravussin E']","['Pennington Biomedical Research Center, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70808, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20111020,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Child', '*Energy Metabolism', 'Humans', 'Obesity/etiology/*metabolism']",PMC4215728,2011/10/25 06:00,2012/01/13 06:00,['2011/10/25 06:00'],"['2011/09/06 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.23375 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Jan;58(1):154-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.23375.

METHODS: Sociodemographic data, including education, were reported by the patient at trial enrollment. Cox proportional hazards model stratified by treatment arm/study was used to examine the effect of education on survival among patients with early stage and metastatic breast cancer, after adjustment for known prognostic factors. RESULTS: The patient population included 1020 patients with metastatic disease and 5146 patients with early stage disease. Among metastatic patients, factors associated with poorer survival in the final multivariable model included African American race, never married, negative estrogen receptor status, prior hormonal therapy, visceral involvement, and bone involvement. Among early stage patients, significant factors associated with poorer survival included African American race, separated/widowed, post/perimenopausal, negative/unknown estrogen receptor status, negative progesterone receptor status, >4 positive nodes, tumor diameter >2 cm, and education. Having not completed high school was associated with poorer survival among early stage patients. Among metastatic patients, non-African American women who lacked a high school degree had poorer survival than other non-African American women, and African American women who lacked a high school education had better survival than educated African American women. CONCLUSIONS: Having less than a high school education is a risk factor for death among patients with early stage breast cancer who participated in a clinical trial, with its impact among metastatic patients being less clear. Post-trial survivorship plans need to focus on women with low social status, as measured by education.","['Herndon, James E 2nd', 'Kornblith, Alice B', 'Holland, Jimmie C', 'Paskett, Electra D']","['Herndon JE 2nd', 'Kornblith AB', 'Holland JC', 'Paskett ED']","['Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA. james.herndon@duke.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20111020,England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,,IM,"['Adult', 'African Americans/statistics & numerical data', 'Aged', 'Breast Neoplasms/ethnology/*mortality', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Educational Status', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Factors', '*Social Class', 'Survival Rate', 'United States/epidemiology']",PMC3920288,2011/10/25 06:00,2013/08/01 06:00,['2011/10/25 06:00'],"['2011/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/05 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pon.2094 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2013 Feb;22(2):315-23. doi: 10.1002/pon.2094.

METHODS: This was a prospective study in which DNA was purified in peripheral blood from patients with colon cancer who received oxaliplatin. The primary endpoint was the development of severe (grade 2 lasting for >7 days or grade 3) OXCPN. For the discovery set, genotyping was done for 96 patients who received adjuvant fluorouracil and oxaliplatin using the a genome-wide human single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. An association between polymorphisms and severe OXCPN was investigated. At the same time, 247 patients who received oxaliplatin-based, first-line chemotherapy for advanced disease were enrolled as a validation set. RESULTS: Among the 32 genotyped candidate SNPs selected from the discovery set, 9 SNPs in 8 genes (tachykinin, precursor 1[TAC1]; forkhead box C1 [FOXC1]; integrin, alpha 1 [ITGA1]; acylphosphatase 2, muscle type [ACYP2]; deleted in lymphocytic leukemia, 7 [DLEU7]; B-cell translocation gene 4 [BTG4]; calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor 1 [CAMK2N1]; and phenylalanyl-tRNA synthase 2 [FARS2]) had nominal replication (P < .05). The most significant association was observed at reference SNP number (rs)10486003 in TAC1 (P = 4.84 x 10(-7)) in combined data from 2 sets. Five SNPs (rs10486003, rs2338, rs830884, rs843748, and rs797519) were significant in a multiple regression analysis (P < .05).

RESULTS: IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were present in 12 (7%) and 24 (14%) of patients, and IDH1 G105 SNP in 24 (14%). Overall, 52 (30%) patients had IDH gene alterations. There was no association with complete response (CR), remission duration, overall survival, and event-free survival and any of the IDH alterations, and no association with a higher CR rate or survival with the 4 regimens for the 52 patients with aberrant IDH. Among the patients with diploid karyotype and NPM1(mut) FLT3(WT) genotype, those with IDH1 or IDH2 mutations had an inferior outcome. CONCLUSIONS: IDH aberrations and IDH1 codon 105 SNP occur in about 30% of younger patients with AML, mostly with diploid karyotype. Using high-dose ara-C-based induction regimens, we did not detect an association with outcome for any of the aberrations.","['Ravandi, Farhad', 'Patel, Keyur', 'Luthra, Rajyalakshmi', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Brandt, Mark', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Kornblau, Steven', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Wang, Xuemei', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Ravandi F', 'Patel K', 'Luthra R', 'Faderl S', 'Konopleva M', 'Kadia T', 'Brandt M', 'Pierce S', 'Kornblau S', 'Andreeff M', 'Wang X', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Cortes J', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. fravandi@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111021,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

MYC can either activate or repress target genes by forming a complex with MAX (ref. 2). MYC also exerts MAX-independent functions that are not yet fully characterized(3). Cells possess an intrinsic pathway that can abrogate MYC-MAX dimerization and E-box interaction, by inducing phosphorylation of MYC in a PAK2-dependent manner at three residues located in its helix-loop-helix domain(4). Here we show that these carboxy-terminal phosphorylation events switch MYC from an oncogenic to a tumour-suppressive function. In undifferentiated cells, MYC-MAX is targeted to the promoters of retinoic-acid-responsive genes by its direct interaction with the retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARalpha). MYC-MAX cooperates with RARalpha to repress genes required for differentiation, in an E-box-independent manner. Conversely, on C-terminal phosphorylation of MYC during differentiation, the complex switches from a repressive to an activating function, by releasing MAX and recruiting transcriptional co-activators. Phospho-MYC synergizes with retinoic acid to eliminate circulating leukaemic cells and to decrease the level of tumour invasion. Our results identify an E-box-independent mechanism for transcriptional regulation by MYC that unveils previously unknown functions for MYC in differentiation. These may be exploited to develop alternative targeted therapies.","['Uribesalgo, Iris', 'Buschbeck, Marcus', 'Gutierrez, Arantxa', 'Teichmann, Sophia', 'Demajo, Santiago', 'Kuebler, Bernd', 'Nomdedeu, Josep F', 'Martin-Caballero, Juan', 'Roma, Guglielmo', 'Benitah, Salvador Aznar', 'Di Croce, Luciano']","['Uribesalgo I', 'Buschbeck M', 'Gutierrez A', 'Teichmann S', 'Demajo S', 'Kuebler B', 'Nomdedeu JF', 'Martin-Caballero J', 'Roma G', 'Benitah SA', 'Di Croce L']","['Centre de Regulacio Genomica and UPF, Barcelona 08003, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111023,England,Nat Cell Biol,Nature cell biology,100890575,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (MAX protein, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (p21-Activated Kinases)']",IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'E-Box Elements/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Homeostasis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology', 'p21-Activated Kinases/genetics/metabolism']",,2011/10/25 06:00,2012/01/27 06:00,['2011/10/25 06:00'],"['2011/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['ncb2355 [pii]', '10.1038/ncb2355 [doi]']",epublish,Nat Cell Biol. 2011 Oct 23;13(12):1443-9. doi: 10.1038/ncb2355.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated anti-proliferative, growth suppressive and/or pro-apoptotic effects of GS-HCl on YD-8 human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells. Fundamentally, treatment with GS-HCl strongly inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in YD-8 cells, as determined by MTS and DNA fragmentation analyses. Of further note, as measured by Western analyses, GS-HCl treatment led to activation of caspase-3, cytosolic accumulation of cytochrome c, down-regulation of Mcl-1 and HIF-1alpha, up-regulation of GRP78, an indicator of ER stress, and generation of ROS in YD-8 cells. Importantly, results of pharmacological inhibition studies showed that treatment with z-VAD-fmk, a pan-caspase inhibitor, but not with vitamin E, an anti-oxidant strongly blocked the GS-HCl-induced apoptosis in YD-8 cells. Analyses of additional cell culture works further revealed that GS-HCl had a strong growth suppressive effect on not only YD-8 but also YD-10B and YD-38, two other human OSCC cell lines. These findings collectively demonstrate that GS-HCl has anti-proliferative, anti-survival, and pro-apoptotic effects on YD-8 cells and the effects appear to be mediated via mechanisms associated with the mitochondrial-dependent activation of caspases, down-regulation of Mcl-1, and induction of ER stress. Considering HIF-1alpha as a tumor angiogenic transcription factor, the ability of GS-HCl to down-regulate HIF-1alpha in YD-8 cells may further support its anti-cancer property. It is thus suggested that GS-HCl may be used as a potential anti-cancer drug against human OSCC.","['Jung, Chang-Wook', 'Jo, Jeong-Rang', 'Lee, Sang-Han', 'Park, Yu-Kyoung', 'Jung, Nak-Kyun', 'Song, Dae-Kyu', 'Bae, JaeHoon', 'Nam, Ki-Young', 'Ha, Jung-Sook', 'Park, In-Sook', 'Park, Gy-Young', 'Jang, Byeong-Churl', 'Park, Jong-Wook']","['Jung CW', 'Jo JR', 'Lee SH', 'Park YK', 'Jung NK', 'Song DK', 'Bae J', 'Nam KY', 'Ha JS', 'Park IS', 'Park GY', 'Jang BC', 'Park JW']","['Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, School of Dentistry, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 700-412, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111013,England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'N08U5BOQ1K (Glucosamine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Glucosamine/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/*metabolism', 'Mouth Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2011/10/25 06:00,2012/05/04 06:00,['2011/10/25 06:00'],"['2011/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/28 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0887-2333(11)00271-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tiv.2011.10.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 2012 Feb;26(1):42-50. doi: 10.1016/j.tiv.2011.10.005.

The enhanced expression of CD200 on the tumors implies that anti-tumor responses can be enhanced by blockage of the CD200-CD200R interaction. Indeed, antibody-mediated blockade of the CD200-CD200R inhibitory axis is currently evaluated in clinical tests to boost immune responses against CD200-expressing tumors. Here, we show that mice lacking CD200, the exclusive ligand for CD200R, are resistant to chemical skin carcinogenesis. Importantly, CD200R controls tumor outgrowth independently of CD200 expression by the tumor cells themselves. Furthermore, Cd200(-/-) mice do not become tolerant to intranasally administered antigens, suggesting that tumor rejection is normally suppressed through CD200-induced immune tolerance. Decreased tumor outgrowth is accompanied by increased expression of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6 by the lymph node (LN) dendritic cells. During carcinogenesis, skin-draining LNs of Cd200(-/-) mice contain increased numbers of IL-17-producing FoxP3(+) cells, which preferentially home to the tumors. Thus, the CD200-CD200R axis induces tolerance to external and tumor antigens and influences the T-regulatory/Th17 cell ratio. We demonstrate for the first time that the absence of CD200R signaling inhibits outgrowth of an endogenous tumor irrespective of CD200 expression by the tumor cells. This important paradigm shift leads to a much broader applicability of CD200-blockade in the treatment of tumors.","['Rygiel, T P', 'Karnam, G', 'Goverse, G', 'van der Marel, A P J', 'Greuter, M J', 'van Schaarenburg, R A', 'Visser, W F', 'Brenkman, A B', 'Molenaar, R', 'Hoek, R M', 'Mebius, R E', 'Meyaard, L']","['Rygiel TP', 'Karnam G', 'Goverse G', 'van der Marel AP', 'Greuter MJ', 'van Schaarenburg RA', 'Visser WF', 'Brenkman AB', 'Molenaar R', 'Hoek RM', 'Mebius RE', 'Meyaard L']","['Department of Immunology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111024,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD200 receptor, mouse)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Foxp3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'UQ4V77A8VA (antigens, CD200)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/*immunology', 'Carcinogens/toxicity', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/chemically induced/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/immunology', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Lymph Nodes/immunology/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Papilloma/*immunology/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'Skin Neoplasms/chemically induced/*immunology']",,2011/10/25 06:00,2012/08/30 06:00,['2011/10/25 06:00'],"['2011/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/30 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2011477 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2011.477 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2012 Jun 14;31(24):2979-88. doi: 10.1038/onc.2011.477.

As with other aging syndromes, evidence accumulated over the past several decades points to a DNA repair defect inherent in Down syndrome. This evidence has led us to suggest that Down syndrome results in reduced DNA base excision repair (BER) capacity, and that this contributes to the genomic instability and the aging phenotype of Down syndrome. We propose important roles for microRNA and/or folate metabolism and oxidative stress in the dysregulation of BER in Down syndrome. Further, we suggest these pathways are involved in the leukemogenesis of Down syndrome. We have reviewed the role of BER in the processing of oxidative stress, and the impact of folate depletion on BER capacity. Further, we have reviewed the role that loss of BER, specifically DNA polymerase beta, plays in accelerating the rate of aging. Like that seen in the DNA polymerase beta heterozygous mouse, the aging phenotype of Down syndrome is subtle, unlike the aging phenotypes seen in the classical progeroid syndromes and mouse models of aging. As such, Down syndrome may provide a model for elucidating some of the basic mechanisms of aging.","['Patterson, David', 'Cabelof, Diane C']","['Patterson D', 'Cabelof DC']","['Eleanor Roosevelt Institute, University of Denver, Denver, CO, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20111012,Ireland,Mech Ageing Dev,Mechanisms of ageing and development,0347227,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase beta)']",IM,"['Aging/*genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'DNA Polymerase beta/*genetics', '*DNA Repair', 'Down Syndrome/complications/enzymology/*genetics', 'Folic Acid/metabolism', 'Folic Acid Deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genomic Instability', '*Haploinsufficiency', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/genetics', 'Phenotype']",,2011/10/25 06:00,2012/09/15 06:00,['2011/10/25 06:00'],"['2011/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/20 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0047-6374(11)00158-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mad.2011.10.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Mech Ageing Dev. 2012 Apr;133(4):133-7. doi: 10.1016/j.mad.2011.10.001.

Serum levels of several cytokines are altered in patients with hematologic malignancies, and pretransplant cytokine levels seem to have a prognostic impact in patients treated with allogeneic stem cell transplantation. However, the cytokine system constitutes an interacting functional network, and it may therefore be more relevant to look at serum cytokine profiles rather than the serum levels of single cytokines in allotransplanted patients. We therefore investigated the pretransplantation serum levels of 35 cytokines in a group of 44 consecutive allogeneic stem cell transplantation patients, mainly with a primary diagnosis of acute leukemia. Serum samples were collected before the start of myeloablative conditioning therapy when all patients were in complete hematologic remission. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis identified three major patient groups/subsets. These groups differed especially in the levels of hepatocyte growth factor and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, and one of the groups was characterized by low early treatment-related morbidity and high levels of hepatocyte growth factor and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor. The degree of weight gain/fluid retention after conditioning therapy did not differ between the patient subsets, but fluid retention showed a significant correlation with pretransplantation serum levels of basic fibroblast growth factor. We conclude that the pretransplantation serum cytokine profile shows a considerable variation even between patients in complete hematologic remission and is associated with clinicopathologic features.","['Reikvam, Hakon', 'Mosevoll, Knut Anders', 'Melve, Guro Kristin', 'Gunther, Clara-Cecilie', 'Sjo, Malvin', 'Bentsen, Pal-Tore', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Reikvam H', 'Mosevoll KA', 'Melve GK', 'Gunther CC', 'Sjo M', 'Bentsen PT', 'Bruserud O']","['Division for Hematology, Institute of Medicine, University of Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111020,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cytokines/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood/diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Postoperative Complications/*blood/mortality', '*Preoperative Period', 'Remission Induction', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2011/10/25 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2011/10/25 06:00'],"['2011/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(11)00410-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.10.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2012 Feb;18(2):190-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.10.007.

The variability in chemoresistance of normal bone marrow precursors has been hypothesized as explanation for the variable CD34 mobilization in AML. In 37 patients with AML in CR, we determined the chemosensitivity of bone marrow clonogenic precursors to maphosphamide and etoposide, which was then correlated with the degree of CD34(+) mobilization. In an enlarged set of 49 patients, we also studied the importance of chemosensitivity of marrow precursors for disease-free survival and relapse incidence. Significant correlations were demonstrated between the peak number of CD34(+) cells and residual growth of colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) after maphosphamide (R = 0.550; p = 0.0003) and after etoposide (R = 0.793; p = 0.0003). It was possible to identify three groups of AML patients based on chemosensitivity. The mean CD34(+) peak was 33 x 10(6)/L in the hyperchemosensitive group, 141 x 10(6)/L in the normochemosensitive (p = 0.03), and 379 x 10(6)/L in the chemoresistant group (p = 0.002). Failed CD34(+) mobilization was observed in 72% of the hyperchemosensitive group, 23% of the normochemosensitive group, and 0% of the chemoresistant group (p = 0.001). Hyperchemosensitivity of CFU-GM, together with a low platelet count, were independent factors important in the failure of CD34(+) cell mobilization. A disease-free survival significantly inferior to that of all other patients was associated with chemoresistance of CFU-GM (log rank, p = 0.030) and with chemoresistance of burst-forming unit erythroid (BFU-E) (log rank, p = 0.033). Chemoresistance of CFU-GM (p = 0.048) and BFU-E (p = 0.017) was also associated with increase relapse incidence. Nonleukemic nature of these precursors was demonstrated studying minimal residual disease from single colony cells. In conclusion, we found that hyperchemosensitivity of normal nonleukemic CFU-GM is associated with a high risk of CD34(+) cell mobilization failure, while a chemoresistant pattern in CFU-GM and BFU-E is associated with poor disease-free survival and increased cumulative incidence of relapse.","['Milone, Giuseppe', 'Avola, Giuseppe', 'Leotta, Salvatore', 'Strano, Aurora', 'Camuglia, Maria Grazia', 'Pinto, Valeria', 'Mercurio, Salvatore', 'Poidomani, Massimo', 'Coppoletta, Stefania', 'Di Marco, Anna Lia', 'Consoli, Carla', 'Triolo, Anna', 'Spadaro, Andrea', 'Privitera, Antonella', 'Ragusa, Angela', 'Tibullo, Daniele', 'Di Mercurio, Sandra']","['Milone G', 'Avola G', 'Leotta S', 'Strano A', 'Camuglia MG', 'Pinto V', 'Mercurio S', 'Poidomani M', 'Coppoletta S', 'Di Marco AL', 'Consoli C', 'Triolo A', 'Spadaro A', 'Privitera A', 'Ragusa A', 'Tibullo D', 'Di Mercurio S']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Department of Hematology, Azienda Ospedaliera Policlinico-Vittorio Emanuele, Catania, Italy. giuseppe.milone@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111020,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Clone Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Young Adult']",,2011/10/25 06:00,2012/02/02 06:00,['2011/10/25 06:00'],"['2009/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/06 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(11)00499-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2011.10.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2012 Jan;40(1):35-47.e2. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2011.10.002.

PSIP1 gene products were shown to be involved in transcriptional regulation, affecting a plethora of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, cell survival, and stress response. Furthermore, LEDGF/p75 has implications for various diseases and infections, including autoimmunity, leukemia, embryo development, psoriasis, and human immunodeficiency virus integration. Here, we reported the first characterization of the PSIP1 promoter. Using 5' RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends, we identified novel transcription start sites in different cell types. Using a luciferase reporter system, we identified regulatory elements controlling the expression of LEDGF/p75 and p52. These include (i) minimal promoters (-112/+59 and +609/+781) that drive the basal expression of LEDGF/p75 and of the shorter splice variant p52, respectively; (ii) a sequence (+319/+397) that may control the ratio of LEDGF/p75 expression to p52 expression; and (iii) a strong enhancer (-320/-207) implicated in the modulation of LEDGF/p75 transcriptional activity. Computational, biochemical, and genetic approaches enabled us to identify the transcription factor Sp1 as a key modulator of the PSIP1 promoter, controlling LEDGF/p75 transcription through two binding sites at -72/-64 and -46/-36. Overall, our results provide initial data concerning LEDGF/p75 promoter regulation, giving new insights to further understand its biological function and opening the door for new therapeutic strategies in which LEDGF/p75 is involved.","['Desfarges, Sebastien', 'Abderrahmani, Amar', 'Hernandez-Novoa, Beatriz', 'Munoz, Miguel', 'Ciuffi, Angela']","['Desfarges S', 'Abderrahmani A', 'Hernandez-Novoa B', 'Munoz M', 'Ciuffi A']","['Institute of Microbiology, University Hospital Center and University of Lausanne, Bugnon 48, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111012,England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (lens epithelium-derived growth factor)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', '*TATA Box', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,2011/10/25 06:00,2012/01/14 06:00,['2011/10/25 06:00'],"['2011/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/12 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-2836(11)01134-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmb.2011.10.010 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2011 Nov 25;414(2):177-93. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2011.10.010.

This study compares racial differences in childhood cancer rates as estimated by case-control studies with various design features. It also compares estimates of racial distribution among cases as reported by case-control studies to those observed for an ideal case series with complete ascertainment of cases for these studies or in population-based cancer registries in corresponding geographic regions and calendar periods. METHODS: Peer-reviewed publications on childhood leukemia and brain tumors from North America, published between 1980 and 2007, were reviewed. Incidence data by race/ethnicity were compiled from research publications, federal cancer statistics, and cancer registries. Meta-analysis was conducted to assess racial/ethnic differences by study characteristics. Racial distributions of cases from published case-control studies were compared to those of a presumably noncensored case distribution (i.e. include both participating and non-participating cases in a case-control study) or cases recorded by cancer registries. RESULTS: In interview-based case-control studies of childhood cancer, the proportion of Whites compared to non-Whites tended to be higher among controls than among cases; however, the opposite was true for record-based case-control studies. Additionally, the proportion of Whites tended to be higher among the participating cases in the published case-control studies compared to the proportion of Whites among the non-participating cases or in cancer registries. CONCLUSIONS: Investigators need to consider differential participation by racial group as a potential source of bias in the interpretation of case-control study results.","['Slusky, Danna A', 'Mezei, Gabor', 'Metayer, Catherine', 'Selvin, Steve', 'Von Behren, Julie', 'Buffler, Patricia A']","['Slusky DA', 'Mezei G', 'Metayer C', 'Selvin S', 'Von Behren J', 'Buffler PA']","['School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94704, USA. dannaaharon@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111021,Netherlands,Cancer Epidemiol,Cancer epidemiology,101508793,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Brain Neoplasms/epidemiology/*ethnology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*ethnology', 'North America/epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'SEER Program', 'Young Adult']",,2011/10/25 06:00,2012/07/04 06:00,['2011/10/25 06:00'],"['2010/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/05 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S1877-7821(11)00086-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canep.2011.05.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol. 2012 Feb;36(1):36-44. doi: 10.1016/j.canep.2011.05.005.

Most studies show no increased risk with family history of cancer. Non-malignant diseases such as allergic diseases, autoimmune diseases, birth defects and thyroid diseases have been reported to be associated with ALL. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study of family history of cancer and selected non-malignant conditions (allergic diseases, autoimmune diseases, birth defects, and thyroid diseases). ALL cases were obtained from Children's Cancer Group institutions from January 1989 to June 1993. Controls were recruited via random digit dialing. Family history for first degree relatives and grandparents of ALL cases and controls was collected by structured telephone questionnaires. Conditional logistical regression was used to calculate odds ratios adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: We found a borderline association of ALL and having a family member with a history of cancer in cases (n=1842) compared to controls (n=1986) (OR=0.98, 95%CI=0.93, 1.00) and an inverse association for esophageal cancer based on small numbers. Family history of food and drug allergies demonstrated a modestly reduced risk (OR=0.83, 95%CI=0.73, 0.95) as did family history of rheumatoid arthritis (OR=0.79, 95%CI=0.65, 0.96). There were no associations with family history of any autoimmune diseases, immunodeficiencies, birth defects, thyroid diseases and risk of childhood ALL. CONCLUSIONS: These results show no association of overall family history of cancer with childhood ALL, while providing additional evidence for an inverse association with family history of allergic disease. Two potentially new associations of ALL with family history of esophageal cancer and rheumatoid arthritis require confirmation in other studies and validation with medical records.","['Zierhut, Heather', 'Linet, Martha S', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Severson, Richard K', 'Spector, Logan']","['Zierhut H', 'Linet MS', 'Robison LL', 'Severson RK', 'Spector L']","['University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, MMC 715 420 Delaware Street, SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. zier0034@umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111021,Netherlands,Cancer Epidemiol,Cancer epidemiology,101508793,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Family Health', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Risk Factors']",PMC3962042,2011/10/25 06:00,2012/07/04 06:00,['2011/10/25 06:00'],"['2010/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/04 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S1877-7821(11)00104-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canep.2011.06.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol. 2012 Feb;36(1):45-51. doi: 10.1016/j.canep.2011.06.004.

The majority of patients can be cured with either fertility-preserving surgery alone or a combination of surgery and chemotherapy. Relapses occur in 10% to 20% of patients, and the significant proportion of them can be salvaged with chemotherapy. There is no evidence that treatment for malignant ovarian germ cell tumors will adversely affect menstrual or reproductive functions, increase future pregnancy loss, or increase the risk of congenital malformations of the fetus. Late effects, such as secondary leukemia, from chemotherapy are reported but rare. TARGET AUDIENCE: Obstetricians & Gynecologists and Family Physicians.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the risk of developing subsequent primary cancers among people with cutaneous melanoma. METHODS: Using 1992 to 2006 data from the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program, 40,881 people with in situ melanoma and 76,041 people with invasive melanoma were followed up (mean of 5.6 years) for the development of subsequent primary cancers. The observed number of subsequent cancers was compared with those expected based on age-/race-/year-/site-specific rates in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results population. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) (SIR = observed number/expected number) were considered statistically significant if they differed from 1, with an alpha level of 0.05. RESULTS: After a first primary in situ melanoma, risk was significantly elevated for subsequent invasive melanoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia among men (SIRs = 8.43 and 1.44, respectively) and women (SIRs = 12.33 and 1.79, respectively). After a first primary invasive melanoma, risk was significantly elevated for subsequent invasive melanoma, thyroid cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia among both men (SIRs = 12.50, 2.67, 1.56, and 1.57, respectively) and women (SIRs = 15.67, 1.77, 1.42, and 1.63, respectively). LIMITATIONS: Case ascertainment issues particularly affecting in situ melanoma cases could affect results. The role of detection bias in the diagnoses of some subsequent cancers cannot be completely eliminated. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the study should guide the development of strategies such as posttreatment surveillance, screening, and ultraviolet exposure education among melanoma survivors to improve cancer survivorship.","['Balamurugan, Appathurai', 'Rees, Judy R', 'Kosary, Carol', 'Rim, Sun Hee', 'Li, Jun', 'Stewart, Sherri L']","['Balamurugan A', 'Rees JR', 'Kosary C', 'Rim SH', 'Li J', 'Stewart SL']","['Department of Family and Preventive Medicine, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas 72205, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Am Acad Dermatol,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,7907132,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/epidemiology/etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Melanoma/*epidemiology/etiology/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/etiology/pathology', 'Risk Factors', 'SEER Program', 'Sex Factors', 'Skin Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology/pathology', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,2011/11/02 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/10/25 06:00'],"['2011/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/28 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S0190-9622(11)00612-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jaad.2011.04.033 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Acad Dermatol. 2011 Nov;65(5 Suppl 1):S69-77. doi: 10.1016/j.jaad.2011.04.033.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2011 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.

Specially, we focus on polyploidisation, a unique form of the cell cycle that allows MKs to increase their DNA content, and the genes that regulate this process. In addition, because MKs have an important role in the pathogenesis of acute megakaryocytic leukaemia and a subset of myeloproliferative neoplasms, including essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis, we discuss the biology and genetics of these disorders.

MLL encodes a large histone methyltransferase that directly binds DNA and positively regulates gene transcription, including homeobox (HOX) genes. MLL is involved in chromosomal translocations, partial tandem duplications, and amplifications, all of which result in hematopoietic malignancies due to sustained HOX expression and stalled differentiation. MLL lesions are associated with both acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoid leukemia and are usually associated with a relatively poor prognosis despite improved treatment options such as allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which underscores the need for new treatment regimens. Recent advances have begun to reveal the molecular mechanisms that drive MLL-associated leukemias, which, in turn, have provided opportunities for therapeutic development. Here, we discuss the etiology of MLL leukemias and potential directions for future therapy.","['Muntean, Andrew G', 'Hess, Jay L']","['Muntean AG', 'Hess JL']","['Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA. andrewmu@umich.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20111017,United States,Annu Rev Pathol,Annual review of pathology,101275111,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Histone Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Genes, Homeobox', 'Histone Methyltransferases', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/therapy', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/therapy', 'Translocation, Genetic']",PMC3381338,2011/10/25 06:00,2013/04/13 06:00,['2011/10/25 06:00'],"['2011/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1146/annurev-pathol-011811-132434 [doi]'],ppublish,Annu Rev Pathol. 2012;7:283-301. doi: 10.1146/annurev-pathol-011811-132434.

The study aim was to evaluate the effect of both ACE I/D polymorphism and ACE serum levels on the clinical outcomes of critically ill septic patients. METHODS: This study recruited 186 Caucasian patients with sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock. Epidemiological, clinical data, co-morbidities and severity scores were recorded. Measurements of serum ACE activity and genotyping for ACE I/D polymorphism were carried out. Primary outcomes were the 28- and the 90-day mortality; secondary outcomes included the number of days without renal or cardiovascular failure and ventilation-free days over the 28-day period following study enrolment. RESULTS: Neither 28- nor 90-day mortality were associated with ACE I/D polymorphism (p=0.59 and 0.34, respectively) or circulating ACE levels (p=0.17 and 0.25, respectively). Similarly, ACE polymorphism and levels were not related to ventilation-free days (p=0.14 and 0.25, respectively), days without cardiovascular failure (p=0.14 and 0.81, respectively) and days without renal failure (p=0.64 and 0.27, respectively).

Next-generation sequencing for molecular TET2 mutations was performed in 37/50 del(TET2) patients. We identified TET2 deletions in 50/893 patients (26 males, 24 females; 44-87 years) resulting in a 5.6% frequency [22/425 AML (5.2%), 15/217 chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML; 6.9%), 9/188 myelodysplastic syndromes (4.8%), 4/63 myeloproliferative neoplasms (6.3%)].

In de novo AML with intermediate cytogenetics, presence of any TET2 alteration was related to worse median overall survival (347 d vs. not reached; P = 0.052) and event-free survival (164 vs. 457 d; P = 0.024). JAK2(V617F) was found in 6/18 (33.3%) del(TET2) cases analysed.

METHODS: Seventy-two children with ALL and 109 age- and sex-matched healthy children from Western Iran were screened for MTHFR C677T and A1298C variants by using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). RESULTS: The frequencies of MTHFR 677T and 1298C alleles in patients were 29.9% and 43.1%, respectively, that were higher than those in controls (24.8% and 38.1%, respectively).

METHOD: The realgar which was used in the study contains 90% insoluble asenic sulfide (As2S2) and 1.696 mg x kg(-1) soluble arsenic. Two separate experiments were performed: 1) Twenty-eight fasting SD rats were orally given a single dose of realgar at the dose of 0.8 g x kg(-1) and the other four rats were given ultra-filtrated water served as control group. Blood, hearts, livers, kidneys, lungs and brains of four rats were taken out at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 36 h respectively after treatment. Asenic quantity of each organ or blood sample was measured. 2) Forty SD rats were randomly divided into four groups: control group and realgar 0.02, 0.08, 0.16 g x kg(-1) groups, each group containing 5 females and 5 males. The rats were intra-gastrically treated with realgar once a day for successively 90 days, while the control group was given ultra-filtrated water. Asenic amount in blood, liver, kidney and brain of each rat was measured in fasting rats at 16 h after last dosing. RESULT: Asenic amount of blood, liver, kidney, heart, lung and brain increased after single dosing of realgar at dose of 0.16 g x kg(-1), with the order from high to low blood > kidney > lung > liver > heart > brain. Asenic amount was much higher in blood than that in other organs. The feature of asenic distribution in blood following realgar administration may be the basis for its use for leukemia Ninety-day oral treatment of realgar led to significant accumulation of asenic in blood, kidney, liver and brain. The highest asenic accumulation times was found in kidney followed by liver, which was assumed to be associated with nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity of realgar. The highest amount of asenic was observed in blood after 90 day's administration of realgar, and the amount of asenic in organs was in the order of blood > kidney > liver > brain. CONCLUSION: Asenic can be absorbed and extensively distributed in various organs or tissesses after realgar administration in rats.

METHOD: A CD63-GFP plasmid was constructed and introduced steadily into rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells. The movements of CD63-GFP, which was located on both the granule membranes and the plasma membranes of RBL cells stimulated by Compound 48/80, were studied by confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) and total internal reflection fluorescence microscope (TIRFM) both inside and on the surface of living RBL-2H3 cells. RESULT: Before antigen stimulation, most granules with CD63-GFP hardly moved in RBL cells. However, after antigen stimulation, the granules moved dramatically. They reached the plasma membranes in a few minutes and fused with them instantaneously. The velocity of the granule movement toward the plasma membranes on antigen stimulation was calculated to be 0.05 micron x s(-1). CONCLUSION: Analysis of the movement of each granule provided a new insight into the elementary process of degranulation. The method is rapid, sensitive and reliable, which could be used as a new detection method for anaphylactoid reaction in vitro.","['Hu, Jianjiang', 'Hou, Yanming', 'Zhang, Qian', 'Lei, Hongtao', 'Wang, Yi', 'Wang, Danqiao']","['Hu J', 'Hou Y', 'Zhang Q', 'Lei H', 'Wang Y', 'Wang D']","['Experimental Research Center, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China. jianjianghu1982@yahoo.com.cn']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi,Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica,8913656,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cd63 protein, rat)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Tetraspanin 30)']",IM,"['Anaphylaxis/diagnosis/*immunology/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics', '*Cell Degranulation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Mast Cells/*cytology/*immunology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Rats', 'Tetraspanin 30', 'Time Factors']",,2011/10/25 06:00,2011/11/15 06:00,['2011/10/25 06:00'],"['2011/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi. 2011 Jul;36(14):1860-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been reported as deregulated in diverse cancer types. Here, BAG1 protein was found highly expressed in children with acute myeloid leukemia at diagnosis, and in a cohort of leukemic cell lines. A silencing approach was used for determining BAG1's role in AML, finding that its down-regulation decreased expression of BCL2, BCL-XL, MCL1, and phospho-ERK1/2, all proteins able to sustain leukemia, without affecting the pro-apoptotic protein BAX. BAG1 down-regulation was also found to increase expression of BAG3, whose similar activity was able to compensate the loss of function of BAG1. BAG1/BAG3 co-silencing caused an enhanced cell predisposition to death in cell lines and also in primary AML cultures, affecting the same proteins. Cell death was CASPASE-3 dependent, was accompanied by PARP cleavage and documented by an increased release of pro-apoptotic molecules Smac/DIABLO and Cytochrome c. BAG1 was found to directly maintain BCL2 and to protect MCL1 from proteasomal degradation by controlling USP9X expression, which appeared to be its novel target. Finally, BAG1 was found able to affect leukemia cell fate by influencing the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins crucial for AML maintenance.","['Aveic, Sanja', 'Pigazzi, Martina', 'Basso, Giuseppe']","['Aveic S', 'Pigazzi M', 'Basso G']","['Hematology-Oncology Laboratory, Pediatrics Department, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111010,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BAG3 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2-associated athanogene 1 protein)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (USP9X protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Child', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Silencing', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Proteolysis', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase/metabolism']",PMC3189928,2011/10/22 06:00,2012/02/14 06:00,['2011/10/22 06:00'],"['2011/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0026097 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-11177 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(10):e26097. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0026097.

Single cell network profiling (SCNP) utilizing flow cytometry measures alterations in signaling biology in the context of molecular changes occurring in malignancies. In this study SCNP was used to identify proteomic profiles associated with in vitro apoptotic responsiveness of CLL B cells to fludarabine, as a basis for ultimately linking these with clinical outcome. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: SCNP was used to quantify modulated-signaling of B cell receptor (BCR) network proteins and in vitro F-ara-A mediated apoptosis in 23 CLL samples. Of the modulators studied the reactive oxygen species, hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), a known intracellular second messenger and a general tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor stratified CLL samples into two sub-groups based on the percentage of B cells in a CLL sample with increased phosphorylation of BCR network proteins. Separately, in the same patient samples, in vitro exposure to F-ara-A also identified two sub-groups with B cells showing competence or refractoriness to apoptotic induction. Statistical analysis showed that in vitro F-ara-A apoptotic proficiency was highly associated with the proficiency of CLL B cells to undergo H(2)O(2)-augmented signaling. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This linkage in CLL B cells among the mechanisms governing chemotherapy-induced apoptosis increased signaling of BCR network proteins and a likely role of phosphatase activity suggests a means of stratifying patients for their response to F-ara-A based regimens. Future studies will examine the clinical applicability of these findings and also the utility of this approach in relating mechanism to function of therapeutic agents.","['Palazzo, Adam L', 'Evensen, Erik', 'Huang, Ying-Wen', 'Cesano, Alessandra', 'Nolan, Garry P', 'Fantl, Wendy J']","['Palazzo AL', 'Evensen E', 'Huang YW', 'Cesano A', 'Nolan GP', 'Fantl WJ']","['Nodality Inc., South San Francisco, California, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111010,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Proteome)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proteome/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/immunology', '*Single-Cell Analysis', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",PMC3189964,2011/10/22 06:00,2012/02/14 06:00,['2011/10/22 06:00'],"['2011/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0024592 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-05419 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(10):e24592. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0024592.

LOH in chromosome 6p, on which the HLA genes are located, can give rise to false homozygosity results in HLA genotyping of patients with hematologic malignancies. Here we report false homozygosity results in HLA genotyping due to the loss of whole chromosome 6 in the neoplastic cells of a patient with ALL. A 33-yr-old Korean female patient was admitted for the evaluation of leukocytosis detected during a workup for headache. Her initial white blood cell count was 336.9x10(9)/L with 84% of blasts in the differential count. Precursor-B lymphoblastic leukemia was diagnosed from a subsequent bone marrow study. HLA high-resolution genotyping of the patient was requested at the time of diagnosis for possible hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Homozygosity results (A(*)02:01, B(*)54:01, C(*)08:01, DQB1(*)04:01) were obtained, except for the DRB1 locus (DRB1(*)04:05, DRB1(*)11:01), in sequence-based typing. Conventional karyotyping of bone marrow metaphase cells revealed chromosomal abnormalities, with loss of multiple chromosomes including chromosome 6, and reduplication of the remaining chromosomes: 29,X,+X,+8,inv(9)(p11q13),+10,+14,+18,+21[15]/58,idemX2[3]/46,XX,inv(9)[2].

We explored the status of Tregs in neoplastic and autoimmune hematologic diseases. We also evaluated the technical aspects of Treg measurement in terms of sample type and detection markers. METHODS: A total of 68 subjects were enrolled: 11 with AML, 8 with MDS, 10 with autoimmune diseases, and 39 controls. Tregs were analyzed in peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) samples from each subject. Flow cytometry and the Human Regulatory T cell Staining Kit (eBioscience, USA) for CD4, CD25, and FoxP3 (forkhead box P3) were used. RESULTS: The CD4+CD25(high)/CD4 and CD4+CD25(high)FoxP3+/CD4 populations were significantly correlated (P<0.0001). The AML and high-risk MDS groups had significantly larger CD4+CD25(high)/CD4 and CD4+CD25(high)FoxP3+/CD4 populations in PB than the autoimmune (P=0.007 and 0.012, respectively) and control groups (P=0.004 and 0.006, respectively). Comparable findings were observed in BM. The CD4+CD25(high)FoxP3+/CD4 population was significantly larger in PB than in BM (P=0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides comparison data for Tregs in AML, MDS, and autoimmune hematologic diseases, and would be helpful for understanding the different immunologic bases of various hematologic diseases. Treg measurement using CD4, CD25, and/or FoxP3 in PB rather than in BM seems to be practical for routine hematologic purposes.

METHODS: We reviewed the clinical data, laboratory findings, bone marrow findings, and cytogenetic analysis of elderly patients (>/= 60 years) with ALL, and data of an additional 101 younger adult patients (< 60 years) with ALL were reviewed for comparison. RESULTS: Twenty-six elderly patients (>/= 60 years) and 101 younger adult patients (< 60 years) with ALL were retrospectively enrolled. The median follow-up duration was 6.0 months (range, 0.4 to 113.2) in the elderly patients and 21.7 months (range, 1.0 to 122.7) in the adult patients. In total, 34.6% (9 patients) of the elderly patients and 24.8% (25 patients) of the adult patients had Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL. The overall complete remission (CR) rate was much higher in the younger than in the elderly patients (94.1% vs. 57.7%, p < 0.001). The median overall survival (OS) of the younger patients (< 60 years) was 26.3 months, whereas that of the elderly patients (>/= 60 years) was 10.3 months (p = 0.003). In the elderly patients with ALL, T cell lineage and the presence of lymphadenopathy were significant prognostic factors for OS in a univariate analysis (p = 0.033 and 0.041, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes of Korean elderly patients with ALL were poor, and the shorter OS was mainly due to the low CR rate.

There are currently no options to preserve the fertility of prepubertal boys who are not yet making sperm. Cryopreservation of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs, obtained via testicular biopsy) followed by autologous transplantation back into the testes at a later date may restore fertility in these patients. However, this approach carries an inherent risk of reintroducing cancer. METHODS: To address this aspect of SSC transplantation safety, prepubertal non-human primate testis cell suspensions were inoculated with MOLT4 T-lymphoblastic leukemia cells and subsequently sorted for cell surface markers CD90 (THY-1) and CD45. RESULTS: Cancer cells segregated to the CD90-/CD45+ fraction and produced tumors in nude mice. Nearly all sorted DEAD box polypeptide 4-positive (VASA+) spermatogonia segregated to the CD90+/CD45- fraction. In a preliminary experiment, a purity check of the sorted putative stem cell fraction (CD90+/CD45-) revealed 0.1% contamination with cancer cells, which was sufficient to produce tumors in nude mice. We hypothesized that the contamination resulted from mis-sorting due to cell clumping and employed singlet discrimination (SD) in four subsequent experiments. Purity checks revealed no cancer cell contamination in the CD90+/CD45- fraction from three of the four SD replicates and these fractions produced no tumors when transplanted into nude mouse testes. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that spermatogonia can be separated from contaminating malignant cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting prior to SSC transplantation and that post-sorting purity checks are required to confirm elimination of malignant cells.","['Hermann, Brian P', 'Sukhwani, Meena', 'Salati, Jennifer', 'Sheng, Yi', 'Chu, Tianjiao', 'Orwig, Kyle E']","['Hermann BP', 'Sukhwani M', 'Salati J', 'Sheng Y', 'Chu T', 'Orwig KE']","['Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology & Reproductive Sciences, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111020,England,Hum Reprod,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",8701199,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Separation/*methods', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Fertility Preservation/*methods', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Male', 'Sexual Maturation', 'Spermatogonia/*cytology/transplantation', 'Testis/*cytology', 'Tissue Preservation']",PMC3212882,2011/10/22 06:00,2012/08/10 06:00,['2011/10/22 06:00'],"['2011/10/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/10 06:00 [medline]']","['der343 [pii]', '10.1093/humrep/der343 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Reprod. 2011 Dec;26(12):3222-31. doi: 10.1093/humrep/der343.

However, in the absence of inflammatory conditions, cooperation between CD4 and CD8 T cells likely is required for an effective primary CD8 T cell response directed against allo-HLA class I. In this study we investigated whether a coordinated response of CD8 and CD4 T cells could be demonstrated in an HLA class I-directed immune response in a patient who developed severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after the administration HLA-A2-mismatched donor lymphocyte infusion in the absence of inflammatory conditions. A previously administered donor lymphocyte infusion from the same donor did not lead to an immune response, excluding the presence of a substantial pool of CD8 T cells cross-reactive against HLA-A2 within the memory T cell compartment of the donor. Analysis of isolated donor CD8 and CD4 T cell clones activated during the GVHD revealed a polyclonal CD8 T cell response directed against the mismatched HLA-A2 and a polyclonal CD4 T cell response recognizing HLA-A2-derived peptides presented in HLA class II. In addition, leukemic blasts present at the time of the emergence of GVHD expressed HLA-A2 and HLA class II and could activate both the CD4 and CD8 alloreactive T cells. Our results demonstrate that the GVHD was mediated by a cooperative CD4 and CD8 response directed against the mismatched HLA-A2 and suggest that leukemic blasts possibly activated this CD8 and CD4 T cell response.","['Amir, Avital L', 'Hagedoorn, Renate S', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs, Simone A P', 'Marijt, Erik W A', 'Kruisselbrink, Alwine B', 'Frederik Falkenburg, J H', 'Heemskerk, Mirjam H M']","['Amir AL', 'Hagedoorn RS', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs SA', 'Marijt EW', 'Kruisselbrink AB', 'Frederik Falkenburg JH', 'Heemskerk MH']","['Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111019,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology/pathology', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/therapy', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Stem Cell Transplantation']",,2011/10/22 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2011/10/22 06:00'],"['2011/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(11)00421-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.10.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2012 Feb;18(2):210-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.10.018.

We performed a retrospective analysis of RIC HCST using double UCB (dUCB) grafts and RIC HSCT using unrelated donor (URD) grafts. The study included 64 dUCB transplantations and 221 URD transplantations performed at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital between 2004 and 2008. The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 14.1% for dUCB and 20.3% for URD (P = .32). The 2-year cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was significantly lower in dUCB compared with URD (21.9% versus 53.9%; P < .0001). The 2-year cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality was significantly higher in dUCB (26.9% versus 10.4%; P = .0009). In our analysis, dUCB HSCT and URD HSCT had comparable 3-year overall survival (46% in dUCB and 50% in URD; P = .49) and progression-free survival (30% in dUCB and 40% in URD; P = .47). dUCBT was associated with greater nonrelapse mortality despite less chronic GVHD. Our findings suggest that the use of 2 partially matched UCB units appears to be a suitable alternative for patients undergoing RIC HSCT without an HLA-matched donor.","['Chen, Yi-Bin', 'Aldridge, Julie', 'Kim, Haesook T', 'Ballen, Karen K', 'Cutler, Corey', 'Kao, Grace', 'Liney, Deborah', 'Bourdeau, Greg', 'Alyea, Edwin P', 'Armand, Philippe', 'Koreth, John', 'Ritz, Jerome', 'Spitzer, Thomas R', 'Soiffer, Robert J', 'Antin, Joseph H', 'Ho, Vincent T']","['Chen YB', 'Aldridge J', 'Kim HT', 'Ballen KK', 'Cutler C', 'Kao G', 'Liney D', 'Bourdeau G', 'Alyea EP', 'Armand P', 'Koreth J', 'Ritz J', 'Spitzer TR', 'Soiffer RJ', 'Antin JH', 'Ho VT']","['Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02114, USA. ychen6@partners.org']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111019,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (HLA Antigens)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Unrelated Donors', 'Young Adult']",,2011/10/22 06:00,2013/05/04 06:00,['2011/10/22 06:00'],"['2011/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(11)00419-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.10.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2012 May;18(5):805-12. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.10.016.

Mortality from these conditions was as high as 90% in the case of metastatic choriocarcinoma. If lives could be saved, it was in the operating theater and often at the expense of future reproductive potential. By the 1940s, however, targeted chemotherapy was starting to be explored, and the development of methotrexate for the treatment of childhood leukemia in 1949 eventually resulted in an unexpected, but nevertheless long and happy association with the field of gynecology. Here we trace the origins of methotrexate and how it came to be an effective medical treatment for two life-threatening gynecologic conditions.

Malignant FL B cells are found admixed to specific stromal and immune cell subsets, in particular CD4(pos) T cells displaying phenotypic features of follicular helper T cells (T(FH)). The goal of our study was to functionally characterize intratumoral CD4(pos) T cells. We showed that CXCR5(hi)ICOS(hi)CD4(pos) T cells sorted from FL biopsies comprise at least two separate cell populations with distinct genetic and functional features: (i) CD25(pos) follicular regulatory T cells (T(FR)), and (ii) CD25(neg) T(FH) displaying a FL-B cell supportive activity without regulatory functions. Furthermore, despite their strong similarities with tonsil-derived T(FH), purified FL-derived T(FH) displayed a specific gene expression profile including an overexpression of several genes potentially involved directly or indirectly in lymphomagenesis, in particular TNF, LTA, IL4 or CD40LG. Interestingly, we further demonstrated that these two last signals efficiently rescued malignant B cells from spontaneous and rituximab-induced apoptosis. Altogether, our study demonstrates that tumor-infiltrating CD4(pos) T cells are more heterogeneous than previously presumed, and underlines for the first time the crucial role of T(FH) in the complex set of cellular interactions within FL microenvironment.","['Ame-Thomas, P', 'Le Priol, J', 'Yssel, H', 'Caron, G', 'Pangault, C', 'Jean, R', 'Martin, N', 'Marafioti, T', 'Gaulard, P', 'Lamy, T', 'Fest, T', 'Semana, G', 'Tarte, K']","['Ame-Thomas P', 'Le Priol J', 'Yssel H', 'Caron G', 'Pangault C', 'Jean R', 'Martin N', 'Marafioti T', 'Gaulard P', 'Lamy T', 'Fest T', 'Semana G', 'Tarte K']","['INSERM, UMR 917, Faculte de Medicine, Rennes, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111021,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CXCR5 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR5)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'CD4 Antigens/immunology', 'Cell Survival/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/immunology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Receptors, CXCR5/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*immunology']",PMC3428269,2011/10/22 06:00,2012/07/06 06:00,['2011/10/22 06:00'],"['2011/10/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011301 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.301 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 May;26(5):1053-63. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.301.

We uncovered that the activation of particular (proto-onco)genes is mediated by promoter hypomethylation. In search for therapeutic agents capable of targeting these potential cancer-promoting genes, we applied connectivity mapping on a gene expression signature based on the genes most significantly hypomethylated in t(4;11)-positive infant ALL as compared with healthy bone marrows. This analysis revealed histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors as suitable candidates to reverse the unfavorable gene signature. We show that HDAC inhibitors effectively induce leukemic cell death in t(4;11)-positive primary infant ALL cells, accompanied by downregulation of MYC, SET, RUNX1, RAN as well as the MLL-AF4 fusion product. Furthermore, DNA methylation was restored after HDAC inhibitor exposure. Our data underlines the essential role for epigenetic de-regulation in MLL-rearranged ALL. Furthermore, we show, for the first time, that connectivity mapping can indirectly be applied on DNA methylation patterns, providing a rationale for HDAC inhibition in t(4;11)-positive leukemias. Given the presented potential of HDAC inhibitors to target important proto-oncogenes including the leukemia-specific MLL fusion in vitro, these agents should urgently be tested in in vivo models and subsequent clinical trials.","['Stumpel, D J P M', 'Schneider, P', 'Seslija, L', 'Osaki, H', 'Williams, O', 'Pieters, R', 'Stam, R W']","['Stumpel DJ', 'Schneider P', 'Seslija L', 'Osaki H', 'Williams O', 'Pieters R', 'Stam RW']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center, Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111021,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'DNA Methylation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,2011/10/22 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2011/10/22 06:00'],"['2011/10/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011278 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.278 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Apr;26(4):682-92. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.278.

Functionally, BMS-911543 displayed potent anti-proliferative and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects in cell lines dependent upon JAK2 signaling, and had little activity in cell types dependent upon other pathways, such as JAK1 and JAK3. BMS-911543 also displayed anti-proliferative responses in colony growth assays using primary progenitor cells isolated from patients with JAK2(V617F)-positive myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Similar to these in vitro observations, BMS-911543 was also highly active in in vivo models of JAK2 signaling, with sustained pathway suppression being observed after a single oral dose. At low dose levels active in JAK2-dependent PD models, no effects were observed in an in vivo model of immunosuppression monitoring antigen-induced IgG and IgM production. Expression profiling of JAK2(V617F)-expressing cells treated with diverse JAK2 inhibitors revealed a shared set of transcriptional changes underlying pharmacological effects of JAK2 inhibition, including many STAT1-regulated genes and STAT1 itself. Collectively, our results highlight BMS-911543 as a functionally selective JAK2 inhibitor and support the therapeutic rationale for its further characterization in patients with MPN or in other disorders characterized by constitutively active JAK2 signaling.","['Purandare, A V', 'McDevitt, T M', 'Wan, H', 'You, D', 'Penhallow, B', 'Han, X', 'Vuppugalla, R', 'Zhang, Y', 'Ruepp, S U', 'Trainor, G L', 'Lombardo, L', 'Pedicord, D', 'Gottardis, M M', 'Ross-Macdonald, P', 'de Silva, H', 'Hosbach, J', 'Emanuel, S L', 'Blat, Y', 'Fitzpatrick, E', 'Taylor, T L', 'McIntyre, K W', 'Michaud, E', 'Mulligan, C', 'Lee, F Y', 'Woolfson, A', 'Lasho, T L', 'Pardanani, A', 'Tefferi, A', 'Lorenzi, M V']","['Purandare AV', 'McDevitt TM', 'Wan H', 'You D', 'Penhallow B', 'Han X', 'Vuppugalla R', 'Zhang Y', 'Ruepp SU', 'Trainor GL', 'Lombardo L', 'Pedicord D', 'Gottardis MM', 'Ross-Macdonald P', 'de Silva H', 'Hosbach J', 'Emanuel SL', 'Blat Y', 'Fitzpatrick E', 'Taylor TL', 'McIntyre KW', 'Michaud E', 'Mulligan C', 'Lee FY', 'Woolfson A', 'Lasho TL', 'Pardanani A', 'Tefferi A', 'Lorenzi MV']","['Research and Development, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ 08543-4000, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111021,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring)', '0', '(N,N-dicyclopropyl-4-((1,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)amino)-6-ethyl-1-methyl-1,6-d', 'ihydroimidazo(4,5-d)pyrrolo(2,3b)pyridine-7-carboxamide)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/enzymology/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology']",,2011/10/22 06:00,2012/03/31 06:00,['2011/10/22 06:00'],"['2011/10/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011292 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.292 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Feb;26(2):280-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.292.

Since centrosomal proteins have been recurrently identified as translocation partners of tyrosine kinases FGFR1, JAK2, PDGFRalpha and PDGFRbeta in these diseases, a role for the centrosome in oncogenic transformation has been hypothesized. In this study, we addressed the functional role of centrosomally targeted tyrosine kinase activity. First, centrosomal localization was not routinely found for all chimeric fusion proteins tested. Second, targeting of tyrosine kinases to the centrosome by creating artificial chimeric fusion kinases with the centrosomal targeting domain of AKAP450 failed to enhance the oncogenic transforming potential in both Ba/F3 and U2OS cells, although phospho-tyrosine-mediated signal transduction pathways were initiated at the centrosome. We conclude that the centrosomal localization of constitutively activated tyrosine kinases does not contribute to disease pathogenesis in chronic myeloproliferative disorders.","['Bochtler, T', 'Kirsch, M', 'Maier, B', 'Bachmann, J', 'Klingmuller, U', 'Anderhub, S', 'Ho, A D', 'Kramer, A']","['Bochtler T', 'Kirsch M', 'Maier B', 'Bachmann J', 'Klingmuller U', 'Anderhub S', 'Ho AD', 'Kramer A']","['Clinical Cooperation Unit Molecular Hematology/Oncology, German Cancer Research Center, DKFZ and Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111021,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Centrosome/*physiology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Humans', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*complications', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*physiology', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/physiology', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta/physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",,2011/10/22 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2011/10/22 06:00'],"['2011/10/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011283 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.283 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Apr;26(4):728-35. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.283.

A molecular beacon (MB) which comprises a DNA loop section, a pair of fluorophore (tetramethoxyl rhodamine, TAMRA), and a quencher (4-(2-methyl-on-amino-azobenzene) benzoate, DABCYL) was designed. The loop sequence of MB was designed according to the DNA sequence relating to CML (type b3a2) which contained a single-stranded oligonucleotide. Before hybridization, the fluorescence from the TAMRA had been quenched by the DABCYL. After hybridization with the complementary DNA, the quencher will become far away from the TAMRA, and the fluorescence intensity detected will increase. Changes in the fluorescence intensity have a linear relationship with the concentration of complementary DNA (C) in the range of 4.0 x 10(-9)-3.2 x 10(-8) mol/L, with a correlation coefficient of 0.9973; the detection limit was 6.0 x 10(-10) mol/L (S/N = 3). The developed method has high selectivity, which can be used to discriminate single-base mismatch sequence.

METHODS: Between 1990 and 1996, 73 adult patients (from 211 adult transplant recipients) received TLI for recurrent rejection (71%), rejection with hemodynamic compromise (25%), and rejection with vasculitis (4%). The treatment consisted of 80 cGy twice per week for 5 weeks. Fifty-five patients received at least 80% of the full dose (>640 cGy). Follow-up ended December 31, 2007, comprising a total 18 year experience. RESULTS: Patients treated with TLI exhibited a short-term decrease in hazard for rejection in the first 12 months posttransplantation (relative risk, 0.36) but exhibited increased cumulative rejection over the long term. There were no differences in the rates of infection, allograft coronary disease, or malignancy, but seven patients developed myelodysplasia or acute myelogenous leukemia, four of those being the rare but uniformly fatal acute megakaryocytic leukemia type 7. CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated with TLI seemed to experience a reduction in the early hazard for rejection, but long-term outcomes indicate that such patients continued to accumulate more rejection and rejection-death events, likely because these patients were overall at much higher risk for rejection than the other patient groups. We observed minimal long-term complications, except for the unique occurrence of myelodysplasia and acute megakaryocytic leukemia type 7.","['Tallaj, Jose A', 'Pamboukian, Salpy V', 'George, James F', 'Brown, Robert N', 'Pajaro, Octavio E', 'Bourge, Robert C', 'Cadeiras, Martin', 'Smallfield, Melissa', 'Kirklin, James K', 'McGiffin, David C']","['Tallaj JA', 'Pamboukian SV', 'George JF', 'Brown RN', 'Pajaro OE', 'Bourge RC', 'Cadeiras M', 'Smallfield M', 'Kirklin JK', 'McGiffin DC']","['Division of Cardiovascular Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA. jtallaj@uab.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,,IM,"['Adult', 'Graft Rejection/prevention & control/*radiotherapy', 'Heart Transplantation/*mortality', 'Hemodynamics', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Irradiation', 'Paraproteinemias/etiology']",,2011/10/22 06:00,2011/12/28 06:00,['2011/10/22 06:00'],"['2011/10/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/TP.0b013e318231e9d3 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 2011 Nov 27;92(10):1159-64. doi: 10.1097/TP.0b013e318231e9d3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MMQ cells were treated with the ERalpha antagonist fulvestrant, then proliferation and PRL secretion were measured using MTS and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Levels of ERalpha, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and B cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) were measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. Fulvestrant acted as a potent inhibitor of ERalpha expression, and significantly inhibited cell proliferation (by up to 57.6+/-2.2%) and PRL secretion (by up to 81.0%). Fulvestrant also significantly altered the expression levels of VEGF, MMP-9 and BCL-2. We conclude that ERalpha plays an important functional role in pituitary prolactinomas and is also involved in the expression of particular growth factors, even in the absence of estrogen. Fulvestrant treatment may be an effective therapy for such tumors.","['Leng, Lige', 'Zhang, Yazhuo']","['Leng L', 'Zhang Y']","['Beijing Neurosurgical Institute, 6 Tiantan Xili, Chongwen District, Beijing 100050, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111019,Scotland,J Clin Neurosci,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,9433352,"['0 (Estrogen Antagonists)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '22X328QOC4 (Fulvestrant)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '9002-62-4 (Prolactin)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Estradiol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Estrogen Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha/metabolism', 'Fulvestrant', 'Humans', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/metabolism', 'Pituitary Gland/*drug effects', 'Prolactin/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism']",,2011/10/22 06:00,2012/07/20 06:00,['2011/10/22 06:00'],"['2011/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/14 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0967-5868(11)00438-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jocn.2011.06.013 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Neurosci. 2011 Dec;18(12):1694-8. doi: 10.1016/j.jocn.2011.06.013.

We conducted a retrospective analysis of secondary hyperprolactinemia in 106 patients who underwent surgery for non-PRL-secreting pituitary adenoma. The incidence of hyperprolactinemia was evaluated, and pituitary-stalk damage was assessed radiographically using MRI (size of tumor and extension type) and endocrinologically by monitoring hormonal function using a provocation test. The effect of a tumor-derived intrasellar factor, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), on hyperprolactinemia was also investigated. Hyperprolactinemia was observed in 31 of the 106 (29.2%) patients. It was not correlated with either physical stalk compression or endocrinological dysfunction. However, LIF expression was negatively correlated with the incidence of secondary hyperprolactinemia (p<0.01). Although secondary hyperprolactinemia might be caused by pituitary stalk damage, it is possible that LIF masks the effect.","['Kinoshita, Yasuyuki', 'Hama, Seiji', 'Tominaga, Atsushi', 'Arita, Kazunori', 'Sugiyama, Kazuhiko', 'Sakoguchi, Tetsuhiko', 'Usui, Satoshi', 'Kurisu, Kaoru']","['Kinoshita Y', 'Hama S', 'Tominaga A', 'Arita K', 'Sugiyama K', 'Sakoguchi T', 'Usui S', 'Kurisu K']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Hiroshima University, 1-2-3 Kasumi, Minami-Ku, Hiroshima 734-8551, Japan. y-kinoshita@hiroshima-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111019,Scotland,J Clin Neurosci,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,9433352,['9002-62-4 (Prolactin)'],IM,"['Adenoma/pathology/*surgery', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyperprolactinemia/blood/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pituitary Gland/*injuries/pathology/*surgery', 'Pituitary Neoplasms/pathology/*surgery', 'Prolactin/*blood/metabolism']",,2011/10/22 06:00,2012/07/20 06:00,['2011/10/22 06:00'],"['2010/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/28 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0967-5868(11)00315-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jocn.2011.03.029 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Neurosci. 2011 Dec;18(12):1651-5. doi: 10.1016/j.jocn.2011.03.029.

In a first attempt for immunotargeting of AML blasts we constructed two bispecific antibodies in the single chain bispecific diabody (scBsDb) format by fusing the variable domains of monoclonal antibodies directed against CD3 and CD33. Unfortunately, protein expression of both scBsDbs resulted in varying mixtures of fragmented and full length proteins. As the non-functional fragments competed with the functional full length antibodies we tried to understand the reason for the fragmentation. We found that the anti-CD3 and anti-CD33 antibody genes show striking sequence homologies: during B cell development the same V(h) J558 heavy and V(l) kk4 light chain genes were selected. Moreover, the closely related D genes DSP2 (9 and 11) were combined with the same JH4 gene. And finally, during VJ recombination of the light chain the same JK5 element was selected. These homologies between the two monoclonal antibodies were the reason for recombinations in the cell lines generated for expression of the scBsDbs. Finally, we solved this problem by (i) rearranging the order of the heavy and light chains of the anti-CD3 and anti-CD33 domains, and (ii) a replacement of one of the commonly used glycine serine linkers with a novel linker domain. The resulting bispecific antibody in a single chain bispecific tandem format (scBsTaFv) was stable and capable of redirecting T cells to CD33-positive tumor cells including AML blasts of patients.","['Stamova, Slava', 'Cartellieri, Marc', 'Feldmann, Anja', 'Arndt, Claudia', 'Koristka, Stefanie', 'Bartsch, Holger', 'Bippes, Claudia C', 'Wehner, Rebekka', 'Schmitz, Marc', 'von Bonin, Malte', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Bachmann, Michael']","['Stamova S', 'Cartellieri M', 'Feldmann A', 'Arndt C', 'Koristka S', 'Bartsch H', 'Bippes CC', 'Wehner R', 'Schmitz M', 'von Bonin M', 'Bornhauser M', 'Ehninger G', 'Bachmann M']","['Institute of Immunology, Medical Faculty Carl Gustav Carus, Technical University Dresden, Fetscherstr. 74, 01307 Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111019,England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '0 (Single-Chain Antibodies)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/chemistry/genetics/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*immunology', 'CD3 Complex/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms/immunology', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Single-Chain Antibodies/chemistry/genetics/*immunology']",,2011/10/22 06:00,2012/01/27 06:00,['2011/10/22 06:00'],"['2011/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/30 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0161-5890(11)00759-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molimm.2011.09.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 2011 Dec;49(3):474-82. doi: 10.1016/j.molimm.2011.09.019.

In Drosophila, Ena is a substrate of the tyrosine kinase DAbl (Drosophila Abl). However, the link between Abl and the Mena/VASP family is not fully understood in mammals. We previously reported that Abi-1 (Abl interactor 1) promotes phosphorylation of Mena and BCAP (B-cell adaptor for phosphoinositide 3-kinase) by bridging the interaction between c-Abl and the substrate. In the present study we have identified VASP, another member of the Mena/VASP family, as an Abi-1-bridged substrate of Abl. VASP is phosphorylated by Abl when Abi-1 is co-expressed. We also found that VASP interacted with Abi-1 both in vitro and in vivo. VASP was tyrosine-phosphorylated in Bcr-Abl-positive leukaemic cells in an Abi-1-dependent manner. Co-expression of c-Abl and Abi-1 or the phosphomimetic Y39D mutation in VASP resulted in less accumulation of VASP at focal adhesions. VASP Y39D had a reduced affinity to the proline-rich region of zyxin. Interestingly, overexpression of both phosphomimetic and unphosphorylated forms of VASP, but not wild-type VASP, impaired adhesion of K562 cells to fibronectin. These results suggest that the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation cycle of VASP by the Abi-1-bridged mechanism regulates association of VASP with focal adhesions, which may regulate adhesion of Bcr-Abl-transformed leukaemic cells.","['Maruoka, Masahiro', 'Sato, Mizuho', 'Yuan, Yunfeng', 'Ichiba, Masayoshi', 'Fujii, Ryosuke', 'Ogawa, Takuya', 'Ishida-Kitagawa, Norihiro', 'Takeya, Tatsuo', 'Watanabe, Naoki']","['Maruoka M', 'Sato M', 'Yuan Y', 'Ichiba M', 'Fujii R', 'Ogawa T', 'Ishida-Kitagawa N', 'Takeya T', 'Watanabe N']","['Laboratory of Single-Molecule Cell Biology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Life Sciences, Aoba-ku, Sendai, Miyagi 980-8578, Japan. m-maruoka@m.tohoku.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (ABI1 protein, human)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Adhesion/genetics', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins', 'Focal Adhesions/genetics/*metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Experimental/enzymology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microfilament Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/genetics', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'Xenopus laevis']",,2011/10/22 06:00,2012/03/16 06:00,['2011/10/22 06:00'],"['2011/10/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/16 06:00 [medline]']","['BJ20110951 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20110951 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2012 Feb 1;441(3):889-99. doi: 10.1042/BJ20110951.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND RESULTS: The morphology and expression of a range of antigens including markers of epithelial differentiation [cytokeratins, thyroid transcription factor (TTF)-1], neuroendocrine antigens [neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), chromogranin, protein gene product (PGP) 9.5, neurone-specific enolase (NSE), synaptophysin], peptide products [gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), calcitonin, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)] and inactivator [common acute lymphoblastic leukaemia antigen (CALLA)] and antigens involved in cell proliferation and death (p53, p16, p27, Rb, Bcl-2, c-kit, Ki67) were studied in four cases of reactive PNEC proliferation and seven cases of DIPNECH. Proliferation was more florid in DIPNECH. There was no major shift in antigen expression with proliferation in either group apart from CALLA, which was expressed only by proliferating cells and not by solitary PNECs. There were differences between the groups in expression of p53, p16 and Ki67, which were seen more consistently and earlier in proliferation in DIPNECH. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that there are early and fundamental differences in cell kinetics between the reactive PNEC proliferation that occurs in response to pulmonary injury and that seen in the pre-neoplastic condition of DIPNECH.","['Gosney, John R', 'Williams, Ian J', 'Dodson, Andrew R', 'Foster, Christopher S']","['Gosney JR', 'Williams IJ', 'Dodson AR', 'Foster CS']","['Department of Pathology, Royal Liverpool University Hospital University of Liverpool, UK.

A bimodal age distribution was noted in NKTL patients. We examined the clinicopathological differences between two age groups of ENKTL patients (n = 23) and compared the findings with those of aggressive NK cell leukaemia (ANKL; n = 10) and monoclonal chronic active EBV infection-associated T/NK-cell lymphoproliferative disorders [chronic active EBV infection/TNK-lymphoproliferative disorders (CAEBV/TNK-LPD)] of NK-cell type (n = 45). METHODS AND RESULTS: Distinct differences existed between elderly (> 50 years; n = 13) and younger (</= 50 years; n = 10) ENKTL patients; the latter showed a higher disease stage (P = 0.0286), worse performance status (P = 0.0244), more frequent B symptoms (P = 0.0286) and more frequent liver, spleen and bone marrow involvement (P = 0.0222, 0.0005 and 0.0259, respectively). Few clinicopathological differences existed between younger ENKTL and ANKL patients. Patients with monoclonal CAEBV/TNK-LPD of NK-cell type (n = 45) showed features similar to those in younger ENKTL/ANKL patients, except a more juvenile onset of CAEBV-related symptoms and better prognosis. However, the onset age of overt leukaemia/lymphoma in CAEBV/TNK-LPD patients and overall survival thereafter were similar to those in younger ENKTL/ANKL patients.

High constitutive activation of NFkappaB has been found in different cancers, creating an environment conducive for chemotherapeutic resistance. Here we report that doxorubicin-induced SMAR1-dependent transcriptional repression and SMAR1-independent degradation of IkBalpha resulted in nuclear translocation of p65NFkappaB and its association with p300 histone acetylase and subsequent transcription of Bcl-2 to impart protective response in drug-resistant cells. Consistently SMAR1-silenced drug-resistant cells exhibited IkBalpha-mediated inhibition of p65NFkappaB and induction of p53-dependent apoptosis. Interestingly, curcumin pretreatment of drug-resistant cells alleviated SMAR1-mediated p65NFkappaB activation and hence restored doxorubicin sensitivity. Under such anti-survival condition, induction of p53-p300 cross-talk enhanced the transcriptional activity of p53 and intrinsic death cascade. Importantly, promyelocyte leukemia-mediated SMAR1 sequestration that relieved the repression of apoptosis-inducing genes was indispensable for such chemo-sensitizing ability of curcumin. A simultaneous decrease in drug-induced systemic toxicity by curcumin might also have enhanced the efficacy of doxorubicin by improving the intrinsic defense machineries of the tumor-bearer. Overall, the findings of this preclinical study clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of curcumin to combat doxorubicin-resistance. We, therefore, suggest curcumin as a potent chemo-sensitizer to improve the therapeutic index of this widely used anti-cancer drug. Taken together, these results suggest that curcumin can be developed into an adjuvant chemotherapeutic drug.","['Sen, Gouri Sankar', 'Mohanty, Suchismita', 'Hossain, Dewan Md Sakib', 'Bhattacharyya, Sankar', 'Banerjee, Shuvomoy', 'Chakraborty, Juni', 'Saha, Shilpi', 'Ray, Pallab', 'Bhattacharjee, Pushpak', 'Mandal, Debaprasad', 'Bhattacharya, Arindam', 'Chattopadhyay, Samit', 'Das, Tanya', 'Sa, Gaurisankar']","['Sen GS', 'Mohanty S', 'Hossain DMS', 'Bhattacharyya S', 'Banerjee S', 'Chakraborty J', 'Saha S', 'Ray P', 'Bhattacharjee P', 'Mandal D', 'Bhattacharya A', 'Chattopadhyay S', 'Das T', 'Sa G']","['Division of Molecular Medicine, Bose Institute, P-1/12, Calcutta Improvement Trust Scheme VII M, Kolkata 700054, India.', 'Division of Molecular Medicine, Bose Institute, P-1/12, Calcutta Improvement Trust Scheme VII M, Kolkata 700054, India.', 'Division of Molecular Medicine, Bose Institute, P-1/12, Calcutta Improvement Trust Scheme VII M, Kolkata 700054, India.', 'Division of Molecular Medicine, Bose Institute, P-1/12, Calcutta Improvement Trust Scheme VII M, Kolkata 700054, India.', 'Division of Molecular Medicine, Bose Institute, P-1/12, Calcutta Improvement Trust Scheme VII M, Kolkata 700054, India.', 'Division of Molecular Medicine, Bose Institute, P-1/12, Calcutta Improvement Trust Scheme VII M, Kolkata 700054, India.', 'Division of Molecular Medicine, Bose Institute, P-1/12, Calcutta Improvement Trust Scheme VII M, Kolkata 700054, India.', 'Division of Molecular Medicine, Bose Institute, P-1/12, Calcutta Improvement Trust Scheme VII M, Kolkata 700054, India.', 'Division of Molecular Medicine, Bose Institute, P-1/12, Calcutta Improvement Trust Scheme VII M, Kolkata 700054, India.', 'Division of Molecular Medicine, Bose Institute, P-1/12, Calcutta Improvement Trust Scheme VII M, Kolkata 700054, India.', 'Division of Molecular Medicine, Bose Institute, P-1/12, Calcutta Improvement Trust Scheme VII M, Kolkata 700054, India.', 'Division of Molecular Medicine, Bose Institute, P-1/12, Calcutta Improvement Trust Scheme VII M, Kolkata 700054, India; National Centre for Cell Science, NCCS Complex, Ganeshkhind, Pune 411007, Maharashtra, India.', 'Division of Molecular Medicine, Bose Institute, P-1/12, Calcutta Improvement Trust Scheme VII M, Kolkata 700054, India.', 'Division of Molecular Medicine, Bose Institute, P-1/12, Calcutta Improvement Trust Scheme VII M, Kolkata 700054, India.

We have investigated the cellular effects of the only EBV nuclear protein expressed in GC, EBNA1, focusing on promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (NBs), which play important roles in apoptosis, p53 activation, and tumor suppression. AGS GC cells infected with EBV were found to contain fewer PML NBs and less PML protein than the parental EBV-negative AGS cells, and these levels were restored by silencing EBNA1. Conversely, EBNA1 expression was sufficient to induce the loss of PML NBs and proteins in AGS cells. Consistent with PML functions, EBNA1 expression decreased p53 activation and apoptosis in response to DNA damage and resulted in increased cell survival. In addition, EBNA1 mutants unable to bind CK2 kinase or ubiquitin-specific protease 7 had decreased ability to induce PML loss and to interfere with p53 activation. PML levels in EBV-positive and EBV-negative GC biopsy specimens were then compared by immunohistochemistry. Consistent with the results in the AGS cells, EBV-positive tumors had significantly lower PML levels than EBV-negative tumors. The results indicate that EBV infection of GC cells leads to loss of PML NBs through the action of EBNA1, resulting in impaired responses to DNA damage and promotion of cell survival. Therefore, PML disruption by EBNA1 is one mechanism by which EBV may contribute to the development of gastric cancer.","['Sivachandran, Nirojini', 'Dawson, Christopher W', 'Young, Lawrence S', 'Liu, Fei-Fei', 'Middeldorp, Jaap', 'Frappier, Lori']","['Sivachandran N', 'Dawson CW', 'Young LS', 'Liu FF', 'Middeldorp J', 'Frappier L']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111019,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'O5GA75RST7 (EBV-encoded nuclear antigen 1)']",IM,"['Carcinoma/genetics/metabolism/*virology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/genetics/metabolism/*virology', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Stomach Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*virology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3255905,2011/10/21 06:00,2012/02/15 06:00,['2011/10/21 06:00'],"['2011/10/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.05623-11 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.05623-11 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2012 Jan;86(1):60-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.05623-11.

This new chimeric glycoprotein, which has been named the Sst receptor binding site (Sst-RBS), gives targeted transduction based on three criteria: (i) a gain of the use of a new entry receptor not used by any known virus; (ii) targeted entry at levels comparable to gene delivery by wild-type ecotropic Moloney murine leukemia virus and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G glycoproteins; and (iii) a loss of the use of the natural ecotropic virus receptor. Retroviral vectors coated with Sst-RBS gained the ability to bind and transduce human 293 cells expressing somatostatin receptors. Their infection was specific to target somatostatin receptors, since a synthetic somatostatin peptide inhibited infection in a dose-dependent manner and the ability to transduce mouse cells bearing the natural ecotropic receptor was effectively lost. Importantly, vectors coated with the Sst-RBS glycoprotein gave targeted entry of up to 1 x 10(6) transducing U/ml, a level comparable to that seen with infection of vectors coated with the parental wild-type ecotropic Moloney murine leukemia virus glycoprotein through the ecotropic receptor and approaching that of infection of VSV G-coated vectors through the VSV receptor.

NAE is an essential component of the NEDD8 conjugation pathway, controlling the activity of a subset of ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) E3 ligases, multiprotein complexes that transfer ubiquitin molecules to substrate proteins. PROCEDURES: MLN4924 was tested against the PPTP in vitro panel using 96-hour exposure time at concentrations ranging from 1.0 nM to 10 microM. It was tested in vivo at a dose of 100 mg/kg [66 mg/kg for the acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) xenografts] administered orally twice daily x 5 days. Treatment duration was 3 weeks. RESULTS: The median relative IC(50) for MLN4924 against the PPTP cell lines was 143 nM, (range: 15-678 nM) with that for the Ewing panel being significantly lower (31 nM). MLN4924 induced significant differences in EFS distribution compared to control in 20 of 34 (59%) evaluable solid tumor xenografts.

The virus has since been found in the respiratory tract of some patients with respiratory disease. However, the role of MCPyV in the causation of respiratory disease has not been established. To determine the prevalence of MCPyV in 305 respiratory samples from immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients and evaluate their contribution to respiratory diseases, specimens were screened for MCPyV using single, multiplex, or real-time PCR; co-infection with other viruses was examined. Of the 305 samples tested, 10 (3.27%) were positive for MCPyV. The virus was found in two groups of patients: in 6 (2%) nasopharyngeal aspirate samples from children aged 26 days to 7 months who were immunocompetent; and in 4 (1.3%) of nasopharyngeal aspirate samples taken from patients aged 41 to 69 years who were severely immunosuppressed from leukemia or transplant therapy. Both groups had upper or lower respiratory tract infection. Co-infections with other viruses were found in 30% of the MCPyV positive samples. The data present a pattern of infection similar to that seen with the polyomaviruses JC and BK in which the virus is acquired during childhood, probably by the respiratory route.

The results demonstrated that highly purified RCG1 induced large cell aggregates and revealed cell-type-specific growth inhibition. It significantly inhibited all human leukemia cell lines tested such as HL-60, U937, and K562 cells but did not inhibit human colon cancer cell line, Colo 201, or mouse mammary tumor cell line FM3A cells. Although most of the galectin-induced growth inhibitions are known to be apoptic, RCG1 induced growth arrest and neither apoptosis nor necrosis. RCG1-mediated growth inhibition was specifically suppressed by the corresponding sugar, lactose, but not by sucrose or even the structurally similar sugar, melibiose. Several studies have reported that galectin-mediated biological functions were modulated by charge modification. Since the high purity of RCG1 was demonstrated but a moderate degree of growth inhibition occurred, it is possible protein charge modification was examined by isoelectric focusing, and it was found to be highly heterogeneous in charge. RCG1 binding proteins in human cells were analyzed by lectin blotting using biotinylated RCG1, and lectin blotting revealed that in human cell extracts the specific proteins at molecular weight 37 and 50 kDa possessed the responsive features of RCG1 binding and lactose competition.","['Yasumitsu, Hidetaro', 'Mochida, Keiichi', 'Yasuda, Chie', 'Isobe, Masaharu', 'Kawsar, Sarkar M A', 'Fujii, Yuki', 'Matsumoto, Ryo', 'Kanaly, Robert A', 'Ozeki, Yasuhiro']","['Yasumitsu H', 'Mochida K', 'Yasuda C', 'Isobe M', 'Kawsar SM', 'Fujii Y', 'Matsumoto R', 'Kanaly RA', 'Ozeki Y']","['Expert Laboratory for Life Environments, Department of Genome System Sciences, Graduate School of Nanobiosciences, Yokohama City University, 22-2 Seto, Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama, 236-0027, Japan. hyasumit@yokohama-cu.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111020,Germany,In Vitro Cell Dev Biol Anim,In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

Using whole-exome sequencing of one CN-AML patient lacking mutations in NPM1, CEBPA, FLT3-ITD, IDH1, and MLL-PTD, we newly identified a clonal somatic mutation in BCOR (BCL6 corepressor), a gene located on chromosome Xp11.4. Further analyses of 553 AML patients showed that BCOR mutations occurred in 3.8% of unselected CN-AML patients and represented a substantial fraction (17.1%) of CN-AML patients showing the same genotype as the AML index patient subjected to whole-exome sequencing. BCOR somatic mutations were: (1) disruptive events similar to the germline BCOR mutations causing the oculo-facio-cardio-dental genetic syndrome; (2) associated with decreased BCOR mRNA levels, absence of full-length BCOR, and absent or low expression of a truncated BCOR protein; (3) virtually mutually exclusive with NPM1 mutations; and (4) frequently associated with DNMT3A mutations, suggesting cooperativity among these genetic alterations. Finally, BCOR mutations tended to be associated with an inferior outcome in a cohort of 422 CN-AML patients (25.6% vs 56.7% overall survival at 2 years; P = .032).

Furthermore, a subset of previously uncharacterized frame-shift and missense mutations at the N terminus of AML1, found in MDS and AML patients, impairs its interaction with MLL, resulting in loss of the H3K4me3 mark within PU.1 regulatory regions, and decreased PU.1 expression.

The following features were examined: fever, rheumatoid rash, arthritis, limb pain, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, pericarditis, myocarditis, pleuritis, weight loss, bleeding, anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and lactic dehydrogenase levels. RESULTS: The median age at disease onset was significantly higher in leukemia patients than in those with systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (5.8 vs. 3.8 years). In addition, the frequencies of limb pain, hepatomegaly, weight loss and hemorrhagic manifestations were significantly higher in leukemia patients than in systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients (70% vs. 1%, 54% vs. 32%, 30% vs. 8%, and 9% vs. 0%, respectively). Likewise, the frequencies of anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and high lactic dehydrogenase levels were statistically higher in leukemia patients than in patients with systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (88% vs. 57%, 39% vs. 1%, 60% vs. 1%, 77% vs. 1%, and 56% vs. 14%, respectively). Remarkably, multivariate analysis revealed that limb pain (OR = 553; 95% CI = 46.48-6580.42) and thrombocytopenia (OR = 754.13; 95% CI = 64.57-8806.72) were significant independent variables that differentiated leukemia from systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis. The R2 of the Nagelkerke test was 0.91, and the Kaplan-Meier survival curves were similar for acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients with and without limb pain. CONCLUSION: Our study emphasizes the importance of investigating leukemia in patients presenting with musculoskeletal manifestations and, in particular, limb pain associated with thrombocytopenia.","['Tamashiro, Mirian S', 'Aikawa, Nadia Emi', 'Campos, Lucia Maria A', 'Cristofani, Lilian Maria', 'Odone-Filho, Vicente', 'Silva, Clovis A']","['Tamashiro MS', 'Aikawa NE', 'Campos LM', 'Cristofani LM', 'Odone-Filho V', 'Silva CA']","['Pediatric Rheumatology Unit, Faculdade de Medicina, Instituto da Crianca, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Brazil,Clinics (Sao Paulo),"Clinics (Sao Paulo, Brazil)",101244734,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Arthritis, Juvenile/blood/*diagnosis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukopenia/blood', 'Male', 'Musculoskeletal Pain/etiology', 'Neutropenia/blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*diagnosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thrombocytopenia/blood']",PMC3180165,2011/10/21 06:00,2012/02/23 06:00,['2011/10/21 06:00'],"['2011/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S1807-59322011001000001 [pii]', '10.1590/s1807-59322011001000001 [doi]']",ppublish,Clinics (Sao Paulo). 2011;66(10):1665-9. doi: 10.1590/s1807-59322011001000001.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fruit of Punica granatum (pomegranate) has been reported to possess several vital biological activities. This study aimed to determine the antioxidant and anticancer properties of polysaccharide PSP001 isolated from the fruit rind of pomegranate. Antioxidant activities were evaluated using various assays such as the 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazil (DPPH) radical scavenging assay, ferric reducing antioxidant power assay, linoleic acid emulsion thiocyanate assay, and superoxide, hydroxyl and nitric oxide radical scavenging assays. PSP001 exhibited a dose-dependent enhancement in activity using concentrations from 10 to 1000 microg/ml except for the DPPH assay for which the highest activity was obtained at 200 microg/ml. The anticancer properties of PSP001 evaluated on MCF-7 (breast cancer), KB (nasopharyngeal carcinoma) and K562 (leukemia) cells by MTT assay indicate its potential as an antitumor agent. An IC50 value of 97.21 +/- 1.06 microg/-ml and 52.8 +/- 0.9 microg/-ml were obtained following 72 h incubation for MCF-7 and K562 cells, respectively. PSP001 showed in vitro growth stimulatory effect on isolated normal lymphocytes, and a proliferative index of 1.21 +/- 0.01 at a concentration of 1000 microg/-ml was obtained, indicating immunomodulatory activity.

Over recent years, several major improvements have greatly increased the success rate for deriving mouse ES cell lines. The first improvement was the establishment of a user-friendly and reproducible medium-alternating protocol that allows isolation of ES cells from C57BL/6 transgenic mice with efficiencies of up to 75%. A recent report describes the use of this protocol in combination with leukemia inhibitory factor and pluripotin treatment, which made it possible to obtain ES cells from F1 strains with high efficiency. We report modifications of these protocols for user-friendly and reproducible derivation of mouse ES cells with efficiencies of up to 100%. Our protocol involves a long initial incubation of primary outgrowths from blastocysts with pluripotin, which results in the formation of large spherical outgrowths. These outgrowths are morphologically distinct from classical inner cell mass (ICM) outgrowths and can be easily picked and trypsinized. Pluripotin was omitted after the first trypsinization because we found that it blocks attachment of ES cells to the feeder layer and its removal facilitated formation of ES cell colonies. The newly established ES cells exhibited normal karyotypes and generated chimeras. In summary, our user-friendly modified protocol allows formation of large spherical ICM outgrowths in a robust and reliable manner. These outgrowths gave rise to ES cell lines with success rates of up to 100%.","['Pieters, Tim', 'Haenebalcke, Lieven', 'Hochepied, Tino', ""D'Hont, Jinke"", 'Haigh, Jody J', 'van Roy, Frans', 'van Hengel, Jolanda']","['Pieters T', 'Haenebalcke L', 'Hochepied T', ""D'Hont J"", 'Haigh JJ', 'van Roy F', 'van Hengel J']","['Department for Molecular Biomedical Research, VIB, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Stem Cell Rev Rep,Stem cell reviews and reports,101752767,"['0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (SC1 compound)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blastocyst/cytology', '*Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/drug effects/*physiology', 'Female', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Morula/cytology', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Spheroids, Cellular/drug effects']",PMC3412084,2011/10/21 06:00,2012/12/18 06:00,['2011/10/21 06:00'],"['2011/10/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12015-011-9323-x [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cell Rev Rep. 2012 Sep;8(3):768-78. doi: 10.1007/s12015-011-9323-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The capacity of leukemia cells to re-organize their microtubules is considered an integral part of differentiation in these cells in order to become mature granulocytes through treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), an established drug for treating acute promyelocytic leukemia. In this study we examined gamma-, alpha- and acetylated-alpha-tubulin content, their patterns of distribution in the cytoplasm, and the potency of centrosomes in re-organizing microtubules in different stages of ATRA-induced differentiation and apoptosis of the HL-60 cell line. The gamma-tubulin content was dramatically increased following differentiation of HL-60 cells, and was then decreased after apoptosis. We also found that gamma-tubulin had a diffuse, cytoplasmic pattern following apoptosis compared to the focal, centrosomal accumulation of gamma-tubulin in differentiated cells. Differentiated cells had the ability to re-organize their microtubule network following nocodazole challenge testing, whereas undifferentiated cells did not show a similar ability. alpha-tubulin was more regularly organized in differentiated cells, and did not reveal any specific pattern of polymerization in apoptotic cells. Acetylated-alpha-tubulin generally followed the same organization patterns after differentiation, as that which occurred for alpha-tubulin. Our data is suggestive of a centrosomal and organized nucleation pattern of microtubules in HL-60 cells following differentiation, possibly mediated through up-regulation of gamma-tubulin.","['Shariftabrizi, Ahmad', 'Ahmadian, Shahin', 'Pazhang, Yaghub']","['Shariftabrizi A', 'Ahmadian S', 'Pazhang Y']","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111018,Greece,Mol Med Rep,Molecular medicine reports,101475259,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Tubulin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cytoskeleton/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tubulin/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",,2011/10/21 06:00,2012/03/31 06:00,['2011/10/21 06:00'],"['2011/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/mmr.2011.635 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Med Rep. 2012 Feb;5(2):545-51. doi: 10.3892/mmr.2011.635.

The mechanism(s) by which it mediates these effects remain unclear. Clinically, CLL patients treated with lenalidomide demonstrate an acute inflammatory reaction, the tumour flare reaction that is suggestive of an immune activation phenomenon. Samples from CLL patients treated with lenalidomide were used to evaluate its effect on the tumour cell and components of its microenvironment (immune cellular and cytokine). Lenalidomide was unable to directly induce apoptosis in CLL cells in vitro, however it modulated costimulatory (CD80, CD83, CD86) surface molecules on CLL cells in vitro and in vivo. Concurrently, we demonstrated that NK cell proliferation was induced by lenalidomide treatment in patients and correlated with clinical response. Cytokine analysis showed increase in levels of TNF-alpha post-lenalidomide treatment, consistent with acute inflammatory reaction. Furthermore, the basal cytokine profile (high IL-8, MIG, IP-10 and IL-4 levels and low IL-5, MIP1a, MIP1b, IL12/p70) was predictive of clinical response to lenalidomide. Collectively, our correlative studies provide further evidence that the antileukaemic effect of lenalidomide in CLL is mediated not only through modulation of the leukaemic clone but also through elements of the tumour microenvironment.","['Chanan-Khan, Asher A', 'Chitta, Kasyapa', 'Ersing, Noreen', 'Paulus, Aneel', 'Masood, Aisha', 'Sher, Taimur', 'Swaika, Abhisek', 'Wallace, Paul K', 'Mashtare, Terry L Jr', 'Wilding, Greg', 'Lee, Kelvin', 'Czuczman, Myron S', 'Borrello, Ivan', 'Bangia, Naveen']","['Chanan-Khan AA', 'Chitta K', 'Ersing N', 'Paulus A', 'Masood A', 'Sher T', 'Swaika A', 'Wallace PK', 'Mashtare TL Jr', 'Wilding G', 'Lee K', 'Czuczman MS', 'Borrello I', 'Bangia N']","['Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY, USA. chanan-khan.asher@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111020,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (CD86 protein, human)', '0 (Cytokines)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['B7-1 Antigen/biosynthesis/immunology', 'B7-2 Antigen/biosynthesis/immunology', 'CD40 Ligand/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Cytokines/blood/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/immunology', 'Lenalidomide', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*drug therapy/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Thalidomide/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",PMC3698616,2011/10/21 06:00,2012/03/02 06:00,['2011/10/21 06:00'],"['2011/10/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08882.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2011 Nov;155(4):457-67. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08882.x.

Here, we examined whether human cells internalize MLV-E or other retroviral pseudotypes irrespective of the presence of a specific receptor. Using fluorescently tagged Gag to monitor viral internalization, and treating cells with chloroquine or bafilomycin A1, we show that endocytosis is the main pathway for productive transduction with ecotropic particles, but endocytosis of retroviral particles itself does not depend on a suitable receptor or Env. Nonspecific endosomal uptake and lysosomal degradation occurred with all ""illegitimate"" envelope-receptor combinations tested: MLV particles pseudotyped with the ecotropic envelope or measles virus H and F proteins as well as ""ecotropic"" or ""bald"" HIV-1 particles. Kinetic studies in cell lines and primary human T lymphocytes showed the persistence of Gag-GFP signals for more than 10 days after exposure to retroviral vector particles, even in the absence of a suitable receptor. Further studies testing the Gag-mediated transfer of protein or retroviral mRNA revealed that nonspecific endocytosis prevented the release of functional particle-associated proteins and nucleic acids into the cytosol. We conclude that receptor-targeted retroviral particles are unlikely to escape nonspecific cellular uptake unless appropriate protective principles are discovered. Conversely, as lysosomal degradation was found to inactivate mRNA and proteins embedded into retroviral particles, receptor targeting is a useful strategy for both transient and permanent cell modification by retrovirus-like particles.","['Voelkel, Christine', 'Galla, Melanie', 'Dannhauser, Philip N', 'Maetzig, Tobias', 'Sodeik, Beate', 'Schambach, Axel', 'Baum, Christopher']","['Voelkel C', 'Galla M', 'Dannhauser PN', 'Maetzig T', 'Sodeik B', 'Schambach A', 'Baum C']","['Institute of Experimental Hematology, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120112,United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Endocytosis', 'Endosomes/metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag/metabolism', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'HIV-1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/metabolism', '*Transduction, Genetic', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Virion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Virus Assembly']",,2011/10/21 06:00,2013/06/21 06:00,['2011/10/21 06:00'],"['2011/10/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/hum.2011.011 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2012 Mar;23(3):274-86. doi: 10.1089/hum.2011.011.

HTLV-1 encodes Tax, which plays crucial roles in HTLV-1-mediated immortalization and transformation of human T cells. A previous study showed that Tax can transform a mouse T-cell line, CTLL-2, from having IL-2-dependent growth to IL-2-independent growth. Given that the Akt/mTOR pathway is essential for IL-2-induced cell growth in T cells, we examined whether the Akt/mTOR pathway is involved in Tax-induced transformation to IL-2-independent growth. The stable and transient expression of Tax in CTLL-2 induced the phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase and ribosomal protein S6, downstream targets of the mTOR kinase, whereas that of Akt was only minimally induced. Studies with Tax mutants indicated that the activation of mTOR by Tax was correlated with the transformation of CTLL-2 cells to IL-2-independent growth. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR kinase, reduced the growth of Tax-transformed CTLL-2 cells. Moreover, the transduction of a constitutively active form of Akt in the CTLL-2 cells also induced IL-2-independent growth. Like CTLL-2/Tax, constitutive phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase was detected in the absence of IL-2 in all of the HTLV-1-infected human T-cell lines. These results suggest that Tax activates the mTOR pathway in T cells, and that this activation plays a crucial role in the growth of HTLV-1-infected T cells when a limited amount of IL-2 is available.","['Yoshita, Manami', 'Higuchi, Masaya', 'Takahashi, Masahiko', 'Oie, Masayasu', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Fujii, Masahiro']","['Yoshita M', 'Higuchi M', 'Takahashi M', 'Oie M', 'Tanaka Y', 'Fujii M']","['Division of Virology, Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111128,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa/metabolism', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology/*virology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",,2011/10/21 06:00,2012/03/27 06:00,['2011/10/21 06:00'],"['2011/10/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2011.02123.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2012 Feb;103(2):369-74. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2011.02123.x.

E2F-binding protein 1 (E2FBP1), a transcription regulator for E2F, induces PML reduction and suppresses the formation of PML-nuclear bodies, whereas the down-regulation of E2FBP1 provokes the PML-dependent premature senescence in human normal fibroblasts. Here we report that the depletion of E2FBP1 induces the accumulation of PML through the Ras-dependent activation of MAP kinase signaling. The cellular levels of p16(INK4A) and p53 are elevated during premature senescence induced by depletion of E2FBP1, and the depletion of p16(INK4A), but not p53 rescued senescent cells from growth arrest. Therefore, the premature senescence induced by E2FBP1 depletion is achieved through the p16(INK4A)-Rb pathway. Similar to human normal fibroblasts, the growth inhibition induced by E2FBP1 depletion is also observed in human tumor cells with intact p16(INK4A) and Rb. These results suggest that E2FBP1 functions as a critical antagonist to the p16(INK4A)-Rb tumor suppressor machinery by regulating PML stability.","['Fukuyo, Yayoi', 'Takahashi, Akiko', 'Hara, Eiji', 'Horikoshi, Nobuo', 'Pandita, Tej K', 'Nakajima, Takuma']","['Fukuyo Y', 'Takahashi A', 'Hara E', 'Horikoshi N', 'Pandita TK', 'Nakajima T']","['Department of Immunology, Tulane National Primate Research Center, Covington, LA 70433, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,India,Int J Oral Sci,International journal of oral science,101504351,"['0 (ARID3A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cellular Senescence/genetics/*physiology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein Stability', 'RNA Interference', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Ubiquitination', 'ras Proteins/metabolism']",PMC3469977,2011/10/21 06:00,2011/11/02 06:00,['2011/10/21 06:00'],"['2011/10/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4248/IJOS11071 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oral Sci. 2011 Oct;3(4):200-8. doi: 10.4248/IJOS11071.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MAHA (defined by fragmented red cells on the peripheral blood smear and evidence of hemolysis) and thrombocytopenia are the clinical features of syndromes described as thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs). If a malignancy is not recognized as the cause of TMA, the diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) may be considered and plasma exchange, the essential treatment for TTP, may be initiated-a critical decision because this treatment carries a high risk of serious complications. This review describes the clinical features that should suggest a search for systemic malignancy as the cause of unexpected MAHA and thrombocytopenia.

Here, we aimed at characterizing the role of caspase-8 for chemosensitivity of B- and T-ALL cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Primary tumor cells from children with ALL were evaluated for expression levels of the caspase-8 protein, were amplified in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice, transfected with siRNA, and evaluated for their chemosensitivity in vitro. RESULTS: Effective cell death in B- and T-ALL cells depended on the presence of caspase-8 for the majority of cytotoxic drugs routinely used in antileukemia treatment. Caspase-8 was activated independently from extrinsic apoptosis signaling. Accordingly in primary ALL cells, the expression level of caspase-8 protein correlated with cell death sensitivity toward defined cytotoxic drugs in vitro. In the subgroup of primary ALL cells, with low expression of caspase-8, methotrexate (MTX) upregulated the expression of caspase-8 mediated by the transcription factor p53, suggesting epigenetic silencing of caspase-8. RNA interference in patient-derived B- and T-ALL cells revealed that effective cell death induction by most routine drug combinations involving MTX depended on the presence of caspase-8. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that caspase-8 is crucial for the high antileukemic efficiency of numerous routine cytotoxic drugs. Reexpression of epigenetically downregulated caspase-8 represents a promising approach to increase efficiency of antileukemic therapy.","['Ehrhardt, Harald', 'Wachter, Franziska', 'Maurer, Martina', 'Stahnke, Karsten', 'Jeremias, Irmela']","['Ehrhardt H', 'Wachter F', 'Maurer M', 'Stahnke K', 'Jeremias I']","['Helmholtz Center Munich-German Research Center for Environmental Health, Department of Gene Vectors, Marchioninistrasse 25, D-81377 Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111018,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 8/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Child', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'RNA Interference', 'Thioguanine/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2011/10/20 06:00,2012/06/12 06:00,['2011/10/20 06:00'],"['2011/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-11-0513 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-0513 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2011 Dec 15;17(24):7605-13. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-0513.

We investigated NLI (Ldb1 homolog) complex occupancy and chromatin conformation of the beta-globin locus in human erythroid cells. In addition to the LCR, we found robust NLI complex occupancy at a site downstream of the (A)gamma-globin gene within sequences of BGL3, an intergenic RNA transcript. In cells primarily transcribing beta-globin, BGL3 is not transcribed and BGL3 sequences are occupied by NLI core complex members, together with corepressor ETO2 and by gamma-globin repressor BCL11A. The LCR and beta-globin gene establish proximity in these cells. In contrast, when gamma-globin transcription is reactivated in these cells, ETO2 participation in the NLI complex at BGL3 is diminished, as is BCL11A occupancy, and both BGL3 and gamma-globin are transcribed. In these cells, proximity between the BGL3/gamma-globin region and the LCR is established. We conclude that alternative NLI complexes mediate gamma-globin transcription or silencing through long-range LCR interactions involving an intergenic site of noncoding RNA transcription and that ETO2 is critical to this process.","['Kiefer, Christine M', 'Lee, Jongjoo', 'Hou, Chunhui', 'Dale, Ryan K', 'Lee, Y Terry', 'Meier, Emily R', 'Miller, Jeffrey L', 'Dean, Ann']","['Kiefer CM', 'Lee J', 'Hou C', 'Dale RK', 'Lee YT', 'Meier ER', 'Miller JL', 'Dean A']","['Laboratory of Cellular and Developmental Biology, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20111018,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (CBFA2T3 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (LDB1 protein, human)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Untranslated)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (gamma-Globins)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Erythroid Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'LIM Domain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Untranslated/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'gamma-Globins/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC3234672,2011/10/20 06:00,2012/01/25 06:00,['2011/10/20 06:00'],"['2011/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40552-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-06-363101 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Dec 1;118(23):6200-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-06-363101.

LEF1, a key mediator of Wnt signaling, has been linked to leukemic transformation, and recurrent mutations of LEF1 have been identified in pediatric T-ALL. Here we evaluated the prognostic significance of LEF1 expression in B-precursor ALL patients. LEF1 expression was determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR in 282 adult B-precursor ALL patients treated on 06/99 and 07/03 GMALL trials. Patients were grouped into quartiles (Q1-Q4) according to LEF1 expression levels (LEF1 high, Q4; n = 71; LEF1 low, Q1-Q3; n = 211). Patients with high LEF1 expression had a significantly shorter relapse-free survival (RFS) compared with low LEF1 expressers (5-year RFS: LEF1 high, 27%; LEF1 low, 47%; P = .05). Importantly, high LEF1 expression was also associated with inferior RFS in standard-risk patients and was independently predictive for RFS (P = .02) in multivariate analyses for this subgroup. Thus, high LEF1 expression identifies B-precursor ALL patients with inferior RFS, supporting a pathogenetic role of Wnt signaling in ALL. Standard-risk patients with high LEF1 expression might benefit from early treatment modifications and new molecular therapies, including agents targeting the Wnt pathway.","['Kuhnl, Andrea', 'Gokbuget, Nicola', 'Kaiser, Martin', 'Schlee, Cornelia', 'Stroux, Andrea', 'Burmeister, Thomas', 'Mochmann, Liliana H', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Thiel, Eckhard', 'Baldus, Claudia D']","['Kuhnl A', 'Gokbuget N', 'Kaiser M', 'Schlee C', 'Stroux A', 'Burmeister T', 'Mochmann LH', 'Hoelzer D', 'Hofmann WK', 'Thiel E', 'Baldus CD']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Charite University Hospital Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111018,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (LEF1 protein, human)', '0 (Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Cohort Studies', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*metabolism/physiopathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', '*Up-Regulation', 'Young Adult']",,2011/10/20 06:00,2012/02/15 06:00,['2011/10/20 06:00'],"['2011/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40503-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-04-350850 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Dec 8;118(24):6362-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-04-350850.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 195 patients with LGG, which was diagnosed, on average, 5.6 years before the study, were compared with 100 patients with hematologic (non-Hodgkin's) lymphoma and chronic lymphatic leukemia cancer (NHL/CLL) and 205 general population controls who were comparable with patients with LGG at the group level for age, sex, and education (healthy controls). Generic HRQL was assessed with the Short Form-36 (SF-36) Health Survey, and condition-specific HRQL was assessed with the Medical Outcomes Study cognitive function questionnaire and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer brain cancer module. Objective neurocognitive functioning was assessed with a standardized battery of neuropsychological tests. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were observed between patients with LGG and patients with NHL/CLL in SF-36 scores. Patients with LGG scored significantly lower than healthy controls on six of eight scales and on the mental health component score of the SF-36. Approximately one quarter of patients with LGG reported serious neurocognitive symptoms. Female sex, epilepsy burden, and number of objectively assessed neurocognitive deficits were associated significantly with both generic and condition-specific HRQL. Clinical variables, including the time since diagnosis, tumor lateralization, extent of surgery, and radiotherapy, did not show a consistent relationship with HRQL. CONCLUSION: Patients with LGG experienced significant problems across a broad range of HRQL domains, many of which were not condition-specific. However, the neurocognitive deficits and epilepsy that were relatively prevalent among patients with LGG were associated with negative HRQL outcomes and, thus, contributed additionally to the vulnerability of this population of patients with cancer.","['Aaronson, Neil K', 'Taphoorn, Martin J B', 'Heimans, Jan J', 'Postma, Tjeerd J', 'Gundy, Chad M', 'Beute, Guus N', 'Slotman, Ben J', 'Klein, Martin']","['Aaronson NK', 'Taphoorn MJ', 'Heimans JJ', 'Postma TJ', 'Gundy CM', 'Beute GN', 'Slotman BJ', 'Klein M']","['The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066 CX Amsterdam, the Netherlands. n.aaronson@nki.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111017,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adult', 'Brain Neoplasms/*psychology', 'Cognition', 'Female', 'Glioma/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Quality of Life']",,2011/10/20 06:00,2012/01/05 06:00,['2011/10/20 06:00'],"['2011/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.35.5750 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.35.5750 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Nov 20;29(33):4430-5. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.35.5750.

Despite improvements in the field of surgery and radiotherapy, patients with these tumors still face a very unfavorable prognosis, partly because of their localization in a complex anatomic area, which has special relevance for surgery and postoperative treatment. Therefore, there is a need for new therapeutic possibilities for patients with these tumors. METHODS: Gene copy numbers of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ERBB2) were analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization and multiplex ligand-dependent probe amplification, and protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 54 SNSCC specimens. The results were correlated with clinicopathologic and follow-up data. RESULTS: EGFR gene copy number increases were observed in 20 of 45 tumors (44%), and 21 of 54 tumors (39%) had EGFR protein overexpression. Eight of 38 tumors (21%) had ERBB2 copy number increases, and 4 of 54 tumors (7%) exhibited elevated protein expression levels. Both copy number increases and protein overexpression of EGFR and ERBB2 were mutually exclusive. v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutations were absent in 37 tumors that were analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of SNSCCs carried alterations in EGFR or ERBB2. Together with the absence of KRAS mutations, these findings indicate that therapies targeting these molecules may be promising additions to the therapeutic options for patients with SNSCC.","['Lopez, Fernando', 'Llorente, Jose Luis', 'Oviedo, Carlos Martin', 'Vivanco, Blanca', 'Marcos, Cesar Alvarez', 'Garcia-Inclan, Cristina', 'Scola, Bartolome', 'Hermsen, Mario A']","['Lopez F', 'Llorente JL', 'Oviedo CM', 'Vivanco B', 'Marcos CA', 'Garcia-Inclan C', 'Scola B', 'Hermsen MA']","['Department of Otolaryngology, IUOPA, University Hospital Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110825,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*genetics', 'ErbB Receptors/*metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Amplification', 'Gene Dosage', '*Genes, erbB-1', '*Genes, erbB-2', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/*metabolism']",,2011/10/20 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2011/10/20 06:00'],"['2011/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/20 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.26451 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2012 Apr 1;118(7):1818-26. doi: 10.1002/cncr.26451.

Although it has been described only in one patient with testicular hydrocele and gynecomastia in the literature, several cases of male gynecomastia have been reported with the use of imatinib mesylate in chronic myeloid leukemia (GML). Generally, male mastoplasia resolves after discontinuation of imatinib treatment. We report a 73-year-old male with metastatic GISTs who developed gynecomastia and unilateral testicular hydrocele while receiving imatinib mesylate. Nine months after commencing imatinib treatment, gynecomastia and testicular hydrocele were determined. Hormone analyses requested showed serum testosterone levels below and serum estrogen levels above normal limits. During the first month after discontinuing imatinib mesylate treatment, serum testosterone level was normal and there was a partial regression in gynecomastia and testicular hydrocele. To our knowledge, this is the second report of male gynecomastia following imatinib mesylate treatment of a patient with GIST. In conclusion, male patients who are to receive treatment with imatinib mesylate may be monitored for serum testosterone levels and for other reproductive hormone profiles before initiation of the treatment and their breasts may be examined during follow-up visits.","['Tanriverdi, Ozgur', 'Unubol, Mustafa', 'Taskin, Fisun', 'Meydan, Nezih', 'Sargin, Gokhan', 'Guney, Engin', 'Barutca, Sabri']","['Tanriverdi O', 'Unubol M', 'Taskin F', 'Meydan N', 'Sargin G', 'Guney E', 'Barutca S']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Adnan Menderes University, Aydin, Turkey. ozgurtanriverdi@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20111018,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Benzamides', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/*drug therapy', 'Gynecomastia/chemically induced/*diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Male', 'Piperazines/*adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects', 'Testicular Hydrocele/chemically induced/*diagnosis']",,2011/10/20 06:00,2013/03/06 06:00,['2011/10/20 06:00'],"['2011/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1078155211424629 [pii]', '10.1177/1078155211424629 [doi]']",ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2012 Jun;18(2):303-10. doi: 10.1177/1078155211424629.

Although previous studies suggest a survival advantage for cancer patients cared for at high-volume centers, these observations may simply reflect referral bias or better access to advanced technologies, clinical trials, and multidisciplinary support at large centers. METHODS: We evaluated time to first treatment (TTFT) and overall survival (OS) of patients with newly diagnosed chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL) at a single academic center based on whether they were cared for by a hematologist/oncologist who subspecializes in CLL (CLL hematologist) or a hematologist/oncologist with expertise in other areas (non-CLL hematologist). RESULTS: Among 1309 newly diagnosed patients with CLL cared for between 1999 and 2009, 773(59%) were cared for by CLL hematologists and 536 were cared for by non-CLL hematologists. Among early-stage patients (Rai 0-I), median TTFT (9.2 vs 6.1 years; P < .001) and OS (10.5 years vs 8.8 years; P < .001) were longer for patients cared for by CLL hematologists. For all patients, OS was superior for patients cared for by CLL hematologists (10.5 years vs 8.4 years; P = .001). Physician's disease-specific expertise remained an independent predictor of OS after adjusting for age, sex, stage, and lymphocyte count at diagnosis. Patients seen by a CLL hematologist were also more likely to participate in clinical trials (48% vs 16%; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Physician disease-specific expertise appears to influence outcome in patients with CLL. To the greatest extent possible, patients should be cared for by a hematologist/oncologist expert in the care of their specific malignancy. When not possible, practice guidelines developed by disease-specific experts should be followed.","['Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Rabe, Kari G', 'Inwards, David J', 'Zent, Clive S', 'Leis, Jose F', 'Schwager, Susan M', 'Thompson, Carrie A', 'Bowen, Deborah A', 'Witzig, Thomas E', 'Slager, Susan L', 'Call, Timothy G']","['Shanafelt TD', 'Kay NE', 'Rabe KG', 'Inwards DJ', 'Zent CS', 'Leis JF', 'Schwager SM', 'Thompson CA', 'Bowen DA', 'Witzig TE', 'Slager SL', 'Call TG']","['Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55902, USA. shanafelt.tait@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110826,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Clinical Competence', 'Databases as Topic', 'Female', '*Hematology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', '*Medical Oncology', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",PMC3893049,2011/10/20 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2011/10/20 06:00'],"['2011/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/06 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.26474 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2012 Apr 1;118(7):1827-37. doi: 10.1002/cncr.26474.

Using a high throughput screen designed to detect inhibitors of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, we identified a series of acyl hydrazones that act downstream of the beta-catenin destruction complex to inhibit both Wnt-induced and cancer-associated constitutive Wnt signaling via destabilization of beta-catenin. We found that these acyl hydrazones bind iron in vitro and in intact cells and that chelating activity is required to abrogate Wnt signaling and block the growth of colorectal cancer cell lines with constitutive Wnt signaling. In addition, we found that multiple iron chelators, desferrioxamine, deferasirox, and ciclopirox olamine similarly blocked Wnt signaling and cell growth. Moreover, in patients with AML administered ciclopirox olamine, we observed decreased expression of the Wnt target gene AXIN2 in leukemic cells. The novel class of acyl hydrazones would thus be prime candidates for further development as chemotherapeutic agents. Taken together, our results reveal a critical requirement for iron in Wnt signaling and they show that iron chelation serves as an effective mechanism to inhibit Wnt signaling in humans.","['Song, Siyuan', 'Christova, Tania', 'Perusini, Stephen', 'Alizadeh, Solmaz', 'Bao, Ren-Yue', 'Miller, Bryan W', 'Hurren, Rose', 'Jitkova, Yulia', 'Gronda, Marcela', 'Isaac, Methvin', 'Joseph, Babu', 'Subramaniam, Ratheesh', 'Aman, Ahmed', 'Chau, Anh', 'Hogge, Donna E', 'Weir, Scott J', 'Kasper, James', 'Schimmer, Aaron D', 'Al-awar, Rima', 'Wrana, Jeff L', 'Attisano, Liliana']","['Song S', 'Christova T', 'Perusini S', 'Alizadeh S', 'Bao RY', 'Miller BW', 'Hurren R', 'Jitkova Y', 'Gronda M', 'Isaac M', 'Joseph B', 'Subramaniam R', 'Aman A', 'Chau A', 'Hogge DE', 'Weir SJ', 'Kasper J', 'Schimmer AD', 'Al-awar R', 'Wrana JL', 'Attisano L']","['Department of Biochemistry, Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111018,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Hydrazones)', '0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', '0 (Pyridones)', '0 (Triazoles)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '19W019ZDRJ (Ciclopirox)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)', 'V8G4MOF2V9 (Deferasirox)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Administration, Oral', 'Benzoates/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Ciclopirox', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Deferasirox', 'Deferoxamine/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrazones/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Iron Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Pyridones/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Triazoles/pharmacology', 'Wnt Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/*drug effects', 'beta Catenin/genetics/*metabolism']",,2011/10/20 06:00,2012/03/07 06:00,['2011/10/20 06:00'],"['2011/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-11-2745 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-2745 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2011 Dec 15;71(24):7628-39. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-2745.

Neutrophils isolated from human peripheral blood have been used for a number of studies conducted for evaluation of immunomodulating drugs, cytokines, and microbe products. Human promyelocytic leukemia cells, HL-60, have been extensively studied because they can differentiate into neutrophil-like cells by addition of all-trans retinoic acid or dimethyl sulfoxide. For a system that would always allow experimental use of granulocytic cells in a uniformly activated state, we have established HL-60 cell lines with increased migratory activity by transducing the CXC chemokine receptor 1 (CXCR1) gene.

However, the tissue obtained by this method is insufficient to define and type the tumour. This article demonstrates the feasibility and safety of the laparoscopic approach in obtaining an adequate volume of lymph node tissue for typing. METHODS: Laparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph node biopsy was performed on 12 patients over a period of five years. A pneumoperitoneum was induced with a Veress needle, and an initial 10-mm trocar was inserted in the sub-umbilical region in order to carry a 30-degree telescope. Two or more 5-mm ports were inserted into the targeted areas under laparoscopic guidance to achieve optimal triangulation in order to access the nodal tissue. RESULTS: The procedure was successful in 11 out of the 12 patients. An average volume of 1.7 cm3 of tissue was harvested for each patient. In one patient with preoperatively undiagnosed portal hypertension, laparoscopy was converted to an open procedure due to bleeding. In all patients, the histology was adequate and contributed to the diagnosis, allowing rapid institution of treatment. The diagnosis was reactive lymphadenopathy in three patients and sarcoidosis in one patient. Seven others suffered from various conditions, including lymphoma, leukaemia, secondary from unknown origin and Castleman's disease. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopy allows access to perihepatic and perisplenic areas, and is a procedure of choice when needle biopsy is not possible or fails to provide an adequate sample.","['Durai, R', 'Mir, N', 'Ng, P C H']","['Durai R', 'Mir N', 'Ng PC']","['Department of Surgery and Haematology, University Hospital Lewisham, Lewisham High Street, London, SE13 6LH, UK. dr_durai@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Singapore,Singapore Med J,Singapore medical journal,0404516,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biopsy, Needle/*methods', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Laparoscopy/*methods', 'Lymph Node Excision/methods', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology/*surgery', 'Male', 'Mesentery/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures/methods', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Pneumoperitoneum, Artificial/methods', 'Retroperitoneal Space/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed/methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2011/10/20 06:00,2012/03/16 06:00,['2011/10/20 06:00'],"['2011/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/16 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Singapore Med J. 2011 Oct;52(10):758-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Children with ALL receiving 6-MP in maintenance phase of treatment (n = 90) were enrolled in the study. Bidirectional sequencing of TPMT (whole gene) and ITPA (exon 2, exon 3, and intron 2) was undertaken, and correlation between genotype and 6-MP toxicity was assessed. RESULTS: Five variations were observed in TPMT, including two exonic variations, TPMT*12 (374 C > T) and TPMT*3C (719A > G), and three intronic, intron 3 (12356 C > T), intron 4 (16638 C > T), and TPMT rs2842949. Two exonic, ITPA exon -2 (94 C --> A) and exon 3 of ITPA (138 G > A), and one intronic, ITPA intron 2 (A-->C), variations were observed in ITPA. Multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis of all the genetic variants showed independent association of ITPA 94 C-->A as well as synergic epistatic interactions, i.e., TPMT*12 x ITPA ex3, ITPA ex2 x TPMT*12 x ITPA ex3, and TPMT*3C x ITPA ex2 x TPMT*12 x ITPA ex3, in determining hematological toxicity. This is further substantiated by a multiple linear regression model, which showed moderate predictability of toxicity with these variants (area under the curve = 0.70, p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that apart from the individual effect of ITPA 94 C-->A, epistatic interactions between the variations of TPMT (*3C, *12) and ITPA (ex2, ex3) are associated with the 6-MP toxicity. Testing these variants facilitates tailoring of the 6-MP therapy in children with ALL.","['Dorababu, Patchva', 'Nagesh, Narayana', 'Linga, Vijay Gandhi', 'Gundeti, Sadashivudu', 'Kutala, Vijay Kumar', 'Reddanna, Pallu', 'Digumarti, Raghunadharao']","['Dorababu P', 'Nagesh N', 'Linga VG', 'Gundeti S', 'Kutala VK', 'Reddanna P', 'Digumarti R']","[""Department of Medical Oncology, Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Panjagutta, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India.""]",['eng'],"['Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111019,Germany,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,European journal of clinical pharmacology,1256165,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Pyrophosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.1.9 (ITPA protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*toxicity', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'India', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/*toxicity', 'Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy', 'Pyrophosphatases/*genetics']",,2011/10/20 06:00,2012/07/11 06:00,['2011/10/20 06:00'],"['2011/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00228-011-1133-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 2012 Apr;68(4):379-87. doi: 10.1007/s00228-011-1133-1.

A major safety concern for gene delivery achieved by murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based retroviral vectors is the activation of adjacent cellular genes including oncogenes following integration into the host genome. Self-inactivating (SIN) vectors lacking viral enhancers/promoters in their 3' long terminal repeat (LTR) have been proposed as a means of overcoming this safety concern. However the MLV-based SIN vectors currently used by laboratories to assess insertional mutagenesis, integration site selection, and the potency of transgene expression are not uniform in the composition of their 3' LTRs. We constructed a series of SIN vectors representative of the currently employed vectors, but lacking an internal promoter. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used as a reporter gene. Target cells exposed to these vectors were evaluated for number of integrants and GFP expression at the messenger RNA (mRNA) level and protein level. We found that viral promoter activity in the 3' LTR is not attenuated in many currently employed SIN vectors. These results suggest that the influence of strong residual promoter activity should be taken into consideration when interpreting experimental results obtained using SIN vectors in gene therapy research.","['Xu, Wenqin', 'Russ, Jill L', 'Eiden, Maribeth V']","['Xu W', 'Russ JL', 'Eiden MV']","['Section on Directed Gene Transfer, Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Regulation, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20111018,United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gammaretrovirus/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Order', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Virus Integration']",PMC3255602,2011/10/20 06:00,2012/07/12 06:00,['2011/10/20 06:00'],"['2011/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S1525-0016(16)30453-1 [pii]', '10.1038/mt.2011.204 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2012 Jan;20(1):84-90. doi: 10.1038/mt.2011.204.

This chimeric oncoprotein disrupts wild-type AML1 function and dysregulates genes important for normal myelopoiesis. Monoclonal antibodies that can capture and detect the AML1-ETO fusion protein would help with early diagnosis and treatment prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia. We report the development of murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that specifically bind epitopes encoded by either AML1 or ETO. Since alignment to the human ETO protein indicated almost 100% homology to the mouse ortholog, a strategy was needed to instruct humoral immunity in mice to focus and respond to self-epitopes. Our strategy to develop capture/detector reagents involved producing MAbs that would bind to epitopes within the non-fused myelopic protein (i.e., either AML1 or ETO). This included a process to select antibodies for their ability to also recognize the translocated chromosomal AML1-ETO fusion protein and to identify complementary capture/detector antibody pairs. Construction of a peptide hapten-carrier complex and use of a rapid immunization protocol resulted in IgM-IgG ETO specific MAbs. These MAbs bound specifically to a recombinant form of AML1-ETO fusion protein expressed in HEK and to an endogenous AML1-ETO form of the fusion protein expressed in Kasumi-1. We report the development of murine hybridoma MAbs derived from immunizations with a peptide ""self-epitope."" Our findings provide a potential strategy to instruct humoral immunity in mice to focus and respond to self-epitopes.

Here, we assessed how common cancer chemotherapeutic agents perturb cytosine methylation in Jurkat-T acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. We tested six antitumor agents and found that cyclophosphamide induced the most pronounced increase in global DNA cytosine methylation after a 24-h treatment. Long-term treatment with cyclophosphamide led to a time-dependent increase in cytosine methylation level with up to 4 days of treatment, and the extent of cytosine methylation returned to normal level after 8 days. The trend of change in DNA methylation level paralleled that of the expression level of DNMT1 protein, whereas no significant increase in DNMT1 mRNA level was observed. Previous studies showed that the stability of endogenous DNMT1 protein is regulated by lysine methylation through histone lysine methyltransferase Set7 and lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), with the methylated DNMT1 being the target for proteasomal degradation. We observed that the elevated expression of DNMT1 protein at 4 days of treatment was correlated with the increased expression of LSD1 protein and with the decreased frequency of K142 methylation in DNMT1. Taken together, our results showed that cyclophosphamide perturbed temporarily global cytosine methylation in Jurkat-T cells via regulation of the lysine methylation level in DNMT1.","['Zhang, Jing', 'Yuan, Bifeng', 'Zhang, Fan', 'Xiong, Lei', 'Wu, Jiang', 'Pradhan, Sriharsa', 'Wang, Yinsheng']","['Zhang J', 'Yuan B', 'Zhang F', 'Xiong L', 'Wu J', 'Pradhan S', 'Wang Y']","[""Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Life Science of Shaanxi Province, School of Chemistry & Chemical Engineering, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an 710062, P.

These cytokines also trigger the local loss of TH in peri-infarct sympathetic axons after myocardial infarction, but altered gene expression cannot explain the selective loss of TH enzyme in one region of the heart. We hypothesized that inflammatory cytokines, which are highest near the infarct, stimulated local degradation of TH protein. We used cultured sympathetic neurons and neuroblastoma cells to test this hypothesis. The cytokines ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) suppressed TH content in both neurons and neuroblastoma cells. CNTF suppressed TH in a gp130-dependent manner, and decreased the half-life of TH protein by approximately 50%. CNTF stimulated the ubiquitination of TH in both neurons and neuroblastoma cells, and the proteasome inhibitors MG-132 and lactacystin prevented the CNTF-induced loss of TH protein. Inhibiting activation of extracellular signal regulated kinases 1&2 (ERK1/2) with U0126 prevented the CNTF-induced ubiquitination of TH and the associated decrease in protein half-life. Likewise, inhibiting ERK1/2 activation blunted the cytokine-stimulated loss of TH protein in sympathetic neurons, despite enhancing the loss of TH mRNA. These data suggest that gp130 cytokines stimulate proteasomal degradation of TH through an ERK1/2 dependent pathway, and may have important implications for local regulation of neurotransmission at sites of inflammation.","['Shi, Xiao', 'Habecker, Beth A']","['Shi X', 'Habecker BA']","['Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111111,England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (U 0126)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'EC 1.14.16.2 (Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase)', 'EC 1.14.17.1 (Dopamine beta-Hydroxylase)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Butadienes/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/pharmacology', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Dopamine beta-Hydroxylase/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Ganglia, Spinal/cytology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/*metabolism', 'Neurons/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Pregnancy', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination/drug effects']",PMC3243797,2011/10/20 06:00,2012/02/10 06:00,['2011/10/20 06:00'],"['2011/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1471-4159.2011.07539.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurochem. 2012 Jan;120(2):239-47. doi: 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2011.07539.x.

However, drug resistance is an obstacle that often impairs the successful use of chemotherapies. Therefore, overcoming drug resistance would lead to better therapeutic outcomes for cancer patients. Recently, studies by our own and other groups have demonstrated that there is an intimate correlation between the loss of the F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (FBW7) tumor suppressor and the incurring drug resistance. While loss of FBW7 sensitizes cancer cells to certain drugs, FBW7-/- cells are more resistant to other types of chemotherapies. FBW7 exerts its tumor suppressor function by promoting the degradation of various oncoproteins that regulate many cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, cellular metabolism, differentiation, and apoptosis. Since loss of the FBW7 tumor suppressor is linked to drug resistance, FBW7 may represent a novel therapeutic target to increase drug sensitivity of cancer cells to conventional chemotherapeutics. This paper thus focuses on the new functional aspects of FBW7 in drug resistance.","['Wang, Zhiwei', 'Fukushima, Hidefumi', 'Gao, Daming', 'Inuzuka, Hiroyuki', 'Wan, Lixin', 'Lau, Alan W', 'Liu, Pengda', 'Wei, Wenyi']","['Wang Z', 'Fukushima H', 'Gao D', 'Inuzuka H', 'Wan L', 'Lau AW', 'Liu P', 'Wei W']","['Department of Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",20110830,United States,Bioessays,"BioEssays : news and reviews in molecular, cellular and developmental biology",8510851,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (F-Box Proteins)', '0 (F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7)', '0 (FBXW7 protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Apoptosis', 'Benzenesulfonates/pharmacology', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'F-Box Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Sorafenib', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",PMC3364519,2011/10/19 06:00,2012/02/10 06:00,['2011/10/19 06:00'],"['2011/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/31 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/bies.201100101 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioessays. 2011 Nov;33(11):851-9. doi: 10.1002/bies.201100101.

Three hundred and five (16.7%) patients had extranodal involvement (in 1821 regions). The major extranodal location was the stomach. CONCLUSION: It seems that our data make a contribution to the relevant literature, because the epidemiologic data of Turkey are inadequate, and hematopoietic neoplasms have different geographic distribution.","['Kilciksiz, S', 'Pehlivan, M', 'Yilmaz, E B', 'Payzin, B', 'Bener, S', 'Baloglu, A']","['Kilciksiz S', 'Pehlivan M', 'Yilmaz EB', 'Payzin B', 'Bener S', 'Baloglu A']","['Okmeydani Research and Training hospital, Department of Radiation Oncology, Okmeydani, Istanbul, Turkey. sevilkilciksiz@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Cyprus,J BUON,Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,100883428,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Registries', 'Turkey/epidemiology']",,2011/10/19 06:00,2012/01/06 06:00,['2011/10/19 06:00'],"['2011/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/06 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J BUON. 2011 Jul-Sep;16(3):505-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inflammatory stimulus increases glutamatergic transmission, especially at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, which are usually coupled to the activation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation modulates the expression of genes involved in development, plasticity, and inflammation. The present work investigated the effects of OUA on NF-kappaB binding activity in rat hippocampus and the influence of this OUA-Na,K-ATPase signaling cascade in NMDA-mediated NF-kappaB activation. The findings presented here are the first report indicating that intrahippocampal administration of OUA, in a concentration that did not alter Na,K-ATPase or NOS activity, induced an activation of NF-kappaB, leading to increases in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf), inducible NOS (iNos), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (Tnf-alpha), and B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) mRNA levels. This response was not linked to any significant signs of neurodegeneration as showed via Fluoro-Jade B and Nissl stain. Intrahippocampal administration of NMDA induced NF-kappaB activation and increased NOS and alpha(2/3) -Na,K-ATPase activities. NMDA treatment further increased OUA-induced NF-kappaB activation, which was partially blocked by MK-801, an antagonist of NMDA receptor. These results suggest that OUA-induced NF-kappaB activation is at least in part dependent on Na,K-ATPase modulatory action of NMDA receptor in hippocampus. The interaction of these signaling pathways could be associated with biological mechanisms that may underlie the basal homeostatic state linked to the inflammatory signaling cascade in the brain.","['Kawamoto, E M', 'Lima, L S', 'Munhoz, C D', 'Yshii, L M', 'Kinoshita, P F', 'Amara, F G', 'Pestana, R R F', 'Orellana, A M M', 'Cipolla-Neto, J', 'Britto, L R G', 'Avellar, M C W', 'Rossoni, L V', 'Scavone, C']","['Kawamoto EM', 'Lima LS', 'Munhoz CD', 'Yshii LM', 'Kinoshita PF', 'Amara FG', 'Pestana RR', 'Orellana AM', 'Cipolla-Neto J', 'Britto LR', 'Avellar MC', 'Rossoni LV', 'Scavone C']","['Molecular Neuropharmacology Laboratory, Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Biomedical Science, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111018,United States,J Neurosci Res,Journal of neuroscience research,7600111,"['0 (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '5ACL011P69 (Ouabain)', '6384-92-5 (N-Methylaspartate)', '6LR8C1B66Q (Dizocilpine Maleate)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)', 'EC 7.2.2.13 (Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Dizocilpine Maleate/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay/methods', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects', 'Hippocampus/cytology/*drug effects', 'Male', 'N-Methylaspartate/pharmacology', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Neurons/cytology/drug effects', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides/pharmacology', 'Ouabain/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/*metabolism', 'Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",,2011/10/19 06:00,2012/03/14 06:00,['2011/10/19 06:00'],"['2010/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/25 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jnr.22745 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurosci Res. 2012 Jan;90(1):213-28. doi: 10.1002/jnr.22745.

Hypoxia is a common feature of solid tumors because of poorly organized tumor-induced neovasculature. Hypoxia is associated with advanced stage and poor outcome in a range of tumor types, and leads to resistance to clinically relevant cytotoxic agents in neuroblastoma and other pediatric tumors in vitro. Resistance to apoptosis is a common feature of tumor cells and leads to pleiotropic drug resistance, mediated by Bcl-2 family proteins. ABT-737 is a novel small-molecule inhibitor of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L) that is able to induce apoptosis in a range of tumor types. Neuroblastoma cell lines are relatively resistant to ABT-737-induced apoptosis in normoxia, but in contrast to the situation with conventional cytotoxic agents are more sensitive in hypoxia. This sensitization is because of an increase in ABT-737-induced apoptosis and is variably dependent upon the presence of functional hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) alpha. In contrast to the situation in colon carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer cells, hypoxia does not result in downregulation of the known ABT-737 resistance factor, Mcl-1, nor any other Bcl-2 family proteins. ABT-737 sensitizes neuroblastoma cells to clinically relevant cytotoxic agents under normal levels of oxygen, and importantly, this sensitization is maintained under hypoxia when neuroblastoma cells are resistant to these agents. Thus rational combinations of ABT-737 and conventional cytotoxics offer a novel approach to overcoming hypoxia-induced drug resistance in neuroblastoma.","['Klymenko, Tetyana', 'Brandenburg, Martin', 'Morrow, Christopher', 'Dive, Caroline', 'Makin, Guy']","['Klymenko T', 'Brandenburg M', 'Morrow C', 'Dive C', 'Makin G']","['Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology Group, Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, Manchester, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111017,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (MYCN protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (N-Myc Proto-Oncogene Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Hypoxia/drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'N-Myc Proto-Oncogene Protein', 'Neuroblastoma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oxygen/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC3242074,2011/10/19 06:00,2012/05/12 06:00,['2011/10/19 06:00'],"['2011/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-11-0326 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-11-0326 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2011 Dec;10(12):2373-83. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-11-0326.

We show that BTZ induces the phosphorylation of several mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, including MEK/ERK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK. BTZ-induced cell differentiation is almost completely reversed by PD98059, an inhibitor of MEK, which also attenuates the increase in phospho-JNK p46. However, p38 activation does not appear to be required for the differentiation induced by BTZ. Furthermore, the differentiation effect of BTZ is associated with increased protein level of signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1), a molecular determinant of myeloid differentiation, due to effects on both its synthesis and degradation. In short, this study reveals that BTZ activates the MEK/ERK cascade, which further up-regulates the expression and activity of the key myeloid transcription factor STAT1, thus promoting myeloid differentiation. These findings contribute to an unexpected potential mechanism for the antitumor activity of BTZ in AML.","['Zhou, Xinglu', 'Fang, Yanfen', 'Jing, Hui', 'Zhong, Like', 'Luo, Peihua', 'Song, Hua', 'Yang, Bo', 'He, Qiaojun']","['Zhou X', 'Fang Y', 'Jing H', 'Zhong L', 'Luo P', 'Song H', 'Yang B', 'He Q']","['Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111017,United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2011/10/19 06:00,2013/02/23 06:00,['2011/10/19 06:00'],"['2011/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/29 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/mc.20873 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 2013 Jan;52(1):18-28. doi: 10.1002/mc.20873.

We identified NOTCH1 or NOTCH2 mutations in ~75% of cutaneous SCCs and in a lesser fraction of lung SCCs, defining a spectrum for the most prevalent tumor suppressor specific to these epithelial malignancies. Notch receptors normally transduce signals in response to ligands on neighboring cells, regulating metazoan lineage selection and developmental patterning. Our findings therefore illustrate a central role for disruption of microenvironmental communication in cancer progression. NOTCH aberrations include frameshift and nonsense mutations leading to receptor truncations as well as point substitutions in key functional domains that abrogate signaling in cell-based assays. Oncogenic gain-of-function mutations in NOTCH1 commonly occur in human T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The bifunctional role of Notch in human cancer thus emphasizes the context dependency of signaling outcomes and suggests that targeted inhibition of the Notch pathway may induce squamous epithelial malignancies.","['Wang, Nicholas J', 'Sanborn, Zachary', 'Arnett, Kelly L', 'Bayston, Laura J', 'Liao, Wilson', 'Proby, Charlotte M', 'Leigh, Irene M', 'Collisson, Eric A', 'Gordon, Patricia B', 'Jakkula, Lakshmi', 'Pennypacker, Sally', 'Zou, Yong', 'Sharma, Mimansa', 'North, Jeffrey P', 'Vemula, Swapna S', 'Mauro, Theodora M', 'Neuhaus, Isaac M', 'Leboit, Philip E', 'Hur, Joe S', 'Park, Kyunghee', 'Huh, Nam', 'Kwok, Pui-Yan', 'Arron, Sarah T', 'Massion, Pierre P', 'Bale, Allen E', 'Haussler, David', 'Cleaver, James E', 'Gray, Joe W', 'Spellman, Paul T', 'South, Andrew P', 'Aster, Jon C', 'Blacklow, Stephen C', 'Cho, Raymond J']","['Wang NJ', 'Sanborn Z', 'Arnett KL', 'Bayston LJ', 'Liao W', 'Proby CM', 'Leigh IM', 'Collisson EA', 'Gordon PB', 'Jakkula L', 'Pennypacker S', 'Zou Y', 'Sharma M', 'North JP', 'Vemula SS', 'Mauro TM', 'Neuhaus IM', 'Leboit PE', 'Hur JS', 'Park K', 'Huh N', 'Kwok PY', 'Arron ST', 'Massion PP', 'Bale AE', 'Haussler D', 'Cleaver JE', 'Gray JW', 'Spellman PT', 'South AP', 'Aster JC', 'Blacklow SC', 'Cho RJ']","['Life Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20111017,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Codon, Nonsense)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (NOTCH2 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptor, Notch2)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*genetics', 'Cell Communication/*genetics', 'Codon, Nonsense/genetics', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Humans', 'Lod Score', 'Lung Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics', 'Receptor, Notch2/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics', 'Skin Neoplasms/*genetics']",PMC3203814,2011/10/19 06:00,2011/12/20 06:00,['2011/10/19 06:00'],"['2011/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [medline]']","['1114669108 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1114669108 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Oct 25;108(43):17761-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1114669108.

High risk can be defined by cytogenetics (Complex; abnormalities of chromosome 5 and 7; 3q-; Ph(1)) in addition, adverse features could include presentation with high white cell count or secondary disease, or a failure to have a satisfactory blast cell reduction to induction course 1 (to <15% marrow blasts), an EVI-1 mutation, although the risk with that mutation is frequently primary resistance. While there is an increasing list of molecular characteristics that could indicate a higher risk, there is in general an absence of clear evidence that they are predictive of a benefit from transplant. This does not mean that they should not be transplanted, just that it is uncertain. Some of the newer markers like minimal residual disease fall into the same category. The decision to allograft is also influenced by the estimated transplant risk. This can be minimised by high quality molecular matching techniques, the availability of a non-parous donor who is CMV seronegative and a patient with a favourable co-morbidity score. Patients who do fail first-line chemotherapy require an allograft unless the duration of first remission, which is a major determinant of outcome, is long e.g. >2 years. The possible exception to this could be core binding factor leukaemias who may have durable survival after relapse with transplant alone.","['Burnett, Alan K', 'Hills, Robert K']","['Burnett AK', 'Hills RK']","['Department of Haematology, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Heath Park, UK.

However, evidence involving short telomeres in cancer development in humans is scarce, epidemiological and indirect. Here we directly implicate telomere shortening as a critical molecular event for malignant evolution in aplastic anemia (AA). Patients' telomere lengths at diagnosis of AA, while comparable to age-matched controls, inversely correlated with the probability of developing a cytogenetically abnormal clone. A significantly increased number of telomere signal-free chromosomal ends and chromosomal numerical and structural abnormalities were observed in bone marrow cells of patients with shorter telomeres in comparison with patients with longer telomeres and healthy subjects. The proportion of monosomy-7 cells in the bone marrow at diagnosis of AA inversely correlated with telomere length, years before the emergence of an autonomous and clinically detectable abnormal clone. Marrow cells of clinically healthy individuals carrying loss-of-function telomerase mutations and with extremely short telomeres also showed chromosomal instability in vitro. These results provide the first clinical direct evidence in humans that short telomeres in hematopoietic cells are dysfunctional, mediate chromosomal instability and predispose to malignant transformation in a human disease.","['Calado, R T', 'Cooper, J N', 'Padilla-Nash, H M', 'Sloand, E M', 'Wu, C O', 'Scheinberg, P', 'Ried, T', 'Young, N S']","['Calado RT', 'Cooper JN', 'Padilla-Nash HM', 'Sloand EM', 'Wu CO', 'Scheinberg P', 'Ried T', 'Young NS']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA. calador@nhlbi.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111018,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Aplastic/complications/*genetics', 'Aneuploidy', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomal Instability', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic System/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Telomere Shortening']",PMC4169071,2011/10/19 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2011/10/19 06:00'],"['2011/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011272 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.272 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Apr;26(4):700-7. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.272.

Conversely, exposure of CML cells to a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) enhances migration of CML cells towards stromal cell layers and promotes non-pharmacological resistance to imatinib. Src-related kinase Lyn is known to interact with CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling and is directly activated by p210 Bcr-Abl. In this study, we demonstrate that TKI treatment promoted CXCR4 redistribution into the lipid raft fraction, in which it co-localized with active phosphorylated form of Lyn (LynTyr396) in CML cells. Lyn inhibition or cholesterol depletion abrogated imatinib-induced migration, and dual Src/Abl kinase inhibitor dasatinib induced fewer CML cells to migrate to the stroma. These findings demonstrate the novel mechanism of microenvironment-mediated resistance through lipid raft modulation, which involves compartmental changes of the multivalent CXCR4 and Lyn complex. We propose that pharmacological targeting of lipid rafts may eliminate bone marrow-resident CML cells through interference with microenvironment-mediated resistance.","['Tabe, Y', 'Jin, L', 'Iwabuchi, K', 'Wang, R-Y', 'Ichikawa, N', 'Miida, T', 'Cortes, J', 'Andreeff, M', 'Konopleva, M']","['Tabe Y', 'Jin L', 'Iwabuchi K', 'Wang RY', 'Ichikawa N', 'Miida T', 'Cortes J', 'Andreeff M', 'Konopleva M']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111018,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chemokine CXCL12/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Microdomains/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Binding', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stromal Cells/*metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/*metabolism']",,2011/10/19 06:00,2012/07/06 06:00,['2011/10/19 06:00'],"['2011/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011291 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.291 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 May;26(5):883-92. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.291.

This review focuses on the pathophysiology of MM with an emphasis on the events that drive MM progression within the bone and the mechanisms by which BPs may inhibit specific processes. The underlying molecular mechanisms that drive the modulation of cellular fate and function and consequent physiological outcomes are described.

We investigated the modulation of a series of putative asparaginase-resistance/sensitivity genes in B-precursor ALL cells upon coculture with BMSCs. Coculture with stromal cells resulted in increased insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) expression by ALL cells. Assays with IGFBP7 knockdown ALL and stromal cell lines, or with addition of recombinant rIGFBP7 (rIGFBP7) to the culture medium, showed that IGFBP7 acts as a positive regulator of ALL and stromal cells growth, and significantly enhances in-vitro resistance of ALL to asparaginase. In these assays, IGFBP7 function occurred mainly in an insulin- and stromal-dependent manner. ALL cells were found to contribute substantially to extracellular IGFBP7 levels in the conditioned coculture medium. Diagnostic BM plasma from children with ALL had higher levels of IGFBP7 than controls. IGFBP7, in an insulin/IGF-dependent manner, enhanced asparagine synthetase expression and asparagine secretion by BMSCs, thus providing a stromal-dependent mechanism by which IGFBP7 protects ALL cells against asparaginase in this coculture system. Importantly, higher IGFBP7 mRNA levels were associated with lower leukemia-free survival (Cox regression model, P=0.003) in precursor B-cell Ph(-) ALL patients (n=147) treated with a contemporary polychemotherapy protocol.","['Laranjeira, A B A', 'de Vasconcellos, J F', 'Sodek, L', 'Spago, M C', 'Fornazim, M C', 'Tone, L G', 'Brandalise, S R', 'Nowill, A E', 'Yunes, J A']","['Laranjeira AB', 'de Vasconcellos JF', 'Sodek L', 'Spago MC', 'Fornazim MC', 'Tone LG', 'Brandalise SR', 'Nowill AE', 'Yunes JA']","['Centro Infantil Boldrini, Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Campinas, SP, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111018,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (insulin-like growth factor binding protein-related protein 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Asparaginase/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Stromal Cells/*pathology']",,2011/10/19 06:00,2012/07/06 06:00,['2011/10/19 06:00'],"['2011/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011289 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.289 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 May;26(5):1001-11. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.289.

We have tested EXEL-8232, an experimental potent JAK2 inhibitor, for efficacy in suppression of thrombocytosis in vivo and for its ability to attenuate MPLW515L myeloproliferative disease. EXEL-8232 was administered for 28 days q12 h by oral gavage at doses of 30 or 100 mg/kg, prospectively. Animals treated with EXEL-8232 at 100 mg/kg had normalized high platelet counts, eliminated extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen and eliminated bone marrow fibrosis, whereas the wild-type controls did not develop thrombocytopenia. Consistent with a clinical response in this model, we validated surrogate end points for response to treatment, including a reduction of endogenous colony growth and signaling inhibition in immature erythroid and myeloid primary cells both in vitro and upon treatment in vivo.

Surrogate markers for a low burden of early childhood infections are also related to increased risk for developing childhood ALL. It remains uncertain, whether siblings of children with ALL have an increased risk of developing ALL. This international collaboration identified 54 sibships with two (N = 51) or more (N = 3) cases of childhood ALL (ages <18 years). The 5-year event-free survival for 61 patients diagnosed after 1 January 1990 was 0.83 +/- 0.05. Ages at diagnosis (Spearman correlation coefficient, r(S) = 0.41, P = 0.002) were significantly correlated, but not WBCs (r(S) = 0.23, P = 0.11). In 18 sibships with successful karyotyping in both cases, six were concordant for high-hyperdiploidy (N = 3), t(12;21) [ETV6/RUNX1] (N = 1), MLL rearrangement (N = 1) or t(1;19)(q23/p13) (N = 1). Eleven sibships were ALL-subtype concordant, being T-cell ALL (T-ALL) (N = 5, of a total of six sibships, where the first-born had T-ALL) or B-lineage ALL belonging to the same cytogenetic subset (N = 6), a finding that differs significantly from the expected chance distribution (kappa: 0.58; P < 0.0001). These data indicate strong genetic and/or environmental risk factors for childhood ALL that are restricted to specific ALL subtypes, which must be taken into account, when performing epidemiological studies to reveal etiological factors.","['Schmiegelow, K', 'Lausten Thomsen, U', 'Baruchel, A', 'Pacheco, C E', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira, M S', 'Andersen, E W', 'Rostgaard, K', 'Hjalgrim, H', 'Pui, C-H']","['Schmiegelow K', 'Lausten Thomsen U', 'Baruchel A', 'Pacheco CE', 'Pieters R', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira MS', 'Andersen EW', 'Rostgaard K', 'Hjalgrim H', 'Pui CH']","['Pediatric Clinics, The Juliane Marie Centre, The University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark. kschmiegelow@rh.dk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111018,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/etiology/*genetics/mortality', 'Risk Factors']",,2011/10/19 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2011/10/19 06:00'],"['2011/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011274 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.274 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Apr;26(4):675-81. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.274.

Currently there are no accepted measures of cGVHD activity to aid in clinical management and disease staging. We analyzed clinical markers of inflammation in the sera of patients with established cGVHD and correlated those with definitions of disease activity. In all, 189 adults with cGVHD (33% moderate and 66% severe according to National Institutes of Health (NIH) global scoring) were consecutively enrolled onto a cross-sectional prospective cGVHD natural history study. At the time of evaluation, 80% were receiving systemic immunosuppression and failed a median of four prior systemic therapies (PST) for their cGVHD. Lower albumin (P<0.0001), higher C-reactive protein (P = 0.043), higher platelets (P = 0.030) and higher number of PST (P<0.0001) were associated with active disease defined as clinician's intention to intensify or alter systemic therapy due to the lack of response. Higher platelet count (P = 0.021) and higher number of PST (P<0.0001) were associated with more severe diseased defined by NIH global score.

Jurkat and HL-60 cells were more sensitive than MCF-7 and HCT-116 cells. Upon coordinating to the gold(I) metal centers in complexes (2) and (4), the cytotoxic activity of the H2Ac4Me and H2Bz4Ph ligands increased against the HL-60 and Jurkat tumor cell lines. 2 was more active than auranofin against both leukemia cells. Most of the studied compounds were less toxic than auranofin to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).

METHODS: Karyotyping and BCR-ABL TKD mutation screening were performed in 71 imatinib-resistant CML patients and 6 Ph+ ALL patients. A total of 56 out of these 77 patients received second-generation TKI. RESULTS: ACAs were present in 30 of 65 imatinib-resistant patients (46%). In 27 of 74 imatinib-resistant patients (36%), 15 different BCR-ABL TKD mutations were detected. Mutations were found in 25% of chronic-phase patients (12/47), 33% of accelerated-phase patients (5/15), 71% of blast crisis CML patients (5/7) and 100% of ALL patients. In nilotinib-resistant patients, Y253H, T315I and F359I/V mutations were detected; in dasatinib-resistant patients, L248M, E279K and T315I mutations were detected. T315I was found more frequently in patients on dasatinib than on imatinib therapy. The presence of ACAs predicted shorter survival during first- and second-generation TKI therapy, while TKD mutations only influenced survival during second-generation TKI therapy. CONCLUSION: For patients with TKI resistance, mutation and ACA screening may play a role in identifying patients with poorer prognosis.","['Meggyesi, Nora', 'Kozma, Andras', 'Halm, Gabriella', 'Nahajevszky, Sarolta', 'Batai, Arpad', 'Fekete, Sandor', 'Barta, Aniko', 'Ujj, Gyorgy', 'Lueff, Sandor', 'Sipos, Andrea', 'Adam, Emma', 'Bors, Andras', 'Remenyi, Peter', 'Masszi, Tamas', 'Tordai, Attila', 'Andrikovics, Hajnalka']","['Meggyesi N', 'Kozma A', 'Halm G', 'Nahajevszky S', 'Batai A', 'Fekete S', 'Barta A', 'Ujj G', 'Lueff S', 'Sipos A', 'Adam E', 'Bors A', 'Remenyi P', 'Masszi T', 'Tordai A', 'Andrikovics H']","['Laboratory of Molecular Diagnostics, Hungarian National Blood Transfusion Service, St. Istvan-St. Laszlo Hospital, Budapest, Hungary. nora.meggyesi@kkk.org.hu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111014,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/*genetics', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Hungary', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/enzymology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Point Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Survival Rate']",,2011/10/19 06:00,2012/02/15 06:00,['2011/10/19 06:00'],"['2011/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [medline]']","['000331472 [pii]', '10.1159/000331472 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2012;127(1):34-42. doi: 10.1159/000331472.

Although low-level benzene exposure is widespread and may induce oxidative damage, no mechanistic biomarkers are available to detect biological dysfunction at low doses. OBJECTIVES: Our goals were to determine in a large multicenter cross-sectional study whether low-level benzene is associated with increased blood mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn, a biological oxidative response to mitochondrial DNA damage and dysfunction) and to explore potential links between mtDNAcn and leukemia-related epigenetic markers. METHODS: We measured blood relative mtDNAcn by real-time polymerase chain reaction in 341 individuals selected from various occupational groups with low-level benzene exposures (> 100 times lower than the Occupational Safety and Health Administration/European Union standards) and 178 referents from three Italian cities (Genoa, Milan, Cagliari). RESULTS: In each city, benzene-exposed participants showed higher mtDNAcn than referents: mtDNAcn was 0.90 relative units in Genoa bus drivers and 0.75 in referents (p = 0.019); 0.90 in Milan gas station attendants, 1.10 in police officers, and 0.75 in referents (p-trend = 0.008); 1.63 in Cagliari petrochemical plant workers, 1.25 in referents close to the plant, and 0.90 in referents farther from the plant (p-trend = 0.046). Using covariate-adjusted regression models, we estimated that an interquartile range increase in personal airborne benzene was associated with percent increases in mtDNAcn equal to 10.5% in Genoa (p = 0.014), 8.2% (p = 0.008) in Milan, 7.5% in Cagliari (p = 0.22), and 10.3% in all cities combined (p < 0.001). Using methylation data available for the Milan participants, we found that mtDNAcn was associated with LINE-1 hypomethylation (-2.41%; p = 0.007) and p15 hypermethylation (+15.95%, p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Blood MtDNAcn was increased in persons exposed to low benzene levels, potentially reflecting mitochondrial DNA damage and dysfunction.","['Carugno, Michele', 'Pesatori, Angela Cecilia', 'Dioni, Laura', 'Hoxha, Mirjam', 'Bollati, Valentina', 'Albetti, Benedetta', 'Byun, Hyang-Min', 'Bonzini, Matteo', 'Fustinoni, Silvia', 'Cocco, Pierluigi', 'Satta, Giannina', 'Zucca, Mariagrazia', 'Merlo, Domenico Franco', 'Cipolla, Massimo', 'Bertazzi, Pier Alberto', 'Baccarelli, Andrea']","['Carugno M', 'Pesatori AC', 'Dioni L', 'Hoxha M', 'Bollati V', 'Albetti B', 'Byun HM', 'Bonzini M', 'Fustinoni S', 'Cocco P', 'Satta G', 'Zucca M', 'Merlo DF', 'Cipolla M', 'Bertazzi PA', 'Baccarelli A']","['Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy. michele.carugno@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111017,United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,"['0 (Air Pollutants, Occupational)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (DNA, Mitochondrial)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Air Pollutants, Occupational/analysis/*toxicity', 'Benzene/analysis/*toxicity', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Cities/epidemiology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/blood/drug effects', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'DNA, Mitochondrial/*blood', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Gene Dosage/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Long Interspersed Nucleotide Elements', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Regression Analysis', 'Young Adult']",PMC3279451,2011/10/19 06:00,2012/05/30 06:00,['2011/10/19 06:00'],"['2011/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1289/ehp.1103979 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2012 Feb;120(2):210-5. doi: 10.1289/ehp.1103979.

The structures were determined using data obtained from (1)H and (13)C NMR spectra, as well as by various correlation experiments (COSY, HMQC and HMBC). The antioxidant activities of the isolated flavonoids from T. ramosissimum leaves were evaluated by measuring their ability to scavenge the radical ABTS(+) and through chemical assays: cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC), reducing power (RP) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). Furthermore, the effects of T. ramosissimum isolated molecules, on inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in human leukemia cells, were also examined. Cirsimaritin showed the best activity in the ABTS assay with TEAC value 2.04muM, whereas apigenin and 4',7-dimethoxy apigenin exhibited the highest antioxidant activity using the CUPRAC, RP and FRAP assays with TEAC values 10.5, 1.39 and 0.71muM respectively.

Recently, we described a series of powerful HDACi characterized by a 1,4-benzodiazepine (BDZ) ring hybridized with a linear alkyl chain bearing a hydroxamate function as Zn(++)--chelating group. Here, we explored the anti-leukaemic properties of three novel hybrids, namely the chiral compounds (S)-2 and (R)-2, and their non-chiral analogue 4, which were first comparatively tested in promyelocytic NB4 cells. (S)-2 and partially 4--but not (R)-2--caused G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest by up-regulating cyclin G2 and p21 expression and down-regulating cyclin D2 expression, and also apoptosis as assessed by cell morphology and cytofluorimetric assay, histone H2AX phosphorylation and PARP cleavage. Notably, these events were partly prevented by an anti-oxidant. Moreover, novel HDACi prompted p53 and alpha-tubulin acetylation and, consistently, inhibited HDAC1 and 6 activity. The rank order of potency was (S)-2 > 4 > (R)-2, reflecting that of other biological assays and addressing (S)-2 as the most effective compound capable of triggering apoptosis in various acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cell lines and blasts from patients with different AML subtypes. Importantly, (S)-2 was safe in mice (up to 150 mg/kg/week) as determined by liver, spleen, kidney and bone marrow histopathology; and displayed negligible affinity for peripheral/central BDZ-receptors. Overall, the BDZ-hydroxamate (S)-2 showed to be a low-toxic HDACi with powerful anti-proliferative and pro-apototic activities towards different cultured and primary AML cells, and therefore of clinical interest to support conventional anti-leukaemic therapy.","['Cellai, C', 'Balliu, M', 'Laurenzana, A', 'Guandalini, L', 'Matucci, R', 'Miniati, D', 'Torre, E', 'Nebbioso, A', 'Carafa, V', 'Altucci, L', 'Romanelli, M N', 'Paoletti, F']","['Cellai C', 'Balliu M', 'Laurenzana A', 'Guandalini L', 'Matucci R', 'Miniati D', 'Torre E', 'Nebbioso A', 'Carafa V', 'Altucci L', 'Romanelli MN', 'Paoletti F']","['Department of Experimental Pathology and Oncology, University of Florence, Sesto Fiorentino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptors, GABA-A)', '12794-10-4 (Benzodiazepines)', 'M4Z88L5FCM (Bz-423)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzodiazepines/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Fluorometry', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Receptors, GABA-A/metabolism', 'Toxicity Tests, Acute']",PMC3822689,2011/10/19 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2011/10/19 06:00'],"['2011/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1582-4934.2011.01464.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2012 Aug;16(8):1758-65. doi: 10.1111/j.1582-4934.2011.01464.x.,,,,,"['(c) 2012 The Authors Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine (c) 2012', 'Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine/Blackwell Publishing Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Whilst in myeloid cells IRF8 is known to modulate growth and differentiation, the role of IRF4 is poorly understood. In this study, we show that IRF4 has activities similar to IRF8 in regulating myeloid cell development. The ectopic expression of IRF4 in myeloid progenitor cells in vitro inhibits cell growth, promotes macrophages, but hinders granulocytic cell differentiation. We also show that IRF4 binds to and activates transcription through the IRF-Ets composite sequence (IECS). Furthermore, we demonstrate that Irf8(-)/(-)Irf4(-)/(-) mice exhibit a more severe chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)-like disease than Irf8(-)/(-) mice, involving a disproportionate expansion of granulocytes at the expense of monocytes/macrophages. Irf4(-)/(-) mice, however, display no obvious abnormality in myeloid cell development, presumably because IRF4 is expressed at a much lower level than IRF8 in granulocyte-macrophage progenitors. Our results also suggest that IRF8 and IRF4 have not only common but also specific activities in myeloid cells. Since the expression of both the IRF8 and IRF4 genes is downregulated in CML patients, these results may add to our understanding of CML pathogenesis.","['Yamamoto, Michio', 'Kato, Takayuki', 'Hotta, Chie', 'Nishiyama, Akira', 'Kurotaki, Daisuke', 'Yoshinari, Masahiro', 'Takami, Masamichi', 'Ichino, Motohide', 'Nakazawa, Masatoshi', 'Matsuyama, Toshifumi', 'Kamijo, Ryutaro', 'Kitagawa, Seiichi', 'Ozato, Keiko', 'Tamura, Tomohiko']","['Yamamoto M', 'Kato T', 'Hotta C', 'Nishiyama A', 'Kurotaki D', 'Yoshinari M', 'Takami M', 'Ichino M', 'Nakazawa M', 'Matsuyama T', 'Kamijo R', 'Kitagawa S', 'Ozato K', 'Tamura T']","['Department of Immunology, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111007,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-4)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-8)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/metabolism', 'Macrophages/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cells/*cytology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Neutrophils/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Transcription, Genetic']",PMC3189223,2011/10/18 06:00,2012/02/03 06:00,['2011/10/18 06:00'],"['2011/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0025812 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-09702 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(10):e25812. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0025812.

Anaplasma infection reduced the cell viability and increased the apoptosis in HL-60 cells and staurosporine or etoposide-induced apoptosis was further exacerbated with Anaplasma infection. Altogether our results suggest that A. phagocytophilum infection is proapoptotic in HL-60 cells unlike in neutrophils where it is antiapoptotic.","['Karki, Pratap', 'Ijdo, Jacob W']","['Karki P', 'Ijdo JW']","['Inflammation Program and Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa and Veterans Administration Medical Center, 2501 Crosspark Road, MTF E104, Coralville, Iowa City, IA 52241, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,World J Microbiol Biotechnol,World journal of microbiology & biotechnology,9012472,,,,PMC3190240,2011/10/18 06:00,2011/10/18 06:01,['2011/10/18 06:00'],"['2011/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/18 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11274-011-0745-z [doi]'],ppublish,World J Microbiol Biotechnol. 2011 Nov 1;27(11):2741-2746. doi: 10.1007/s11274-011-0745-z.,,,,"['R01 AI076244/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI076244-01A2/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,['NIHMS303551'],,,,,,,,,,

SAR3419 combines the strengths of a high-potency tubulin inhibitor and the exquisite B-cell selectivity of an anti-CD19 antibody. The internalization and processing of SAR3419, following its binding at the surface of CD19-positive human lymphoma cell lines and xenograft models, release active metabolites that trigger cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis, leading to cell death and tumor regression. SAR3419 has also been shown to be active in different lymphoma xenograft models, including aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, resulting in complete regressions and tumor-free survival. In these models, the activity of SAR3419 compared favorably with rituximab and lymphoma standard of care chemotherapy. Two phase I trials with 2 different schedules of SAR3419 as a single agent were conducted in refractory/relapsed B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Activity was reported in both schedules, in heavily pretreated patients of both follicular and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma subtypes, with a notable lack of significant hematological toxicity, validating SAR3419 as an effective antibody-drug conjugate and opening opportunities in the future. Numerous B-cell-specific anti-CD19 biologics are available to treat B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and early phase I results obtained with SAR3419 suggest that it is a promising candidate for further development in this disease. In addition, thanks to the broad expression of CD19, SAR3419 may provide treatment options for B-cell leukemias that are often CD20-negative.","['Blanc, Veronique', 'Bousseau, Anne', 'Caron, Anne', 'Carrez, Chantal', 'Lutz, Robert J', 'Lambert, John M']","['Blanc V', 'Bousseau A', 'Caron A', 'Carrez C', 'Lutz RJ', 'Lambert JM']","['Oncology Business Division, Sanofi, Vitry sur Seine, France.

CD33 and CD22 are specific markers of myeloid leukemias and B-cell malignancies, respectively. These endocytic receptors are ideal for an ADC strategy because they can effectively carry the cytotoxic payload into the cell. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO, Mylotarg) and inotuzumab ozogamicin consist of a derivative of calicheamicin (a potent DNA-binding cytotoxic antibiotic) linked to a humanized monoclonal IgG4 antibody directed against CD33 or CD22, respectively. Both of these ADCs have a target-mediated pharmacokinetic disposition. GO was the first drug to prove the ADC concept in the clinic, specifically in phase II studies that included substantial proportions of older patients with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia. In contrast, in phase III studies, it has thus far failed to show clinical benefit in first-line treatment in combination with standard chemotherapy. Inotuzumab ozogamicin has shown remarkable clinical activity in relapsed/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and it has started phase III evaluation. The safety profile of these ADCs includes reversible myelosuppression (especially neutropenia and thrombocytopenia), elevated hepatic transaminases, and hyperbilirubinemia. There have been postmarketing reports of hepatotoxicity, especially veno-occlusive disease, associated with GO. The incidence is ~2%, but patients who undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have an increased risk. As we steadily move toward the goal of personalized medicine, these kinds of agents will provide a unique opportunity to treat selected patient subpopulations based on the expression of their specific tumor targets.","['Ricart, Alejandro D']",['Ricart AD'],"['Biotechnology Unit and Oncology Clinical Research, Pfizer Inc., San Diego, California, USA. alejandro.d.ricart@pfizer.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Enediynes)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '0 (calicheamicin enediyne)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)', 'P93RUU11P7 (Inotuzumab Ozogamicin)']",IM,"['Aminoglycosides/adverse effects/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Enediynes/chemistry', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/*therapeutic use', 'Inotuzumab Ozogamicin', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/immunology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2011/10/18 06:00,2012/02/04 06:00,['2011/10/18 06:00'],"['2011/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['17/20/6417 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-0486 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2011 Oct 15;17(20):6417-27. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-0486.,,,,,['(c)2011 AACR.'],,,,,,,,,,,

The Fv binds to an antigen on a target cell and brings the toxin into the cell interior, where it arrests protein synthesis and initiates the apoptotic cascade. Moxetumomab pasudotox, previously called HA22 or CAT-8015, is a recombinant immunotoxin composed of the Fv fragment of an anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody fused to a 38-kDa fragment of Pseudomonas exotoxin A, called PE38. Moxetumomab pasudotox is an improved, more active form of a predecessor recombinant immunotoxin, BL22 (also called CAT-3888), which produced complete remission in relapsed/refractory hairy cell leukemia (HCL), but it had a <20% response rate in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), diseases in which the leukemic cells contain much lower numbers of CD22 target sites. Compared with BL22, moxetumomab pasudotox is up to 50-fold more active on lymphoma cell lines and leukemic cells from patients with CLL and HCL. A phase I trial was recently completed in HCL patients, who achieved response rates similar to those obtained with BL22 but without dose-limiting toxicity. In addition to further testing in HCL, moxetumomab pasudotox is being evaluated in phase I trials in patients with CLL, B-cell lymphomas, and childhood ALL. Moreover, protein engineering is being used to increase its activity, decrease nonspecific side effects, and remove B-cell epitopes.","['Kreitman, Robert J', 'Pastan, Ira']","['Kreitman RJ', 'Pastan I']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland, USA. kreitmar@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', '2NDX4B6N8F (immunotoxin HA22)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Toxins/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Exotoxins/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Lysosomes/enzymology', 'Peptide Hydrolases/pharmacology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/*administration & dosage']",PMC3201735,2011/10/18 06:00,2012/02/04 06:00,['2011/10/18 06:00'],"['2011/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['17/20/6398 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-0487 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2011 Oct 15;17(20):6398-405. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-0487.,,,,"['Z01 BC010301-10/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 BC010301-11/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z99 CA999999/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA BC010301-12/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",['(c)2011 AACR.'],['NIHMS316767'],,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies showed that the PML tumour suppressor promotes senescence, although the precise mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Combining gene expression profiling with chromatin-binding analyses and promoter reporter studies, we identify TBX2, a T-box transcription factor frequently overexpressed in cancer, as a novel and direct PML-repressible E2F-target gene in senescence but not quiescence. Recruitment of PML to the TBX2 promoter is dependent on a functional p130/E2F4 repressor complex ultimately implementing a transcriptionally inactive chromatin environment at the TBX2 promoter. TBX2 repression actively contributes to senescence induction as cells depleted for TBX2 trigger PML pro-senescence function(s) and enter senescence. Reciprocally, elevated TBX2 levels antagonize PML pro-senescence function through direct protein-protein interaction. Collectively, our findings indicate that PML and TBX2 act in an autoregulatory loop to control the effective execution of the senescence program.","['Martin, Nadine', 'Benhamed, Moussa', 'Nacerddine, Karim', 'Demarque, Maud D', 'van Lohuizen, Maarten', 'Dejean, Anne', 'Bischof, Oliver']","['Martin N', 'Benhamed M', 'Nacerddine K', 'Demarque MD', 'van Lohuizen M', 'Dejean A', 'Bischof O']","['Department of Cell Biology and Infection, Nuclear Organisation and Oncogenesis Laboratory, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111014,England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (T-Box Domain Protein 2)', '0 (T-Box Domain Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cellular Senescence', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'T-Box Domain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3252579,2011/10/18 06:00,2012/04/28 06:00,['2011/10/18 06:00'],"['2011/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/28 06:00 [medline]']","['emboj2011370 [pii]', '10.1038/emboj.2011.370 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2012 Jan 4;31(1):95-109. doi: 10.1038/emboj.2011.370.

The aim of this study was to assess the potential association between residence near hazardous waste sites containing benzene and hospitalization discharge rates for persons having hematologic cancers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We determined the number of hospital discharges of people with hematologic cancers in New York State except for New York City for the years 1993 to 2008.Descriptive statistics and negative binomial regression models were used to compare the rates of hospitalization of residents in zip codes containing hazardous waste sites containing benzene to the rates of discharges from residents in zip codes without waste sites. RESULTS: When adjusting for potential confounders we found a 15% increase in the rate of hospitalization for chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL) [rate ratio (RR): 1.15; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00-1.33], a 22% increase in the rate of discharges for total leukemia (RR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.04-1.43) and a 17% increase in the rate of discharges for total lymphoma (RR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.02-1.35) in the benzene exposed sites. We found greater effects of exposure in African Americans compared to Caucasians, females compared to males and people with higher socioeconomic status (SES) compared to those with lower SES for several of the diseases studied. CONCLUSIONS: After controlling for major confounders we found statistically significant increases in discharge rates for several hematologic cancers in persons residing in zip codes containing benzene waste sites. These results provide additional support for a relationship between environmental exposure to benzene and risk of hematologic cancers.","['Boberg, Erik', 'Lessner, Lawrence', 'Carpenter, David O']","['Boberg E', 'Lessner L', 'Carpenter DO']","['Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111014,Poland,Int J Occup Med Environ Health,International journal of occupational medicine and environmental health,9437093,"['0 (Hazardous Waste)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'African Americans', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Benzene/*adverse effects/*isolation & purification', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects', 'Female', '*Hazardous Waste', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Statistical', 'New York/epidemiology', 'Patient Discharge/trends', 'Population Surveillance/methods', 'Whites', 'Young Adult']",,2011/10/18 06:00,2012/03/27 06:00,['2011/10/18 06:00'],"['2010/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2478/s13382-011-0037-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Occup Med Environ Health. 2011 Dec;24(4):327-38. doi: 10.2478/s13382-011-0037-8.

This paper illustrates that melatonin induces phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 inhibiting cell proliferation and preventing DNA damage accumulation of both normal and transformed cells. This activity requires p53 and promyelocytic leukemia (PML) expression and efficient phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 residue. Melatonin-induced p53 phosphorylation at Ser-15 residue does not require ataxia telangiectasia-mutated activity, whereas it is severely impaired upon chemical inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activity. By and large, these findings imply that the activation of the p53 tumor-suppressor pathway is a critical mediator of melatonin and its anticancer effects. Therefore, it provides molecular insights into increasing observational evidence for the role that melatonin has in cancer prevention.","['Santoro, R', 'Marani, M', 'Blandino, G', 'Muti, P', 'Strano, S']","['Santoro R', 'Marani M', 'Blandino G', 'Muti P', 'Strano S']","['Molecular Chemoprevention Group, Molecular Medicine Department, Italian National Cancer Institute Regina Elena, Rome, Italy. strano@ifo.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111017,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Atm protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'JL5DK93RCL (Melatonin)', 'PVX798P8GI (4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)imidazole)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Melatonin/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Serine/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",,2011/10/18 06:00,2012/08/30 06:00,['2011/10/18 06:00'],"['2011/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/30 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2011469 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2011.469 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2012 Jun 14;31(24):2931-42. doi: 10.1038/onc.2011.469.

However, its role in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) remains unclear. We treated both wild-type and imatinib-resistant K562 cells with imatinib or nilotinib and bortezomib, respectively. The siRNAs of Cdh1 and Skp2 were designed and transiently transfected with HiPerFect transfection reagent into CML cells. Expression of Cdh1-Skp2-p27 pathway proteins were detected by Western blotting. Cell cycle, cell apoptosis and cellular morphology were detected by flow cytometry and Wright staining. Our study revealed that Cdh1 was expressed at lower levels in imatinib-resistant CML blast crisis (BC) patients than imatinib-sensitive ones. Moreover, imatinib and bortezomib induced cell cycle quiescence or arrest, upregulation and nuclear relocation of Cdh1 in CML cells. Furthermore, nilotinib and bortezomib resulted in upregulation of Cdh1 in imatinib-resistant CML cells. Conversely, Cdh1 silencing resulted in stabilization of Skp2 and Cdc20, subsequently promoting G1-S transition and formation of multinucleated cells. Our study shows that TKIs and bortezomib can regulate the cell cycle and cell apoptosis via regulation of the expression and redistribution of Cdh1 in CML-BC, which sheds light on the orchestration of crosstalk between TKIs and bortezomib in imatinib-resistant CML-BC. Additionally, Cdh1 tends to play an important role in maintenance of genomic stability, the detailed mechanisms deserve further study.","['Wang, Qiang', 'Zhou, Hong Sheng', 'Huang, Kai Kai', 'Jiang, Xue Jie', 'Wu, Fu Qun', 'Cao, Rui', 'Yin, Chang Xin', 'Liao, Li Bin', 'Zheng, Zhong Xin', 'He, Han', 'Lin, Rong', 'Yi, Zheng Shan', 'Xu, Dan', 'Yang, Mo', 'Meng, Fan Yi']","['Wang Q', 'Zhou HS', 'Huang KK', 'Jiang XJ', 'Wu FQ', 'Cao R', 'Yin CX', 'Liao LB', 'Zheng ZX', 'He H', 'Lin R', 'Yi ZS', 'Xu D', 'Yang M', 'Meng FY']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111013,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (CDH1 protein, human)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', '*Blast Crisis', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cadherins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'RNA Interference', 'S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",,2011/10/18 06:00,2012/04/07 06:00,['2011/10/18 06:00'],"['2011/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2011.1233 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2012 Feb;40(2):418-26. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2011.1233.

We investigated a possible correlation between these two markers. ZAP70 expression using real-time RT-PCR was examined in 20 B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with del13q14, 13 patients with del11q22, 15 patients with trisomy 12, and 16 patients with no detected chromosomal abnormalities. Molecular analysis revealed that ZAP70 expression in the del13q subgroup was the same as in the control group, while it increased 2.78-fold in the del11q subgroup and 2.95-fold in the trisomy 12 subgroup, compared to the 15 cases in the control group. Comparison of the mean and standard deviation of the ZAP70 expression profile within the subgroups showed it to be highly variable among the individuals of the del11q and trisomy 12 subgroups, versus tight clustering for the del13q subgroup. Therefore, there is a correlation between del13q aberration, which has good prognosis with normal levels of ZAP70 expression. Due to a high degree of variation, no conformity is seen for del11q and trisomy 12 subgroups, making this grouping poor for prognostic discrimination. As a result, neither of these markers can serve as sole discriminators to determine the course of the disease; the use of both markers improves prognostic assessment.","['Teimori, H', 'Akbari, M T', 'Hamid, M', 'Forouzandeh, M', 'Bibordi, E']","['Teimori H', 'Akbari MT', 'Hamid M', 'Forouzandeh M', 'Bibordi E']","['Cellular and Molecular Research Center, School of Medicine, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20111007,Brazil,Genet Mol Res,Genetics and molecular research : GMR,101169387,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Iran', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Trisomy', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*biosynthesis/genetics']",,2011/10/18 06:00,2012/02/03 06:00,['2011/10/18 06:00'],"['2011/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/03 06:00 [medline]']","['gmr1135 [pii]', '10.4238/2011.October.7.3 [doi]']",epublish,Genet Mol Res. 2011 Oct 7;10(4):2415-23. doi: 10.4238/2011.October.7.3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although many studies have demonstrated that ABT-737 acts synergistically with chemotherapeutic drugs, the possibility of a combined treatment with ionizing radiation (IR) and ABT-737 has not yet been thoroughly investigated. Similarly, the relationship between p53 function and the pro-apoptotic effects of ABT-737 are still obscure. Here, we demonstrate that IR and ABT-737 synergistically induce apoptosis in glioblastoma cells. The sensitivity to ABT-737-mediated cell death is significantly increased by the IR-dependent accumulation of cells in the G2/M cell cycle phase. Wild type p53 function inhibits the efficacy of a combined IR and ABT-737 treatment via a p21-dependent G1 cell cycle arrest. Moreover, mutant as well as wild type p53 counteract the pro-apoptotic activity of ABT-737 by maintaining the expression levels of the Mcl-1 protein. Thus, p53 regulates the sensitivity to ABT-737 of glioblastoma cells. Our results warrant a further evaluation of a novel combination therapy using IR and ABT-737. The efficacy of such a therapy could be substantially enhanced by Mcl-1-lowering strategies.","['Tagscherer, Katrin E', 'Fassl, Anne', 'Sinkovic, Tabea', 'Combs, Stephanie E', 'Roth, Wilfried']","['Tagscherer KE', 'Fassl A', 'Sinkovic T', 'Combs SE', 'Roth W']","['Molecular Tumor Pathology, German Cancer Research Center, Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics/*radiation effects', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Glioblastoma/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nitrophenols/*administration & dosage', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Sulfonamides/*administration & dosage', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']",,2011/10/18 06:00,2012/08/02 06:00,['2011/10/18 06:00'],"['2011/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-011-0664-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2012 Feb;17(2):187-99. doi: 10.1007/s10495-011-0664-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To bypass transport-related drug resistance, lipophilic derivatives elacytarabine (CP-4055), ara-C-5'elaidic-acid-ester, and CP-4126, (CO 1.01) gemcitabine-5'elaidic-acid-ester, were investigated for the entry into the cell, distribution, metabolism and retention. The leukemic CEM-cell-line and its deoxycytidine-kinase deficient variant (CEM/dCK-) were exposed for 30 and 60 min to the radiolabeled drugs; followed by culture in drug-free medium in order to determine drug retention in the cell. The cellular fractions were analyzed with thin-layer-chromatography and HPLC. Elacytarabine and CP-4126 were converted to the parent compounds both inside and outside the cell (35-45%). The ENT-inhibitor dipyridamole did not affect their uptake or retention. Inside the cell Elacytarabine and CP-4126 predominantly localized in the membrane and cytosolic fraction, leading to a long retention after removal of the medium. In contrast, in cells exposed to the parent drugs ara-C and dFdC, intracellular drug concentration increased during exposure but decreased to undetectable levels after drug removal. In the dCK- cell line, no metabolism was observed. The concentrations of ara-CTP and dFdCTP reached a peak at the end of the incubation with the drugs, and decreased after drug removal; peak levels of dFdCTP were 35 times higher than ara-CTP and was retained better. In contrast, after exposure to elacytarabine or CP-4126, ara-CTP and dFdCTP levels continued to increase not only during exposure but also during 120 min after removal of the elacytarabine and CP-4126. Levels of ara-CTP and dFdCTP were higher than after exposure to the parent drugs. In conclusion, the lipophilic derivatives elacytarabine and CP-4126 showed a nucleoside-transporter independent uptake, with long retention of the active nucleotides. These lipophilic nucleoside analogues are new chemical entities suitable for novel clinical applications.","['Adema, Auke D', 'Smid, Kees', 'Losekoot, Nienke', 'Honeywell, Richard J', 'Verheul, Henk M', 'Myhren, Finn', 'Sandvold, Marit L', 'Peters, Godefridus J']","['Adema AD', 'Smid K', 'Losekoot N', 'Honeywell RJ', 'Verheul HM', 'Myhren F', 'Sandvold ML', 'Peters GJ']","['Department of Medical Oncology, VU University Medical Center, PO Box 7057, 1007 MB, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111015,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CP 4126)', '0 (Nucleoside Transport Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', ""101235-34-1 (5'-oleoyl cytarabine)"", '64ALC7F90C (Dipyridamole)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'EC 3.1.3.- (Nucleotidases)', 'EC 3.1.3.- (deoxynucleotidase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cytarabine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/metabolism', 'Dipyridamole/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Nucleoside Transport Proteins/metabolism', 'Nucleotidases/*metabolism']",PMC3432794,2011/10/18 06:00,2013/04/04 06:00,['2011/10/18 06:00'],"['2011/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-011-9756-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2012 Oct;30(5):1908-16. doi: 10.1007/s10637-011-9756-8.

This review focuses upon the relationship between fluoroquinolone use and the rising prevalence in neutropenic cancer patients of multidrug resistant pathogens including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci, Clostridium difficile, and aerobic Gram-negative bacilli. RECENT FINDINGS: Fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin are efficacious for the prevention and treatment of neutropenic fever syndromes, including infections due to aerobic Gram-negative bacilli. Recent clinical practice guidelines recommend their prophylactic use in acute leukaemia patients receiving intensive remission-induction, postremission consolidation, or salvage induction therapy, and haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients during pre-engraftment when the duration of profound neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <0.1 x 10(9)/l) is at least 7 days. These same agents combined with amoxicillin/clavulanate are recommended for oral outpatient empirical antibacterial treatment of febrile neutropenic patients at low risk for medical complications. Fluoroquinolone-resistant Enterobacteriaceae is linked to community fluoroquinolone consumption. Prophylaxis efficacy is reduced when the prevalence of fluoroquinolone Gram-negative bacillary resistance exceeds 20%. Widespread use encourages the transmissibility of multiclass antimicrobial resistance genes among Gram-negative bacilli. Fluoroquinolone-driven colonization with MRSA enhances the risk of subsequent infection, the use of vancomycin, and risk of colonization by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. The relative roles of widespread fluoroquinolone use and ineffective infection prevention and control practices in encouraging the spread of virulent C. difficile-associated diarrhoea in healthcare facilities remain controversial. SUMMARY: Widespread use of antibacterial agents of one class can encourage multiclass drug resistance, which reduces prophylaxis and treatment efficacy in neutropenic cancer patients.","['Bow, Eric James']",['Bow EJ'],"['Section of Haematology/Oncology, Department of Medical Microbiology, The University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. ejbow@CancerCare.mb.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Infect Dis,Current opinion in infectious diseases,8809878,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Fluoroquinolones)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial/drug effects', 'Fluoroquinolones/*therapeutic use', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Neutropenia/complications/*drug therapy', 'Prevalence']",,2011/10/18 06:00,2012/01/06 06:00,['2011/10/18 06:00'],"['2011/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/QCO.0b013e32834cf054 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Infect Dis. 2011 Dec;24(6):545-53. doi: 10.1097/QCO.0b013e32834cf054.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phyto-chemical evaluation confirmed the presence of 26.7% of 2-->1 linked fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS). They have a degree of polymerization (DP) of nearly 7-8.

Here, we show that PTPROt expression is significantly reduced in CD19(+) spleen B cells from Emu-T cell leukemia 1 (TCL1) transgenic mice relative to the wild-type mice. Strikingly, as much as a 60% decrease in PTPROt expression occurs at 7 weeks independently of promoter methylation. To elucidate the potential mechanism for this early suppression of PTPROt in these mice, we explored the role of activating protein-1 (AP-1) in its expression. We first demonstrate that AP-1 activation by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate induces PTPROt expression with concurrent recruitment of c-fos and c-jun to its promoter. The PTPROt promoter is also responsive to over- and underexpression of AP-1, confirming the role of AP-1 in PTPROt expression. Next, we demonstrate that TCL1 can repress the PTPROt promoter by altering c-fos expression and c-jun activation state. Finally, using primary CLL cells we have shown an inverse relationship between TCL1 and PTPROt expression. These findings further substantiate the role of TCL1 in PTPROt suppression and its importance in the pathogenesis of CLL.","['Motiwala, Tasneem', 'Zanesi, Nicola', 'Datta, Jharna', 'Roy, Satavisha', 'Kutay, Huban', 'Checovich, Allyn M', 'Kaou, Mohamed', 'Zhong, Yiming', 'Johnson, Amy J', 'Lucas, David M', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Hagan, John', 'Mo, Xiaokui', 'Jarjoura, David', 'Byrd, John C', 'Croce, Carlo M', 'Jacob, Samson T']","['Motiwala T', 'Zanesi N', 'Datta J', 'Roy S', 'Kutay H', 'Checovich AM', 'Kaou M', 'Zhong Y', 'Johnson AJ', 'Lucas DM', 'Heerema NA', 'Hagan J', 'Mo X', 'Jarjoura D', 'Byrd JC', 'Croce CM', 'Jacob ST']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA. tasneem.motiwala@osumc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20111014,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', '0 (Tcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPRO protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpro protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*physiology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Phosphorylation/physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/metabolism', 'Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 3/*genetics', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",PMC3234669,2011/10/18 06:00,2012/01/25 06:00,['2011/10/18 06:00'],"['2011/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40545-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-01-323147 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Dec 1;118(23):6132-40. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-01-323147.

After the discovery of As(2)O(3) as a promising treatment for APL, several studies investigated the use of As(2)O(3) as a single agent in the treatment of solid tumors; however, its therapeutic efficacy is limited. Thus, the systematic study of the combination of As(2)O(3) with other clinically used chemotherapeutic drugs to improve its therapeutic efficacy in treating human solid tumors is merited. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time, using isobologram analysis, that As(2)O(3) exhibits a synergistic interaction with N,N'-bis(2-chloroethyl)-N-nitrosourea (BCNU). The synergistic augmentation of the cytotoxicity of As(2)O(3) with BCNU is in part through the autophagic cell death machinery in human solid tumor cells. As(2)O(3) and BCNU in combination produce enhanced cytotoxicity via the depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH) and augmentation of reaction oxygen species (ROS) production. Further analysis indicated that the extension of GSH depletion by this combined regimen occurs through the inhibition of the catalytic activity of glutathione reductase. Blocking ROS production with antioxidants or ROS scavengers effectively inhibits cell death and autophagy formation, indicating that redox-mediated autophagic cell death involves the synergism of As(2)O(3) with BCNU. Taken together, this is the first evidence that BCNU could help to extend the therapeutic spectrum of As(2)O(3). These findings will be useful in designing future clinical trials of combination chemotherapy with As(2)O(3) and BCNU, with the potential for broad use against a variety of solid tumors.","['Kuo, Ching-Chuan', 'Liu, Tsang-Wu', 'Chen, Li-Tzong', 'Shiah, Her-Shyong', 'Wu, Ching-Ming', 'Cheng, Yen-Ting', 'Pan, Wen-Yu', 'Liu, Jin-Fen', 'Chen, Kuo-Li', 'Yang, Yun-Ning', 'Chen, Shan-Na', 'Chang, Jang-Yang']","['Kuo CC', 'Liu TW', 'Chen LT', 'Shiah HS', 'Wu CM', 'Cheng YT', 'Pan WY', 'Liu JF', 'Chen KL', 'Yang YN', 'Chen SN', 'Chang JY']","['National Institute of Cancer Research, National Health Research Institutes, Tainan 704, Taiwan. cckuo@nhri.org.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110929,United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 1.8.1.7 (Glutathione Reductase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Carmustine/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Glutathione Reductase/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2011/10/18 06:00,2012/05/19 06:00,['2011/10/18 06:00'],"['2010/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/20 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0891-5849(11)00598-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2011.09.023 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 2011 Dec 15;51(12):2195-209. doi: 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2011.09.023.

Separation was successfully achieved using an Agilent((R)) ZORBAX Eclipse plus C(18) reversed phase column (50 mm x 2.1 mm, i.d.; 1.8 mum) under isocratic mobile phase conditions consisting of acetonitrile: 0.02 M potassium dihydrogen phosphate with 0.2% triethylamine at pH 3 (25:75, v/v) and ultra-violet detection was achieved at 235 nm. Extraction of the target compounds was completed using 100% cold acetonitrile. Good linearities (r(2)>0.99) for both IM and M1 were achieved for the concentration ranges of 50-1800 ng/mL and 50-360 ng/mL, respectively. The detection limits were 20 ng/mL and 10 ng/mL for M1 and IM, respectively. The intra- and inter-day precisions were less than 1% with percent recoveries of more than 90%. The method was successfully applied to calculate the pharmacokinetic parameters of chronic myeloid leukemia patients receiving imatinib.

The CD loop-D helix region of CNTF has been suggested to be important for the cytokine interaction with LIFR. We designed a peptide, termed cintrofin, that encompasses this region. Surface plasmon resonance analysis demonstrated that cintrofin bound to LIFR and gp130, but not to CNTFRalpha, with apparent KD values of 35 nM and 1.1 nM, respectively. Cintrofin promoted the survival of cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs), in which cell death was induced either by potassium withdrawal or H2O2 treatment. Cintrofin induced neurite outgrowth from CGNs, and this effect was inhibited by specific antibodies against both gp130 and LIFR, indicating that these receptors are involved in the effects of cintrofin. The C-terminal part of the peptide, corresponding to the D helix region of CNTF, was shown to be essential for the neuritogenic action of the peptide. CNTF and LIF induced neurite outgrowth in CGNs plated on laminin-coated slides. On uncoated slides, CNTF and LIF had no neuritogenic effect but were able to inhibit cintrofin-induced neuronal differentiation, indicating that cintrofin and cytokines compete for the same receptors. In addition, cintrofin induced the phosphorylation of STAT3, Akt, and ERK, indicating that it exerts cell signaling properties similar to those induced by CNTF and may be a valuable survival agent with possible therapeutic potential.","['Rathje, Mette', 'Pankratova, Stanislava', 'Nielsen, Janne', 'Gotfryd, Kamil', 'Bock, Elisabeth', 'Berezin, Vladimir']","['Rathje M', 'Pankratova S', 'Nielsen J', 'Gotfryd K', 'Bock E', 'Berezin V']","['Protein Laboratory, Department of Neuroscience and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111014,Germany,Eur J Cell Biol,European journal of cell biology,7906240,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neurons/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,2011/10/18 06:00,2012/03/08 06:00,['2011/10/18 06:00'],"['2010/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/10 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0171-9335(11)00166-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejcb.2011.08.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cell Biol. 2011 Dec;90(12):990-9. doi: 10.1016/j.ejcb.2011.08.001.

Our objective was to identify risk factors for PCP among patients with HM to help recognize patients who would benefit from primary PCP prophylaxis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a case-control study of adult patients with HM and negative for human immunodeficiency virus and with confirmed PCP by using cytology or histopathology from 2 medical centers over an 11-year period. Each case was matched with 4 patients without PCP by type of HM and year of treatment. We compared demographic, clinical, and laboratory data among cases and controls. Data were analyzed by using SPSS version 18.0. RESULTS: Fourteen cases and 56 controls were included in the study period. No significant differences were seen in demographics between both groups. All identified patients had lymphoproliferative HM, the majority of patients (93%) had either non-Hodgkin lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Autoimmune diseases were more frequent in cases vs. controls (28.6% vs. 5.4% P = .01). The receipt and duration of chemotherapy were similar in both groups. Among chemotherapeutic agents, including steroids, only fludarabine was associated with increased risk for PCP (50% vs. 17.9%; P = .02). No difference was found in total or lymphocyte percentage in cases at the time of PCP diagnosis vs. nadir values in controls. CONCLUSION: Patients with lymphoproliferative HM, specifically chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, who are receiving fludarabine and with autoimmune disorders are at increased risk for PCP and should be considered for PCP primary prophylaxis.","['Obeid, Karam M', 'Aguilar, Javier', 'Szpunar, Susan', 'Sharma, Mamta', 'del Busto, Ramon', 'Al-Katib, Ayad', 'Johnson, Leonard B']","['Obeid KM', 'Aguilar J', 'Szpunar S', 'Sharma M', 'del Busto R', 'Al-Katib A', 'Johnson LB']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, St. John Hospital and Medical Center, Detroit, MI, USA. karam.obeid@stjohn.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20111014,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '8064-90-2 (Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cladribine/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications/drug therapy', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pneumocystis carinii/*drug effects', 'Pneumonia, Pneumocystis/complications/diagnosis/*prevention & control', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination/*therapeutic use', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",,2011/10/18 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2011/10/18 06:00'],"['2011/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/19 00:00 [revised]', '2011/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(11)00269-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2011.07.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2012 Feb;12(1):66-9. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2011.07.006.

However, emerging TKI resistance prevents complete cure. Therefore, alternative strategies targeting regulatory modules of Bcr-Abl in addition to the kinase active site are strongly desirable. Here, we show that an intramolecular interaction between the SH2 and kinase domains in Bcr-Abl is both necessary and sufficient for high catalytic activity of the enzyme. Disruption of this interface led to inhibition of downstream events critical for CML signaling and, importantly, completely abolished leukemia formation in mice. Furthermore, disruption of the SH2-kinase interface increased sensitivity of imatinib-resistant Bcr-Abl mutants to TKI inhibition. An engineered Abl SH2-binding fibronectin type III monobody inhibited Bcr-Abl kinase activity both in vitro and in primary CML cells, where it induced apoptosis. This work validates the SH2-kinase interface as an allosteric target for therapeutic intervention.","['Grebien, Florian', 'Hantschel, Oliver', 'Wojcik, John', 'Kaupe, Ines', 'Kovacic, Boris', 'Wyrzucki, Arkadiusz M', 'Gish, Gerald D', 'Cerny-Reiterer, Sabine', 'Koide, Akiko', 'Beug, Hartmut', 'Pawson, Tony', 'Valent, Peter', 'Koide, Shohei', 'Superti-Furga, Giulio']","['Grebien F', 'Hantschel O', 'Wojcik J', 'Kaupe I', 'Kovacic B', 'Wyrzucki AM', 'Gish GD', 'Cerny-Reiterer S', 'Koide A', 'Beug H', 'Pawson T', 'Valent P', 'Koide S', 'Superti-Furga G']","['Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '04Y7590D77 (Isoleucine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Benzamides', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Isoleucine/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'src Homology Domains']",PMC3202669,2011/10/18 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/10/18 06:00'],"['2010/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/07 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S0092-8674(11)01067-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cell.2011.08.046 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 2011 Oct 14;147(2):306-19. doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2011.08.046.,,,,"['P 22282/FWF_/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria', 'P41 RR015301/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P 18737/FWF_/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria', 'R21-CA132700/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM072688/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'MOP-6849/CAPMC/ CIHR/Canada', 'T32GM07281/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-15301/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007281/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA132700/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-GM72688/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Bone marrow neoangiogenesis is mediated by several growth factors, such as VEGF-A, VEGF-C, angiopoietin-1 and -2, FGF, HGF, TGF-beta and others secreted by leukemic cells. The prognostic relevance of microvessel density, and expression of VEGF-A and -C has been demonstrated especially in acute myeloid leukemia. In the last years, several classes of angiogenesis inhibitors have been developed blocking several angiogenic pathways. These include drugs that inhibit the VEGF (with or without blockade of FLT3) and the mTor signalling cascade. Besides, thalidomide and lenalidomide although possessing a pleiotrophic mode of action including antiangiogenic properities have been evaluated in the treatment of human leukemias. In the current review we analyze the results of clinical trials employing these antiangiogenic drugs. Since the clinical efficacy of these compounds used as monotherapy is often limited, confined to certain subgroups of patients and frequently short lived, several trials combining standard chemotherapy with these agents have been initiated in order to demonstrate an additional benefit to standard therapy. Furthermore the introduction of new antiangiogenic drugs such as inhibitors of the angiopoietin and HGF/cMET pathway is on the horizon. Utilizing cocktails of inhibitors of several angiogenic pathways may represent a new possibility to augment the efficacy of antiangiogenic therapy in the future.","['Wellbrock, J', 'Fiedler, W']","['Wellbrock J', 'Fiedler W']","['Department of Oncology and Hematology with sections Pneumonology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hubertus, Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '2S9ZZM9Q9V (Bevacizumab)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', '71IA9S35AJ (Semaxinib)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)', 'NQU9IPY4K9 (cediranib)', 'V99T50803M (Sunitinib)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzenesulfonates/therapeutic use', 'Bevacizumab', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Indoles/therapeutic use', 'Lenalidomide', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Pyridines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrroles/therapeutic use', 'Quinazolines/therapeutic use', 'Sorafenib', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Sunitinib', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Thalidomide/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",,2011/10/18 06:00,2012/08/17 06:00,['2011/10/18 06:00'],"['2010/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/13 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/17 06:00 [medline]']","['BSP/CCDT/E-Pub/00170 [pii]', '10.2174/156800911798073078 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2011 Nov;11(9):1053-68. doi: 10.2174/156800911798073078.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The design consists of nanogrids of DNP termini inlaid in alkanethiol self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). Using scanning probe-based nanografting, nanometer precision was attained for designed geometry, size, and periodicity. Rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells exhibited high sensitivity to the geometry and local environment of DNP presented on these nanostructures. The impact included cellular adherence, spreading, membrane morphology, cytoskeleton structure, and activation. The highest level of spreading and activation was induced by nanogrids of 17 nm line width and 40 nm periodicity, with DNP haptens 1.4 nm above the surroundings. The high efficacy is attributed to two main factors. First, DNP sites in the nanostructure are highly accessible by anti-DNP IgE during recognition. Second, the arrangement or geometry of DNP termini in nanostructures promotes clustering of FcepsilonRI receptors that are prelinked to IgE.

Overall, 109 consecutive episodes of proven/probable IPA in 56 AML, 31 LD and 22 allo-SCT patients diagnosed from February 2006 through to January 2011 were considered. IPA was diagnosed with EORTC-MSG criteria (control group, 76 patients) or without prespecified radiological criteria (study group, 33 patients). The latter differed from the former by the inclusion of patients with pulmonary infiltrates not fulfilling the three EORTC-MSG IPA specific findings of dense, well-circumscribed lesions with or without halo sign, air crescent sign or cavity. All the analysed clinical and mycological characteristics, 3-month response to antifungal therapy and 1- and 3-month cumulative survival were comparable in the control and study groups in AML, LD and allo-SCT patients. Seventeen of 33 (51.5%) patients of the study group fulfilled EORTC-MSG radiological criteria at subsequent imaging performed a median of 15 days (range, 6-40 days) after documentation of the pulmonary infection.

PGD2 can be converted into active metabolites and is known to activate two distinct receptors, DP (PGD2 receptor) and CRTH2/DP2 (chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th2 cells). In the past, PGD2 was thought to be involved principally in the process of inflammation. However, in recent years, several studies have shown that PGD2 has anti-proliferative ability against tumorigenesis and can induce cellular apoptosis via activation of the caspase-dependent pathway in human colorectal cancer cells, leukaemia cells and eosinophils. In the lung, where PGD2 is highly released when sensitized mast cells are challenged with allergen, the mechanism of PGD2-induced apoptosis is unclear. In the present study, A549 cells, a type of NSCLC (non-small cell lung carcinoma), were treated with PGD2 under various conditions, including while blocking DP and CRTH2/DP2 with the selective antagonists BWA868C and ramatroban respectively. We report here that PGD2 induces A549 cell death through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, although the process does not appear to involve either DP or CRTH2/DP2. Similar results were also found with H2199 cells, another type of NSCLC. We found that PGD2 metabolites induce apoptosis effectively and that 15d-PGJ2 (15-deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J2) is a likely candidate for the principal apoptotic inducer in PGD2-induced apoptosis in NSCLC A549 cells.","['Wang, Jun-Jie', 'Mak, Oi-Tong']","['Wang JJ', 'Mak OT']","['Department of Life Sciences, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 701, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cell Biol Int,Cell biology international,9307129,"['0 (15-deoxyprostaglandin J2)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Hydantoins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Prostaglandin)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '118675-50-6 (BW A868C)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'P1ALI72U6C (ramatroban)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)', 'XZF106QU24 (prostaglandin D2 receptor)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Carbazoles/pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Humans', 'Hydantoins/pharmacology', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Prostaglandin D2/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Receptors, Prostaglandin/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology']",,2011/10/18 06:00,2012/02/04 06:00,['2011/10/18 06:00'],"['2011/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['CBI20110707 [pii]', '10.1042/CBI20110707 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Biol Int. 2011 Nov;35(11):1089-96. doi: 10.1042/CBI20110707.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells aberrantly express LEF-1 and its expression is required for cellular survival. We hypothesized that modification of the differentiation status of CLL cells would result in loss of LEF-1 expression and eliminate the survival advantage provided by its aberrant expression. In this study, we first established a methodology that induces CLL cells to differentiate into immunoglobulin (Ig) secreting cells (ISC) using the TLR9 agonist, CpG, together with cytokines (CpG/c). CpG/c stimulation resulted in dramatic CLL cell phenotypic and morphologic changes, expression of cytoplasmic Ig, and secretion of light chain restricted Ig. CpG/c stimulation also resulted in decreased CLL cell LEF-1 expression and increased Blimp-1 expression, which is crucial for plasma cell differentiation. Further, Wnt pathway activation and cellular survival were impaired in differentiated CLL cells compared to undifferentiated CLL cells. These data support the notion that CLL can differentiate into ISC and that this triggers decreased leukemic cell survival secondary to the down regulation of LEF-1 and decreased Wnt pathway activation.","['Gutierrez, Albert Jr', 'Arendt, Bonnie K', 'Tschumper, Renee C', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Zent, Clive S', 'Jelinek, Diane F']","['Gutierrez A Jr', 'Arendt BK', 'Tschumper RC', 'Kay NE', 'Zent CS', 'Jelinek DF']","['Department of Immunology, Mayo Graduate School, College of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20111006,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (CpG ODN 2006)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '138415-26-6 (PRDM1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/immunology', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/pharmacology', 'Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/immunology', 'Wnt Proteins/metabolism']",PMC3188588,2011/10/15 06:00,2012/02/14 06:00,['2011/10/15 06:00'],"['2011/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0026056 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-15844 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(10):e26056. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0026056.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells abnormally proliferate and escape apoptosis. Herein, the effects and mechanisms of purified HF on AML cell dysfunction were investigated in AML cell lines defining distinct AML subfamilies and primary AML cells cultured ex vivo. METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS: HF inhibited in a time- and concentration-dependent manner the growth of AML cell lines (U937, OCI-AML3, NB4, HL-60) by inducing apoptosis as evidenced by accumulation of sub-G1 population, phosphatidylserine externalization and DNA fragmentation. HF also induced apoptosis in primary AML blasts, whereas normal blood cells were not affected. The apoptotic process in U937 cells was accompanied by downregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, upregulation of pro-apoptotic Noxa, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, activation of procaspases and cleavage of the caspase substrate PARP-1. The general caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk and the caspase-9- and -3-specific inhibitors, but not caspase-8 inhibitor, significantly attenuated apoptosis. HF-mediated apoptosis was associated with dephosphorylation of active Akt1 (at Ser(473)) and Akt1 substrate Bad (at Ser(136)) which activates Bad pro-apoptotic function. HF supppressed the kinase activity of Akt1, and combined treatment with the allosteric Akt1 inhibitor Akt-I-VIII significantly enhanced apoptosis of U937 cells. SIGNIFICANCE: Our data provide new evidence that HF's pro-apoptotic effect in AML cells involved inhibition of Akt1 signaling, mitochondria and Bcl-2 members dysfunctions, and activation of procaspases -9/-3. Combined interruption of mitochondrial and Akt1 pathways by HF may have implications for AML treatment.","['Merhi, Faten', 'Tang, Ruoping', 'Piedfer, Marion', 'Mathieu, Julie', 'Bombarda, Isabelle', 'Zaher, Murhaf', 'Kolb, Jean-Pierre', 'Billard, Christian', 'Bauvois, Brigitte']","['Merhi F', 'Tang R', 'Piedfer M', 'Mathieu J', 'Bombarda I', 'Zaher M', 'Kolb JP', 'Billard C', 'Bauvois B']","['INSERM U872, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Universite Paris Descartes, Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111006,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Terpenes)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', 'DHD7FFG6YS (Phloroglucinol)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'RM741E34FP (hyperforin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Space/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/drug effects/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Phloroglucinol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Terpenes/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/*metabolism']",PMC3188562,2011/10/15 06:00,2012/02/14 06:00,['2011/10/15 06:00'],"['2011/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0025963 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-12444 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(10):e25963. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0025963.

Earlier studies demonstrated that simian virus 40 (SV40) initiates replication near PML NBs. Here we show that PML knockdown inhibits viral replication in vivo, thus indicating a positive role of PML early in infection. SV40 large T antigen (LT) induces DNA damage and, consequently, nuclear foci of the key homologous recombination repair protein Rad51 that colocalize with PML. PML depletion abrogates LT-induced Rad51 foci. LT may target PML NBs to gain access to DNA repair factors like Rad51 that are required for viral replication. We have used the SV40 model to gain insight to DNA repair events involving PML. Strikingly, even in normal cells devoid of viral oncoproteins, PML is found to be instrumental for foci of Rad51, Mre11 and BRCA1, as well as homology-directed repair after double-strand break (DSB) induction. Following LT expression or external DNA damage, PML associates with Rad51. PML depletion also causes a loss of RPA foci following gamma-irradiation, suggesting that PML is required for processing of DSBs. Immunofluorescent detection of incorporated BrdU without prior denaturation indicates a failure to generate ssDNA foci in PML knockdown cells upon gamma-irradiation. Consistent with the lack of RPA and BrdU foci, gamma-irradiation fails to induce Chk1 activation, when PML is depleted. Taken together, we have discovered a novel functional connection between PML and the homologous recombination-mediated repair machinery, which might contribute to PML tumor suppressor activity.","['Boichuk, Sergei', 'Hu, Liang', 'Makielski, Kathleen', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo', 'Gjoerup, Ole V']","['Boichuk S', 'Hu L', 'Makielski K', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Gjoerup OV']","['Cancer Virology Program, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20111005,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens, Viral, Tumor)', '0 (BRCA1 Protein)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MRE11 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Replication Protein A)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Chek1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Rad51 Recombinase)', 'EC 3.1.- (MRE11 Homologue Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral, Tumor/metabolism', 'BRCA1 Protein/metabolism', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/virology', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'MRE11 Homologue Protein', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Stability', 'Protein Transport', 'Rad51 Recombinase/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Recombinational DNA Repair', 'Replication Protein A/metabolism', 'Simian virus 40/immunology/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Virus Replication']",PMC3187806,2011/10/15 06:00,2012/02/14 06:00,['2011/10/15 06:00'],"['2011/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0025814 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-11910 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(10):e25814. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0025814.

A high therapeutic efficacy was found in murine models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and hematological malignancies.","['Avnir, Yuval', 'Turjeman, Keren', 'Tulchinsky, Deborah', 'Sigal, Alex', 'Kizelsztein, Pablo', 'Tzemach, Dina', 'Gabizon, Alberto', 'Barenholz, Yechezkel']","['Avnir Y', 'Turjeman K', 'Tulchinsky D', 'Sigal A', 'Kizelsztein P', 'Tzemach D', 'Gabizon A', 'Barenholz Y']","['Laboratory of Membrane and Liposome Research, Department of Biochemistry, The Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111006,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Capsules)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Myelin Proteolipid Protein)', '059QF0KO0R (Water)', '5GMR90S4KN (Methylprednisolone Hemisuccinate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Capsules', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical/*methods', 'Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/chemically induced/drug therapy', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/*administration & dosage/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Liposomes', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/drug therapy', 'Methylprednisolone Hemisuccinate/administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Multiple Sclerosis/drug therapy', 'Myelin Proteolipid Protein/adverse effects', 'Nanostructures/*chemistry', 'Solubility', 'Water/chemistry']",PMC3188566,2011/10/15 06:00,2012/02/14 06:00,['2011/10/15 06:00'],"['2011/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0025721 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-09333 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(10):e25721. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0025721.

Common to all MLL translocations is the exchange not only of coding regions, but also of MLL and PG 3'-untranslated regions (3'UTRs). As a result, the MLL-PG fusion is normally highly expressed and considered the main driver of leukemia development, whereas the function of the PG-MLL fusions in leukemic disease is unclear. As 3'UTRs have been recognized as determinant regions for regulation of gene expression, we hypothesized that loss of the MLL 3'UTR could have a role in generating high MLL-PG levels and leukemia development. Here, we first tested the MLL-PG and PG-MLL mRNA levels in different leukemic cells and tumours and uncovered differential expression that indicates strong repression by the MLL-3'UTR. Reporter assays confirmed that the 3'UTR of MLL, but not of its main PGs, harbours a region that imposes a strong gene silencing effect. Gene suppression by the MLL 3'UTR was largely microRNA independent and did not affect mRNA stability, but inhibited transcription. This effect can at least partially be attributed to a tighter interaction of the MLL 3'UTR with RNA polymerase II than PG 3'UTRs, affecting its phosphorylation state. Altogether, our findings indicate that MLL translocations relieve oncogenic MLL-PG fusions from the repressive MLL 3'UTR, contributing to higher activity of these genes and leukaemia development.","['Gomez-Benito, Maria', 'Loayza-Puch, Fabricio', 'Oude Vrielink, Joachim A F', 'Odero, Maria D', 'Agami, Reuven']","['Gomez-Benito M', 'Loayza-Puch F', 'Oude Vrielink JA', 'Odero MD', 'Agami R']","['Division of Gene Regulation The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111005,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/*genetics"", 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Gene Fusion/genetics', '*Gene Silencing', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*deficiency/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",PMC3187771,2011/10/15 06:00,2012/02/14 06:00,['2011/10/15 06:00'],"['2011/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0025449 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-09425 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(10):e25449. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0025449.

However, the innate molecular pathways that regulate the strength and quality of the immune response remain largely uncharacterized. To define the role of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling in control of a model retroviral pathogen, Friend virus (FV), I generated mice in which the TLR signaling adapter Myd88 was selectively deleted in dendritic cell (DC) or in B cell lineages. Deletion of Myd88 in DCs had little effect on immune control of FV, while B cell specific deletion of Myd88 caused a dramatic increase in viral infectious centers and a significantly reduced antibody response, indicating that B cell-intrinsic TLR signaling plays a crucial role, while TLR signaling in DCs is less important. I then identified the single-stranded RNA sensing protein TLR7 as being required for antibody-mediated control of FV by analyzing mice deficient in TLR7. Remarkably, B cells in infected TLR7-deficient mice upregulated CD69 and CD86 early in infection, but failed to develop into germinal center B cells. CD4 T cell responses were also attenuated in the absence of TLR7, but CD8 responses were TLR7 independent, suggesting the existence of additional pathways for detection of retroviral particles. Together these results demonstrate that the vertebrate immune system detects retroviruses in vivo via TLR7 and that this pathway regulates a key checkpoint controlling development of germinal center B cells.","['Browne, Edward P']",['Browne EP'],"['Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America. ebrowne@mit.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111006,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (CD69 antigen)', '0 (Cd86 protein, mouse)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Myd88 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88)', '0 (Tlr7 protein, mouse)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 7)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/immunology/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/genetics/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'B7-2 Antigen/genetics/metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Germinal Center/*immunology/*metabolism/virology', 'Interferon-gamma/genetics/metabolism', 'Lectins, C-Type/genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Toll-Like Receptor 7/genetics/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC3188541,2011/10/15 06:00,2012/02/10 06:00,['2011/10/15 06:00'],"['2011/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1002293 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-11-01280 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS Pathog. 2011 Oct;7(10):e1002293. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002293.

The selective advantage to the host of this indirect restriction mechanism remains unclear, but valuable insights may be gained by studying APOBEC3 function in vivo. Apobec3 was previously shown to encode Rfv3, a classical resistance gene that controls the recovery of mice from pathogenic Friend retrovirus (FV) infection by promoting a more potent neutralizing antibody (NAb) response. The underlying mechanism does not involve a direct effect of Apobec3 on B cell function. Here we show that while Apobec3 decreased titers of infectious virus during acute FV infection, plasma viral RNA loads were maintained, indicating substantial release of noninfectious particles in vivo. The lack of plasma virion infectivity was associated with a significant post-entry block during early reverse transcription rather than G-to-A hypermutation. The Apobec3-dependent NAb response correlated with IgG binding titers against native, but not detergent-lysed virions. These findings indicate that innate Apobec3 restriction promotes NAb responses by maintaining high concentrations of virions with native B cell epitopes, but in the context of low virion infectivity. Finally, Apobec3 restriction was found to be saturable in vivo, since increasing FV inoculum doses resulted in decreased Apobec3 inhibition. By analogy, maximizing the release of noninfectious particles by modulating APOBEC3 expression may improve humoral immunity against pathogenic human retroviral infections.","['Smith, Diana S', 'Guo, Kejun', 'Barrett, Bradley S', 'Heilman, Karl J', 'Evans, Leonard H', 'Hasenkrug, Kim J', 'Greene, Warner C', 'Santiago, Mario L']","['Smith DS', 'Guo K', 'Barrett BS', 'Heilman KJ', 'Evans LH', 'Hasenkrug KJ', 'Greene WC', 'Santiago ML']","['Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, Colorado, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20111006,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Apobec3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neutralizing/*immunology', '*Antibody Formation', 'Antiviral Agents/pharmacology', 'Cytidine Deaminase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma/virology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcription', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Viral Load', 'Virion/*pathogenicity']",PMC3188525,2011/10/15 06:00,2012/02/10 06:00,['2011/10/15 06:00'],"['2011/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1002284 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-11-01252 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS Pathog. 2011 Oct;7(10):e1002284. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002284.

The coding exons of SF3B1 were screened using massively parallel pyrosequencing in patients with MDS, MDS/MPN, or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) evolving from MDS. Somatic mutations of SF3B1 were found in 150 of 533 (28.1%) patients with MDS, 16 of 83 (19.3%) with MDS/MPN, and 2 of 38 (5.3%) with AML. There was a significant association of SF3B1 mutations with the presence of ring sideroblasts (P < .001) and of mutant allele burden with their proportion (P = .002). The mutant gene had a positive predictive value for ring sideroblasts of 97.7% (95% confidence interval, 93.5%-99.5%). In multivariate analysis including established risk factors, SF3B1 mutations were found to be independently associated with better overall survival (hazard ratio = 0.15, P = .025) and lower risk of evolution into AML (hazard ratio = 0.33, P = .049). The close association between SF3B1 mutations and disease phenotype with ring sideroblasts across MDS and MDS/MPN is consistent with a causal relationship. Furthermore, SF3B1 mutations are independent predictors of favorable clinical outcome, and their incorporation into stratification systems might improve risk assessment in MDS.","['Malcovati, Luca', 'Papaemmanuil, Elli', 'Bowen, David T', 'Boultwood, Jacqueline', 'Della Porta, Matteo G', 'Pascutto, Cristiana', 'Travaglino, Erica', 'Groves, Michael J', 'Godfrey, Anna L', 'Ambaglio, Ilaria', 'Galli, Anna', 'Da Via, Matteo C', 'Conte, Simona', 'Tauro, Sudhir', 'Keenan, Norene', 'Hyslop, Ann', 'Hinton, Jonathan', 'Mudie, Laura J', 'Wainscoat, James S', 'Futreal, P Andrew', 'Stratton, Michael R', 'Campbell, Peter J', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg, Eva', 'Cazzola, Mario']","['Malcovati L', 'Papaemmanuil E', 'Bowen DT', 'Boultwood J', 'Della Porta MG', 'Pascutto C', 'Travaglino E', 'Groves MJ', 'Godfrey AL', 'Ambaglio I', 'Galli A', 'Da Via MC', 'Conte S', 'Tauro S', 'Keenan N', 'Hyslop A', 'Hinton J', 'Mudie LJ', 'Wainscoat JS', 'Futreal PA', 'Stratton MR', 'Campbell PJ', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg E', 'Cazzola M']","['Department of Hematology Oncology, Fondazione Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Policlinico San Matteo and University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111012,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA Splicing Factors)', '0 (Ribonucleoprotein, U2 Small Nuclear)', '0 (SF3B1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Alleles', 'Codon', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Erythroblasts/pathology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Myelodysplastic-Myeloproliferative Diseases/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RNA Splicing Factors', 'Ribonucleoprotein, U2 Small Nuclear/*genetics', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Survival Analysis']",PMC3236114,2011/10/15 06:00,2012/02/15 06:00,['2011/10/15 06:00'],"['2011/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40489-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-09-377275 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Dec 8;118(24):6239-46. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-09-377275.

Remarkably, even loss of a single bcl-x allele delayed the lymphomagenesis.

We have tested whether the expression of CD39 and CD73 by chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells activates an adenosinergic axis affecting growth and survival. By immunohistochemistry, CD39 is widely expressed in CLL lymph nodes, whereas CD73 is restricted to proliferation centers. CD73 expression is highest on Ki-67(+) CLL cells, adjacent to T lymphocytes, and is further localized to perivascular areas. CD39(+)/CD73(+) CLL cells generate ADO from ADP in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. In peripheral blood, CD73 expression occurs in 97/299 (32%) CLL patients and pairs with CD38 and ZAP-70 expression. CD73-generated extracellular ADO activates type 1 purinergic A2A receptors that are constitutively expressed by CLL cells and that are further elevated in proliferating neoplastic cells. Activation of the ADO receptors increases cytoplasmic cAMP levels, inhibiting chemotaxis and limiting spontaneous drug-induced apoptosis of CLL cells. These data are consistent with the existence of an autocrine adenosinergic loop, and support engraftment of leukemic cells in growth-favorable niches, while simultaneously protecting from the action of chemotherapeutic agents.","['Serra, Sara', 'Horenstein, Alberto L', 'Vaisitti, Tiziana', 'Brusa, Davide', 'Rossi, Davide', 'Laurenti, Luca', ""D'Arena, Giovanni"", 'Coscia, Marta', 'Tripodo, Claudio', 'Inghirami, Giorgio', 'Robson, Simon C', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Malavasi, Fabio', 'Deaglio, Silvia']","['Serra S', 'Horenstein AL', 'Vaisitti T', 'Brusa D', 'Rossi D', 'Laurenti L', ""D'Arena G"", 'Coscia M', 'Tripodo C', 'Inghirami G', 'Robson SC', 'Gaidano G', 'Malavasi F', 'Deaglio S']","['Human Genetics Foundation (HuGeF), Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111013,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Adenosine A2A)', '61D2G4IYVH (Adenosine Diphosphate)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', ""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)"", 'EC 3.1.3.5 (NT5E protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.5 (Apyrase)', 'EC 3.6.1.5 (CD39 antigen)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"[""5'-Nucleotidase/*metabolism"", 'Adenosine/*metabolism', 'Adenosine Diphosphate/metabolism', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apyrase/metabolism', 'Autocrine Communication/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Death/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Movement/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Extracellular Space/metabolism', 'GPI-Linked Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Paracrine Communication/drug effects/physiology', 'Receptor, Adenosine A2A/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC3342854,2011/10/15 06:00,2012/01/25 06:00,['2011/10/15 06:00'],"['2011/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40546-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-08-374728 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Dec 1;118(23):6141-52. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-08-374728.

Although application of established biomarkers is limited by intrinsic detection/readout complexities, abnormality of kappa and lambda serum-free light chain ratio [sFLC (kappa/lambda)] was proposed as a straightforward prognosticator in CLL. By analyzing 449 therapy-naive patients, we show that an abnormal sFLC(kappa/lambda), along with CD38, ZAP-70, IGHV mutations, cytogenetics and stage, independently predicts treatment-free survival (TFS) but becomes prognostically irrelevant if the cumulative amount of clonal and nonclonal FLCs [sFLC(kappa + lambda)], a variable associated with cytogenetic risk, exceeds the threshold of 60.6 mg/mL. Patients with sFLC(kappa + lambda) above cut-off displayed a poorer TFS outcome, irrespective of sFLC(kappa/lambda). Only ZAP-70, cytogenetics, stage, and TFS remained associated with sFLC(kappa + lambda) in a multivariate model. By assigning 1 point each for these variables, the 3-year probability of TFS was 94.8%, 84.5%, 61.6%, and 21.1% for patients scoring 0, 1, 2, and 3 + 4, respectively (P < .0001). These data, and the demonstration that monoclonal and polyclonal B cells concur to FLC synthesis in tumor tissues, suggest that sFLC(kappa/lambda) and sFLC(kappa + lambda) mirror distinct biologic processes in CLL. sFLC(kappa + lambda) assessment represents a sensitive and cost-effective tool for identifying CLL patients requiring early treatment.","['Morabito, Fortunato', 'De Filippi, Rosaria', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Zirlik, Katja', 'Recchia, Anna Grazia', 'Gentile, Massimo', 'Morelli, Emanuela', 'Vigna, Ernesto', 'Gigliotti, Vincenzo', 'Calemma, Rosa', 'Amoroso, Barbara', 'Neri, Antonino', 'Cutrona, Giovanna', 'Ferrarini, Manlio', 'Molica, Stefano', 'Del Poeta, Giovanni', 'Tripodo, Claudio', 'Pinto, Antonio']","['Morabito F', 'De Filippi R', 'Laurenti L', 'Zirlik K', 'Recchia AG', 'Gentile M', 'Morelli E', 'Vigna E', 'Gigliotti V', 'Calemma R', 'Amoroso B', 'Neri A', 'Cutrona G', 'Ferrarini M', 'Molica S', 'Del Poeta G', 'Tripodo C', 'Pinto A']","['Onco-Hematology Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Annunziata, Cosenza, Italy. fortunato_morabito@tin.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111013,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Algorithms', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/*analysis', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains/analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",,2011/10/15 06:00,2012/02/15 06:00,['2011/10/15 06:00'],"['2011/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40502-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-04-345587 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Dec 8;118(24):6353-61. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-04-345587.

Septin assemblies during the interphase of animal cells remain poorly defined and are the topic of this report. In this study, we developed protocols for visualization of authentic higher-order assemblies using tagged septins to effectively replace the endogenous gene product within septin core heteromers in human cells. Our analysis revealed that septins assemble into microtubule-supported, disk-like structures at the plasma membrane. In the absence of cell substrate adhesion, this is the predominant higher-order arrangement in interphase cells and each of the seven to eight septin family members expressed by the two analyzed cell types appears equally represented. However, studies of myeloid and lymphoid cell model systems revealed cell type-specific alterations of higher-order septin arrangements in response to substrate adhesion. Live-cell observations suggested that all higher-order septin assemblies are mutually exclusive with plasma membrane regions undergoing remodeling. The combined data point to a mechanism by which densely arranged cortical microtubules, which are typical for nonadhered spherical cells, support plasma membrane-bound, disk-like septin assemblies.","['Sellin, Mikael E', 'Holmfeldt, Per', 'Stenmark, Sonja', 'Gullberg, Martin']","['Sellin ME', 'Holmfeldt P', 'Stenmark S', 'Gullberg M']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Umea University, SE-901 87 Umea, Sweden. mikael.sellin@molbiol.umu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111012,United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (green fluorescent protein, Aequorea victoria)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (SEPTIN7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (SEPTIN9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Septins)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Microtubules/*metabolism', 'Permeability', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Septins/genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/ultrastructure']",PMC3226477,2011/10/15 06:00,2012/04/13 06:00,['2011/10/15 06:00'],"['2011/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/13 06:00 [medline]']","['mbc.E11-09-0754 [pii]', '10.1091/mbc.E11-09-0754 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 2011 Dec;22(23):4588-601. doi: 10.1091/mbc.E11-09-0754.

Signs, symptoms, laboratory and pathologic findings demonstrated AAE. CONCLUSION: Wider appreciation of the possibility of AAE, particularly in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders, could lead to preventive therapy and spare unnecessary surgery.

This is due to the offered speed of detection, the real-time non-invasive approach and their high sensitivity not only to mass coupling, but also to viscoelastic changes occurring close to the sensor surface. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and surface acoustic wave (Love-wave) systems have been used to monitor the adhesion of animal cells to various surfaces and record the behaviour of cell layers under various conditions. The sensors detect cells mostly via their sensitivity in viscoelasticity and mechanical properties. Particularly, the QCM sensor detects cytoskeletal rearrangements caused by specific drugs affecting either actin microfilaments or microtubules. The Love-wave sensor directly measures cell/substrate bonds via acoustic damping and provides 2D kinetic and affinity parameters. Other studies have applied the QCM sensor as a diagnostic tool for leukaemia and, potentially, for chemotherapeutic agents. Acoustic sensors have also been used in the evaluation of the cytocompatibility of artificial surfaces and, in general, they have the potential to become powerful tools for even more diverse cellular analysis.","['Saitakis, Michael', 'Gizeli, Electra']","['Saitakis M', 'Gizeli E']","['Department of Biology, University of Crete, Heraklion-Crete, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20111015,Switzerland,Cell Mol Life Sci,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,9705402,['0 (Polymers)'],IM,"['*Acoustics', 'Animals', 'Biosensing Techniques/*instrumentation', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Humans', 'Polymers/chemistry', 'Quartz Crystal Microbalance Techniques', 'Surface Properties']",,2011/10/15 06:00,2012/03/07 06:00,['2011/10/15 06:00'],"['2011/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/29 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00018-011-0854-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Mol Life Sci. 2012 Feb;69(3):357-71. doi: 10.1007/s00018-011-0854-8.

Mutations of p53 have been implicated in the development of approximately 50% of human cancers, including those instigated by exposure to mutagens. Although numerically rare, cancers can arise as a consequence of inherited mutations, such as in the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, which is caused by mutation of one p53 allele. Gene-targeted mice deficient for p53 have been generated to study this familial cancer syndrome. On a C57BL/6 background, p53-deficient mice develop primarily thymic lymphoma and more rarely sarcoma. Evasion of apoptosis is considered to be essential for neoplastic transformation. As proteins of the Bcl-2 family are the critical regulators of apoptosis, we investigated the role of the pro-survival members Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L) and Bcl-w in cancer development in p53(+/-) and p53(-/-) mice by testing whether ABT-737, a pharmacological inhibitor of these proteins, could prevent or delay tumourigenesis. Our studies showed that ABT-737 prophylaxis only caused a minor delay and reduction in gamma-radiation-induced thymic lymphoma development in p53(-/-) mice, but this was accompanied by a concomitant increase in sarcoma. These data show that, collectively, Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L) and Bcl-w have only minor roles in thymic lymphoma development elicited by defects in p53, and this may indicate that Mcl-1 and/or A1 may feature more prominently in this process.","['Grabow, S', 'Waring, P', 'Happo, L', 'Cook, M', 'Mason, K D', 'Kelly, P N', 'Strasser, A']","['Grabow S', 'Waring P', 'Happo L', 'Cook M', 'Mason KD', 'Kelly PN', 'Strasser A']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111014,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bcl2l2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Biomimetic Materials/*pharmacology', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/genetics/*metabolism/prevention & control', 'Neoplastic Syndromes, Hereditary/genetics/*metabolism/prevention & control', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/prevention & control', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3260394,2011/10/15 06:00,2012/07/04 06:00,['2011/10/15 06:00'],"['2011/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/04 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd2011133 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2011.133 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2012 Apr;19(4):623-32. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2011.133.

To evaluate morbidity 555/1826 randomised children underwent prospective psychological evaluations. Full Scale, verbal and performance IQs were measured at 5 months, 3 years and 5 years. Scores were compared in; (1) all patients (n = 555) versus related controls (n = 311), (2) low-risk children (presenting white cell count (WCC) < 50 x 10(9)/l) randomised to intrathecal methotrexate (n = 197) versus intrathecal and high-dose intravenous methotrexate (HDM) (n = 202), and (3) high-risk children (WCC >/= 50 x 10(9)/l, age >/= 2 years) randomised to HDM (n = 79) versus cranial irradiation (n = 77). RESULTS: There were no significant differences in IQ scores between the treatment arms in either low- or high-risk groups. Despite similar scores at baseline, results at 3 and 5 years showed a significant reduction of between 3.6 and 7.3 points in all three IQ scores in all patient groups compared to controls (P < 0.002) with a higher proportion of children with IQs < 80 in the patient groups (13% vs. 5% at 3 years p = 0.003).

It remains unclear (a) whether this association is restricted to discrete subtypes of B-cell neoplasms and (b) if occult hepatitis B virus infection can impact on the risk of B-cell malignancy. METHODS: We analysed the prevalence of occult hepatitis B virus infection in three age and sex matched groups: patients with multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and healthy volunteers (N=80 each group). Hepatitis B virus sequences were detected by PCR in blood mononuclear cells isolated prior to treatment. RESULTS: Fifteen subjects tested positive for occult hepatitis B virus infection and its distribution significantly favoured chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (p<0.02) over the other groups. No difference in age, gender and proportion of anti-HBc seropositivity was noted according to occult hepatitis B virus infection status. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia had an odds ratio of 4.6 (95% CI 1.5-13.9) for the presence of occult hepatitis B virus infection in comparison to multiple myeloma and controls. Most occult hepatitis B virus infection cases (10/15, 67%) were detected in completely hepatitis B virus seronegative subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support a potentially causal relationship for hepatitis B virus in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia but not in multiple myeloma. HBsAg seropositivity alone may bias the study of this association, potentially leading to underestimation.

However, subsequent studies have identified various sources of potential contamination with XMRV and other murine leukemia virus (MLV)-related sequences in test samples. Biological and nucleotide sequence analysis indicates that XMRV is distinct from known xenotropic MLVs and has a broad host range and cell tropism including human cells. Therefore, it is prudent to minimize the risk of human exposure to infection by evaluating XMRV contamination in cell lines handled in laboratory research and particularly those used in the manufacture of biological products. Nested DNA PCR assays were optimized for investigating XMRV gag and env sequences in various cell lines, which included MRC-5, Vero, HEK-293, MDCK, HeLa, and A549, that may be used in the development of some vaccines and other cell lines broadly used in research. The sensitivity of the DNA PCR assays was <10 copies in approximately 1.8 x 10(5) cells equivalent of human DNA. The results indicated the absence of XMRV in the cell lines tested; although in some cases DNA fragments identified as cellular sequences were seen following the first round of PCR amplification with the env primer pair.","['Williams, Dhanya K', 'Galvin, Teresa A', 'Ma, Hailun', 'Khan, Arifa S']","['Williams DK', 'Galvin TA', 'Ma H', 'Khan AS']","['Laboratory of Retroviruses, Division of Viral Products, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 8800 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111012,England,Biologicals,Biologicals : journal of the International Association of Biological Standardization,9004494,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Drug Contamination/prevention & control', 'Gene Products, env/*genetics', 'Gene Products, gag/*genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Retroviridae Infections/diagnosis/virology', 'Vero Cells', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/*genetics/growth & development']",,2011/10/15 06:00,2012/03/17 06:00,['2011/10/15 06:00'],"['2011/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/17 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S1045-1056(11)00120-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biologicals.2011.08.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Biologicals. 2011 Nov;39(6):378-83. doi: 10.1016/j.biologicals.2011.08.011.

The lymph node biopsy confirmed that the patients had CLL with remarkable immunoglobulin light chain amyloid deposition. The renal biopsy demonstrated the concurrence of AL amyloidosis and neoplastic infiltration. Combined treatment of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab resulted in remission of CLL, as well as the renal disfunction and nephrotic syndrome, without recurrence during a 12-month follow-up. To our knowledge, this is the first case of CLL patient showing the nephrotic syndrome and acute renal failure caused by AL amyloidosis and neoplastic infiltration.

HTLV-1-infected T cells have been hypothesized to contribute to the development of these disorders, although the precise mechanisms are not well understood. HTLV-1 primarily infects CD4(+) T helper (Th) cells that play a central role in adaptive immune responses. Based on their functions, patterns of cytokine secretion, and expression of specific transcription factors and chemokine receptors, Th cells that are differentiated from naive CD4(+) T cells are classified into four major lineages: Th1, Th2, Th17, and T regulatory (Treg) cells. The CD4(+)CD25(+)CCR4(+) T cell population, which consists primarily of suppressive T cell subsets, such as the Treg and Th2 subsets in healthy individuals, is the predominant viral reservoir of HTLV-1 in both ATL and HAM/TSP patients. Interestingly, CD4(+)CD25(+)CCR4(+) T cells become Th1-like cells in HAM/TSP patients, as evidenced by their overproduction of IFN-gamma, suggesting that HTLV-1 may intracellularly induce T cell plasticity from Treg to IFN-gamma(+) T cells. This review examines the recent research into the association between HTLV-1 and Treg cells that has greatly enhanced understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying immune dysregulation in HTLV-1-associated neuroinflammatory disease.","['Araya, Natsumi', 'Sato, Tomoo', 'Yagishita, Naoko', 'Ando, Hitoshi', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Jacobson, Steven', 'Yamano, Yoshihisa']","['Araya N', 'Sato T', 'Yagishita N', 'Ando H', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Jacobson S', 'Yamano Y']","['Department of Rare Diseases Research, Institute of Medical Science, School of Medicine, St. Marianna University, Kawasaki 216-8511, Japan. araya@marianna-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20110825,Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,['82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)'],IM,"['Adaptive Immunity/immunology', 'Adult', 'Cell Differentiation', 'HTLV-I Infections/*immunology/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/immunology/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology/virology', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/immunology/virology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/immunology/*virology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology/*virology', 'Th2 Cells/immunology/virology']",PMC3187691,2011/10/14 06:00,2014/05/16 06:00,['2011/10/14 06:00'],"['2011/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/13 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3390/v3091532 [doi]', 'v3091532 [pii]']",ppublish,Viruses. 2011 Sep;3(9):1532-48. doi: 10.3390/v3091532.

The virally-encoded Tax protein is believed to initiate early events in the development of this disease, as it is able to promote immortalization of T-cells and transformation of other cell types. These processes may be aided by the ability of the viral protein to directly deregulate expression of specific cellular genes through interactions with numerous transcriptional regulators. To identify gene promoters where Tax is localized, we isolated Tax-DNA complexes from an HTLV-1-infected T-cell line through a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and used the DNA to probe a CpG island microarray. A site within the RNASET2 gene was found to be occupied by Tax. Real-time PCR analysis confirmed this result, and transient expression of Tax in uninfected cells led to the recruitment of the viral protein to the promoter. This event correlated with a decrease in the level of RNase T2 mRNA and protein, suggesting that Tax represses expression of this gene. Loss of RNase T2 expression occurs in certain hematological malignancies and other forms of cancer, and RNase T2 was recently reported to function as a tumor suppressor. Consequently, a reduction in the level of RNase T2 by Tax may play a role in ATL development.","['Polakowski, Nicholas', 'Han, Hongjin', 'Lemasson, Isabelle']","['Polakowski N', 'Han H', 'Lemasson I']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC 27834, USA. polakowskin@ecu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20110818,Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.27.- (RNASET2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.27.1 (ribonuclease T(2))']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'CpG Islands', 'Endoribonucleases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/metabolism/virology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Ribonucleases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3185805,2011/10/14 06:00,2012/03/17 06:00,['2011/10/14 06:00'],"['2011/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3390/v3081485 [doi]', 'v3081485 [pii]']",ppublish,Viruses. 2011 Aug;3(8):1485-500. doi: 10.3390/v3081485.

Once it was shown that there is an increased risk for developing HAM/TSP associated with blood transfusion, screening for HTLV-1 among blood banks was implemented in Japan, United States, France, and the Netherlands.

HTLV-1 is able to induce, after decades of infection, lymphomas/leukemia or neuroimmune disorders whereas untreated HIV infection leads almost inevitably to AIDS. The recently described XMRV (xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus) appeared to possess many of the features known for HTLV and was regarded by some to be the third human retrovirus. However, recent publications by Knox et al. and Paprotka et al. have shed new light on this gammaretrovirus. Knox and colleagues clearly demonstrate that XMRV is absent in patients belonging to a chronic fatigue syndrome cohort who had previously been reported to be XMRV-positive. This supports the growing suspicion that laboratory contamination was responsible for the postulated link between XMRV and the disease. Furthermore, Paprotka et al's identification of XMRV's origin and the phylogenetic analysis of known XMRV sequences are further nails in the coffin to the notion that XMRV is a clinically relevant infectious human retrovirus.","['Hohn, Oliver', 'Bannert, Norbert']","['Hohn O', 'Bannert N']","['Center for HIV and Retrovirology, Robert Koch Institute, Berlin, Germany.

After prolonged latency periods, approximately 3 to 5% of HTLV-1 infected individuals will develop either adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), or other lymphocyte-mediated disorders such as HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). The genome of this complex retrovirus contains typical gag, pol, and env genes, but also unique nonstructural proteins encoded from the pX region. These nonstructural genes encode the Tax and Rex regulatory proteins, as well as novel proteins essential for viral spread in vivo such as, p30, p12, p13 and the antisense encoded HBZ. While progress has been made in the understanding of viral determinants of cell transformation and host immune responses, host and viral determinants of HTLV-1 transmission and spread during the early phases of infection are unclear.

The high percentage of homologies between HTLV-1 and STLV-1 strains, led to the demonstration that most HTLV-1 subtypes arose from interspecies transmission between monkeys and humans. STLV-3 viruses belong to the third PTLV type and are equally divergent from both HTLV-1 and HTLV-2. They are endemic in several monkey species that live in West, Central and East Africa. In 2005, we, and others reported the discovery of the human homolog (HTLV-3) of STLV-3 in two asymptomatic inhabitants from South Cameroon whose sera exhibited HTLV indeterminate serologies. More recently, two other cases of HTLV-3 infection in persons living in Cameroon were reported suggesting that this virus is not extremely rare in the human population living in Central Africa. Together with STLV-3, these human viral strains belong to the PTLV-3 group. A fourth HTLV type (HTLV-4) was also discovered in the same geographical area. The overall PTLV-3 and PTLV-4 genomic organization is similar to that of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 with the exception of their long terminal repeats (LTRs) that contain only two 21 bp repeats. As in HTLV-1, HTLV-3 Tax contains a PDZ binding motif while HTLV-4 does not. An antisense transcript was also described in HTLV-3 transfected cells. PTLV-3 molecular clones are now available and will allow scientists to study the viral cycle, the tropism and the possible pathogenicity in vivo. Current studies are also aimed at determining the prevalence, distribution, and modes of transmission of these viruses, as well as their possible association with human diseases.

Patients with aggressive ATLL have a poor prognosis because the leukemic cells are resistant to conventional chemotherapy. We have investigated the therapeutic efficacy of a biphosphinic cyclopalladated complex {Pd(2) [S(-)C(2), N-dmpa](2) (mu-dppe)Cl(2)}, termed C7a, in a patient-derived xenograft model of ATLL, and investigated the mechanism of C7a action in HTLV-1-positive and negative transformed T cell lines in vitro. In vivo survival studies in immunocompromised mice inoculated with human RV-ATL cells and intraperitoneally treated with C7a led to significantly increased survival of the treated mice. We investigated the mechanism of C7a activity in vitro and found that it induced mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, caspase activation, nuclear condensation and DNA degradation. These results suggest that C7a triggers apoptotic cell death in both HTLV-1 infected and uninfected human transformed T-cell lines.

The finding that CREB protein is activated in HTLV-1 infected cells underlines the possibility that other mechanisms of survival may be implicated in HTLV-1 infection. Indeed, CREB activation or overexpression plays a role in normal hematopoiesis, as well as in leukemia development, and CREB is considered as a survival factor in various cell systems.

We and others have demonstrated the existence of an antisense transcript initiating in the 3' LTR of the Human T-cell Leukemia Virus type 1 (HTLV-1) that is involved in the production of HBZ (HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper (bZIP) factor). HBZ is a Fos-like factor capable of inhibiting Tax-mediated activation of the HTLV-1 LTR by interacting with the cellular transcription factor cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) and the pleiotropic cellular coactivators p300/CBP. HBZ can also activate cellular transcription through its interaction with p300/CBP. Interestingly, HBZ has also been found to promote T-lymphocyte proliferation. By down-regulating viral expression and by stimulating T-cell proliferation, HBZ could be essential in the establishment of a chronic infection. Antisense transcription also occurs in the closely related HTLV-2 retrovirus as well as in the recently discovered HTLV-3 and HTLV-4. These antisense transcripts are also involved in the production of retroviral proteins that we have termed Antisense Protein of HTLVs (APH).

Most importantly, it has been demonstrated that the genotoxic potential is not identical among all retroviral vector systems designed for clinical application. Large scale viral integration site determination has uncovered significant differences in the target site selection of retrovirus subfamilies influencing the propensity for inducing genetic alterations in the host genome.

The multi-stage erythroleukemia induced in mice by Friend spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) is an excellent animal model for studying the molecular basis for both of these changes. Significant progress has been made in understanding the molecular basis for the multi-stage erythroleukemia induced by Friend SFFV. In the first stage of leukemia, the envelope protein encoded by SFFV interacts with and activates the erythropoietin (Epo) receptor and the receptor tyrosine kinase sf-Stk in erythroid cells, causing their Epo-independent proliferation, differentiation and survival. In the second stage, SFFV integration into the Sfpi1 locus activates the myeloid transcription factor PU.1, blocking erythroid cell differentiation, and in conjunction with the loss of p53 tumor suppressor activity, results in the outgrowth of malignant cells. In this review, we discuss the current level of understanding of how SFFV alters the growth and differentiation of erythroid cells and results in the development of erythroleukemia. Our knowledge of how SFFV causes erythroleukemia in mice may give us clues as to how the highly related human retrovirus XMRV causes malignancies in humans.","['Cmarik, Joan', 'Ruscetti, Sandra']","['Cmarik J', 'Ruscetti S']","['Laboratory of Cancer Prevention, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD 21702, USA; E-Mail: cmarikj@mail.nih.gov.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20101011,Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,,,,PMC3185572,2011/10/14 06:00,2011/10/14 06:01,['2011/10/14 06:00'],"['2010/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/11 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3390/v2102235 [doi]', 'viruses-02-02235 [pii]']",ppublish,Viruses. 2010 Oct;2(10):2235-57. doi: 10.3390/v2102235.

Several alternatively spliced PML transcripts from a single PML gene lead to the production of seven PML isoforms (PML isoform I [PMLI] to VII [PMLVII]), which all share a N-terminal region that includes the RBCC (RING, B boxes, and a alpha-helical coiled-coil) motif but differ in the C-terminal region. This diversity of PML isoforms determines the specific functions of each isoform. There is increasing evidence implicating PML in host antiviral defense and suggesting various strategies involving PML to counteract viral production. We reported that mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from PML knockout mice are more sensitive than wild-type cells to infection with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). Here, we show that stable expression of PMLIV or PMLIVa inhibited viral replication and protein synthesis, leading to a substantial reduction of EMCV multiplication. This protective effect required PMLIV SUMOylation and was not observed with other nuclear PML isoforms (I, II, III, V, and VI) or with the cytoplasmic PMLVII. We demonstrated that only PMLIV interacted with EMCV 3D polymerase (3Dpol) and sequestered it within PML NBs. The C-terminal region specific to PMLIV was required for both interaction with 3Dpol and the antiviral properties. Also, depletion of PMLIV by RNA interference significantly boosted EMCV production in interferon-treated cells. These findings indicate the mechanism by which PML confers resistance to EMCV. They also reveal a new pathway mediating the antiviral activity of interferon against EMCV.","['Maroui, Mohamed Ali', 'Pampin, Mathieu', 'Chelbi-Alix, Mounira K']","['Maroui MA', 'Pampin M', 'Chelbi-Alix MK']","['CNRS FRE3235, Universite Paris Descartes, 45 rue des Saints Peres, 75006 Paris, France. mounira.chelbi-alix@parisdescartes.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111012,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.6 (DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Encephalomyocarditis virus/*enzymology/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Protein Isoforms/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism']",PMC3233141,2011/10/14 06:00,2012/01/24 06:00,['2011/10/14 06:00'],"['2011/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.05808-11 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.05808-11 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2011 Dec;85(24):13164-73. doi: 10.1128/JVI.05808-11.

However, some patients with CML are less likely to respond to imatinib, the inhibitor of Bcr-Abl kinase. Recent studies showed that mTOR pathway can increase responses to imatinib. The analysis of mTOR pathway in CML may provide new insights into possible targets of novel therapies. Therefore, we examined the expression of mTOR pathway molecules in bone marrow cells from CML patients and effect of rapamycin on K562 cells in vitro. Western blot analysis showed the visibly higher phosphorylation of mTOR (70.6%), 4E-BP1 (76.5%) and p70S6K (73.5%) in bone marrow cells from CML patients. Moreover, treatment of CML cell line (K562) with rapamycin resulted in a decrease of phosphorylation of mTOR, 4E-BP1 and p70S6K. In vitro, the cell viability in groups with rapamycin treatment displayed a significant decrease in a dose-dependent manner by MTT. The data presented an increase of G0/G1 phase cells and decrease of S phase cells after rapamycin treatment, and the decreased expression of cyclinD1, higher expression of p21 at mRNA level was also detected in K562 with rapamycin. Treatment with 20 nmol/l or more rapamycin could increase apoptotic cells, decrease expression of bcl-2 and activate caspase-3. In conclusion, the mTOR pathway might be involved in chronic myelogenous leukemia. Inhibition of mTOR pathway could interfer with cell proliferation and increase cell apoptosis in K562 cells. It suggested that mTOR might be an important therapeutic target for myelogenous leukemia.","['Li, Jie', 'Xue, Liying', 'Hao, Hongling', 'Han, Yuxiang', 'Yang, Jingci', 'Luo, Jianmin']","['Li J', 'Xue L', 'Hao H', 'Han Y', 'Yang J', 'Luo J']","['Department of Hematology, the Second Hospital, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang 050017, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111012,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Sirolimus/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",,2011/10/14 06:00,2012/04/06 06:00,['2011/10/14 06:00'],"['2011/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2011.1502 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2012 Feb;27(2):461-6. doi: 10.3892/or.2011.1502.

DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 39 patients with myeloid neoplasms following radioiodine treatment, whose data were reported to the Duesseldorf Myelodysplastic Syndromes Register (8 of 3814 patients) and five other German Myelodysplastic Syndromes centers (n=31) between 1982 and 2011. These data were compared with those from 165 patients from our Myelodysplastic Syndromes Register with therapy-related myeloid neoplasms following chemotherapy (n=90), radiation (n=30), or radiochemotherapy (n=45). RESULTS: With a median latency of 79 months, 18 patients developed therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia and 21 presented with therapy-related myelodysplastic syndromes (8 refractory anemia with excess blasts I/II, 6 refractory anemia with multilineage dysplasia, 3 myelodysplastic syndromes with del(5q), 1 refractory anemia, 1 refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts, 1 chronic myelomonocytic leukemia II, 1 myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm unclassifiable). Risk assessment according to the International Prognostic Scoring System was low-risk in 23%, intermediate-1 in 29%, intermediate-2 in 35%, and high-risk in 13%. Karyotype was abnormal in 68%, with chromosomes 7 (30%), 5 (26%), 8 (26%) and 3 (17%) being most frequently affected. No differences in the distribution of gender, World Health Organization subtype, acute myeloid leukemia progression, International Prognostic Scoring System score, and cytogenetic risk were observed between patients with therapy-related myeloid neoplasms following radioiodine or other treatment modalities. Of 17 patients who received induction chemotherapy, 71% were refractory to this treatment or died from treatment-related toxicity. The median overall survival in the entire group was 21.7 months (95%-CI 10.5-33 months) and did not differ significantly in comparison to the survival of patients with therapy-related myeloid neoplasms following other cytotoxic treatments. Patients with therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia had significantly inferior overall survival (12.4 versus 28.7 months, P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Patients developing a therapy-related myeloid neoplasm after radioiodine treatment usually present with biological characteristics similar to those seen in patients with therapy-related myeloid neoplasms following other cytotoxic treatment modalities, associated with a low response rate to induction chemotherapy and poor prognosis.","['Schroeder, Thomas', 'Kuendgen, Andrea', 'Kayser, Sabine', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Braulke, Friederike', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Klarner, Viola', 'Zohren, Fabian', 'Haase, Detlef', 'Stadler, Michael', 'Schlenk, Richard', 'Czibere, Akos G', 'Bruns, Ingmar', 'Fenk, Roland', 'Gattermann, Norbert', 'Haas, Rainer', 'Kobbe, Guido', 'Germing, Ulrich']","['Schroeder T', 'Kuendgen A', 'Kayser S', 'Kroger N', 'Braulke F', 'Platzbecker U', 'Klarner V', 'Zohren F', 'Haase D', 'Stadler M', 'Schlenk R', 'Czibere AG', 'Bruns I', 'Fenk R', 'Gattermann N', 'Haas R', 'Kobbe G', 'Germing U']","['Department for Haematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, University of Duesseldorf Medical Faculty, Duesseldorf, Germany. thomas.schroeder@med.uniduesseldorf.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20111011,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC3269479,2011/10/14 06:00,2012/09/20 06:00,['2011/10/14 06:00'],"['2011/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/20 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.049114 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.049114 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Feb;97(2):206-12. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.049114.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Three cohorts of patients received escalating doses of monoclonal antibody 216 administered as an intravenous infusion. In the case of poor response to the first dose of monoclonal antibody 216 alone, defined as less than 75% reduction in peripheral blood blast count, a second dose of the antibody with vincristine was given between days 4 and 7. Responses were assessed weekly until day 35. Serum concentration of monoclonal antibody 216 was measured before and after infusion. Monoclonal antibody 216 targeting was determined with an anti-idiotypic antibody to monoclonal antibody 216 and preliminary efficacy was analyzed by changes in peripheral blood blasts. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were enrolled. One episode of grade 3 epistaxis was the only dose-limiting toxicity observed. All patients showed a poor response to the first monoclonal antibody 216 infusion with a decrease in peripheral blasts from 6-65% in 9 patients. In 8 patients, addition of vincristine to monoclonal antibody 216 resulted in an average reduction of the peripheral blasts of 81%. One patient without peripheral blasts achieved a hypoplastic marrow without evidence of leukemia after one infusion of monoclonal antibody 216 and monoclonal antibody 216/vincristine each. Monoclonal antibody 216 was detected on peripheral blasts in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with monoclonal antibody 216 in combination with vincristine is feasible and well tolerated in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Binding of monoclonal antibody 216 to leukemic blasts was efficient, and favorable early responses were observed.","['Liedtke, Michaela', 'Twist, Clare J', 'Medeiros, Bruno C', 'Gotlib, Jason R', 'Berube, Caroline', 'Bieber, Marcia M', 'Bhat, Neelima M', 'Teng, Nelson N', 'Coutre, Steven E']","['Liedtke M', 'Twist CJ', 'Medeiros BC', 'Gotlib JR', 'Berube C', 'Bieber MM', 'Bhat NM', 'Teng NN', 'Coutre SE']","['Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, 875 Blake Wilbur Drive, Stanford, CA 94305, USA. mliedtke@stanford.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111011,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Neutralizing/blood/immunology', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex/blood/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Erythrocytes/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",PMC3248928,2011/10/14 06:00,2012/05/02 06:00,['2011/10/14 06:00'],"['2011/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.045997 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.045997 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Jan;97(1):30-7. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.045997.

This cohort of 95 lenalidomide-treated patients was compared to a historical control cohort of 99 patients with lower risk myelodysplastic syndromes with del 5q who never received lenalidomide, using a propensity score approach that can control for potential confounders in non-randomized comparisons. RESULTS: The 4-year estimated cumulative incidence of leukemia was 9% in patients treated with lenalidomide and 15.8% in controls who did not receive lenalidomide (P=0.16).

The role of non-anthracycline drugs in induction and consolidation is less well-established and varies widely between different cooperative group protocols. DESIGN AND METHODS: In an attempt to minimize relapse and maximize survival for patients with newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia, the Australasian Leukaemia and Lymphoma Group utilized all-trans-retinoic acid and idarubicin as anti-leukemic therapy for both induction and consolidation. The protocol (known as APML3) was subsequently amended to incorporate maintenance with all-trans-retinoic acid, methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine. RESULTS: Eight (8%) of 101 patients died within 30 days, and 91 (90%) achieved complete remission. With a median estimated potential follow-up of 4.6 years, 4-year overall survival was 84%, and 71% of the patients remained in remission at 4 years. The cumulative incidence of all relapses was 28.1%, with 15 of the 25 relapses initially identified as an isolated molecular relapse. Both FLT3 mutations (internal tandem duplications and codon 835/836 kinase domain mutations) and increased white cell count at diagnosis were associated with inferior overall survival, but in multivariate analyses only FLT3 mutations remained significant (hazard ratio 6.647, P=0.005). Maintenance therapy was significantly associated with improved remission duration (hazard ratio 0.281, P<0.001) and disease-free survival (hazard ratio 0.290, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of all-trans-retinoic acid and just two cycles of idarubicin followed by triple maintenance produced durable remissions in most patients, but patients with high-risk disease, especially those with FLT3 mutations, require additional agents or alternative treatment approaches. The significant reduction in relapse seen after the addition of maintenance to the protocol supports a role for maintenance in the context of relatively low chemotherapy exposure during consolidation.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Our aim was to investigate the role of ATM gene alterations, their biological consequences and their value in predicting disease progression. The ATM gene was analyzed by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography and multiplex ligation probe amplification in a series of patients at diagnosis. The results were correlated with immunoglobulin gene mutations, cytogenetic abnormalities, ZAP-70 and CD38 expression, TP53 mutations, gene expression profile and treatment-free interval. RESULTS: Mutational screening of the ATM gene identified point mutations in 8/57 cases (14%). Multiplex ligation probe amplification analysis identified six patients with 11q deletion: all of them had at least 20% of deleted cells, analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Overall, ATM point mutations and deletions were detected in 14/57 (24.6%) cases at presentation, representing the most common unfavorable genetic anomalies in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, also in stage A patients. Patients with deleted or mutated ATM had a significantly shorter treatment-free interval compared to patients without ATM alterations. ATM-mutated cases had a peculiar gene expression profile characterized by the deregulation of genes involved in apoptosis and DNA repair. Finally, definition of the structure of the ATM-mutated protein led to a hypothesis that functional abnormalities are responsible for the unfavorable clinical course of patients carrying these point mutations. CONCLUSIONS: ATM alterations are present at diagnosis in about 25% of individuals with chronic lymphocytic leukemia; these alterations are associated with a peculiar gene expression pattern and a shorter treatment-free interval.","['Guarini, Anna', 'Marinelli, Marilisa', 'Tavolaro, Simona', 'Bellacchio, Emanuele', 'Magliozzi, Monia', 'Chiaretti, Sabina', 'De Propris, Maria Stefania', 'Peragine, Nadia', 'Santangelo, Simona', 'Paoloni, Francesca', 'Nanni, Mauro', 'Del Giudice, Ilaria', 'Mauro, Francesca Romana', 'Torrente, Isabella', 'Foa, Robin']","['Guarini A', 'Marinelli M', 'Tavolaro S', 'Bellacchio E', 'Magliozzi M', 'Chiaretti S', 'De Propris MS', 'Peragine N', 'Santangelo S', 'Paoloni F', 'Nanni M', 'Del Giudice I', 'Mauro FR', 'Torrente I', 'Foa R']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy. rfoa@bce.uniroma1.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111011,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cluster Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', '*Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Duplication', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC3248930,2011/10/14 06:00,2012/05/02 06:00,['2011/10/14 06:00'],"['2011/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.049270 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.049270 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Jan;97(1):47-55. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.049270.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a clinically heterogeneous disease which needs novel prognostic parameters which can be easily and efficiently managed. DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated CD69 by flow cytometry in a series of 417 patients affected by chronic lymphocytic leukemia and compared this to other biological and clinical prognosticators. RESULTS: CD69 was associated with Rai stages (P=0.00002), beta(2)-microglobulin (P=0.0005) and soluble CD23 (P<0.0001). CD69 and ZAP-70 (P=0.018) or CD38 (P=0.00015) or immunoglobulin variable heavy chain gene mutations (P=0.0005) were also significantly correlated. Clinically, CD69 positive chronic lymphocytic leukemias received chemotherapy more frequently (74%; P<0.0001), and presented a shorter duration of response after fludarabine plus rituximab (P=0.010) as well as shorter progression free survival and overall survival (P<0.0001). CD69 demonstrated true additive prognostic properties, since the CD69(+) plus ZAP-70(+) or CD38(+) or immunoglobulin variable heavy chain gene unmutated patients had the worst progression free survival and overall survival (P<0.0001). Interestingly, low CD69 expression was necessary to correctly prognosticate the longer progression free survival of patients with a low tumor burden of beta(2)-microglobulin (P=0.002), of soluble CD23 (P=0.020), or of Rai stages 0-I (P=0.005). CD69 was confirmed to be an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis of progression free survival (P=0.017) and overall survival (P=0.039). CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that CD69 is significantly correlated with poor clinical and biological prognostic factors and is confirmed to be an independent disease prognosticator. This supports its introduction in a routine laboratory assessment and, possibly, in a prognostic scoring system for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, after an adequate standardization process.","['Del Poeta, Giovanni', 'Del Principe, Maria Ilaria', 'Zucchetto, Antonella', 'Luciano, Fabrizio', 'Buccisano, Francesco', 'Rossi, Francesca Maria', 'Bruno, Antonio', 'Biagi, Annalisa', 'Bulian, Pietro', 'Maurillo, Luca', 'Neri, Benedetta', 'Bomben, Riccardo', 'Simotti, Cristina', 'Coletta, Angela Maria', 'Dal Bo, Michele', 'de Fabritiis, Paolo', 'Venditti, Adriano', 'Gattei, Valter', 'Amadori, Sergio']","['Del Poeta G', 'Del Principe MI', 'Zucchetto A', 'Luciano F', 'Buccisano F', 'Rossi FM', 'Bruno A', 'Biagi A', 'Bulian P', 'Maurillo L', 'Neri B', 'Bomben R', 'Simotti C', 'Coletta AM', 'Dal Bo M', 'de Fabritiis P', 'Venditti A', 'Gattei V', 'Amadori S']","['Department of Hematology, University Tor Vergata, Roma. g.delpoeta@tin.it']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111011,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD69 antigen)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/genetics/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lectins, C-Type/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Rituximab', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",PMC3269490,2011/10/14 06:00,2012/09/20 06:00,['2011/10/14 06:00'],"['2011/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/20 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.052829 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.052829 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Feb;97(2):279-87. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.052829.

So far, however, little is known about expression of CD33 on leukemic stem cells in chronic leukemias. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed expression of CD33 in leukemic progenitors in chronic myeloid leukemia by multi-color flow cytometry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In addition, the effects of a CD33-targeting drug, gemtuzumab/ozogamicin, were examined. RESULTS: As assessed by flow cytometry, stem cell-enriched CD34(+)/CD38(-)/CD123(+) leukemic cells expressed significantly higher levels of CD33 compared to normal CD34(+)/CD38(-) stem cells. Moreover, highly enriched leukemic CD34(+)/CD38(-) cells (>98% purity) displayed higher levels of CD33 mRNA. In chronic phase patients, CD33 was found to be expressed invariably on most or all stem cells, whereas in accelerated or blast phase of the disease, the levels of CD33 on stem cells varied from donor to donor. The MDR1 antigen, supposedly involved in resistance against ozogamicin, was not detectable on leukemic CD34(+)/CD38(-) cells. Correspondingly, gemtuzumab/ozogamicin produced growth inhibition in leukemic progenitor cells in all patients tested. The effects of gemtuzumab/ozogamicin were dose-dependent, occurred at low concentrations, and were accompanied by apoptosis in suspension culture. Moreover, the drug was found to inhibit growth of leukemic cells in a colony assay and long-term culture-initiating cell assay. Finally, gemtuzumab/ozogamicin was found to synergize with nilotinib and bosutinib in inducing growth inhibition in leukemic cells. CONCLUSIONS: CD33 is expressed abundantly on immature CD34(+)/CD38(-) stem cells and may serve as a stem cell target in chronic myeloid leukemia.","['Herrmann, Harald', 'Cerny-Reiterer, Sabine', 'Gleixner, Karoline V', 'Blatt, Katharina', 'Herndlhofer, Susanne', 'Rabitsch, Werner', 'Jager, Eva', 'Mitterbauer-Hohendanner, Gerlinde', 'Streubel, Berthold', 'Selzer, Edgar', 'Schwarzinger, Ilse', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Valent, Peter']","['Herrmann H', 'Cerny-Reiterer S', 'Gleixner KV', 'Blatt K', 'Herndlhofer S', 'Rabitsch W', 'Jager E', 'Mitterbauer-Hohendanner G', 'Streubel B', 'Selzer E', 'Schwarzinger I', 'Sperr WR', 'Valent P']","['Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111011,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aminoglycosides/*administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*administration & dosage', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Young Adult']",PMC3269481,2011/10/14 06:00,2012/09/20 06:00,['2011/10/14 06:00'],"['2011/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/20 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2010.035006 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2010.035006 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Feb;97(2):219-26. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2010.035006.

We investigated the effects of the flavonoid acacetin on human T cell leukemia Jurkat cells. Acacetin inhibited the proliferation of Jurkat cells by inducing apoptosis in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Acacetin-induced cell death was characterized by changes in nuclear and cell morphology. Treatment of Jurkat cells with acacetin also induced caspase-3, -8 and -9 activities in a time-dependent manner. Acacetin-induced apoptosis was blocked by a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, a caspase-3 inhibitor and a caspase-8 inhibitor, but not by a caspase-9 inhibitor. In addition, acacetin promoted the expression of FAF1, phosphor-FADD, Apaf-1 and cytochrome c. Acacetin-induced apoptosis was also accompanied by upregulation of Bax, and downregulation of Bcl-2. Taken together, these results suggest that acacetin may induce apoptosis in T cell leukemia cells, possibly by activating the Fas-mediated pathway.

MiR-101 has been reported down-regulated in various types of cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression profile of miR-101 and its target gene Mcl-1 in NSCLC and to assess their clinical significance. QRT-PCR was used in the detection of miR-101 and Mcl-1 mRNA expression both in NSCLC tissue and in adjacent normal lung tissue. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis were used in the detection of Mcl-1 protein expression. The clinicopathological implications of these molecules were analyzed statistically. Survival analysis was performed to assess prognostic significance. Down-regulation of miR-101 was associated with overexpression of Mcl-1 mRNA in NSCLC tissue when compared with corresponding normal tissue, with a negative correlation (r = -0.724, P < 0.01). MiR-101 expression was significantly associated with pathological stage (P = 0.004) and lymph node involvement (P = 0.012). Overexpression of Mcl-1 was associated with pathological grade (P = 0.022) and lymph node involvement (P = 0.017). A comparison of survival curves of low versus high expressers of miR-101 and Mcl-1 revealed a highly significant difference in NSCLC (P < 0.05), which suggests that reduced expression of miR-101 versus overexpression of Mcl-1 is associated with a poorer prognosis. Our results suggest that down-regulation of miR-101 may result in enhanced expression of Mcl-1 in NSCLC, which consequently favored tumor progression. MiR-101 and Mcl-1 may play important roles as biomarkers for prognosis and therapeutic targets in NSCLC.","['Luo, Liang', 'Zhang, Ting', 'Liu, Hongbing', 'Lv, Tangfeng', 'Yuan, Dongmei', 'Yao, Yanwen', 'Lv, Yanling', 'Song, Yong']","['Luo L', 'Zhang T', 'Liu H', 'Lv T', 'Yuan D', 'Yao Y', 'Lv Y', 'Song Y']","['Department of Respiratory Medicine, Jinling Hospital, Nanjing University School of Medicine, Nanjing 210002, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111013,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MIRN101 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lung Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcriptome']",,2011/10/14 06:00,2013/06/15 06:00,['2011/10/14 06:00'],"['2011/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-011-0085-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2012 Sep;29(3):1681-6. doi: 10.1007/s12032-011-0085-8.

Several studies have shown that imatinib inhibits the differentiation and activity of osteoclasts in vitro, whereas the effects of imatinib on osteoblast differentiation are less clear. In this study osteoblast differentiation was induced in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) by treatment with bone morphogenetic protein 2 in vitro. Imatinib inhibited proliferation of hMSCs in a dose-dependent manner. Even though imatinib promoted early osteoblast differentiation assessed by alkaline phosphate activity, mineralization measured by Alizarin Red staining (ARS) was reduced by imatinib. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of imatinib on mineralization was most prominent at low concentrations of imatinib. When we measured the relative mRNA expression levels of Runx2, we found that Runx2 expression was higher in imatinib-treated (5 muM) cultures at early time points during differentiation. On the other hand, the expression of Osterix late during differentiation was lower in imatinib-treated (5 muM) cultures, corresponding to the ARS results. Thus, the effect of imatinib on osteoblast differentiation is not only dependent on the drug concentration, but indeed also on the maturation stage of the cells. This finding might partly explain why previous studies on the effects of imatinib osteoblast differentiation have shown different results.","['Jonsson, Sofia', 'Hjorth-Hansen, Henrik', 'Olsson, Bob', 'Wadenvik, Hans', 'Sundan, Anders', 'Standal, Therese']","['Jonsson S', 'Hjorth-Hansen H', 'Olsson B', 'Wadenvik H', 'Sundan A', 'Standal T']","['Department of Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway. sofia.jonsson@vgregion.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111014,Japan,J Bone Miner Metab,Journal of bone and mineral metabolism,9436705,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology/*drug effects', 'Osteoblasts/*cytology/*drug effects', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",,2011/10/14 06:00,2012/05/15 06:00,['2011/10/14 06:00'],"['2011/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00774-011-0323-3 [doi]'],ppublish,J Bone Miner Metab. 2012 Jan;30(1):119-23. doi: 10.1007/s00774-011-0323-3.

Alongside this period of discovery has been the rapid development of targeted therapy and, here, we summarize results from clinical trials involving these small molecule Janus family of tyrosine kinase (JAK) inhibitors. RECENT FINDINGS: The JAK inhibitors consistently alleviate constitutional symptoms and reduce spleen size. Early phase testing indicates that some of these inhibitors have additional unique effects: INCB018424 results in a significant reduction in the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines; TG101348 may modify disease burden as assessed by JAK2 allele measurements; and CYT387 ameliorates anemia. SUMMARY: The initial enthusiasm for these agents has been tempered by recognition that JAK2 V617F may represent only one component of lesions driving the heterogeneity of the MPN. Clinical trial design cannot address important disease endpoints such as thrombosis or leukemia transformation, but it appears that JAK inhibitors will offer an important palliative option and because of the molecular complexity in these diseases, it might be rational to give these inhibitors along with other agents that target alternate mechanisms of the disease pathogenesis.","['Stein, Brady L', 'Crispino, John D', 'Moliterno, Alison R']","['Stein BL', 'Crispino JD', 'Moliterno AR']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA. bstein@nmff.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use']",,2011/10/14 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/10/14 06:00'],"['2011/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/CCO.0b013e32834d1b22 [doi]', '00001622-201111000-00009 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2011 Nov;23(6):609-16. doi: 10.1097/CCO.0b013e32834d1b22.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We compared the efficacy and safety of the combination of fludarabine and alemtuzumab with fludarabine monotherapy in previously treated patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. METHODS: Patients (aged >/= 18 years) with CLL Binet stage A, B, or C or Rai stages I-IV were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio according to a computer-generated allocation schedule to open-label combination treatment (fludarabine 30 mg/m(2) per day and alemtuzumab 30 mg per day on days 1-3) or monotherapy (fludarabine 25 mg/m(2) on days 1-5) by use of an interactive voice response system. Both regimens were given intravenously for a maximum of six 28-day cycles. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00086580. FINDINGS: Fludarabine plus alemtuzumab (n=168) resulted in better PFS than did fludarabine monotherapy (n=167; median 23.7 months [95% CI 19.2-28.4] vs 16.5 months [12.5-21.2]; hazard ratio 0.61 [95% CI 0.47-0.80]; p=0.0003) and overall survival (median not reached vs 52.9 months [40.9-not reached]; 0.65 [0.45-0.94]; p=0.021) compared with fludarabine alone. All-cause adverse events occurred in 161 (98%) of 164 patients in the combination treatment group and 149 (90%) of 165 in the fludarabine alone group. Patients in the fludarabine plus alemtuzumab group had more cytomegalovirus events (23 [14%] vs one [<1%]) and grade 1 or 2 potentially alemtuzumab infusion-related adverse reactions (102 [62%] vs 22 [13%]). Grade 3 or 4 toxicities in the combination treatment and monotherapy groups were leucopenia (121 [74%] of 164 vs 55 [34%] of 164), lymphopenia (149 [94%] of 158 vs 53 [33%] of 161), neutropenia (93 [59%] of 157 vs 110 [68%] of 161), thrombocytopenia (18 [11%] of 164 vs 27 [17%] of 163), and anaemia (14 [9%] of 163 vs 28 [17%] of 164). The incidence of serious adverse events was higher in the combination treatment group (54 [33%] of 164 vs 41 [25%] of 165); deaths due to adverse events were similar between the two groups (ten [6%] vs 12 [7%]).

Treatments included: rituximab in combination with etanercept, alemtuzumab, bendamustine or methylprednisolone alone, with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FCR), with oxaliplatin as well as fludarabine and cytarabine, with cyclophosphamide as well as fludarabine and alemtuzumab (CFAR), and with cytarabine, cisplatinum and dexamethasone (DHAP). One study evaluated rituximab with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in combination with alternating cyclophosphamide, liposomal daunorubicin, vincristine, dexamethasone and methotrexate plus Ara-C. One study evaluated rituximab as monotherapy. Of the nine studies considering overall response, eight reported rates above 50% (four reported rates above 75%). Median overall survival was 37 months for FCR, 11 months for CFAR, 20 months for rituximab with methylprednisolone, 30 months for rituximab with alemtuzumab and 44 months for an FCR/CFAR mixed treatment. The identified studies indicate that regimens containing rituximab may be highly efficacious in the fludarabine-refractory CLL setting.

In this study, following the identification of a full-length MuLV-ERV by in silico survey of the C57BL/6J mouse genome, its distribution in different mouse strains and expression characteristics were investigated. RESULTS: Application of a set of ERV mining protocols identified a MuLV-ERV locus with full coding potential on chromosome 8 (named ERVmch8). It appears that ERVmch8 shares the same genomic locus with a replication-incompetent MuLV-ERV, called Emv2; however, it was not confirmed due to a lack of relevant annotation and Emv2 sequence information. The ERVmch8 sequence was more prevalent in laboratory strains compared to wild-derived strains. Among 16 different tissues of ~12 week-old female C57BL/6J mice, brain homogenate was the only tissue with evident expression of ERVmch8. Further ERVmch8 expression analysis in six different brain compartments and four peripheral neuronal tissues of C57BL/6J mice revealed no significant expression except for the cerebellum in which the ERVmch8 locus' low methylation status was unique compared to the other brain compartments. The ERVmch8 locus was found to be surrounded by genes associated with neuronal development and/or inflammation. Interestingly, cerebellum-specific ERVmch8 expression was age-dependent with almost no expression at 2 weeks and a plateau at 6 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The ecotropic ERVmch8 locus on the C57BL/6J mouse genome was relatively undermethylated in the cerebellum, and its expression was cerebellum-specific and age-dependent.","['Lee, Kang-Hoon', 'Horiuchi, Makoto', 'Itoh, Takayuki', 'Greenhalgh, David G', 'Cho, Kiho']","['Lee KH', 'Horiuchi M', 'Itoh T', 'Greenhalgh DG', 'Cho K']","['Department of Surgery, University of California, Davis, Sacramento, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111012,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,['0 (Codon)'],IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cerebellum/*virology', 'Chromosomes, Mammalian/genetics/virology', 'Codon', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/classification/*genetics/*isolation & purification/physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/classification/*genetics/*isolation & purification/physiology', 'Mice/genetics/*virology', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Organ Specificity', 'Phylogeny', 'Virus Replication']",PMC3207890,2011/10/14 06:00,2012/01/31 06:00,['2011/10/14 06:00'],"['2011/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-8-82 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-8-82 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2011 Oct 12;8:82. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-8-82.,,,,['R01 GM071360/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,"['Retrovirology. 2012;9:23.

We wanted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new nonanthracycline regimen with trastuzumab. METHODS: We randomly assigned 3222 women with HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer to receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel every 3 weeks (AC-T), the same regimen plus 52 weeks of trastuzumab (AC-T plus trastuzumab), or docetaxel and carboplatin plus 52 weeks of trastuzumab (TCH). The primary study end point was disease-free survival. Secondary end points were overall survival and safety. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 65 months, 656 events triggered this protocol-specified analysis. The estimated disease-free survival rates at 5 years were 75% among patients receiving AC-T, 84% among those receiving AC-T plus trastuzumab, and 81% among those receiving TCH. Estimated rates of overall survival were 87%, 92%, and 91%, respectively. No significant differences in efficacy (disease-free or overall survival) were found between the two trastuzumab regimens, whereas both were superior to AC-T. The rates of congestive heart failure and cardiac dysfunction were significantly higher in the group receiving AC-T plus trastuzumab than in the TCH group (P<0.001). Eight cases of acute leukemia were reported: seven in the groups receiving the anthracycline-based regimens and one in the TCH group subsequent to receiving an anthracycline outside the study. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab significantly improved disease-free and overall survival among women with HER2-positive breast cancer. The risk-benefit ratio favored the nonanthracycline TCH regimen over AC-T plus trastuzumab, given its similar efficacy, fewer acute toxic effects, and lower risks of cardiotoxicity and leukemia.

The physiological consequence of ABCG2 multidrug transport activity in leukaemia, and some solid tumours is the acquisition of cancer multidrug resistance. ABCG2 has a primary structure that infers that a minimal functional transporting unit would be a homodimer. Here we investigated the ability of a bimolecular fluorescence complementation approach to examine ABCG2 dimers, and to probe the role of individual amino acid substitutions in dimer formation. ABCG2 was tagged with fragments of venus fluorescent protein (vYFP), and this tagging did not perturb trafficking or function. Co-expression of two proteins bearing N-terminal and C-terminal fragments of YFP resulted in their association and detection of dimerization by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Point mutations in ABCG2 which may affect dimer formation were examined for alterations in the magnitude of fluorescence complementation signal. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) demonstrated specific ABCG2 dimer formation, but no changes in dimer formation, resulting from single amino acid substitutions, were detected by BiFC analysis.","['Haider, Ameena J', 'Briggs, Deborah', 'Self, Tim J', 'Chilvers, Hannah L', 'Holliday, Nicholas D', 'Kerr, Ian D']","['Haider AJ', 'Briggs D', 'Self TJ', 'Chilvers HL', 'Holliday ND', 'Kerr ID']","['School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111003,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (yellow fluorescent protein, Bacteria)']",IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Bacterial Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Fluorescence', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Luminescent Measurements/*methods', 'Luminescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism', '*Protein Multimerization', 'Protein Structure, Quaternary', 'Protein Transport']",PMC3185054,2011/10/13 06:00,2012/02/07 06:00,['2011/10/13 06:00'],"['2011/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0025818 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-12448 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(10):e25818. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0025818.

Causal role of MCPyV for this rare and aggressive skin cancer is suggested by monoclonal integration and truncation of large T (LT) viral antigen in MCC cells. The mutated MCPyV has recently been found in highly purified leukemic cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), suggesting a pathogenic role also in CLL. About 50-80% of adults display MCPyV-specific antibodies. The humoral immunity does not protect against the development of MCC, as neutralizing MCPyV antibodies occur in higher levels among MCC patients than healthy controls. Impaired T-cell immunity has been linked with aggressive MCC behavior. Therefore, cellular immunity appears to be important in MCPyV infection surveillance. In order to elucidate the role of MCPyV-specific Th-cell immunity, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of healthy adults were stimulated with MCPyV VP1 virus-like particles (VLPs), using human bocavirus (HBoV) VLPs and Candida albicans antigen as positive controls. Proliferation, IFN-gamma, IL-13 and IL-10 responses were examined in 15 MCPyV-seropositive and 15 seronegative volunteers. With the MCPyV antigen, significantly stronger Th-cell responses were found in MCPyV-seropositive than MCPyV-seronegative subjects, whereas with the control antigens, the responses were statistically similar. The most readily detectable cytokine was IFN-gamma. The MCPyV antigen tended to induce stronger IFN-gamma responses than HBoV VLP antigen. Taken together, MCPyV-specific Th-cells elicit vigorous IFN-gamma responses. IFN-gamma being a cytokine with major antiviral and tumor suppressing functions, Th-cells are suggested to be important mediators of MCPyV-specific immune surveillance.","['Kumar, Arun', 'Chen, Tingting', 'Pakkanen, Sari', 'Kantele, Anu', 'Soderlund-Venermo, Maria', 'Hedman, Klaus', 'Franssila, Rauli']","['Kumar A', 'Chen T', 'Pakkanen S', 'Kantele A', 'Soderlund-Venermo M', 'Hedman K', 'Franssila R']","['Departments of Virology, Haartman Institute, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland. arun.kumar@helsinki.fi']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111003,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-13)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antibody Specificity/immunology', 'Antigens, Viral/immunology', 'Candida albicans/immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytokines/*immunology', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Human bocavirus/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/immunology', 'Interleukin-10/immunology', 'Interleukin-13/immunology', 'Merkel cell polyomavirus/*immunology/ultrastructure', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombination, Genetic/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*cytology/*immunology/virology', 'Virion/*immunology/ultrastructure']",PMC3185038,2011/10/13 06:00,2012/02/07 06:00,['2011/10/13 06:00'],"['2011/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0025751 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-13117 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(10):e25751. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0025751.

In this study, we postulated that adipocytes and lipids could be involved in the progression of CML. To test this hypothesis, adipocytes were co-cultured with two BCR-ABL positive cell lines (PCMDS and K562). T cell (Jurkat) and stroma cell (HS-5) lines were used as controls. In the second set of experiments, leukemic cell lines were treated with stearic, oleic, linoleic or alpha-linolenic acids in presence or absence of leptin. Survival, proliferation, leptin production, OB-R isoforms (OB-Ra and OB-Rb), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3k) and BCL-2 expression have been tested after 24h, 48h and 72h of treatment. Our results showed that adipocytes induced a decrease of CML proliferation and an increase in lipid accumulation in leukemic cells. In addition, CML cell lines induced adipocytes cell death. Chromatography analysis showed that BM microenvironment cells were full of saturated (SFA) and monounsaturated (MUFA) fatty acids, fatty acids that protect tumor cells against external agents. Stearic acid increased Bcl-2 expression in PCMDS, whereas oleic and linoleic acids had no effects. In contrast, alpha-linolenic acid decreased the proliferation and the survival of CML cell lines as well as BCL-2 and OB-R expression. The effect of alpha-linolenic acids seemed to be due to PI3K pathway and Bcl-2 inhibition. Leptin production was detected in the co-culture medium. In the presence of leptin, the effect of alpha-linolenic acid on proliferation, survival, OB-R and BCl-2 expression was reduced.","['Beaulieu, Aurore', 'Poncin, Geraldine', 'Belaid-Choucair, Zakia', 'Humblet, Chantal', 'Bogdanovic, Gordana', 'Lognay, Georges', 'Boniver, Jacques', 'Defresne, Marie-Paule']","['Beaulieu A', 'Poncin G', 'Belaid-Choucair Z', 'Humblet C', 'Bogdanovic G', 'Lognay G', 'Boniver J', 'Defresne MP']","['Department of Cytology, Histology and Pathological Anatomy (Giga-R), University of Liege, Liege, Belgium. abeaulieu@ulg.ac.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111003,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Leptin)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Leptin)', '0RBV727H71 (alpha-Linolenic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Adipocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Communication/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Culture Media/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leptin/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Lipid Metabolism/drug effects', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Receptors, Leptin/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'alpha-Linolenic Acid/*pharmacology']",PMC3185037,2011/10/13 06:00,2012/02/07 06:00,['2011/10/13 06:00'],"['2011/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0025651 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-11041 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(10):e25651. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0025651.

However, mutations could be present below the detection limit of conventional direct sequencing. We developed a sensitive, multiplexed mass spectrometry assay (detection limit, 0.05% to 0.5%) to determine the impact of low-level mutations after imatinib treatment has failed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Mutation status was assessed in 220 patients treated with nilotinib or dasatinib after they experienced resistance to imatinib. RESULTS: Mutations were detected by sequencing in 128 patients before commencing nilotinib or dasatinib therapy (switchover). In 64 patients, 132 additional low-level mutations were detected by mass spectrometry alone (50 of 132 mutations were resistant to nilotinib and/or dasatinib). When patients received the inhibitor for which the mutation confers resistance, 84% of the low-level resistant mutations rapidly became dominant clones detectable by sequencing, including 11 of 12 T315I mutations. Subsequent complete cytogenetic response rates were lower for patients with resistant mutations at switchover detected by sequencing (0%) or mass spectrometry alone (16%) compared with patients with other mutations or no mutations (41% and 49%, respectively; P < .001). Failure-free survival among the 100 patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia when resistant mutations were detected at switchover by sequencing or mass spectrometry alone was 0% and 0% compared with 51% and 45% for patients with other mutations or no mutations (P = .003). CONCLUSION: Detection of low-level mutations after imatinib resistance offers critical information to guide subsequent therapy selection. If an inappropriate kinase inhibitor is selected, there is a high risk of treatment failure with clonal expansion of the resistant mutant.","['Parker, Wendy T', 'Lawrence, Rebecca M', 'Ho, Musei', 'Irwin, Darryl L', 'Scott, Hamish S', 'Hughes, Timothy P', 'Branford, Susan']","['Parker WT', 'Lawrence RM', 'Ho M', 'Irwin DL', 'Scott HS', 'Hughes TP', 'Branford S']","['SA Pathology, IMVS, e Rd, PO Box 14 Rundle Mall, Adelaide, SA, 5000, Australia. wendy.parker@health.sa.gov.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111011,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Mass Spectrometry', '*Mutation', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2011/10/13 06:00,2011/12/23 06:00,['2011/10/13 06:00'],"['2011/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/23 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.35.0934 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.35.0934 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Nov 10;29(32):4250-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.35.0934.

It is unknown whether these definitions apply to patients treated with second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred sixty-seven patients with newly diagnosed chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in chronic phase were treated with second-generation TKIs in phase II trials (nilotinib, 81; dasatinib, 86). Median follow-up was 33 months. Event-free survival (EFS) was measured from the start of treatment to the date of loss of complete hematologic response, loss of complete or major cytogenetic response, discontinuation of therapy for toxicity or lack of efficacy, progression to accelerated or blastic phases, or death at any time. RESULTS: Overall, 155 patients (93%) achieved complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), including 146 (87%) with major molecular response (MMR; complete in 46 patients [28%]). According to the ELN definitions, the rates of suboptimal response were 0%, 2%, 1%, and 12% at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months of therapy, respectively. There was no difference in EFS and CCyR duration between patients who achieved CCyR with and without MMR across all the landmark times of 3, 6, 12, and 18 months. CONCLUSION: The use of second-generation TKIs as initial therapy in CML induces high rates of CCyR at early time points. The ELN definitions of response proposed for imatinib therapy are not applicable in this setting. We propose that achievement of CCyR and partial cytogenetic response at 3 months should be considered optimal and suboptimal responses, respectively. The achievement of MMR offered no advantage over CCyR in defining long-term outcome in patients with newly diagnosed CML treated with second-generation TKIs.","['Jabbour, Elias', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Shan, Jianqin', 'Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Rios, Mary Beth', 'Cortes, Jorge E']","['Jabbour E', 'Kantarjian HM', ""O'Brien S"", 'Shan J', 'Quintas-Cardama A', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Rios MB', 'Cortes JE']","['University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Box 428, Houston, TX 77030, USA. ejabbour@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20111011,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",PMC3221527,2011/10/13 06:00,2011/12/23 06:00,['2011/10/13 06:00'],"['2011/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/23 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.36.0693 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.36.0693 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Nov 10;29(32):4260-5. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.36.0693.

The transcription factor Tal1 is involved in the establishment of hematopoietic stem cells in the embryo and is a master regulator of hematopoietic gene expression in the adult. Here, we show that Tal1 is expressed in osteoclasts and that loss of Tal1 in osteoclast progenitors leads to altered expression of >1200 genes. We found that DC-STAMP, a key regulator of osteoclast cell fusion, is a direct target gene of Tal1 and show that Tal1 represses DC-STAMP expression by counteracting the activating function of the transcription factors PU.1 and MITF. The identification of Tal1 as a factor involved in cell fusion contributes to the understanding of osteoclast-associated diseases, including osteoporosis.","['Courtial, Nadine', 'Smink, Jeske J', 'Kuvardina, Olga N', 'Leutz, Achim', 'Gothert, Joachim R', 'Lausen, Jorn']","['Courtial N', 'Smink JJ', 'Kuvardina ON', 'Leutz A', 'Gothert JR', 'Lausen J']","['Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Biomedical Research, Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111011,United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DC-STAMP protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor)', '0 (Mitf protein, mouse)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Bone Remodeling', 'Bone and Bones/cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Membrane Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Osteoclasts/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism']",,2011/10/13 06:00,2012/04/10 06:00,['2011/10/13 06:00'],"['2011/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['fj.11-190850 [pii]', '10.1096/fj.11-190850 [doi]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2012 Feb;26(2):523-32. doi: 10.1096/fj.11-190850.

In addition, SET is a potent inhibitior of the phosphatase PP2A. Previously, we proposed a model in which the small GTPase Rac1 recruits SET from the nucleus to the plasma membrane to promote cell migration. This event represents an entirely novel concept in the field of cell migration. Now, fluorescent versions of the SET protein are generated to analyze its nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling in live cells. Our studies showed that under steady-state conditions a fraction of the SET protein, which is primarily localized in the nucleus, translocates to the cytosol in an apparently random fashion. SET exiting the nucleus was also seen in spreading as well as dividing cells. We designed an image analysis method to quantify the frequency of nuclear exit of the SET proteins, based on 4D confocal imaging. This straightforward method was validated by analysis of SET wild-type and mutant proteins. This showed that the frequency of nuclear exit of a Ser-9 phosphomimetic mutant (S9E) is enhanced compared to wild-type SET or a S9A mutant. Thus, we have developed a novel method to analyze the nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of the proto-oncogene SET dynamics in live cells. This method will also be applicable to monitor dynamic localization of other nuclear and/or cytoplasmic signaling proteins.","['Lam, B Daniel', 'Anthony, Eloise C', 'Hordijk, Peter L']","['Lam BD', 'Anthony EC', 'Hordijk PL']","['Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Sanquin Research and Landsteiner Laboratory, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20111011,United States,Cytometry A,Cytometry.

However, its gradual advancement toward increasing numbers of fluorescent parameters leads to information rich datasets, which are challenging to analyze by standard gating and do not reflect the multidimensionality of the data. We have developed a novel method to analyze complex flow cytometry data, based on hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) but with a new underlying algorithm, using Mahalanobis distance measure. HCA is scalable to analyze complex multiparameter datasets (here demonstrated on up to 12 color flow cytometry and on a 20-parameter synthetic dataset). We have validated this method by comparison with standard gating approaches when performed independently by expert cytometrists. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia blast populations were analyzed in diagnostic and follow-up datasets (n = 123) from three centers. HCA results correlated very well (Passing-Bablok correlation coefficient = 0.992, slope = 1, intercept = -0.01) with standard gating data obtained by the I-BFM FLOW-MRD study group. To further improve the performance in follow-up samples with low MRD levels and to automate MRD detection, we combined HCA with support vector machine (SVM) learning. HCA in combination with SVM provides a novel diagnostic tool that not only allows analysis of increasingly complex flow cytometry data but also is less observer-dependent compared with classical gating and has potential for automation.","['Fiser, Karel', 'Sieger, Tomas', 'Schumich, Angela', 'Wood, Brent', 'Irving, Julie', 'Mejstrikova, Ester', 'Dworzak, Michael N']","['Fiser K', 'Sieger T', 'Schumich A', 'Wood B', 'Irving J', 'Mejstrikova E', 'Dworzak MN']","['Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle, United Kingdom. karel.fiser@lfmotol.cuni.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20111011,United States,Cytometry A,Cytometry.

Hence, we conducted a meta-analysis aiming to summarize current evidence and quantify any tentative impact. PROCEDURE: We retrieved one cohort (553 leukemias compared to 1,440,542 children), 20 case-control studies and also analyzed the updated Greek case-control dataset with unpublished data, yielding in total 11,092 cases and 25,221 controls. RESULTS: Odds ratios reported in the studies included ranged from 0.70 to 2.20 for acute lymphocytic (ALL) and from 0.60 to 2.17 for acute myelocytic leukemia (AML). The combined effect regarding the association of maternal smoking (any vs. no) and leukemia risk was 1.03 for ALL (95% CI = 0.95-1.12, random effects model) and 0.99 for AML (95% CI = 0.90-1.09, fixed effects model). The results remained unchanged when sensitivity analyses were undertaken of studies reporting same maternal smoking periods, those focusing only on childhood leukemia deaths or investigations which did not clearly define AML subtype. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the meta-analysis challenge the limits of traditional epidemiology to provide sound inferences when point estimates of constituent studies range around the null. In particular, this study provides no support to a hypothesis linking maternal smoking during pregnancy with subsequent development of main childhood leukemia subtypes. Further investigations employing molecular and genetic epidemiology, however, might be needed in the hope to reveal even minimal risks pertaining individuals with specific susceptibility to tobacco compounds who sustain high environmental exposures prenatally or postnatally.","['Klimentopoulou, Alexandra', 'Antonopoulos, Constantine N', 'Papadopoulou, Charalampia', 'Kanavidis, Prodromos', 'Tourvas, Aristomenis-Dimitrios', 'Polychronopoulou, Sofia', 'Baka, Margarita', 'Athanasiadou-Piperopoulou, Fani', 'Kalmanti, Maria', 'Sidi, Vassiliki', 'Moschovi, Maria', 'Petridou, Eleni Th']","['Klimentopoulou A', 'Antonopoulos CN', 'Papadopoulou C', 'Kanavidis P', 'Tourvas AD', 'Polychronopoulou S', 'Baka M', 'Athanasiadou-Piperopoulou F', 'Kalmanti M', 'Sidi V', 'Moschovi M', 'Petridou ET']","['Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Medical School, 75 M.

RESULTS: A 45-year-old woman with acute myeloid leukemia presented with progressive headache, somnolence, and hemiparesis. She was noted to be thrombocytopenic. CT scan revealed a heterodense extra-axial lesion consistent with an acute to subacute subdural hematoma. There was no antecedent trauma. After platelet transfusion, she was taken for burr hole evacuation and an opalescent pearly white mass was encountered. Pathology revealed myeloid sarcoma.

In 2008, The International Committee for Standardization in Hematology recommended the use of two types of slides for the microscopic evaluation of bone marrow: wedge-spread film and crush film slides. Because these techniques have not yet been compared, we performed such a comparison. Routine bone marrow samples from 250 patients diagnosed due to different neoplastic haematological disorders were evaluated. The major differences between the two compared techniques were identified in 13 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, seven patients with systemic mastocytosis and 11 patients with acute leukaemias or myelodysplastic syndromes or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia. Differences were noted also in many patients with multiple myeloma, but the clinical significance of these discrepancies was rather modest. The major causes of the differences observed seemed to be the dilution of marrow with blood cells and the focal growth of many neoplastic cells. We believe that the crush technique is more advantageous compared to the wedge-spread films. Therefore, we recommend the use of crush films as the primary method for establishing a diagnosis or for making therapeutic decisions based on the microscopic examination of bone marrow.","['Lewandowski, Krzysztof', 'Complak, Agnieszka', 'Hellmann, Andrzej']","['Lewandowski K', 'Complak A', 'Hellmann A']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry and Biochemistry, Medical University of Gdansk, Debinki St 7, 80-952 Gdansk, Poland. klewa@gd.home.pl']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20111012,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Cytological Techniques/instrumentation/*methods/*standards', 'Hematologic Diseases/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Hematology/instrumentation/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/pathology', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/pathology', 'Microscopy/instrumentation/*methods', 'Multiple Myeloma/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/pathology']",PMC3294213,2011/10/13 06:00,2012/05/11 06:00,['2011/10/13 06:00'],"['2011/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-011-1347-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2012 Apr;91(4):497-505. doi: 10.1007/s00277-011-1347-4.

Even though primary human AML cells may affect Th17 development through their constitutive cytokine release, the levels of circulating Th17 cells in older patients with untreated AML do not differ from healthy controls and show only minor variations during and following conventional intensive chemotherapy. IL17-A is the signature cytokine of Th17 cells, but in vitro studies have failed to demonstrate a direct antileukemic effect of IL17 on primary human AML cells for most patient samples. However, several observations suggest that Th17 cells mediate antileukemic effects through other mechanisms and are important in allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Firstly, genetic variants in IL23/Th17 pathway have a prognostic impact with regard to both development of GVHD and posttransplant infections. Secondly, circulating IL17-secreting cells are detected during early posttransplant pancytopenia, and their ability to release IL17 is associated with later GVHD. Thirdly, a high number of Th17 cells in allogeneic stem cell grafts are associated with later acute GVHD, levels of circulating Th17 cells are increased at the onset of acute GVHD, and these levels normalize during treatment. In the present article, we review previous studies of Th17 cells in AML and in the development of GVHD, possible therapeutic strategies and available therapeutic tools for targeting of Th17 cells.","['Ersvaer, Elisabeth', 'Melve, Guro Kristin', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Ersvaer E', 'Melve GK', 'Bruserud O']","['Division for Hematology, Institute of Internal Medicine, University of Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20111012,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/*surgery', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'Th17 Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2011/10/13 06:00,2012/01/04 06:00,['2011/10/13 06:00'],"['2011/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-011-1118-z [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2011 Dec;60(12):1669-81. doi: 10.1007/s00262-011-1118-z.

In patients at high-risk for developing PA bloodstream infections, the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is the main reservoir for colonization, but the mechanisms by which PA transitions from an asymptomatic colonizing microbe to an invasive, and often deadly, pathogen are unclear. Previously, we performed in vivo transcription profiling experiments by recovering PA mRNA from bacterial cells residing in the cecums of colonized mice in order to identify changes in bacterial gene expression during alterations to the host's immune status. As with any transcription profiling experiment, the rate-limiting step is in the isolation of sufficient amounts of high quality mRNA. Given the abundance of enzymes, debris, food residues, and particulate matter in the GI tract, the challenge of RNA isolation is daunting. Here, we present a method for reliable and reproducible isolation of bacterial RNA recovered from the murine GI tract. This method utilizes a well-established murine model of PA GI colonization and neutropenia-induced dissemination. Once GI colonization with PA is confirmed, mice are euthanized and cecal contents are recovered and flash frozen. RNA is then extracted using a combination of mechanical disruption, boiling, phenol/chloroform extractions, DNase treatment, and affinity chromatography. Quantity and purity are confirmed by spectrophotometry (Nanodrop Technologies) and bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) (Fig 1). This method of GI microbial RNA isolation can easily be adapted to other bacteria and fungi as well.","['Lopez-Medina, Eduardo', 'Neubauer, Megan M', 'Pier, Gerald B', 'Koh, Andrew Y']","['Lopez-Medina E', 'Neubauer MM', 'Pier GB', 'Koh AY']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Video-Audio Media']",20110928,United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,"['0 (RNA, Bacterial)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cecum/*microbiology', 'Chromatography, Affinity/methods', 'Female', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa/chemistry/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'RNA, Bacterial/*isolation & purification']",PMC3230207,2011/10/13 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/10/13 06:00'],"['2011/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['3293 [pii]', '10.3791/3293 [doi]']",epublish,J Vis Exp. 2011 Sep 28;(55). pii: 3293. doi: 10.3791/3293.,,,,"['K08 AI062983/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI022535/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI22535/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI62983/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

As these tissues are naturally connected through the immune system, a disease affecting one of them will often affect the others as well. The hematological malignancies include; Leukemia, Lymphoma, Multiple myeloma. Among them, leukemia is a serious malignancy that starts in blood tissues especially the bone marrow, where the blood is made. Researches show, leukemia is one of the common cancers in the world. So, the emphasis on diagnostic techniques and best treatments would be able to provide better prognosis and survival for patients. In this paper, an automatic diagnosis recommender system for classifying leukemia based on cooperative game is presented. Through out this research, we analyze the flow cytometry data toward the classification of leukemia into eight classes. We work on real data set from different types of leukemia that have been collected at Iran Blood Transfusion Organization (IBTO). Generally, the data set contains 400 samples taken from human leukemic bone marrow. This study deals with cooperative game used for classification according to different weights assigned to the markers. The proposed method is versatile as there are no constraints to what the input or output represent. This means that it can be used to classify a population according to their contributions. In other words, it applies equally to other groups of data. The experimental results show the accuracy rate of 93.12%, for classification and compared to decision tree (C4.5) with (90.16%) in accuracy. The result demonstrates that cooperative game is very promising to be used directly for classification of leukemia as a part of Active Medical decision support system for interpretation of flow cytometry readout. This system could assist clinical hematologists to properly recognize different kinds of leukemia by preparing suggestions and this could improve the treatment of leukemic patients.","['Torkaman, Atefeh', 'Charkari, Nasrollah Moghaddam', 'Aghaeipour, Mahnaz']","['Torkaman A', 'Charkari NM', 'Aghaeipour M']","['Department of Information Technology, Tarbiat Modarres University, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Anal Cell Pathol (Amst),Analytical cellular pathology (Amsterdam),101541993,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', '*Decision Support Techniques', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Game Theory', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Leukemia/*classification/diagnosis/immunology/therapy', 'Prognosis', '*Terminology as Topic']",PMC4605502,2011/10/13 06:00,2012/01/27 06:00,['2011/10/13 06:00'],"['2011/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['80721706684G4110 [pii]', '10.3233/ACP-2011-0016 [doi]']",ppublish,Anal Cell Pathol (Amst). 2011;34(5):235-46. doi: 10.3233/ACP-2011-0016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Traditional measures of treatment efficacy such as leukaemia-free survival and cumulative incidence are unable to cope with multiple events in time, e.g. disease remissions or progressions, and as such are inappropriate for the efficacy assessment of the recent CML treatment. METHODS: Standard nonparametric statistical methods are used for estimating two principal characteristics of the current CML treatment: the probability of being alive and leukaemia-free in time after CML therapy initiation, denoted as the current cumulative incidence of leukaemia-free patients; and the probability that a patient is alive and in any leukaemia-free period in time after achieving the first leukaemia-free period on the CML treatment, denoted as the current leukaemia-free survival. The validity of the proposed methods is further documented in the data of the Czech CML patients consecutively recorded between July 2003 and July 2009 as well as in simulated data. RESULTS: The results have shown a difference between the estimates of the current cumulative incidence function and the common cumulative incidence of leukaemia-free patients, as well as between the estimates of the current leukaemia-free survival and the common leukaemia-free survival. Regarding the currently available follow-up period, both differences have reached the maximum (12.8% and 20.8%, respectively) at 3 years after the start of follow-up, i.e. after the CML therapy initiation in the former case and after the first achievement of the disease remission in the latter. CONCLUSIONS: Two quantities for the evaluation of the efficacy of current CML therapy that may be estimated with standard nonparametric methods have been proposed in this paper. Both quantities reliably illustrate a patient's disease status in time because they account for the proportion of patients in the second and subsequent disease remissions. Moreover, the model is also applicable in the future, regardless of what the progress in the CML treatment will be and how many treatment options will be available, respectively.","['Pavlik, Tomas', 'Janousova, Eva', 'Pospisil, Zdenek', 'Muzik, Jan', 'Zackova, Daniela', 'Racil, Zdenek', 'Klamova, Hana', 'Cetkovsky, Petr', 'Trneny, Marek', 'Mayer, Jiri', 'Dusek, Ladislav']","['Pavlik T', 'Janousova E', 'Pospisil Z', 'Muzik J', 'Zackova D', 'Racil Z', 'Klamova H', 'Cetkovsky P', 'Trneny M', 'Mayer J', 'Dusek L']","['Institute of Biostatistics and Analyses, Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111011,England,BMC Med Res Methodol,BMC medical research methodology,100968545,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Computer Simulation', 'Czech Republic/epidemiology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Statistical', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Prevalence', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Young Adult']",PMC3224477,2011/10/13 06:00,2012/01/19 06:00,['2011/10/13 06:00'],"['2011/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2288-11-140 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2288-11-140 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Med Res Methodol. 2011 Oct 11;11:140. doi: 10.1186/1471-2288-11-140.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study sought to assess their relative cost-effectiveness. DESIGN AND METHODS: The authors developed a cost-effectiveness Markov model (1-month cycles) tracking hypothetical cohorts of MDS patients treated with azacitidine or decitabine over 2 years. The model used a US payer perspective and 2009 costs. Health states modeled included MDS with Transfusion Dependence, MDS with Transfusion Independence, Progression to Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML), and Death. Incremental cost-effectiveness outcomes included cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), cost per life year (LY), cost per patient-month of transfusion independence, and cost per case of AML progression avoided. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed on key model parameters. RESULTS: Compared to decitabine, azacitidine was associated with better survival (1.512 LYs vs 1.292), more QALYs gained (1.041 vs 0.870), more patient-months with transfusion independence (8.328 vs 6.224), and a greater proportion of patients avoiding progression to AML (50.9% vs 28.5%). Total per-patient costs over 2 years for azacitidine were lower than for decitabine ($150,322 vs $166, 212). LIMITATIONS: To inform and update the model over time, it will be important that randomized or observational clinical studies be conducted to directly compare azacitidine and decitabine, provide new information on how these medicines are used, and on their relative clinical effectiveness. CONCLUSION: Results demonstrate that azacitidine provides greater clinical benefit and costs less than decitabine across all key outcomes. These results accentuate the positive role of azacitidine in providing cost-effective care for MDS.","['Gidwani, Risha', 'Khan, Zeba M', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Beach, C L', 'Pashos, Chris L']","['Gidwani R', 'Khan ZM', 'Fenaux P', 'Beach CL', 'Pashos CL']","['United BioSource Corporation, Lexington, MA 02420, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111104,England,J Med Econ,Journal of medical economics,9892255,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Decitabine', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care/*economics', 'United States']",,2011/10/13 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2011/10/13 06:00'],"['2011/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3111/13696998.2011.631067 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Econ. 2012;15(1):145-54. doi: 10.3111/13696998.2011.631067.

The Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study (NCCLS) is the only epidemiological study known to address whether contact current may confound the reported association between residential magnetic fields and childhood leukemia. The study contributed contact voltage and magnetic-field data for over 500 residences of leukemia cases and control children. We combined these data with the results of previous measurement studies of contact voltage in other communities to conduct an analysis of the relationship of magnetic fields with contact voltage for a total sample of 702 residences. The Spearman correlation of magnetic field with contact voltage was 0.29 (Spearman, P < 0.0001). Magnetic-field and contact voltage data were both divided into tertiles, with an upper magnetic-field cutpoint of 0.3 muT suggested by values used in epidemiological results and an upper contact voltage cutpoint of 60 mV based on dosimetric considerations. Expressed as an exposure odds ratios (EOR), we report an association of contact voltage with magnetic fields of 15.1 (95% CI 3.6-61) as well as a statistically significant positive trend across magnetic-field strata (EOR of 4.2 per stratum with 95% CI 2.4-7.4). The associations appear to be large enough to support the possibility that contact current could be responsible for the association of childhood leukemia with magnetic fields.","['Kavet, R', 'Hooper, C', 'Buffler, P', 'Does, M']","['Kavet R', 'Hooper C', 'Buffler P', 'Does M']","['Electric Power Research Institute, Palo Alto, California 94304, USA. rkavet@epri.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111012,United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', '*Electric Conductivity/adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects/*analysis', '*Housing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/etiology', '*Magnetic Fields']",,2011/10/13 06:00,2012/01/27 06:00,['2011/10/13 06:00'],"['2011/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1667/RR2719.1 [pii]', '10.1667/rr2719.1 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiat Res. 2011 Dec;176(6):807-15. doi: 10.1667/rr2719.1.

In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms for BMME-mediated drug resistance and BM lodgment in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Gene-expression profile as well as signal pathway and protein analyses revealed that galectin-3 (Gal-3), a member of the beta-gal-binding galectin family of proteins, was specifically induced by coculture with HS-5 cells, a BM stroma cell-derived cell line, in all five CML cell lines examined. It was also found that primary CML cells expressed high levels of Gal-3 in BM. Enforced expression of Gal-3 activated Akt and Erk, induced accumulation of Mcl-1, and promoted in vitro cell proliferation, multidrug resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors for Bcr-Abl and genotoxic agents as a result of impaired apoptosis induction, and chemotactic cell migration to HS-5-derived soluble factors in CML cell lines independently of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase. The conditioned medium from Gal-3-overexpressing CML cells promoted in vitro cell proliferation of CML cells and HS-5 cells more than did the conditioned medium from parental cells. Moreover, the in vivo study in a mice transplantation model showed that Gal-3 overexpression promoted the long-term BM lodgment of CML cells. These results demonstrate that leukemia microenvironment-specific Gal-3 expression supports molecular signaling pathways for disease maintenance in BM and resistance to therapy in CML. They also suggest that Gal-3 may be a candidate therapeutic target to help overcome BMME-mediated therapeutic resistance.","['Yamamoto-Sugitani, Mio', 'Kuroda, Junya', 'Ashihara, Eishi', 'Nagoshi, Hisao', 'Kobayashi, Tsutomu', 'Matsumoto, Yosuke', 'Sasaki, Nana', 'Shimura, Yuji', 'Kiyota, Miki', 'Nakayama, Ryuko', 'Akaji, Kenichi', 'Taki, Tomohiko', 'Uoshima, Nobuhiko', 'Kobayashi, Yutaka', 'Horiike, Shigeo', 'Maekawa, Taira', 'Taniwaki, Masafumi']","['Yamamoto-Sugitani M', 'Kuroda J', 'Ashihara E', 'Nagoshi H', 'Kobayashi T', 'Matsumoto Y', 'Sasaki N', 'Shimura Y', 'Kiyota M', 'Nakayama R', 'Akaji K', 'Taki T', 'Uoshima N', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Horiike S', 'Maekawa T', 'Taniwaki M']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto 602-8566, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111010,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Galectin 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics/physiology', 'Galectin 3/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Microenvironment/genetics/physiology']",PMC3198366,2011/10/12 06:00,2011/12/31 06:00,['2011/10/12 06:00'],"['2011/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/31 06:00 [medline]']","['1111138108 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1111138108 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Oct 18;108(42):17468-73. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1111138108.

METHODS: All cases of lacrimal gland lymphoma from January 1, 1975, through December 31, 2009, were retrieved from The Danish Registry of Pathology. Histologic specimens were reevaluated using a panel of monoclonal antibodies. Clinical files from all patients with confirmed lymphoma were collected. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients with lacrimal gland lymphoma were identified. Eight of the patients were men and 19 were women; the median (range) age was 69 (43-87) years. The distribution of lymphoma subtypes was as follows: extranodal marginal zone lymphoma, 10 (37%); follicular lymphoma, 5 (19%); diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 4 (15%); mantle cell lymphoma, 3 (11%); chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphatic lymphoma, 2 (7%); and unclassified B-cell lymphoma, 3 (11%). Twenty-two patients (81%) had stage I or II lymphoma, 1 patient (4%) had stage III lymphoma, and 4 patients (15%) had stage IV lymphoma. Patients with stage I or II lymphoma were treated with radiotherapy (15 [67%]), chemotherapy (3 [14%]), chemotherapy plus radiotherapy (1 [5%]), and surgery (3 [14%]). Patients presenting with stage III or IV lymphoma were treated with chemotherapy alone. Complete remission was observed in 23 of the patients (85%), although 12 (44%) of these had a relapse, independent of subtype, stage, or treatment. The 5-year overall survival was 70%. CONCLUSIONS: Malignant lymphoma of the lacrimal gland is relatively rare and is mostly prevalent in elderly women. The distribution of lacrimal gland lymphoma subtypes resembles that of lymphoma subtypes of the salivary glands. The majority of lacrimal gland lymphomas are low grade, and the prognosis is relatively good.","['Rasmussen, Peter', 'Ralfkiaer, Elisabeth', 'Prause, Jan Ulrik', 'Sjo, Lene D', 'Siersma, Volkert D', 'Heegaard, Steffen']","['Rasmussen P', 'Ralfkiaer E', 'Prause JU', 'Sjo LD', 'Siersma VD', 'Heegaard S']","['Department of Neuroscience and Pharmacology, Section of Eye Pathology, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Arch Ophthalmol,"Archives of ophthalmology (Chicago, Ill. : 1960)",7706534,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Eye Neoplasms/epidemiology/*pathology/therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lacrimal Apparatus Diseases/epidemiology/*pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/epidemiology/*pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/epidemiology/*pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/epidemiology/*pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/epidemiology/*pathology/therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Registries', 'Survival Rate', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",,2011/10/12 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/10/12 06:00'],"['2011/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['129/10/1275 [pii]', '10.1001/archophthalmol.2011.270 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Ophthalmol. 2011 Oct;129(10):1275-80. doi: 10.1001/archophthalmol.2011.270.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report one such case with some overlapping cytomorphological features with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A 91-year-old man presented with generalized lymphadenopathy, pleural effusion, ascites, and an ulcerated growth in rectum. FNA smears from the left cervical lymph node showed a monotonous population of small lymphoid cells having small but distinct nucleoli that was initially diagnosed as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Smears from the left axillary lymph node contained both small and medium-sized lymphoid cells with frequent hand-mirror cell appearance, which has been described in acute lymphoblatic leukemia (ALL). Immunocyto/histochemical stainings on smears and cell block preparations of the aspirate showed the following immunophenotype: CD3+, CD4+, CD5+, CD7+, CD8-, CD20-, CD23-, and Tdt-. Total peripheral blood leukocyte count was 26.4 x 10(9) /L and total lymphocyte count, 8.3 x 10(9) /L with predominance of small lymphocytes. T-cell nature of the neoplasm was confirmed by biopsies from the cervical lymph node (T-cell lymphoma), bone marrow (T-cell lymphoid neoplasm/chronic lymphocytic leukemia), and the ulcerated rectal lesion (atypical T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder). The patient developed deep vein thrombosis, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and bleeding from duodenal ulcer. By the time the reports of all the investigations were ready, the patient succumbed to bronchopneumonia.

Genome-wide gene expression profiling, performed on 20 T-LBL and 10 T-ALL diagnostic specimens, revealed that the two malignancies shared a large fraction of their transcriptional profile while a subset of genes appeared to be differentially expressed in T-LBL versus T-ALL. This signature included genes involved in chemotactic responses and angiogenesis, which may play a role in tumor cell localization. Genome-wide copy number alteration analysis was performed on a subset of the samples analyzed by gene expression profiling and detected 41 recurrently altered genetic loci. Although most aberrations were found in both entities, several were selectively identified in T-LBL or T-ALL. In addition, NOTCH1 mutational status was found to correlate with a subset of genetic aberrations.

These abnormalities may be influenced by altered DNA repair and cell cycle control processes. METHODS: We examined the association between childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 32 genes in DNA repair and cell cycle pathways using a haplotype-based approach, among 377 childhood ALL cases and 448 controls enrolled during 1995-2002. RESULTS: We found that haplotypes in APEX1, BRCA2, ERCC2, and RAD51 were significantly associated with total ALL, while haplotypes in NBN and XRCC4, and CDKN2A were associated with structural and numerical change subtypes, respectively. In addition, we observed statistically significant interaction between exposure to 3 or more diagnostic X-rays and haplotypes of XRCC4 on risk of structural abnormality-positive childhood ALL. CONCLUSIONS: These results support a role of altered DNA repair and cell cycle processes in the risk of childhood ALL, and show that this genetic susceptibility can differ by cytogenetic subtype and may be modified by exposure to ionizing radiation. To our knowledge, our study is the first to broadly examine the DNA repair and cell cycle pathways using a haplotype approach in conjunction with X-ray exposures in childhood ALL risk. If confirmed, future studies are needed to identify specific functional SNPs in the regions of interest identified in this analysis.","['Chokkalingam, Anand P', 'Bartley, Karen', 'Wiemels, Joseph L', 'Metayer, Catherine', 'Barcellos, Lisa F', 'Hansen, Helen M', 'Aldrich, Melinda C', 'Guha, Neela', 'Urayama, Kevin Y', 'Scelo, Ghislaine', 'Chang, Jeffrey S', 'Month, Stacy R', 'Wiencke, John K', 'Buffler, Patricia A']","['Chokkalingam AP', 'Bartley K', 'Wiemels JL', 'Metayer C', 'Barcellos LF', 'Hansen HM', 'Aldrich MC', 'Guha N', 'Urayama KY', 'Scelo G', 'Chang JS', 'Month SR', 'Wiencke JK', 'Buffler PA']","['Division of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of California-Berkeley, 1995 University Avenue, Berkeley, CA 94704, USA. anandc@berkeley.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20111011,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Repair/*genetics', 'Genes, cdc/*genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'X-Rays/*adverse effects']",PMC3206192,2011/10/12 06:00,2012/02/18 06:00,['2011/10/12 06:00'],"['2011/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10552-011-9848-y [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2011 Dec;22(12):1721-30. doi: 10.1007/s10552-011-9848-y.

In this study, a mouse model of precursor B acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (pre-B ALL/LBL) was established by retroviral transduction of Myc genes (N-Myc or c-Myc) into mouse bone marrow cells. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) exhibited the highest susceptibility to N-Myc-induced pre-B ALL/LBL versus lymphoid progenitors, myeloid progenitors and committed progenitor B cells. N-Myc was able to induce pre-B ALL/LBL directly from progenitor B cells in the absence of Ink4a and Arf. Arf was expressed higher in progenitor B cells than Ink4a. In addition, N-Myc induced pre-B ALL/LBL from Arf(-/-) progenitor B cells suggesting that Arf has a predominant role in determining the cell of origin of pre-B ALL/LBL. Tumor cells derived from Ink4a/Arf(-/-) progenitor B cells exhibited a higher rate of proliferation and were more chemoresistant than those derived from wild-type HSCs. Furthermore, the Mdm2 inhibitor Nutlin-3 restored p53 and induced massive apoptosis in mouse pre-B ALL/LBL cells derived from Ink4a/Arf(-/-) cells and human B-ALL cell lines lacking Ink4a and Arf expression, suggesting that Mdm2 inhibition may be a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of Ink4a/Arf(-/-) B-ALL/LBL, such as is frequently found in Ph(+) ALL and relapsed ALL. Collectively, these findings indicate that Ink4a and Arf are critical determining factors of the cell of origin and the therapeutic sensitivity of Myc-induced lymphoid tumors.","['Sugihara, E', 'Shimizu, T', 'Kojima, K', 'Onishi, N', 'Kai, K', 'Ishizawa, J', 'Nagata, K', 'Hashimoto, N', 'Honda, H', 'Kanno, M', 'Miwa, M', 'Okada, S', 'Andreeff, M', 'Saya, H']","['Sugihara E', 'Shimizu T', 'Kojima K', 'Onishi N', 'Kai K', 'Ishizawa J', 'Nagata K', 'Hashimoto N', 'Honda H', 'Kanno M', 'Miwa M', 'Okada S', 'Andreeff M', 'Saya H']","['Division of Gene Regulation, Institute for Advanced Medical Research, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111010,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '53IA0V845C (nutlin 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*physiology', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Genes, myc', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/etiology/*pathology', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF/*physiology']",PMC3271180,2011/10/12 06:00,2012/08/22 06:00,['2011/10/12 06:00'],"['2011/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/22 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2011462 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2011.462 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2012 Jun 7;31(23):2849-61. doi: 10.1038/onc.2011.462.

RECENT FINDINGS: The rate of thrombosis in patients with polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis is elevated and a risk-oriented therapeutic approach is recommended to avoid inappropriate exposure to cytotoxic drugs on one side or suboptimal treatment on the other. Established thrombosis risk factors are age and previous vascular events but novel disease-related determinants such as leukocytosis and JAK2V617F mutational status and/or mutational burden are now under active investigation. The theory that elevated platelet count increases thrombosis risk in these diseases is now challenged. SUMMARY: Recent recommendations by the European Leukemia Net suggest that MPN patients should be stratified and treated according to conventional risk factors (age and previous events) and that baseline leukocytosis and JAK2V617F mutation should be considered once more information is available and when they have been eventually validated in prospective studies.","['Barbui, Tiziano']",['Barbui T'],"['Department of Hematology and Research Foundation, Ospedali Riuniti di Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy. tbarbui@ospedaliriuniti.bergamo.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,,IM,"['Humans', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*blood/complications', 'Thrombosis/blood/classification/etiology/*therapy']",,2011/10/12 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/10/12 06:00'],"['2011/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CCO.0b013e32834bb867 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2011 Nov;23(6):654-8. doi: 10.1097/CCO.0b013e32834bb867.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is strong evidence that deregulation of c-myb expression is involved in the development of human tumors, particularly of certain types of leukemia, and breast and colon cancer. The c-Myb protein is therefore an interesting therapeutic target. Here, we have investigated the potential of natural sesquiterpene lactones (STLs), a class of compounds that are active constituents of a variety of medicinal plants, to suppress Myb-dependent gene expression. We have developed a test system that allows screening of compounds for their ability to interfere with the activation of Myb target genes.

Here, we report the case of a 6-year-old boy who presented with NS only 61 days after cord blood stem cell transplantation (CBSCT). At 4 years old he was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and underwent bone marrow transplantation. Six months later, a recurrence was noted in the thymus, which required CBSCT at the age of 6. Acute GVHD and hemophagocytic syndrome occurred on day +13 and day +15, respectively, and were successfully treated with tacrolimus and a steroid. After tacrolimus was switched from intravenous infusion to oral administration, NS occurred on day +61. Complete remission was achieved in 3 weeks by resuming steroid treatment. Dry erythema with pigmentation and elevation of Th2 cytokine level suggest that NS in this case was also related to chronic GVHD. To our knowledge, this is the earliest occurrence of NS after HSCT. Hematologists and nephrologists should be aware that this condition may occur even in early periods after HSCT.","['Miura, Kenichiro', 'Sekine, Takashi', 'Takamizawa, Masaru', 'Terashima, Hiroshi', 'Furuya, Ayaka', 'Koh, Katsuyoshi', 'Takita, Junko', 'Ida, Kohmei', 'Igarashi, Takashi']","['Miura K', 'Sekine T', 'Takamizawa M', 'Terashima H', 'Furuya A', 'Koh K', 'Takita J', 'Ida K', 'Igarashi T']","['Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20111012,Japan,Clin Exp Nephrol,Clinical and experimental nephrology,9709923,"['9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*complications/drug therapy/etiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Nephrotic Syndrome/*etiology', 'Pleural Effusion/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Prednisolone/therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Tacrolimus/administration & dosage']",,2011/10/12 06:00,2012/07/10 06:00,['2011/10/12 06:00'],"['2011/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10157-011-0538-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Nephrol. 2012 Feb;16(1):180-2. doi: 10.1007/s10157-011-0538-6.

Imatinib (IM) has transient but significant activity in advanced phases of CML, which may permit early allografting for responding patients. To identify prognostic factors in allograft recipients previously treated with IM, we analyzed 449 allogeneic hematopoietic SCTs performed from 1999 to 2004 in advanced-phase CML, using the data reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. CML patients in second chronic phase (CP2, n=184), AP (n=185) and BP (n=80) received HLA-identical sibling (27%), related (3%), or matched or mismatched unrelated donor (70%), peripheral blood (47%) or BM (53%) hematopoietic SCT after myeloablative (78%) or non-myeloablative (22%) conditioning. In all, 52% in CP2, 49% in AP and 46% in BP received IM before hematopoietic SCT. Disease-free survival was 35-40% for CP2, 26-27% for AP and 8-11% for BP. Cumulative incidence of acute and chronic GVHD and TRM were not affected by the stages of CML or pre-hematopoietic SCT IM exposure. Multivariate analyses showed that conventional prognostic indicators remain the strongest determinants of transplant outcomes. In conclusion, there are no new prognostic indicators of the outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic SCT for advanced-phase CML in the IM era.","['Khoury, H J', 'Kukreja, M', 'Goldman, J M', 'Wang, T', 'Halter, J', 'Arora, M', 'Gupta, V', 'Rizzieri, D A', 'George, B', 'Keating, A', 'Gale, R P', 'Marks, D I', 'McCarthy, P L', 'Woolfrey, A', 'Szer, J', 'Giralt, S A', 'Maziarz, R T', 'Cortes, J', 'Horowitz, M M', 'Lee, S J']","['Khoury HJ', 'Kukreja M', 'Goldman JM', 'Wang T', 'Halter J', 'Arora M', 'Gupta V', 'Rizzieri DA', 'George B', 'Keating A', 'Gale RP', 'Marks DI', 'McCarthy PL', 'Woolfrey A', 'Szer J', 'Giralt SA', 'Maziarz RT', 'Cortes J', 'Horowitz MM', 'Lee SJ']","['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA. hkhoury@emory.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20111010,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Benzamides', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Siblings', 'Survival Rate', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",PMC3896981,2011/10/12 06:00,2012/10/04 06:00,['2011/10/12 06:00'],"['2011/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/04 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt2011194 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2011.194 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2012 Jun;47(6):810-6. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2011.194.

Currently, RQ-PCR is not based on the concept of international scale (IS) in Japan; mainly because none of the domestic laboratories have obtained their own conversion factor (CF) which makes it possible to convert locally scaled BCR-ABL (BCR-ABL (L)) value to the IS (BCR-ABL (IS)). To join the global trend of molecular assessment of BCR-ABL in CML patients, we have tried to obtain a CF in Japan. METHODS: Samples from 55 patients were exchanged between the Japanese laboratory and the reference laboratory in Adelaide, and BCR-ABL and internal control gene transcripts of the samples were measured using RQ-PCR. The patient bias conversion method was used to determine the CF for the IS using the Bland and Altman method. RESULTS: The local CF in the Japanese laboratory was determined to be 0.87. Based on this CF, 0.1% BCR-ABL (IS), defined as major molecular response, becomes equivalent to 731 copy/mug RNA BCR-ABL (L). CONCLUSION: This study is the first to introduce a laboratory-specific CF for harmonizing RQ-PCR methodology for detecting BCR-ABL transcripts to Japan, which may open new windows for molecular assessment of CML patients in Japan.","['Yoshida, Chikashi', 'Fletcher, Linda', 'Ohashi, Kazuteru', 'Wakita, Hisashi', 'Kumagai, Takashi', 'Shiseki, Masayuki', 'Matsuei, Kousei', 'Inokuchi, Koiti', 'Hatta, Yoshihiro', 'Shirasugi, Yukari', 'Yamaguchi, Toshikazu', 'Sakamoto, Junichi', 'Branford, Susan', 'Sakamaki, Hisashi']","['Yoshida C', 'Fletcher L', 'Ohashi K', 'Wakita H', 'Kumagai T', 'Shiseki M', 'Matsuei K', 'Inokuchi K', 'Hatta Y', 'Shirasugi Y', 'Yamaguchi T', 'Sakamoto J', 'Branford S', 'Sakamaki H']","['Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization Mito Medical Center, 280 Sakuranosato, Ibarakimachi, Higashiibarakigun, Ibaraki, 311-3193, Japan. c.yoshida.d@mn.hosp.go.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111012,Japan,Int J Clin Oncol,International journal of clinical oncology,9616295,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*genetics/*therapy', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2011/10/12 06:00,2014/02/04 06:00,['2011/10/12 06:00'],"['2011/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10147-011-0328-x [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Clin Oncol. 2012 Dec;17(6):584-9. doi: 10.1007/s10147-011-0328-x.

RECENT FINDINGS: PCR and multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) assays are the most important methods of identifying MRD. PCR technique allows to recognize early genetic abnormalities of residual leukemic cells with high specificity and sensitivity. MFC assay using six-color to 10-color technology is an alternative option for MRD monitoring in AML patients without gene markers to detect leukemia-associated immunophenotype antigens (LAIPs). SUMMARY: Despite the evidence that early detection of MRD after allogeneic HSCT is associated with a high risk of hematological relapse, it is still unclear whether this information can be translated into clinical practice, in order to prevent hematological relapse.","['Dominietto, Alida']",['Dominietto A'],"['Department of Haematology, San Martino Hospital, Genova, Italy. alida.dominietto@hsanmartino.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Genetic Markers)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Genetic Markers', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2011/10/12 06:00,2012/01/05 06:00,['2011/10/12 06:00'],"['2011/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e32834bac7d [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2011 Nov;18(6):381-7. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e32834bac7d.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Weighing the risks and benefits of platelet transfusion, although imprecise, should be attempted each time a platelet transfusion is ordered.

As the response to chemotherapy is essentially determined by the development of cellular drug resistance, new drugs that are capable to overcome resistance to conventional chemotherapeutics are urgently needed. With regard to this demand, we investigated the titanium-based anticancer drug Titanocene Y. Treatment with Titanocene Y leads to inhibition of tumour cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in established cell lines of leukemia, lymphoma and melanoma. The extrinsic pathway appears to be responsible, at least in part, for the effect: cell death is partly inhibited in BJAB cells overexpressing a dominant negative Fas-associated death domain (FADD) mutant and via real time PCR we found a significant up-regulation of Fas ligand in the affected cells. Apoptosis is triggered regardless of the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and pro-apoptotic smac and the agent is also effective on cells that are multidrug resistant due to overexpression of P-gp. In combination with vincristine impressive synergistic effects could be observed, exposing Titanocene Y as a possible component for polychemotherapy.

The study was conducted on 22 patients with CML in the chronic phase and 10 healthy subjects. The median serum NGAL levels in CML patients at diagnosis were significantly higher compared to age-matched controls. After imatinib therapy, all patients achieved complete molecular remission and NGAL levels decreased and were found significantly lower with respect to the baseline. No significant correlations were found between NGAL levels and other disease parameters. Before imatinib therapy, the median blood leptin levels were not significantly different from those of controls. After therapy with imatinib, all patients in molecular remission presented an increase in leptin levels. Future research is eagerly awaited as it may demonstrate the real role of NGAL and leptin in the onset and progression of CML.","['Alonci, Andrea', 'Allegra, Alessandro', 'Russo, Sabina', 'Penna, Giuseppa', 'Bellomo, Giacomo', ""D'Angelo, Arianna"", 'Campo, Salvatore', 'Cannavo, Antonino', 'Centorrino, Raffaella', 'Musolino, Caterina']","['Alonci A', 'Allegra A', 'Russo S', 'Penna G', 'Bellomo G', ""D'Angelo A"", 'Campo S', 'Cannavo A', 'Centorrino R', 'Musolino C']","['Division of Hematology, Medicinal Chemistry Section, University of Messina, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20111004,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (LCN2 protein, human)', '0 (Leptin)', '0 (Lipocalin-2)', '0 (Lipocalins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Benzamides', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leptin/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/*drug therapy', 'Lipocalin-2', 'Lipocalins/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*blood', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction']",,2011/10/12 06:00,2012/02/15 06:00,['2011/10/12 06:00'],"['2011/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [medline]']","['000330948 [pii]', '10.1159/000330948 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2012;127(1):1-6. doi: 10.1159/000330948.

This complication following allogeneic stem cell therapy (alloSCT) is less severe after reduced intense conditioning (RIC); however, even here it may be serious. METHODS: 52 patients (male: n = 35 (67%), female: n = 17 (33%)) at a median age of 62 years (35-73 years) underwent alloSCT after RIC. Conditioning was either total body irradiation (TBI)(2Gy)/+/-fludarabine (n = 33, 63.5%) or chemotherapy based. Graftversushost disease (GvHD) prophylaxis was carried out with cyclosporine A +/- mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). 45 patients (87%) received shortcourse methotrexate (MTX). Mucositis was graded according to the Bearman and the World Health Organisation (WHO) scale. A variety of parameters were correlated with mucositis. RESULTS: The Bearman and WHO scales showed excellent correlation. Mucositis was significantly more severe after chemotherapybased conditioning compared to conditioning with TBI(2Gy)/+/-fludarabine (p < 0.002) as well as in cases with an increase in creatinine levels above the upper normal value (UNV) on day +1 after SCT (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the severity correlated with time to engraftment of leucocytes (correlation coefficient (cc) = 0.26, p < 0.02) and thrombocytes (cc = 0.38, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The conditioning regimen and increased creatinine levels at day +1 were identified as factors predicting the severity of mucositis after RICSCT. Creatinine levels on day +1 after SCT may help identify patients at risk for severe mucositis in the further course of transplantation.","['Busemann, Christoph', 'Wilfert, Hanna', 'Neumann, Thomas', 'Kiefer, Thomas', 'Dolken, Gottfried', 'Kruger, William H']","['Busemann C', 'Wilfert H', 'Neumann T', 'Kiefer T', 'Dolken G', 'Kruger WH']","['Department of Internal Medicine C - Haematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Hospital Greifswald, Ernst Moritz Arndt University Greifswald, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20110916,Switzerland,Onkologie,Onkologie,7808556,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Middle Aged', 'Mucositis/*etiology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*therapy', 'Platelet Count', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects']",,2011/10/12 06:00,2012/04/28 06:00,['2011/10/12 06:00'],"['2011/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/28 06:00 [medline]']","['000332131 [pii]', '10.1159/000332131 [doi]']",ppublish,Onkologie. 2011;34(10):518-24. doi: 10.1159/000332131.

We determined the pattern of expression of forkhead box P3 (FoxP3), CD25, CD27 and CD127 and showed that the frequency of CD4+ FoxP3+ T cells was increased in CLL patients (12% versus 8% in controls). This increase was seen only in advanced disease, with selective expansion of FoxP3-expressing cells in the CD4+ CD25(low) population, whereas the number of CD4+ CD25(high) FoxP3+ cells was unchanged. CD4+ CD25(low) cells showed reduced expression of CD127 and increased CD27, and this regulatory phenotype was also seen on all CD4 T cells subsets in CLL patients, irrespective of CD25 or FoxP3 expression. Incubation of CD4+ T cells with primary CLL tumours led to a sixfold increase in the expression of FoxP3 in CD4+ CD25- T cells. Patients undergoing treatment with fludarabine demonstrated a transient increase in the percentage of CD4+ FoxP3+ T cells, but this reduced to normal levels post-treatment. This work demonstrates that patients with CLL exhibit a systemic T cell dysregulation leading to the accumulation of CD4+ FoxP3+ T cells. This appears to be driven by interaction with malignant cells, and increased understanding of the mechanisms that are involved could provide novel avenues for treatment.","['Piper, K P', 'Karanth, M', 'McLarnon, A', 'Kalk, E', 'Khan, N', 'Murray, J', 'Pratt, G', 'Moss, P A H']","['Piper KP', 'Karanth M', 'McLarnon A', 'Kalk E', 'Khan N', 'Murray J', 'Pratt G', 'Moss PA']","['School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Interleukin-7 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Immunomodulation', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-7 Receptor alpha Subunit/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7/biosynthesis', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",PMC3219890,2011/10/12 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/10/12 06:00'],"['2011/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2249.2011.04466.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 2011 Nov;166(2):154-63. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2249.2011.04466.x.,,,,['G0901755/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['(c) 2011 The Authors.

However, there are patients with dysplastic bone marrow features with or without a karyotype, who have only mild if any cytopenia. This condition has been termed idiopathic dysplasia of unknown significance (IDUS). Out of a series of 1,363 patients with suspected MDS or mild cytopenia seen between 1997 and 2010, we have identified 10 patients with IDUS, and analyzed their clinical course and outcome as well as features potentially involved in disease-evolution. Follow-up ranged between 2 and 13 years. Progression to an overt myeloid neoplasm was observed in 4 patients: two progressed to frank MDS, one to chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and one to a myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm exhibiting 5q-and JAK2 V617F. Consecutive studies revealed that most IDUS patients have an adequate production of erythropoietin (EPO) and sufficient numbers of EPO-responsive erythroid progenitors, features rarely seen in MDS. The erythropoiesis-promoting JAK2 mutation V617F was only detectable in one case. We hypothesize that the dysplastic clone in IDUS cannot manifest as frank MDS because i) the clone retains responsiveness against EPO, and ii) an adequate EPO-production counteracts anemia. Evolution of IDUS to low risk MDS may thus depend on the biological properties of the clone as well as patient-related factors such as EPO production. The latter often decreases with age and may thus explain why MDS often manifests in the elderly.","['Valent, Peter', 'Jager, Eva', 'Mitterbauer-Hohendanner, Gerlinde', 'Mullauer, Leonhard', 'Schwarzinger, Ilse', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Thalhammer, Renate', 'Wimazal, Friedrich']","['Valent P', 'Jager E', 'Mitterbauer-Hohendanner G', 'Mullauer L', 'Schwarzinger I', 'Sperr WR', 'Thalhammer R', 'Wimazal F']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100316,United States,Am J Cancer Res,American journal of cancer research,101549944,,,,PMC3186051,2011/10/11 06:00,2011/10/11 06:01,['2011/10/11 06:00'],"['2011/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/11 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Am J Cancer Res. 2011;1(4):531-41.

The use of what are known as Conceptual Knowledge Discovery in Databases (CKDD) methods provides a potential means of scaling hypothesis discovery and testing approaches for large data sets. Such methods enable the high-throughput generation and evaluation of knowledge-anchored relationships between complexes of variables found in targeted data sets. METHODS: The authors have conducted a multipart model formulation and validation process, focusing on the development of a methodological and technical approach to using CKDD to support hypothesis discovery for in silico science. The model the authors have developed is known as the Translational Ontology-anchored Knowledge Discovery Engine (TOKEn). This model utilizes a specific CKDD approach known as Constructive Induction to identify and prioritize potential hypotheses related to the meaningful semantic relationships between variables found in large-scale and heterogeneous biomedical data sets. RESULTS: The authors have verified and validated TOKEn in the context of a translational research data repository maintained by the NCI-funded Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Research Consortium. Such studies have shown that TOKEn is: (1) computationally tractable; and (2) able to generate valid and potentially useful hypotheses concerning relationships between phenotypic and biomolecular variables in that data collection.

Notch1 pathway activation is seen in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) due to the high frequency of Notch1 mutations affecting approximately 60% of patients, causing ligand-independent signalling and/or prolonging Notch1 half-life. We have investigated the possible regulative role of Notch1 on the expression and function of chemokine receptors CCR5, CCR9 and CXCR4 that play a role in determining blast malignant properties and localization of extramedullary infiltrations in leukaemia. We inhibited the pathway through gamma-Secretase inhibitor and Notch1 RNA interference and analysed the effect on the expression and function of chemokine receptors. Our results indicate that gamma-Secretase inhibitor negatively regulates the transcription level of the CC chemokine receptors 5 and 9 in T-ALL cell lines and patients' primary leukaemia cells, leaving CXCR4 expression unaltered. The Notch pathway also controls CCR5- and CCR9-mediated biological effects, ie chemotaxis and proliferation. Furthermore, engaging CCR9 through CCL25 administration rescues proliferation inhibition associated with abrogation of Notch activity. Finally, through RNA interference we demonstrated that the oncogenic isoform in T-ALL, Notch1, plays a role in controlling CCR5 and CCR9 expression and functions. These findings suggest that Notch1, acting in concert with chemokine receptors pathways, may provide leukaemia cells with proliferative advantage and specific chemotactic abilities, therefore influencing tumour cell progression and localization.","['Mirandola, Leonardo', 'Chiriva-Internati, Maurizio', 'Montagna, Daniela', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Zecca, Marco', 'Ranzani, Marco', 'Basile, Andrea', 'Locati, Massimo', 'Cobos, Everardo', 'Kast, W Martin', 'Asselta, Rosanna', 'Paraboschi, Elvezia Maria', 'Comi, Paola', 'Chiaramonte, Raffaella']","['Mirandola L', 'Chiriva-Internati M', 'Montagna D', 'Locatelli F', 'Zecca M', 'Ranzani M', 'Basile A', 'Locati M', 'Cobos E', 'Kast WM', 'Asselta R', 'Paraboschi EM', 'Comi P', 'Chiaramonte R']","['Department of Medicine, Surgery and Dentistry, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111209,England,J Pathol,The Journal of pathology,0204634,"['0 (CC chemokine receptor 9)', '0 (CCL25 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokines, CC)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, CCR)', '0 (Receptors, CCR5)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', '*Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chemokines, CC/metabolism', '*Chemotaxis/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Male', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, CCR/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, CCR5/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR4/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2011/10/11 06:00,2012/04/28 06:00,['2011/10/11 06:00'],"['2011/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/04 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/path.3015 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pathol. 2012 Apr;226(5):713-22. doi: 10.1002/path.3015.

Methotrexate (MTX) is a key compound of chemotherapeutic regimens used in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) and Burkitt's lymphomas (BL). This study aims to evaluate the role of MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms and G80A reduced folate carrier gene (RFC1) in a cohort of adult patients with lymphoproliferative malignancies submitted to high-dose MTX followed by leucovorin rescue. METHODS: We performed the analysis of these polymorphisms on genomic DNA with RFLP-PCR. RESULTS: Patients carrying MTHFR A1298C variant showed decreased hepatic and hematological toxicity (P = 0.03). Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) between homozygous wild-type and variant patients for the RFC1 G(80)A were significantly different (P = 0.035 and P = 0.02, respectively). A significant correlation between hematological toxicity and age (P = 0.003) was observed. There was no significant influence of MTHFR C677T genotype on toxicity, OS and PFS. CONCLUSIONS: Leucovorin rescue given after high-dose MTX probably accounts for the lack of influence of C677T polymorphism. To better define a role of RFC1 polymorphism on patients outcome, it would be worthwhile to perform a study on intracellular MTX level and RFC1 substrate binding affinities in different genotypes.","['Chiusolo, Patrizia', 'Giammarco, Sabrina', 'Bellesi, Silvia', 'Metafuni, Elisabetta', 'Piccirillo, Nicola', 'De Ritis, Daniela', 'Marietti, Sara', 'Federica, Sora', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Fianchi, Luana', 'Hohaus, Stefan', 'Giuseppe, Leone', 'Sica, Simona']","['Chiusolo P', 'Giammarco S', 'Bellesi S', 'Metafuni E', 'Piccirillo N', 'De Ritis D', 'Marietti S', 'Federica S', 'Laurenti L', 'Fianchi L', 'Hohaus S', 'Giuseppe L', 'Sica S']","['Department of Hematology, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Largo A.

METHODS: The antitumor activity of fourteen anticancer drugs was tested in over one hundred tumor samples from patients with solid or hematological malignancies. Drug activity against four normal cell types was used for the assessment of normal tissue toxicity. In vitro activity of the drugs was compared with indications approved by the Food and Drug Administration and established adverse event profiles. RESULTS: In general, in vitro drug activity in tumor cells from patients reflected known clinical activity of the drugs investigated. For example, the clinical activity of imatinib in chronic myeloid leukemia was clearly detected in the tumor panel. Further, and in accordance with clinical use, cisplatin and bortezomib showed high activity in ovarian cancer and myeloma samples, respectively. The normal cell models roughly reflected known clinical toxicity profiles and were able to detect differences in therapeutic index, e.g., between targeted drugs and classical cytotoxic agents. For example, the high tolerability of imatinib and the well-known renal toxicity of cisplatin were demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: In preclinical drug development, primary tumor cells from patients can be used for the prediction of cancer diagnosis-specific activity and may aid in the selection of diagnoses for clinical trials. By using tumor and toxicity panels together, information about therapeutic index may be derived, which may be useful when choosing among drug candidates with similar tumor effects.","['Haglund, Caroline', 'Aleskog, Anna', 'Nygren, Peter', 'Gullbo, Joachim', 'Hoglund, Martin', 'Wickstrom, Malin', 'Larsson, Rolf', 'Lindhagen, Elin']","['Haglund C', 'Aleskog A', 'Nygren P', 'Gullbo J', 'Hoglund M', 'Wickstrom M', 'Larsson R', 'Lindhagen E']","['Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. caroline.haglund@medsci.uu.se']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111009,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['*Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Epithelial Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kidney Tubules, Proximal/cytology/drug effects', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Models, Biological', 'Stem Cells/*drug effects']",,2011/10/11 06:00,2012/04/21 06:00,['2011/10/11 06:00'],"['2011/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-011-1746-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2012 Mar;69(3):697-707. doi: 10.1007/s00280-011-1746-1.

METHODS: The proliferation of Jurkat cells was observed by CCK-8 assay. The combined index was analyzed by Isobologram method. Apoptosis was detected by electron microscopy and flow cytometry with Annexin V/PI staining. Protein expressions of Caspase 3, PARP, Caspase 8, Caspase 9, Akt, p-Akt, P85S6K, p-P85S6K, P70S6K, p-P70S6K, ERK1/2 and p-ERK1/2 were determined by Western blotting. RESULTS: The IC(50) of IDA for Jurkat cells was significantly reduced when combined with 10 nmol/L rapamycin. The combined index was <1. Both electron microscopy and Annexin V/PI staining flow cytometry revealed that rapamycin significantly increased apoptotic sensitivity to IDA. The combination of IDA with rapamycin enhanced the expressions of Caspase 3, PARP, Caspase 8 and Caspase 9. Rapamycin significantly inhibited mTOR signaling upstream Akt and downstream S6K activation triggered by IDA, and the combination of the two agents led to synergistic inhibition of ERK phosphorylation. CONCLUSION: Combination of IDA with rapamycin exerted a synergistic anti-proliferative effect and promoted apoptosis by both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways in Jurkat cells. Inhibition of ERK phosphorylation and mTOR signaling by rapamycin may play a certain role in this synergistic effect.","['Zhao, Yan-min', 'Wu, Kang-ni', 'Wang, Ying-jia', 'Wu, Gong-qiang', 'Cao, Wei-jie', 'Yu, Xiao-hong', 'Huang, He']","['Zhao YM', 'Wu KN', 'Wang YJ', 'Wu GQ', 'Cao WJ', 'Yu XH', 'Huang H']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhejiang Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

In this study, we firstly aimed to investigate the relationship between EPHX1 Tyr113His and His139Arg variants, and the risk of incidence of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in Turkish population, comprised of 190 healthy controls and 167 ALL patients. In exon 3 Tyr113His polymorphism, 113His/His homozygous mutant genotype with slow activity was 18.6% in ALL patients and 9% in controls, indicating 113His/His slow activity genotype was significantly associated with an increased risk of childhood ALL (OR: 2.3, 95% CI, 1.2-4.4, P = 0.01). No significant association was found between exon 4 His139Arg variant and the risk of ALL. When both exon 3 Tyr113His and exon 4 His139Arg polymorphisms were considered together, only the exon 3 113His/His, homozygous mutant, slow activity genotype with exon 4 wild-type genotype 139His/His was significantly increased the risk of ALL 2.4-fold (OR: 2.4, P = 0.02). We also evaluated whether haplotype analysis for EPHX1 Tyr113His polymorphism together with DNA protein XRCC1 Arg399Gln variant known for its deficient DNA repair capacity would represent more prominent risk factors for the development of childhood ALL. Accordingly, the co-presence of Tyr113His variant of EPHX1 and Arg399Gln variant of XRCC1 in the same individuals significantly increased the risk of childhood ALL up to 2.1-fold (OR = 2.1, P = 0.03). Moreover, homozygous mutant genotype for both genes significantly and considerably increased the risk of childhood ALL 8.5-fold (OR: 8.5, P = 0.03). In conclusion, individuals with EPHX1 113His/His slow activity genotype may not detoxify reactive carcinogenic epoxides efficiently, binding of reactive epoxides to DNA cause DNA damage.

T-bet orchestrates the differentiation of mature peripheral T-cells into interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha producing CD4+ T-helper type I (Th1) and CD8+ T cytotoxic cells that are necessary for antiviral responses. When IL-12 is produced by antigen-presenting cells, T-bet expression is induced, causing direct stimulation of ifng gene transcription while simultaneously acting as a transcriptional repressor of the IL4 gene, which then leads to Th1 dominance and T-helper type 2 differentiation blockade. Additionally, T-bet has been shown to regulate histone acetylation of the ifng promoter and enhancer to loosen condensed DNA, creating greater accessibility for other transcription factor binding, which further amplifies IFNgamma production. We found that treatment with a farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib reduced Th1 cytokines in LGL leukemia patient T-cells and blocked T-bet protein expression and IL-12 responsiveness in T-cells from healthy donors. The mechanism of suppression was based on modulation of histone acetylation of the ifng gene, which culminated in Th1 blockade.","['Bai, Fanqi', 'Villagra, Alejandro V', 'Zou, Jianxiang', 'Painter, Jeffrey S', 'Connolly, Kirby', 'Blaskovich, Michelle A', 'Sokol, Lubomir', 'Sebti, Said', 'Djeu, Julie Y', 'Loughran, Thomas P', 'Wei, Sheng', 'Sotomayor, Eduardo', 'Epling-Burnette, Pearlie']","['Bai F', 'Villagra AV', 'Zou J', 'Painter JS', 'Connolly K', 'Blaskovich MA', 'Sokol L', 'Sebti S', 'Djeu JY', 'Loughran TP', 'Wei S', 'Sotomayor E', 'Epling-Burnette P']","['Immunology Program, H.

AM is considered to be the target tissue for assessment of both long-term leukemia risk and acute marrow toxicity following radiation exposure. The total shallow marrow (TM(50)), defined as all tissues lying within the first 50 microm of the bone surfaces, is considered to be the radiation target tissue of relevance for radiogenic bone cancer induction. For irradiation by sources external to the body, kerma to homogeneous spongiosa has been used as a surrogate for absorbed dose to both of these tissues, as direct dose calculations are not possible using computational phantoms with homogenized spongiosa. Recent micro-CT imaging of a 40 year old male cadaver has allowed for the accurate modeling of the fine microscopic structure of spongiosa in many regions of the adult skeleton (Hough et al 2011 Phys. Med. Biol. 56 2309-46). This microstructure, along with associated masses and tissue compositions, was used to compute specific absorbed fraction (SAF) values for protons originating in axial and appendicular bone sites (Jokisch et al 2011 Phys. Med. Biol. 56 6857-72). These proton SAFs, bone masses, tissue compositions and proton production cross sections, were subsequently used to construct neutron dose-response functions (DRFs) for both AM and TM(50) targets in each bone of the reference adult male. Kerma conditions were assumed for other resultant charged particles. For comparison, AM, TM(50) and spongiosa kerma coefficients were also calculated. At low incident neutron energies, AM kerma coefficients for neutrons correlate well with values of the AM DRF, while total marrow (TM) kerma coefficients correlate well with values of the TM(50) DRF. At high incident neutron energies, all kerma coefficients and DRFs tend to converge as charged-particle equilibrium is established across the bone site. In the range of 10 eV to 100 MeV, substantial differences are observed among the kerma coefficients and DRF. As a result, it is recommended that the AM kerma coefficient be used to estimate the AM DRF, and that the TM kerma coefficient be used to estimate the TM(50) DRF below 10 eV. Between 10 eV and 100 MeV, the appropriate DRF should be used as presented in this study. Above 100 MeV, spongiosa kerma coefficients apply well for estimating skeletal tissue doses. DRF values for each bone site as a function of energy are provided in an electronic annex to this article available at http://stacks.iop.org/0031-9155/56/6873/mmedia.","['Bahadori, Amir A', 'Johnson, Perry', 'Jokisch, Derek W', 'Eckerman, Keith F', 'Bolch, Wesley E']","['Bahadori AA', 'Johnson P', 'Jokisch DW', 'Eckerman KF', 'Bolch WE']","['Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, Francis Marion University, Florence, SC, USA.', 'Environmental Sciences Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20111007,England,Phys Med Biol,Physics in medicine and biology,0401220,['0 (Protons)'],IM,"['Absorption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Bone Marrow/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*radiation effects', 'Computer Simulation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Models, Biological', 'Muscle, Skeletal/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*radiation effects', '*Neutrons', 'Phantoms, Imaging', 'Protons', '*Radiation Dosage', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*methods/standards']",PMC5225754,2011/10/11 06:00,2012/02/16 06:00,['2011/10/11 06:00'],"['2011/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1088/0031-9155/56/21/008 [doi]'],ppublish,Phys Med Biol. 2011 Nov 7;56(21):6873-97. doi: 10.1088/0031-9155/56/21/008.

Herein, we investigated the effects of the natural compound, 16-hydroxycleroda-3,13-dien-15,16-olide (PL3), on the expressions of histone-modifying enzymes, and examined how it induces apoptosis in leukemia K562 cells. MAIN METHODS: Cell proliferation was determined by an MTT assay, and histone-modifying enzyme gene expressions were investigated by a quantitative real-time PCR. Protein expressions were analyzed by a Western blot analysis. The histone H3K27 distribution was observed with immunofluorescence staining. To verify polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) complex downstream gene expressions, a gene-expression array was performed to determine gene regulations. KEY FINDINGS: PL3 induced apoptosis and modulated many histone-modifying enzymes, especially the two PRC2 components, enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and suppressor of zeste 12 homolog (Suz12). Genes repressed by PRC2 were shown to be reactivated by PL3. Of these, 10 genes targeted by the PRC2 complex were identified, and expressions of 10 pro-/antiapoptotic genes were significantly regulated; these effects may have contributed to PL3-induced apoptosis in K562 cells. Regulation of other histone-modifying enzymes, including Aurora B, may also be involved in cell-cycle regulation. SIGNIFICANCE: Our data suggest that the induction of apoptosis by PL3 might partly occur through both a reduction in PRC2-mediated gene silencing and the reactivation of downstream tumor suppressor gene expressions. PL3 acts as a novel small-molecule histone modulator, which can potentially contribute to cancer chemotherapy singly or as a combined medication.","['Lin, Yi-Hsiung', 'Lee, Chien-Chih', 'Chang, Fang-Rong', 'Chang, Wen-Hsin', 'Wu, Yang-Chang', 'Chang, Jan-Gowth']","['Lin YH', 'Lee CC', 'Chang FR', 'Chang WH', 'Wu YC', 'Chang JG']","['Graduate Institute of Natural Products, College of Pharmacy, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110929,Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SUZ12 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '92593-91-4 (16-hydroxycleroda-3,13(14)-dien-15,16-olide)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Repressor Proteins/*biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/drug effects']",,2011/10/11 06:00,2012/01/14 06:00,['2011/10/11 06:00'],"['2011/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/08 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0024-3205(11)00453-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.lfs.2011.09.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 2011 Dec 5;89(23-24):886-95. doi: 10.1016/j.lfs.2011.09.011.

MAIN METHODS: Cytotoxic activity was assessed by MTT assay. Flow cytometry assays were used to determined DNA fragmentation (Propidium Iodide-PI staining) and phosphatidylserine exposure (Annexin-V and PI staining). DNA condensation was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy using double-staining in leukemia cells (Hoechst and PI). Caspase activities were measured using Z-VAD-FMK, a non-selective caspase inhibitor, by flow cytometry and Z-DEVD-AMC, a selective caspase-3 substrate, by fluorescence spectrometry. KEY FINDINGS: Both enantiomers displayed cytotoxic activity against leukemia cell lines (HL60, HL60.Bcl-2, HL60.Bcl-XL and Jurkat) with low toxicity against human peripheral blood mononuclear cell--PBMC based on IC50 values. In HL60 cell lines, compounds induce exposure of phosphatidylserine and DNA fragmentation, which could be blocked by pretreatment of cells with Z-VAD-FMK. Confirming this observation, both enantiomers induced caspase-3 activation. Additional analysis revealed an increased percentage of apoptotic cells (defined as those with fragmented nuclei and condensed chromatin) after treatment with compounds.

Among three different endogenous retroviruses (ecotropic, xenotropic and polytropic), xenotropic viruses are considered to be the major source of serum gp70. Although the abundance of xenotropic viral gp70 RNA in livers was up-regulated by the presence of these two Sgp loci, it has not yet been clear whether Sgp3 and Sgp4 regulate the expression of a fraction or multiple xenotropic viruses present in mouse genome. To address this question, we determined the genetic origin of xenotropic viral sequences expressed in wild-type and two different Sgp congenic C57BL/6 mice. Among 14 xenotropic proviruses present in the C57BL/6 genome, only two proviruses (Xmv10 and Xmv14) were actively transcribed in wild-type C57BL/6 mice. In contrast, Sgp3 enhanced the transcription of Xmv10 and induced the transcription of three additional xenotropic viruses (Xmv15, Xmv17 and Xmv18), while Sgp4 induced the expression of a different xenotropic virus (Xmv13). Notably, stimulation of TLR7 in Sgp3 congenic C57BL/6 mice led to a highly enhanced expression of potentially replication-competent Xmv18. These results indicated that Sgp3 and Sgp4 independently regulated the transcription of distinct and restricted sets of xenotropic viruses in trans, thereby promoting the production of nephritogenic gp70 autoantigens. Furthermore, the induced expression of potentially replication-competent xenotropic viruses by Sgp3 may contribute to the development of autoimmune responses against gp70 through the activation of TLR7.","['Kihara, Masao', 'Leroy, Valerie', 'Baudino, Lucie', 'Evans, Leonard H', 'Izui, Shozo']","['Kihara M', 'Leroy V', 'Baudino L', 'Evans LH', 'Izui S']","['Department of Pathology and Immunology, University of Geneva, 1211 Geneve 4, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111007,England,J Autoimmun,Journal of autoimmunity,8812164,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Sgp3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoantibodies/blood', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/immunology', 'Gene Products, env/blood/genetics/metabolism', 'Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lupus Nephritis/etiology/*genetics/immunology/virology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Congenic', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred NZB', 'Molecular Chaperones/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/complications/*genetics/immunology/virology', 'Transcriptional Activation/immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/pathogenicity/*physiology']",PMC3254601,2011/10/11 06:00,2012/04/03 06:00,['2011/10/11 06:00'],"['2011/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/02 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0896-8411(11)00089-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jaut.2011.09.001 [doi]']",ppublish,J Autoimmun. 2011 Dec;37(4):311-8. doi: 10.1016/j.jaut.2011.09.001.

We generated mouse lines lacking Pbx genes in cephalic ectoderm and demonstrated that they exhibit fully penetrant CL/P and perturbed Wnt signaling. We also characterized a midfacial regulatory element that Pbx proteins bind to control the expression of Wnt9b-Wnt3, which in turn regulates p63. Altogether, we establish a Pbx-dependent Wnt-p63-Irf6 regulatory module in midfacial ectoderm that is conserved within mammals. Dysregulation of this network leads to localized suppression of midfacial apoptosis and CL/P. Ectopic Wnt ectodermal expression in Pbx mutants rescues the clefting, opening avenues for tissue repair.","['Ferretti, Elisabetta', 'Li, Bingsi', 'Zewdu, Rediet', 'Wells, Victoria', 'Hebert, Jean M', 'Karner, Courtney', 'Anderson, Matthew J', 'Williams, Trevor', 'Dixon, Jill', 'Dixon, Michael J', 'Depew, Michael J', 'Selleri, Licia']","['Ferretti E', 'Li B', 'Zewdu R', 'Wells V', 'Hebert JM', 'Karner C', 'Anderson MJ', 'Williams T', 'Dixon J', 'Dixon MJ', 'Depew MJ', 'Selleri L']","['Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY 10065, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111006,United States,Dev Cell,Developmental cell,101120028,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (IRF6 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Trp63 protein, mouse)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (Wnt3 Protein)', '0 (Wnt3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Wnt9b protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Cleft Lip/embryology/metabolism', 'Cleft Palate/embryology/metabolism', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Epithelial Cells/*metabolism', 'Face/*embryology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Morphogenesis/physiology', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Wnt Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Wnt3 Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3199312,2011/10/11 06:00,2011/12/17 06:00,['2011/10/11 06:00'],"['2011/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/20 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S1534-5807(11)00317-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.devcel.2011.08.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Dev Cell. 2011 Oct 18;21(4):627-41. doi: 10.1016/j.devcel.2011.08.005.

The selection algorithm for umbilical-cord blood units generally considers intermediate resolution HLA typing at A and B and allele-level typing at DRB1. We aimed to establish the relative importance of additional matching at HLA C. METHODS: We used Cox regression to assess retrospectively the effect of donor-recipient HLA matching on outcomes of single umbilical-cord blood transplantations for leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. Our primary endpoint was transplant-related mortality. HLA typing was done with molecular techniques with a minimum of intermediate resolution for HLA A, B, and C, and at the allele-level for DRB1. FINDINGS: The median age of our study population was 10 years (range <1-62) and 552 (69%) of 803 patients were aged 16 years or younger at transplantation. Compared with transplantations matched at HLA A, B, C, and DRB1 (n=69), transplant-related mortality risk was higher after transplantations matched at HLA A, B, and DRB1 and mismatched at HLA C (n=23; HR 3.97, 95% CI 1.27-12.40; p=0.018). Transplant-related mortality risk was also higher after transplantations with a single mismatch at HLA A, B, or DRB1 and mismatched at HLA C (n=234; 1.70, 1.06-2.74; p=0.029) compared with transplantations matched at HLA C with a single mismatch at HLA A, B, or DRB1 (n=127). Assessing the overall effect of HLA disparity on transplant-related mortality, risks were higher with units mismatched at two (n=259; 3.27, 1.42-7.54; p=0.006), three (n=253; 3.34, 1.45-7.71; p=0.005), or four (n=75; 3.51, 1.44-8.58; p=0.006) loci compared with matched units (n=69). INTERPRETATION: Our data suggest that the present strategy for umbilical-cord blood unit selection should be reassessed; matching at HLA C for units that are matched at HLA A, B, or DRB1 or in the presence of a single locus mismatch at HLA A, B, or DRB1 should be included to minimise mortality risks.

Prior to 10 years ago, durable remission was rare and patients often underwent bone marrow transplantation with substantial morbidity and mortality. Fortunately, CML has been the epicenter of exciting advances in cancer therapy with the discovery of the Bcr-Abl gene fusion and the subsequent development of imatinib mesylate, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, to target the kinase activity of the bcr-abl protein product. Despite unprecedented durability for complete hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular responses seen with front-line imatinib therapy, many patients require alternative therapy because of drug intolerance, suboptimal response, primary resistance, secondary resistance, or progression to advanced phase disease. Further, up to 5% of patients present with advanced disease that does not sustain a durable response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Thus, up to one third of CML patients require alternate therapy. Chronic myeloid leukemia has become an exemplary model system for understanding molecular targeting and overcoming mechanisms of drug resistance. This review will discuss potential mechanisms of resistance and ongoing research into novel targets and agents for CML resistant to standard of care.","['Roychowdhury, Sameek', 'Talpaz, Moshe']","['Roychowdhury S', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20111006,England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",,2011/10/11 06:00,2012/02/16 06:00,['2011/10/11 06:00'],"['2011/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0268-960X(11)00066-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.blre.2011.09.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 2011 Nov;25(6):279-90. doi: 10.1016/j.blre.2011.09.001.

It commonly involves lymph nodes and bone marrow, but may rarely manifest in skin. Certain triggering factors, such as Epstein-Barr virus infection and p53 overexpression, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of RS. Here, we present 3 cases of cutaneous RS from our institution with a follow-up period of up to 8 years. OBJECTIVE: We present a series of cutaneous RS from a single institution with the longest follow-up period (up to 8 years) to date. METHODS: Clinical characteristics were collected and histopathological findings of skin biopsy specimens were analyzed. RESULTS: All 3 patients had prior CLL and later developed cutaneous RS lesions. The mean age at the diagnosis of cutaneous RS was 67 years old. The time intervals between CLL and cutaneous RS were 3 to 8 years. Skin biopsy specimens demonstrated dermal nodular or perivascular infiltrates of large B cells, showing similar immunophenotypes to the lesional cells in the original CLL. Overexpression of p53 and positive stain for Epstein-Barr virus--encoded small RNA was found in one patient. One patient remained alive 8 years after the diagnosis whereas the other two died of the disease at 5 years and 3 weeks, respectively, after the onset of cutaneous RS. LIMITATIONS: Three patients with RS were followed up for up to 8 years. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that, in contrast to extracutaneous RS, cutaneous RS generally has a less aggressive course with longer survival unless other worse prognostic factors are present.","['Yu, Limin', 'Bandhlish, Anshu', 'Fullen, Douglas R', 'Su, Lyndon D', 'Ma, Linglei']","['Yu L', 'Bandhlish A', 'Fullen DR', 'Su LD', 'Ma L']","['Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20111007,United States,J Am Acad Dermatol,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,7907132,['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)'],IM,"['Aged', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Skin Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Syndrome', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",,2011/10/11 06:00,2013/01/18 06:00,['2011/10/11 06:00'],"['2011/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/09 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0190-9622(11)00819-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.jaad.2011.06.021 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Acad Dermatol. 2012 Nov;67(5):e187-93. doi: 10.1016/j.jaad.2011.06.021.

For the first time, we cloned LAG-3 from two breeds of cattle (Holstein and Japanese Black), and analyzed its expression levels in cattle infected with bovine leukemia virus (BLV), a chronic viral infection that leads to immuno-suppression. The cloned cDNA of bovine LAG-3 have an open reading frame of 1551 nucleotides, encoding a polypeptide of 515 amino acids in length. Similar to the swine LAG-3, the bovine LAG-3 protein sequence consisted of four extracellular domains, a transmembrane domain and an inhibitory motif, KTGELE. We found that the bovine LAG-3 mRNA transcripts were expressed predominantly on T-cells such as CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells, among peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In subsequent expression analysis, LAG-3 mRNA expression on CD4(+) T-cells from BLV-infected cattle was upregulated compared to that in normal cattle. Comparable results were obtained with CD8(+) T-cells from cattle infected with BLV. We further observed strong upregualtion of MHC class II molecule, the ligand for LAG-3 in BLV-infected cattle. These findings indicate an important role for inhibitory receptor molecules such as LAG-3 in chronic bovine infections and future studies will elucidate the specific role of LAG-3 in bovine diseases.","['Shirai, Tatsuya', 'Konnai, Satoru', 'Ikebuchi, Ryoyo', 'Okagawa, Tomohiro', 'Suzuki, Saori', 'Sunden, Yuji', 'Onuma, Misao', 'Murata, Shiro', 'Ohashi, Kazuhiko']","['Shirai T', 'Konnai S', 'Ikebuchi R', 'Okagawa T', 'Suzuki S', 'Sunden Y', 'Onuma M', 'Murata S', 'Ohashi K']","['Department of Disease Control, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-0818, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110903,Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD223 antigen)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*genetics/physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cattle', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/genetics/*immunology', 'Gene Expression Profiling/veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Sequence Analysis, Protein/veterinary']",,2011/10/11 06:00,2012/03/10 06:00,['2011/10/11 06:00'],"['2011/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/08 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-2427(11)00348-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.vetimm.2011.08.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 2011 Dec 15;144(3-4):462-7. doi: 10.1016/j.vetimm.2011.08.018.

This study was designed to describe children and youth (age <20 years) diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in Alberta, Canada, during 22 fiscal years. The Alberta Cancer Registry was used to extract data all ALL, AML, HL, and NHL cases diagnosed between April 1, 1982, and March 31, 2004. Population data for Alberta were also obtained. Descriptive statistics and cluster detection tests were used. During 22 years, 525, 117, 257, and 111 children (total = 1010) were diagnosed with ALL, AML, HL, and NHL, respectively. The median ages at diagnosis were 4, 11, 16, and 12 years for ALL, AML, HL, and NHL, respectively. The majority were male for ALL (287/525, 55%), AML (64/117, 55%), and NHL (81/111, 73%), and female for HL (133/257, 52%). The crude rates per 100,000 children were variable, without significant trends, over time and for each diagnosis; the median annual rates, per 100,000 children, were 3.00 (ranging from 1.87 to 3.75) for ALL, 0.62 (ranging from 0.26 to 1.27) for AML, 1.42 (ranging from 0.76 to 2.67) for HL, and 0.54 (ranging from 0.24 to 1.40) for NHL. A few potential spatiotemporal clusters were identified. They are likely due to small number of cases and plausibly clinically insignificant. Overall, childhood leukemia and lymphoma rates in Alberta have remained relatively stable, with no clear epidemiological trends and no significant spatiotemporal clustering. Further investigations are warranted to see if such stability continues and if spatiotemporal patterns arise from longer studies and studies in larger geographic regions with a larger sample size, whilst analyzing for other causal/associated factors, individual susceptibilities, and disease outcomes.","['Kulkarni, Ketan', 'Stobart, Kent', 'Witol, Adrienne', 'Rosychuk, Rhonda J']","['Kulkarni K', 'Stobart K', 'Witol A', 'Rosychuk RJ']","['Department of Pediatrics , Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111007,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,2011/10/11 06:00,2012/09/14 06:00,['2011/10/11 06:00'],"['2011/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08880018.2011.613091 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2011 Nov;28(8):649-60. doi: 10.3109/08880018.2011.613091.

Multivariate analysis confirmed circulating blasts [Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24-0.99; P = 0.05] and poor risk cytogenetics (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.22-0.91; P = 0.03) as independent predictors for OS. Interestingly, this analysis also identified platelet doubling after the first cycle of azacitidine as a simple and independent positive predictor for OS (HR 5.4, 95% CI 0.73-39.9; P = 0.10). In conclusion, routine administration of azacitidine to patients with variable risk groups of MDS, CMML and AML is feasible, and subgroups with distinct efficacy of azacitidine treatment can be identified.","['van der Helm, Lieke H', 'Alhan, Canan', 'Wijermans, Pierre W', 'van Marwijk Kooy, Marinus', 'Schaafsma, Ron', 'Biemond, Bart J', 'Beeker, Aart', 'Hoogendoorn, Mels', 'van Rees, Bastiaan P', 'de Weerdt, Okke', 'Wegman, Jurgen', 'Libourel, Ward J', 'Luykx-de Bakker, Sylvia A', 'Minnema, Monique C', 'Brouwer, Rolf E', 'Croon-de Boer, Fransien', 'Eefting, Matthijs', 'Jie, Kon-Siong G', 'van de Loosdrecht, Arjan A', 'Koedam, Jan', 'Veeger, Nic J G M', 'Vellenga, Edo', 'Huls, Gerwin']","['van der Helm LH', 'Alhan C', 'Wijermans PW', 'van Marwijk Kooy M', 'Schaafsma R', 'Biemond BJ', 'Beeker A', 'Hoogendoorn M', 'van Rees BP', 'de Weerdt O', 'Wegman J', 'Libourel WJ', 'Luykx-de Bakker SA', 'Minnema MC', 'Brouwer RE', 'Croon-de Boer F', 'Eefting M', 'Jie KS', 'van de Loosdrecht AA', 'Koedam J', 'Veeger NJ', 'Vellenga E', 'Huls G']","['Department of Haematology, University Medical Centre Groningen, Hanzeplein 1, Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20111008,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*therapeutic use', 'Blood Platelets/*drug effects', 'Cohort Studies', '*Compassionate Use Trials', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*blood/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*blood/drug therapy', 'Netherlands', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2011/10/11 06:00,2012/03/03 06:00,['2011/10/11 06:00'],"['2011/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08893.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2011 Dec;155(5):599-606. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08893.x.

A prospective study on central venous access in patients with haematological malignancies.",901-6,10.1111/j.1445-5994.2011.02596.x [doi],"AIMS: Central venous catheters (CVC) are integral to modern haematology practice; however, they are associated with a range of complications. This prospective study aimed to determine the rate of CVC-related complications and risk factors in haematology patients, who are vulnerable because of their underlying pathology and treatments. METHODS: All inpatients that had a non-tunnelled CVC inserted in a 14-month period in the haematology ward at St Vincent's Hospital were enrolled. Complications (immediate and late), demographics, type of device, insertion technique and duration of dwell, were examined using multivariate analysis. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-four CVC in 84 patients were recorded, representing 3016 catheter-days. At least one complication was found in 43 (24.7%) patients. Immediate complications occurred in 13 (7.5%) insertions, with a higher rate in those inserted after >/=2 attempts compared with one (P = 0.02). Catheter-related bloodstream infection occurred at a rate of 7.6 per 1000 catheter-days, with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia associated with a higher rate (P = 0.02), and subclavian vein CVC had a lower rate compared with other locations (P < 0.01). Thrombosis was found in seven (4.0%) patients, with subclavian CVC carrying an increased risk (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: This prospective observational study found almost a quarter of haematology patients experience a CVC-related complication. An association was found with a number of attempts at insertion and immediate complications; other risk factors included anatomical location, underlying disease and duration of catheterisation. The relatively high complication rate, compared with reports of non-haematology patients, highlights the need to improve CVC management, a vital part of care for this population.","['Dix, C H K', 'Yeung, D T O', 'Rule, M L', 'Ma, D D F']","['Dix CH', 'Yeung DT', 'Rule ML', 'Ma DD']","[""St Vincent's Clinical School, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Australia,Intern Med J,Internal medicine journal,101092952,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Catheter-Related Infections/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/*adverse effects/trends', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",,2011/10/11 06:00,2013/07/09 06:00,['2011/10/11 06:00'],"['2011/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1445-5994.2011.02596.x [doi]'],ppublish,Intern Med J. 2012 Aug;42(8):901-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1445-5994.2011.02596.x.,,,,,"['(c) 2011 The Authors.

Few studies have specifically focused on infants (<1 year) with leukaemia, a group that is biologically and clinically distinct from older children. We present data from a Children's Oncology Group case-control study of 443 infants diagnosed with acute leukaemia [including acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)] between 1996 and 2006 and 324 population controls. Mothers were queried about their cigarette, alcohol and illicit drug use 1 year before and throughout pregnancy. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals [CI] were calculated using adjusted unconditional logistic regression models. Maternal smoking (>1 cigarette/day) and illicit drug use (any amount) before and/or during pregnancy were not significantly associated with infant leukaemia. Alcohol use (>1 drink/week) during pregnancy was inversely associated with infant leukaemia overall [OR = 0.64; 95% CI 0.43, 0.94], AML [OR = 0.49; 95% CI 0.28, 0.87], and leukaemia with mixed lineage leukaemia gene rearrangements ('MLL+') [OR = 0.59; 95% CI 0.36, 0.97]. While our results agree with the fairly consistent evidence that maternal cigarette smoking is not associated with childhood leukaemia, the data regarding alcohol and illicit drug use are not consistent with prior reports and are difficult to interpret. It is possible that unhealthy maternal behaviours during pregnancy, some of which carry potential legal consequences, may not be adequately measured using only self-report. Future case-control studies of childhood leukaemia that pursue these exposures may benefit from incorporation of validated instruments and/or biomarkers when feasible.","['Slater, Megan E', 'Linabery, Amy M', 'Blair, Cindy K', 'Spector, Logan G', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Ross, Julie A']","['Slater ME', 'Linabery AM', 'Blair CK', 'Spector LG', 'Heerema NA', 'Robison LL', 'Ross JA']","['Division of Pediatric Epidemiology and Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110810,England,Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol,Paediatric and perinatal epidemiology,8709766,['0 (Illicit Drugs)'],IM,"['Alcohol Drinking/*adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Illicit Drugs/*adverse effects', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Maternal Welfare', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking/*adverse effects', 'Time Factors']",PMC3614405,2011/10/11 06:00,2012/02/01 06:00,['2011/10/11 06:00'],"['2011/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-3016.2011.01229.x [doi]'],ppublish,Paediatr Perinat Epidemiol. 2011 Nov;25(6):559-65. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3016.2011.01229.x.

Families of leukaemia and lymphoma patients aged </=21 years diagnosed from 1998 to 2007 at randomly selected Children's Oncology Group institutions across the US were questioned (n = 947). Parents/guardians and patients aged >/=18 years were asked to release DBS to investigators in spring 2009. DBS were then requested from states. Overall, 299 families (32%) released DBS. Consenting/assenting patients were born in 39 US states and 46 DBS were obtained from five states; 124 DBS were unobtainable because patients were born prior to dates of state retention. State policies are rapidly evolving and there is ongoing discussion regarding DBS storage and secondary research uses.

Low sensitivity was observed for maternal protein or albumin in the urine (cases: 12% [95% exact confidence interval (CI) 8%, 18%]; controls: 11% [95% CI 7%, 17%]) and infant supplemental oxygen use (cases: 25% [95% CI 11%, 43%]; controls: 24% [95% CI 13%, 37%]).

We did not detect other case-control differences in recall (differentiality), even though the average time between childbirth and interview was 2.7 years for case and 3.7 years for control mothers.

A large number of Aurora kinase inhibitors are currently in different stages of clinical development. In addition to varying in their selectivity for the different Aurora kinases, some also have activity directed at other cellular kinases involved in important molecular pathways in cancer cells. This review summarizes the biology of Aurora kinases and discusses why they may be good therapeutic targets in different haematological cancers. We describe preclinical data that has served as the rationale for investigating Aurora kinase inhibitors in different haematological malignancies, and summarize published results from early phase clinical trials. While the anti-tumour effects of Aurora kinase inhibitors appear promising, we highlight important issues for future clinical research and suggest that the optimal use of these inhibitors is likely to be in combination with cytotoxic agents already in use for the treatment of various haematological cancers.","['Farag, Sherif S']",['Farag SS'],"['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, 840 Westr Walnut St., Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA. ssfarag@iupui.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20111008,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aurora Kinases', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",PMC3771583,2011/10/11 06:00,2012/03/03 06:00,['2011/10/11 06:00'],"['2011/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08898.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2011 Dec;155(5):561-79. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08898.x.

STUDY DESIGN: CD34 immunostaining was performed on BM biopsies from 21 PMFs, 23 non-PMF myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) with associated MF, 20 secondary MF samples, and 10 nonfibrotic controls. Microvessel density (MVD) and microvessel surface area (MSA), along with blood and BM findings were compared between the groups. RESULTS: The post-MPN MF cases included chronic myeloid leukemia-MF and polycythemia vera-MF. Etiologies of secondary MF were metastatic carcinomas, non-MPN hematologic malignancies, tuberculosis, autoimmune MF, and osteopetrosis. Megakaryocytic clustering was the most frequent and intrasinusoidal hematopoiesis the most specific feature of PMF. Higher reticulin grade, collagenization, and osteomyelosclerosis were commoner in PMF. MVD and MSA were significantly increased in fibrotic marrows regardless of etiology. Although mean MVD as well as MSA were highest in PMF, extensive overlaps among groups and marked heterogeneity in the secondary MF group rendered them of limited utility in the differential diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Enhanced angiogenesis is not entirely specific for PMF. Overlaps with secondary MF limits its differential diagnostic utility. Pathogenetically, our findings suggest that enhanced angiogenesis is a secondary paraneoplastic stromal response shared by various unrelated conditions.","['Sharma, Prashant', 'Pati, Hara Prasad', 'Mishra, Pravas Chandra', 'Dinda, Amit Kumar', 'Gupta, Ruchika', 'Sharma, Alok', 'Jacob, Tony George']","['Sharma P', 'Pati HP', 'Mishra PC', 'Dinda AK', 'Gupta R', 'Sharma A', 'Jacob TG']","['Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Anal Quant Cytol Histol,Analytical and quantitative cytology and histology,8506819,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/blood supply/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Microvessels/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/etiology/*pathology', '*Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/diagnosis/pathology']",,2011/10/08 06:00,2011/12/20 06:00,['2011/10/08 06:00'],"['2011/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Anal Quant Cytol Histol. 2011 Aug;33(4):236-44.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The presence of zinc fingers that are able to bind to specific sequences of DNA suggests that EVI1 is a transcriptional regulator; however, except a few, target genes of EVI1 are poorly functionally identified thus far. In this study we provide evidence that EVI1 directly induces the expression of Bcl-xL through the first set of zinc finger and thereby inhibits apoptosis. ChIP analysis showed that EVI1 binds to the Bcl-xL promoter in HT-29 cells, a colon carcinoma cell line, which expresses EVI1. The observation is also supported by the fact that EVI1 siRNA treated HT-29 cells, shows a down regulation of Bcl-xL expression and that over expression of EVI1 results in the induction of the Bcl-xL reporter construct. A set of EVI1 positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) samples also showed higher Bcl-xL expression with respect to EVI1 negative samples. Interestingly, co-expression of EVI1 with wild type, but not with dominant-negative form of PCAF, abolishes the effect of EVI1 on Bcl-xL, indicating that acetylation of EVI1 abrogates its ability not only to bind Bcl-xL promoter but also alleviate Bcl-xL activity. Finally we have shown that EVI1 expression regulates apoptosis in HT-29 cells, which is abrogated when HT-29 cells are transfected with EVI1 siRNA or PCAF. The result for the first time shows a direct pathway by which EVI1 can protect cells from apoptosis and also demonstrates that the pathway can be reversed when EVI1 is acetylated.","['Pradhan, Anjan Kumar', 'Mohapatra, Alok Das', 'Nayak, Kasturi Bala', 'Chakraborty, Soumen']","['Pradhan AK', 'Mohapatra AD', 'Nayak KB', 'Chakraborty S']","['Department of Gene Function and Regulation, Institute of Life Sciences, Bhubaneswar, Orissa, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110928,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP-associated factor)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Cattle', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Dogs', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HT29 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Rats', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/genetics', 'Zinc Fingers', 'bcl-X Protein/*genetics', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors/metabolism']",PMC3182211,2011/10/08 06:00,2012/01/27 06:00,['2011/10/08 06:00'],"['2010/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0025370 [doi]', 'PONE-D-10-05267 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(9):e25370. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0025370.

Thus, there is a need for identification of molecular mechanisms of clinical resistance to these drugs. In response, we characterized MOLM13 AML cell lines made resistant to two structurally-independent FLT3 inhibitors. METHODS: MOLM13 cells were made drug resistant via prolonged exposure to midostaurin and HG-7-85-01, respectively. Cell proliferation was determined by Trypan blue exclusion. Protein expression was assessed by immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and flow cytometry. Cycloheximide was used to determine protein half-life. RT-PCR was performed to determine FLT3 mRNA levels, and FISH analysis was performed to determine FLT3 gene expression. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We found that MOLM13 cells readily developed cross-resistance when exposed to either midostaurin or HG-7-85-01. Resistance in both lines was associated with dramatically elevated levels of cell surface FLT3 and elevated levels of phosphor-MAPK, but not phospho-STAT5. The increase in FLT3-ITD expression was at least in part due to reduced turnover of the receptor, with prolonged half-life. Importantly, the drug-resistant phenotype could be rapidly reversed upon withdrawal of either inhibitor. Consistent with this phenotype, no significant evidence of FLT3 gene amplification, kinase domain mutations, or elevated levels of mRNA was observed, suggesting that protein turnover may be part of an auto-regulatory pathway initiated by FLT3 kinase activity. Interestingly, FLT3 inhibitor resistance also correlated with resistance to cytosine arabinoside. Over-expression of FLT3 protein in response to kinase inhibitors may be part of a novel mechanism that could contribute to clinical resistance.","['Weisberg, Ellen', 'Ray, Arghya', 'Nelson, Erik', 'Adamia, Sophia', 'Barrett, Rosemary', 'Sattler, Martin', 'Zhang, Chengsheng', 'Daley, John F', 'Frank, David', 'Fox, Edward', 'Griffin, James D']","['Weisberg E', 'Ray A', 'Nelson E', 'Adamia S', 'Barrett R', 'Sattler M', 'Zhang C', 'Daley JF', 'Frank D', 'Fox E', 'Griffin JD']","['Department of Medical Oncology/Hematologic Neoplasia, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America. ellen_weisberg@dfci.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20110928,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (HG-7-85-01 compound)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Enzyme Stability/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects/genetics', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Mutation', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects/genetics', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC3182213,2011/10/08 06:00,2012/01/27 06:00,['2011/10/08 06:00'],"['2011/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0025351 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-15357 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(9):e25351. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0025351.

Studies of mice with a germ-line mutation that replaces Ser18 with Ala (p53(S18A) mice) have demonstrated that loss of phosphorylation of p53Ser18 leads to the development of tumors, including lymphomas, fibrosarcomas, leukemia and leiomyosarcomas. The predominant lymphoma is B-cell lymphoma, which is in contrast to the lymphomas observed in Atm(-/-) animals. This observation and the fact that multiple kinases phosphorylate p53Ser18 suggest Atm-independent tumor suppressive functions of p53Ser18. Therefore, in order to examine p53Ser18 function in relationship to ATM, we analyzed the lifespan and tumorigenesis of mice with combined mutations in p53Ser18 and Atm.

Many established chromosome rearrangements have been described, and their associations with specific clinical, biologic, and prognostic features are well defined. However, approximately 30% of pediatric and 50% of adult patients with all do not have cytogenetic abnormalities of clinical significance. Despite significant improvements in outcome for pediatric all, therapy fails in approximately 25% of patients, and these failures often occur unpredictably in patients with a favorable prognosis and ""good"" cytogenetics at diagnosis.It is well known that karyotype analysis in hematologic malignancies, although genome-wide, is limited because of altered cell kinetics (mitotic rate), a propensity of leukemic blasts to undergo apoptosis in culture, overgrowth by normal cells, and chromosomes of poor quality in the abnormal clone. Array comparative genomic hybridization (acgh-""microarray"") has a greatly increased genomic resolution over classical cytogenetics. Cytogenetic microarray, which uses genomic dna, is a powerful tool in the analysis of unbalanced chromosome rearrangements, such as copy number gains and losses, and it is the method of choice when the mitotic index is low and the quality of metaphases is suboptimal. The copy number profile obtained by microarray is often called a ""molecular karyotype.""In the present study, microarray was applied to 9 retrospective cases of pediatric all either with initial high-risk features or with at least 1 relapse. The conventional karyotype was compared to the ""molecular karyotype"" to assess abnormalities as interpreted by classical cytogenetics. Not only were previously undetected chromosome losses and gains identified by microarray, but several karyotypes interpreted by classical cytogenetics were shown to be discordant with the microarray results. The complementary use of microarray and conventional cytogenetics would allow for more sensitive, comprehensive, and accurate analysis of the underlying genetic profile, with concomitant improvement in prognosis and treatment, not only for pediatric all, but for neoplastic disorders in general.","['Dawson, A J', 'Yanofsky, R', 'Vallente, R', 'Bal, S', 'Schroedter, I', 'Liang, L', 'Mai, S']","['Dawson AJ', 'Yanofsky R', 'Vallente R', 'Bal S', 'Schroedter I', 'Liang L', 'Mai S']","['Cytogenetics Laboratory, Diagnostic Services Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Switzerland,Curr Oncol,"Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",9502503,,,,PMC3185902,2011/10/08 06:00,2011/10/08 06:01,['2011/10/08 06:00'],"['2011/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/08 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3747/co.v18i5.770 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Oncol. 2011 Oct;18(5):e210-7. doi: 10.3747/co.v18i5.770.,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'acgh', 'chromosomes', 'microarray']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Coimmunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments demonstrated that NPM forms a complex with FOXM1 and also identified the regions responsible for their interaction. Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed the interaction between FOXM1 and NPM in cancer and immortal cells. Furthermore, knockdown of NPM in immortal and cancer cells led to significant down-regulation of FOXM1 similar to its levels in normal cells, suggesting that NPM might modulate FOXM1 level. In addition, in OCI/AML3 leukemia cells where mutant NPM is localized in the cytoplasm we found that typically nuclear FOXM1 was predominantly co-localized with NPM in the cytoplasm, while NPM knockdown led to the disappearance of FOXM1 from the cytoplasm, suggesting that NPM may also determine intracellular localization of FOXM1. Knockdown of FOXM1 or NPM in MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells inhibited anchorage-dependent and independent growth in cell culture, and tumor growth in nude mice. In addition, over-expression of FOXM1 reversed the effect of NPM knockdown in vitro. Our data suggest that in cancer cells NPM interacts with FOXM1 and their interaction is required for sustaining the level and localization of FOXM1. Targeting the interaction between FOXM1 and NPM by peptides or small molecules may represent a novel therapeutic strategy against cancer.","['Bhat, Uppoor G', 'Jagadeeswaran, Ramasamy', 'Halasi, Marianna', 'Gartel, Andrei L']","['Bhat UG', 'Jagadeeswaran R', 'Halasi M', 'Gartel AL']","['Department of Medicine, University of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois 60612.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois 60612.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois 60612; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois 60607.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois 60612; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois 60607; Departments of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois 60612.

A model for the DNMT3A homotetramer was developed via computational interface scanning and tested using light scattering and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Distinct oligomeric states were functionally characterized using fluorescence anisotropy and steady-state kinetics. Replacement of residues that result in DNMT3A dimers, including those identified in AML patients, show minor changes in methylation activity but lose the capacity for processive catalysis on multisite DNA substrates, unlike the highly processive wild-type enzyme. Our results are consistent with the bimodal distribution of DNA methylation in vivo and the loss of clustered methylation in AML patients. Tetramerization with the known interacting partner DNMT3L rescues processive catalysis, demonstrating that protein binding at the DNMT3A tetramer interface can modulate methylation patterning.

Deregulation of Notch signaling determines several human disorders, including cancer. In the last decade it became evident that Notch signaling plays pivotal roles in the onset and development of T- and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia by regulating the intracellular molecular pathways involved in leukemia cell survival and proliferation. On the other hand, bone marrow stromal cells are equally necessary for leukemia cell survival by preventing blast cell apoptosis and favoring their reciprocal interactions and cross-talk with bone marrow microenvironment. Quite surprisingly, the link between Notch signaling pathway and bone marrow stromal cells in acute lymphoblastic leukemia has been pointed out only recently. In fact, bone marrow stromal cells express Notch receptors and ligands, through which they can interact with and influence normal and leukemia T- and B-cell survival. Here, the data concerning the development of T- and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia has been critically reviewed in light of the most recent findings on Notch signaling in stromal microenvironment.","['Nwabo Kamdje, Armel Herve', 'Krampera, Mauro']","['Nwabo Kamdje AH', 'Krampera M']","['Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Policlinico G.B.

Since the first results with histone-deacetylase inhibitors in AML are controversial, novel single and combined treatments need to be explored. It is tempting to combine chromatin-targeting drugs. SUV39H1, the main methyl-transferase for lysine 9 tri-methylation on histone H3, interacts with oncogenes involved in AML and acts as a transcriptional repressor for hematopoietic differentiation and immortalization. We report here that pharmacological inhibition of SUV39H1 by chaetocin induces apoptosis in leukemia cell lines in vitro and primary AML cells ex vivo, and that it interferes with leukemia growth in vivo. Chaetocin treatment upregulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) production as well as the transcription of death-receptor-related genes, in a ROS-dependent manner, leading to death receptor-dependent apoptosis. In addition to its direct inhibition by chaetocin, SUV39H1 is indirectly modulated by chaetocin-induced ROS. Accordingly, chaetocin potentiates other anti-AML drugs, in a ROS-dependent manner. The decryption of a dual mechanism of action against AML involving both direct and indirect SUV39H1 modulation represents an innovative read-out for the anticancer activity of chaetocin and for its synergy with other anti-AML drugs, suggesting new therapeutic combination strategies in AML.","['Chaib, H', 'Nebbioso, A', 'Prebet, T', 'Castellano, R', 'Garbit, S', 'Restouin, A', 'Vey, N', 'Altucci, L', 'Collette, Y']","['Chaib H', 'Nebbioso A', 'Prebet T', 'Castellano R', 'Garbit S', 'Restouin A', 'Vey N', 'Altucci L', 'Collette Y']","['Inserm, U891, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111007,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptors, Death Domain)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '28097-03-2 (chaetocin)', 'EC 2.1.1.

The involvement of miRNAs in normal hematopoiesis implies that deregulated miRNAs might contribute to leukemogenesis. To date, although certain miRNAs have been established a clear oncogenic role in hematological malignancies, other individual miRNAs potentially involved in human leukemogenesis still remain elusive. In this report, we showed that miR-142-3p was upregulated in human T-leukemic cell lines and primary T-leukemic cells isolated from T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients and its expressive levels were correlated with patients' prognosis. Such an oncogenic role of miR-142-3p could be explained by its targeting cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) and glucocorticoid receptor alpha (GRalpha). High levels of miR-142-3p resulted in low levels of cAMP and weak activity of PKA, thus relieving the inhibitory effect of PKA on T-leukemic cell proliferation. Meanwhile, miR-142-3p decreased GRalpha protein expression by directly targeting the 3'-untranslational region of GRalpha mRNA, leading to glucocorticoid resistance. Transfection of the miR-142-3p inhibitor effectively converted glucocorticoid resistance, because of the resultant increase of GRalpha expression and PKA activity. These findings suggest that miR-142-3p is critical in T-cell leukemogenesis and may serve as a potential therapeutic target in T-ALL patients.","['Lv, M', 'Zhang, X', 'Jia, H', 'Li, D', 'Zhang, B', 'Zhang, H', 'Hong, M', 'Jiang, T', 'Jiang, Q', 'Lu, J', 'Huang, X', 'Huang, B']","['Lv M', 'Zhang X', 'Jia H', 'Li D', 'Zhang B', 'Zhang H', 'Hong M', 'Jiang T', 'Jiang Q', 'Lu J', 'Huang X', 'Huang B']","[""Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, The People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111007,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (MIRN142 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (glucocorticoid receptor alpha)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclic AMP/*physiology', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/*physiology', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/analysis/*physiology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*etiology/genetics', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",,2011/10/08 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2011/10/08 06:00'],"['2011/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011273 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.273 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Apr;26(4):769-77. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.273.

What is currently debated is whether a trial of re-induction chemotherapy prior to transplantation is beneficial. Data from multiple retrospective analyses have shown that pretreatment variables are useful in predicting response to salvage chemotherapy. For patients unlikely to respond, re-induction attempts may be detrimental, leading to added organ toxicity and possible increased tumor resistance. Allogeneic transplantation in the setting of active disease is the alternative strategy. Multiple studies have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach, but cure rates have been low with the use of traditional transplant approaches. Newer strategies employing allogeneic transplantation earlier in patients with relapsed or refractory AML, as well as the incorporation of novel and effective antileukemic agents into the transplant conditioning regimen, may lead to better outcomes.","['Feldman, E J', 'Gergis, Usama']","['Feldman EJ', 'Gergis U']","['Weill Cornell Medical College and New York-Presbyterian Hospital, 520 E. 70th Street, New York, NY 10021, USA. ejf2001@med.cornell.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Management', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', '*Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/prevention & control/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods']",,2011/10/08 06:00,2012/04/04 06:00,['2011/10/08 06:00'],"['2011/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11899-011-0101-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2012 Mar;7(1):74-7. doi: 10.1007/s11899-011-0101-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because the cellular microenvironment can protect CLL cells from drug-induced apoptosis, it is important to evaluate the effect of novel drugs in this context. Here we characterized the in vitro cytotoxic effects of sorafenib on CLL cells and the underlying mechanism in the presence of marrow stromal cells (MSCs) and nurselike cells (NLCs). One single dose of 10 mumol/L or the repeated addition of 1 mumol/L sorafenib caused caspase-dependent apoptosis and reduced levels of phosphorylated B-RAF, C-RAF, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1) in CLL cells in the presence of the microenvironment. We show that the RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/ERK pathway can modulate Mcl-1 expression and contribute to CLL cell viability, thereby associating so-rafenib cytotoxicity to its impact on RAF and Mcl-1. To evaluate if the other targets of sorafenib can affect CLL cell viability and contribute to sorafenib-mediated cytotoxicity, we tested the sensitivity of CLL cells to several kinase inhibitors specific for these targets. Our data show that RAF and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) but not KIT, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) are critical for CLL cell viability. Taken together, our data suggest that sorafenib exerts its cytotoxic effect likely via inhibition of the VEGFR and RAF/MEK/ERK pathways, both of which can modulate Mcl-1 expression in CLL cells. Furthermore, sorafenib induced apoptosis of CLL cells from fludarabine refractory patients in the presence of NLCs or MSCs. Our results warrant further clinical exploration of sorafenib in CLL.","['Fecteau, Jessie-F', 'Bharati, Ila S', ""O'Hayre, Morgan"", 'Handel, Tracy M', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Messmer, Davorka']","['Fecteau JF', 'Bharati IS', ""O'Hayre M"", 'Handel TM', 'Kipps TJ', 'Messmer D']","['Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120210,England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,"['0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (raf Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzenesulfonates/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/metabolism', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Sorafenib', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'raf Kinases/*metabolism']",PMC3269641,2011/10/08 06:00,2012/06/02 06:00,['2011/10/08 06:00'],"['2011/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/02 06:00 [medline]']","['molmed.2011.00164 [pii]', '10.2119/molmed.2011.00164 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Med. 2012 Feb 10;18:19-28. doi: 10.2119/molmed.2011.00164.,,,,"['P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI037113/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI37113/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Within one year, benefits of x-rays, such as visualization of fractures, and detriments, such as x-ray dermatitis, were recognized. Nobel Laureates Pierre and Marie Sklodowska Curie discovered the radioactive element radium in 1898, and a year later the application of radiation to cure cancer was reported. A significant price was paid for this: Marie Curie died of aplastic anemia related to her radiation exposure, and her daughter Irene Joliot Curie, Nobelist for radiochemical research, died of radiation-induced leukemia. Internationally developed radiation protection recommendations were formalized starting in the late 1920s. The increasing use of ionizing radiation in medical diagnosis and radiation therapy has brought significant societal benefits. Known risks of therapeutic radiation include coronary artery disease and secondary malignancy. However, recently concerns have been raised of possible very small but incremental increases in malignancies due to diagnostic medical radiation. Patients are largely unaware of, and referring physicians and even radiologists often underestimate, the carcinogenic effects of radiation. There is a need to determine the appropriateness of imaging tests that use ionizing radiation prior to performance; optimize imaging protocols to reduce unnecessary radiation; include patients in the decision process and encourage and enable them to track their radiation exposure; and promote education about medical radiation to patients, referring physicians, radiologists, and members of the public. The basic radiation protection principles of justification, optimization, and application of dose limits still pertain.","['Timins, Julie K']",['Timins JK'],"['Diagnostic Radiology, 20 Footes Lane, Morristown, NJ 07960, USA. jtmns@verizon.net']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Health Phys,Health physics,2985093R,,IM,"['*Communication', 'Environmental Exposure/*analysis/history', 'Female', 'History, 19th Century', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Internationality', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/history', 'Nuclear Physics/history/*methods', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Injuries/history/*prevention & control', 'Radiation Protection/history', 'Radiography/history/*methods', 'Radiotherapy/history/methods', 'Risk Assessment', 'Safety Management/history/methods', 'X-Rays']",,2011/10/08 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/10/08 06:00'],"['2011/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/HP.0b013e3182259a71 [doi]', '00004032-201111000-00014 [pii]']",ppublish,Health Phys. 2011 Nov;101(5):562-5. doi: 10.1097/HP.0b013e3182259a71.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, using bipotent K562 human leukemia cells and human CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells as research models, we demonstrate that let-7 and Lin28 have contrary roles in megakaryocytic (MK) differentiation with a dynamic balance; expression of miR-181 is capable of effectively repressing Lin28 expression, disrupting the Lin28-let-7 reciprocal regulatory loop, upregulating let-7, and eventually promoting MK differentiation. However, miR-181 lacks a significant effect on hemin-induced erythrocyte differentiation.

However, because this cell line was derived from the blood of a patient with acute monocytic leukemia, the extent to which THP-1 cells mimic monocytes and macrophages in the vasculature is not entirely known. This article serves as a meaningful attempt to address this question by reviewing the recent publications. The interactions between THP-1 cells and various vascular cells (such as endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, adipocytes, and T cells) provide insight into the roles of the interconnection of monocytes-macrophages with other vascular cells during vascular inflammation, particularly atherogenesis and obesity. Transcriptome, microRNA profile, and histone modifications of THP-1 cells shed new light on the regulatory mechanism of the monocytes-macrophages in response to various inflammatory mediators, such as oxidized low density lipoprotein, lipopolysaccharide, and glucose. These studies hint that under certain defined conditions, THP-1 cells not only resemble primary monocytes-macrophages isolated from healthy donors or donors with disease, such as diabetes mellitus, but also mimic the in situ alteration of macrophages in the adipose tissue of obese subjects and in atherosclerotic lesions. A potential trajectory is to use this cell line to study the novel molecular mechanisms in monocytes and macrophages in relation to the physiology and pathophysiology of the cardiovascular system, however, the conclusion of studies employing THP-1 cells requires further verification using primary cells and/or in vivo models to be generalized to monocytes and macrophages.","['Qin, Zhenyu']",['Qin Z'],"['Division of Vascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, 7703 Floyd Curl Drive, San Antonio, TX 78229, United States. qinz@uthscsa.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20110909,Ireland,Atherosclerosis,Atherosclerosis,0242543,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['Adipocytes/pathology', 'Blood Platelets/pathology', 'Blood Vessels/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Endothelial Cells/pathology', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Macrophages/metabolism/*pathology', 'MicroRNAs/metabolism', 'Monocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Myocytes, Smooth Muscle/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Vascular Diseases/genetics/metabolism/*pathology']",,2011/10/08 06:00,2012/06/13 06:00,['2011/10/08 06:00'],"['2011/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/16 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9150(11)00859-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.09.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Atherosclerosis. 2012 Mar;221(1):2-11. doi: 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.09.003.

We have recently reported that AE possesses a differentiative potential on melanoma cells. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible modulation of defined markers of monocytic differentiation of AE on human U937 cell line. MAIN METHODS: U937 cells differentiation has been confirmed unequivocally by Griess and nitroblue tetrazolium reduction assays, protoporphyrin IX accumulation, expression of CD14 and CD11b surface antigens, phagocytic activity, migration and attachment ability. The effect on polyamine metabolism, apoptosis and cytokine production was also investigated. KEY FINDINGS: We showed that AE-treated U937 cells exhibit a noticeably rise in transglutaminase activity. This enhanced enzyme activity correlates with AE-induced growth arrest and differentiation to functionally mature monocytes. SIGNIFICANCE: Taken together, the results reported here show that AE can promote the macrophage differentiation of U937 cells, suggesting that this anthraquinone could be a potential candidate as a differentiation-inducing selective agent for therapeutic treatment of leukemia.","['Tabolacci, Claudio', 'Oliverio, Serafina', 'Lentini, Alessandro', 'Rossi, Stefania', 'Galbiati, Alice', 'Montesano, Carla', 'Mattioli, Palma', 'Provenzano, Bruno', 'Facchiano, Francesco', 'Beninati, Simone']","['Tabolacci C', 'Oliverio S', 'Lentini A', 'Rossi S', 'Galbiati A', 'Montesano C', 'Mattioli P', 'Provenzano B', 'Facchiano F', 'Beninati S']","['Department of Biology, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", Via della Ricerca Scientifica, 00133 Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110924,Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,"['0 (Anthraquinones)', '0 (Biogenic Polyamines)', '0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Nitrites)', '0 (Protoporphyrins)', '298-83-9 (Nitroblue Tetrazolium)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', 'C2K325S808 (protoporphyrin IX)', 'C8IYT9CR7C (aloe emodin)', 'EC 1.5.- (Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors)', 'EC 1.5.3.- (polyamine oxidase)', 'EC 2.3.2.13 (Transglutaminases)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)']",IM,"['Anthraquinones/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biogenic Polyamines/metabolism', 'CD11b Antigen/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/metabolism', 'Macrophages/drug effects', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism', 'Nitrites/metabolism', 'Nitroblue Tetrazolium', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/metabolism', 'Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors/metabolism', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'Protoporphyrins/metabolism', 'Transglutaminases/metabolism', 'Transport Vesicles/physiology', 'U937 Cells']",,2011/10/08 06:00,2011/12/15 06:00,['2011/10/08 06:00'],"['2011/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/02 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0024-3205(11)00450-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.lfs.2011.09.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 2011 Nov 21;89(21-22):812-20. doi: 10.1016/j.lfs.2011.09.008.

The relationship between total body irradiation (TBI) treatment and mtDNA alterations in vivo, however, has not been postulated yet. The aim of this study is to analyze mtDNA alterations in irradiated human peripheral lymphocytes from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients as well as to take them as predictors for radiation toxicity. METHODS: Peripheral blood lymphocytes were isolated from 26 ALL patients 24 hours after TBI preconditioning (4.5 and 9 Gy, respectively). Extracted DNA was analyzed by real-time PCR method. RESULTS: Average 2.31 times mtDNA and 0.53 fold CD levels were observed after 4.5 Gy exposure compared to their basal levels. 9 Gy TBI produced a greater response of both mtDNA and CD levels than 4.5 Gy. Significant inverse correlation was found between mtDNA content and CD level at 4.5 and 9 Gy (P = 0.037 and 0.048). Moreover, mtDNA content of lymphocytes without irradiation was found to be correlated to age.

However, several biological features, among which is the tendency to trigger innate immune response, limit the development of highly efficient peptide-based drug delivery vectors. This study aims to evaluate the influence of transportan 10 (TP10) and its chemically modified derivatives, PepFects (PFs), on the innate immune response of the host system. PFs have shown high efficiency in nucleic acid delivery in vitro and in vivo; hence, the estimation of their possible toxic side effects would be of particular interest. In this study, we analyzed cytotoxic and immunogenic response of PF3, PF4, and PF6 peptides in monocytic leukemia and peripheral blood mononuclear cell lines. In comparison with amphipathic PFs, TP10, TAT, stearyl-(RxR)(4) peptides, and the most widely used transfection reagents Lipofectamine 2000 and Lipofectamine RNAiMAX were also analyzed in this study. IL-1beta, IL-18, and TNF-alpha cytokine release was detected using highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cell viability was detected by measuring the activity of cellular enzymes that reduce water-soluble tetrazolium salts to formazan dyes and apoptosis was evaluated by measuring the levels of caspase-1 and caspase-3/7 over untreated cells. All peptides were found to be nontoxic and nonimmunogenic in vitro at the concentrations of 10 muM and 5 muM, respectively, and at a dose of 5 mg/kg in vivo, suggesting that these CPPs exhibit a promising potential in the delivery of therapeutic molecules into the cell without risks of toxicity and inflammatory reactions.","['Suhorutsenko, Julia', 'Oskolkov, Nikita', 'Arukuusk, Piret', 'Kurrikoff, Kaido', 'Eriste, Elo', 'Copolovici, Dana-Maria', 'Langel, Ulo']","['Suhorutsenko J', 'Oskolkov N', 'Arukuusk P', 'Kurrikoff K', 'Eriste E', 'Copolovici DM', 'Langel U']","['Institute of Technology, Tartu University, Nooruse 1, Tartu, Estonia. julia.suhorutsenko@ut.ee']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111010,United States,Bioconjug Chem,Bioconjugate chemistry,9010319,"['0 (Cell-Penetrating Peptides)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Interleukin-18)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Wasp Venoms)', '0 (transportan)', '88813-36-9 (Galanin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cell-Penetrating Peptides/chemistry/genetics/*immunology/*toxicity', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Carriers/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/methods', 'Female', 'Galanin/chemistry/*immunology/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-18/immunology', 'Interleukin-1beta/immunology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'Lipopeptides/chemistry/immunology/toxicity', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/*immunology/*toxicity', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/immunology', 'Wasp Venoms/chemistry/*immunology/*toxicity']",,2011/10/08 06:00,2012/03/20 06:00,['2011/10/08 06:00'],"['2011/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/bc200293d [doi]'],ppublish,Bioconjug Chem. 2011 Nov 16;22(11):2255-62. doi: 10.1021/bc200293d.

However, further comprehensive research is needed to better understand cell signaling during the differentiation of pluripotent cells into different cell lineages and accordingly to develop clinically applicable protocols. One of the limiting steps for differentiation studies is proper culture and expansion of pluripotent stem cells, which is labor intensive, expensive, and requires a great deal of expertise. This limiting step can be overcome by successful banking and distribution of embryoid bodies (EBs), which are aggregates of pluripotent stem cells and typically the starting point of differentiation protocols. The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of EB banking by studying survival and functionality of cryopreserved EBs. To this end, EBs were formed by culturing mouse 129 embryonic stem (ES) cells in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in hanging drops and then subjected to different cryopreservation protocols. In a series of experiments, we first tested the postthaw survival of EBs as a function of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and extracellular trehalose concentrations and cooling rates. Next, we studied the functionality of cryopreserved EBs by assessing their postthaw attachment, growth, and differentiation into various cell types. Higher (>/=5%) DMSO concentrations alone or in combination with trehalose (0.1 M and 0.2 M) yielded good postthaw survival rates of >80%, whereas cooling of EBs at 1 degrees C/min in the presence of 5% DMSO +0.1 M trehalose gave the best attachment and growth rates, with differentiation into cell lineages of three germ layers. Taken together, our results suggest that EBs are tolerant to cryopreservation-associated stresses and retain their differentiation potential after freezing and thawing. Furthermore, our experiments with dissociated EB cells and nondissociated EBs suggest that the extracellular matrix may play a beneficial role in the cryotolerance of EBs. Overall, our data support the feasibility of EB banking, which would facilitate advancement of cell-based therapies.","['Sharma, Shruti', 'Szurek, Edyta A', 'Rzucidlo, Jacek S', 'Liour, Sean S', 'Eroglu, Ali']","['Sharma S', 'Szurek EA', 'Rzucidlo JS', 'Liour SS', 'Eroglu A']","['Institute of Molecular Medicine and Genetics, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Georgia, Georgia Health Sciences University, Augusta, Georgia, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111006,United States,Rejuvenation Res,Rejuvenation research,101213381,"['0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy/*methods', 'Cryopreservation/*methods', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/chemistry', 'Embryoid Bodies/*cytology', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Fluorescent Dyes/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Mice', '*Tissue Banks']",,2011/10/08 06:00,2012/04/18 06:00,['2011/10/08 06:00'],"['2011/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/rej.2011.1186 [doi]'],ppublish,Rejuvenation Res. 2011 Dec;14(6):641-9. doi: 10.1089/rej.2011.1186.

Viruses are among the putative environmental triggers of T1D. The mechanisms regulating beta cell responses to viruses, however, remain to be defined. We have presently clarified the signaling pathways leading to beta cell apoptosis following exposure to the viral mimetic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and a diabetogenic enterovirus (Coxsackievirus B5). Internal dsRNA induces cell death via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. In this process, activation of the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) promotes eIF2alpha phosphorylation and protein synthesis inhibition, leading to downregulation of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1). Mcl-1 decrease results in the release of the BH3-only protein Bim, which activates the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Indeed, Bim knockdown prevented both dsRNA- and Coxsackievirus B5-induced beta cell death, and counteracted the proapoptotic effects of Mcl-1 silencing. These observations indicate that the balance between Mcl-1 and Bim is a key factor regulating beta cell survival during diabetogenic viral infections.","['Colli, Maikel L', 'Nogueira, Tatiane C', 'Allagnat, Florent', 'Cunha, Daniel A', 'Gurzov, Esteban N', 'Cardozo, Alessandra K', 'Roivainen, Merja', 'Op de Beeck, Anne', 'Eizirik, Decio L']","['Colli ML', 'Nogueira TC', 'Allagnat F', 'Cunha DA', 'Gurzov EN', 'Cardozo AK', 'Roivainen M', 'Op de Beeck A', 'Eizirik DL']","['Laboratory of Experimental Medicine, Medical Faculty, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110922,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, rat)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, rat)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Double-Stranded)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Coxsackievirus Infections/*metabolism/pathology', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/etiology/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Enterovirus B, Human/*metabolism', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Secreting Cells/*metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'RNA, Double-Stranded/*metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar']",PMC3178579,2011/10/07 06:00,2012/01/28 06:00,['2011/10/07 06:00'],"['2011/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1002267 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-11-00908 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS Pathog. 2011 Sep;7(9):e1002267. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002267.

Compressed sensing (CS) is an emerging approach in statistics and signal processing. With the CS theory, a signal can be uniquely reconstructed or approximated from its sparse representations, which can therefore better distinguish different types of signals. However, the application of CS approach to genome-wide data analysis has been rarely investigated. We propose a novel CS-based approach for genomic data classification and test its performance in the subtyping of leukemia through gene expression analysis. The detection of subtypes of cancers such as leukemia according to different genetic markups is significant, which holds promise for the individualization of therapies and improvement of treatments. In our work, four statistical features were employed to select significant genes for the classification. With our selected genes out of 7,129 ones, the proposed CS method achieved a classification accuracy of 97.4% when evaluated with the cross validation and 94.3% when evaluated with another independent data set. The robustness of the method to noise was also tested, giving good performance. Therefore, this work demonstrates that the CS method can effectively detect subtypes of leukemia, implying improved accuracy of diagnosis of leukemia.","['Tang, Wenlong', 'Cao, Hongbao', 'Duan, Junbo', 'Wang, Yu-Ping']","['Tang W', 'Cao H', 'Duan J', 'Wang YP']","['Department of Biomedical Engineering, Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana 70118, USA. wtang@tulane.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Validation Study']",,Singapore,J Bioinform Comput Biol,Journal of bioinformatics and computational biology,101187344,,IM,"['Computational Biology/methods', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Profiling/statistics & numerical data', 'Genome-Wide Association Study/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*classification/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/genetics', 'Models, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/genetics']",PMC4159949,2011/10/07 06:00,2012/01/24 06:00,['2011/10/07 06:00'],"['2011/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0219720011005689 [pii]', '10.1142/s0219720011005689 [doi]']",ppublish,J Bioinform Comput Biol. 2011 Oct;9(5):631-45. doi: 10.1142/s0219720011005689.,,,,['R21 LM010042/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States'],,['NIHMS624487'],,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Audio-recorded qualitative interviews with 30 doctors and nurses working in six UK paediatric oncology and haematology treatment centres were analysed interpretatively, drawing on the constant comparative method. RESULTS: Doctors' and nurses' descriptions of managing emotional care differed markedly. Doctors described reassuring parents through their ongoing clinical care of the child and by explaining the potentially curative nature of treatment. Doctors did not think they could reassure parents by eliciting and explicitly discussing parents' fears. In contrast, nurses relied on psychological skills and explicit discussion of parents' emotions to provide reassurance. Both doctors and nurses relied on each other to ensure that parents' emotional needs were met by the multidisciplinary team rather than by individual practitioners. CONCLUSION: Nurses' accounts of providing emotional care resembled the emphasis on explicit emotional talk in CST. However, doctors' accounts indicated that they provided emotional care in ways that diverged markedly from expectations in CST but that were more consistent with their biomedical and authoritative role in patient care. These findings may have implications for CST in future revisions of guidelines, but work is first needed to explore parents' perspectives on emotional care.","['Forsey, Mary', 'Salmon, Peter', 'Eden, Tim', 'Young, Bridget']","['Forsey M', 'Salmon P', 'Eden T', 'Young B']","['Division of Clinical Psychology, School of Population, Community and Behavioural Sciences, University of Liverpool, Brownlow Hill, Liverpool, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111004,England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,,IM,"['Child', 'Communication', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Medical Oncology/*methods', ""Nurse's Role"", 'Oncology Nursing/*methods', 'Parents/*psychology', ""Physician's Role"", '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', '*Professional-Family Relations', 'United Kingdom']",,2011/10/07 06:00,2013/08/01 06:00,['2011/10/07 06:00'],"['2010/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/10 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pon.2084 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2013 Feb;22(2):260-7. doi: 10.1002/pon.2084.

Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is currently the most efficient anti-leukemia treatment for AML and has shown a survival advantage in younger patients with intermediate- or poor-risk cytogenetics. METHODS: The authors review their experience as well as the published data regarding the role of reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allo-HCT in adults with AML. MEDLINE/PubMed and EMBASE/Ovid were searched, as well as reference lists of relevant articles, conference proceedings, and ongoing trial databases. RESULTS: Elderly patients with AML have a poor survival for all cytogenetics subgroups (except for acute promyelocytic leukemia) and higher rates of transplant-related mortality with myeloablative allo-HCT. RIC regimens have been shown to decrease procedure-related toxicity and have emerged as an attractive treatment modality in AML patients not suitable for myeloablative conditioning regimens. While prospective data comparing outcomes of AML patients undergoing RIC allo-HCT vs conventional chemotherapy alone are not yet available, RIC allo-HCT is a reasonable option for high-risk older patients and for younger AML patients with medical comorbidities who achieve a first or subsequent remission. The application of RIC for patients with refractory disease or untreated relapse as well as the use of alternative donors should be considered within the context of clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: RIC allo-HCT is a safe and effective treatment modality in high-risk elderly AML patients and in younger AML patients with medical comorbidities.","['Hamadani, Mehdi', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Kharfan-Dabaja, Mohamed A']","['Hamadani M', 'Mohty M', 'Kharfan-Dabaja MA']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV 26506, USA. shamadani@hscwvu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Cancer Control,Cancer control : journal of the Moffitt Cancer Center,9438457,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*surgery', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2011/10/07 06:00,2012/02/04 06:00,['2011/10/07 06:00'],"['2011/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/107327481101800404 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Control. 2011 Oct;18(4):237-45. doi: 10.1177/107327481101800404.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the number of UCB transplantation procedures has grown, an increasing number of publications have focused on disease-specific outcomes. METHODS: This review focuses on the outcome data following UCB transplantation in subsets of hematologic malignancies in which experience with this graft source is greater. RESULTS: Registry and single-institution reports regarding the outcomes of children and adults with acute leukemias after UCB transplantation include many patients, while data on the clinical outcomes of other leukemias are limited due in part to the small number of patients with these diseases. UCB is now routinely used as a source of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in pediatric allogeneic transplantation when a suitable sibling donor is not available. Data also support the use of UCB as an alternative source of HSC for transplantation of patients with hematologic malignancies who lack a more conventional donor. Current data also support UCB for patients who require an allograft in the setting of prospective clinical trials.

While sibling donors have been the gold standard for adult patients in need of an HCT, not all patients have a suitable family donor. The availability of unrelated volunteer donor registries and alternative stem cell sources has expanded the wide application of this procedure. METHODS: PubMed and MEDLINE were searched for human trials and the English language from 2001 to 2011. Factors influencing transplantation outcomes involving unrelated donors over the last decade are discussed, and feasible alternative stem cell sources when a matched unrelated donor is not available are reviewed. RESULTS: HCT using a matched unrelated donor offers outcomes comparable to sibling HCT due to current molecular-based HLA typing and improvements in conditioning regimens and/or supportive care. The primary factor that contributes to improved outcome is the degree of donor-to-recipient HLA matching. The selection of younger unrelated donors has also been associated with improved outcomes in HCT. Evidence supports the universal application of matched unrelated donors even in high-risk leukemia and/or older patients. In adult patients without a matched related donor, other promising options as stem cell source includes mismatched unrelated donors, umbilical cord blood units, and haploidentical donors. CONCLUSIONS: With current methodologies for molecular HLA typing and supportive care tools, outcomes of transplants with matched unrelated donors are comparable to those achieved with sibling donors. Alternative stem cell donors when a matched unrelated donor is not available are feasible expanding the stem cell donor pool.","['Perez, Lia Elena']",['Perez LE'],"['Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.

This subset of CLL-like cells is not well defined in terms of frequency. METHODS: Here, we performed a multicenter study with a panel of four-color antibody combinations possibly useful for the detection of MRD in CLL, to establish the levels of normal CLL-like cells in 49 healthy controls. ROC curves established the upper level of such cells at 4 x 10(-4) . The two best combinations were further applied to 419 samples from 117 treated CLL patients. RESULTS: The combinations CD19/CD5/CD43/CD79b and CD19/CD5/CD81/CD22 appeared very robust and well correlated to enumerate normal CLL-like cells in a lysis no-wash approach. In follow-up samples from CLL patients, they disclosed only 9.8% of the samples within the normal range. In more than 90% of the cases, it was thus possible to report confidently on the absence or presence of MRD in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: This manuscript reports on the frequency of CD19(+) CD5(+) B-cells in normal peripheral blood and confirms the combinations recommended by the European research initiative on CLL as being performing to assess remaining CLL cells above a threshold of 4 x 10(-4) white blood cells.","['Durrieu, Francoise', 'Genevieve, Franck', 'Arnoulet, Christine', 'Brumpt, Caren', 'Capiod, Jean-Claude', 'Degenne, Michel', 'Feuillard, Jean', 'Garand, Richard', 'Kara-Terki, Amina', 'Kulhein, Emilienne', 'Maynadie, Marc', 'Ochoa-Noguera, Maria-Elena', 'Plesa, Adriana', 'Roussel, Mikael', 'Eghbali, Houchingue', 'Truchan-Graczyk, Matgorzata', 'de Carvalho Bittencourt, Marcelo', 'Feugier, Pierre', 'Bene, Marie C']","['Durrieu F', 'Genevieve F', 'Arnoulet C', 'Brumpt C', 'Capiod JC', 'Degenne M', 'Feuillard J', 'Garand R', 'Kara-Terki A', 'Kulhein E', 'Maynadie M', 'Ochoa-Noguera ME', 'Plesa A', 'Roussel M', 'Eghbali H', 'Truchan-Graczyk M', 'de Carvalho Bittencourt M', 'Feugier P', 'Bene MC']","['Department of Biology, Institut Bergonie, Bordeaux, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20111004,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

This study was conducted to establish the scientific rationale for treating skin inflammation and to find active principles from A. capillaris. To accomplish these goals, the 70% ethanol extract of the aerial parts of A. capillaris (AR) was prepared and its 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) inhibitory action was studied since 5-LOX products are known to be involved in several allergic and skin inflammatory disorders. AR showed potent inhibitory activity against 5-LOX-catalyzed leukotriene production by ionophore-induced rat basophilic leukemia-1 cells, with an IC(50) of < 1.0 mug/mL. Nine major compounds, scopoletin, scopolin, scoparone, esculetin, quercetin, capillarisin, isorhamnetin, 3-O-robinobioside, isorhamnetin 3-O-galactoside and chlorogenic acid, were isolated from A. capillaris, and their effects were examined to identify the active principle(s). Several coumarin and flavonoid derivatives were found to be 5-LOX inhibitors. In particular, esculetin and quercetin were potent inhibitors, with IC(50) values of 6.6 and 0.7 muM, respectively. Against arachidonic acid-induced ear edema in mice, AR, and esculetin strongly inhibited edematic response. AR and esculetin also inhibited delayed-type hypersensitivity response in mice. In conclusion, AR and some of their major constituents are 5-LOX inhibitors, and these in vitro and in vivo activities may contribute to the therapeutic potential of AR in skin inflammatory disorders in traditional medicine.","['Kwon, Oh Song', 'Choi, Jae Sue', 'Islam, Md Nurul', 'Kim, Yeong Shik', 'Kim, Hyun Pyo']","['Kwon OS', 'Choi JS', 'Islam MN', 'Kim YS', 'Kim HP']","['College of Pharmacy, Kangwon National University, Chunchon 200-701, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111006,Korea (South),Arch Pharm Res,Archives of pharmacal research,8000036,"['0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Leukotrienes)', '0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', 'EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/*metabolism', 'Artemisia/*chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dermatitis/*drug therapy/enzymology/immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/administration & dosage/isolation & purification/*therapeutic use', 'Edema/drug therapy', 'Hypersensitivity, Delayed/*drug therapy/enzymology/immunology', 'Leukotrienes/metabolism', 'Lipoxygenase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/isolation & purification/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Molecular Structure', 'Plant Components, Aerial/chemistry', 'Rats']",,2011/10/07 06:00,2012/08/04 06:00,['2011/10/07 06:00'],"['2011/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/05/18 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12272-011-0919-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pharm Res. 2011 Sep;34(9):1561-9. doi: 10.1007/s12272-011-0919-0.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of matched sibling donor vs. no donor status for adults with ALL in first complete remission (CR1). SEARCH STRATEGY: We performed a search of CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE electronic databases in September 2010 along with handsearching of literature cited in relevant primary articles, search of abstracts from American Society of Hematology and American Society of Clinical Oncology meetings, as well as consultation with content experts in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: Review was performed by two authors, and Inclusion criteria included the following: controlled trials with donor vs. no donor comparison with assignment by genetic randomizationin adults with ALL in CR1. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data on benefits (overall survival, progression-free survival) and harms (treatment-related mortality, relapse) of compared treatments. Adverse events were considered, but analysis of individual adverse events was not possible from the reported literature. We pooled summary results from each study using a random-effects model. We assessed heterogeneity. We performed subgroup analyses for disease risk categories. We performed sensitivity analyses according to methodological quality. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 14 relevant trials were identified, consisting of a total of 3157 patients. There was a statistically significant overall survival advantage in favor of the donor versus no donor group (HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.77 to 0.97; P = 0.01), as well as significant improvement in disease-free survival in the donor group(HR 0.82; 95% CI 0.72 to 0.94; P = 0.004). Those in the donor group had significant reduction in primary disease relapse(RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.37 to 0.76; P = 0.0004) and significant increase in non-relapse mortality(RR 2.8; 95% CI 1.66 to 4.73; P = 0.001). Significant heterogeneity was detected in analysis of relapse (Chi(2) 40.51, df = 6, P < 0.00001; I(2) = 85%). In regard to methodologic quality, the majority of included studies were free of selective reporting, and performed analyses according to intention to treat. Conversely, few reported sample size calculation that informed the study design. While blinding was considered as an important domain of methodological quality, none of the studies reported on whether any of the study personnel were blinded (e.g. subjects, personnel, outcome assessors, data analysts etc). Therefore, we did not consider blinding further in the analysis of methodological quality in this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis support matched sibling donor allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation as the optimal post-remission therapy in ALL patients aged 15 years or over. This therapy offers superior overall survival and disease-free survival, and significantly reduces the risk of disease relapse, but does impose an increased risk of non-relapse mortality.

The hypothesis of a relationship between hepatitis B and lymphoid neoplasms is more recent and has been far less thoroughly explored. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between hepatitis C and B infections and B cell non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphomas. METHODS: We took advantage of the co-existence in the French administrative area of Cote d'Or of two specialized registries - one for viral hepatitis and one for haematological diseases - to conduct a population-based, cohort study covering a 12-year period. The databases were anonymized and then linked using a probabilistic model. RESULTS: There were 8234 person-years at risk in the hepatitis C cohort and 2784 in the hepatitis B cohort. We found 6 cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the hepatitis C cohort, resulting in an overall adjusted standardized incidence ratio of 3.42 (CI: 1.25-7.45). Three of these 6 cases were diffuse-large-B-cell-lymphoma. Cirrhosis was associated with a higher risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the hepatitis C cohort (relative risk=8.4, p<0.01, using a Poisson regression). We found one case of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia amongst the hepatitis B carriers. CONCLUSION: Hepatitis C carriers are at a higher risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma than the general population. The role of cirrhosis and the association between hepatitis B and lymphoid malignancies deserve to be further assessed.","['Proby, Claire', 'Minello, Anne', 'Quantin, Catherine', 'Jooste, Valerie', 'Binquet, Christine', 'Hagi, Mathieu', 'Mounier, Morgane', 'Benzenine, Eric', 'Hillon, Patrick', 'Maynadie, Marc']","['Proby C', 'Minello A', 'Quantin C', 'Jooste V', 'Binquet C', 'Hagi M', 'Mounier M', 'Benzenine E', 'Hillon P', 'Maynadie M']","[""Registre des hemopathies malignes de Cote d'Or, EA 4184, Faculte de medecine, Dijon, France. claire.proby@gmail.com""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20111004,Netherlands,Dig Liver Dis,Digestive and liver disease : official journal of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology and the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver,100958385,,IM,"['Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'France/epidemiology', 'Hepatitis, Chronic/*complications/epidemiology/virology', 'Hepatitis, Viral, Human/*complications', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Population Surveillance', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",,2011/10/07 06:00,2012/05/30 06:00,['2011/10/07 06:00'],"['2011/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/23 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S1590-8658(11)00336-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.dld.2011.08.025 [doi]']",ppublish,Dig Liver Dis. 2012 Feb;44(2):160-5. doi: 10.1016/j.dld.2011.08.025.

However, in spite of the many pro-apoptotic proteins with proposed binding to Mcl-1, the specific interactions by which Mcl-1 regulates primary T-cell survival under different conditions have not been fully explored. Further, how different trophic cytokines modulate the specific role(s) of Mcl-1 is unknown. Here, we use genetic mouse models to dissect the roles of Mcl-1 in primary T lymphocytes. Using the inducible Mcl-1-floxed estrogen receptor-Cre fusion protein (Mcl-1(f/f)ERCre) deletion system in combination with genetic modification of other B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family members, we show that loss of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer (Bak) rescues the survival of Mcl-1-deficient T cells in the presence of IL-7. Without IL-7, the survival of Mcl-1-deficient cells cannot be rescued by loss of Bak, but is partially rescued by overexpression of Bcl-2 or loss of Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death (Bim). Thus, Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 have a shared role, the inhibition of Bim, in promoting T-cell survival during cytokine withdrawal. Finally, we show that other common gamma-chain (gammac) cytokines differentially modulate the roles of Mcl-1. IL-15 has effects similar to those of IL-7 in memory T cells and naive CD8(+) cells, but not naive CD4(+) cells. However, IL-4 maintains Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 but also upregulates Bim and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), thus altering the cell's dependence on Mcl-1.","['Dunkle, A', 'Dzhagalov, I', 'He, Y-W']","['Dunkle A', 'Dzhagalov I', 'He YW']","['Department of Immunology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111006,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Cytokines/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism/*physiology']",PMC3219091,2011/10/07 06:00,2012/04/11 06:00,['2011/10/07 06:00'],"['2011/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/11 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis201195 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2011.95 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2011 Oct 6;2:e214. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2011.95.,,,,['R01 AI074754/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

PML NBs have been implicated in the modulation of transcription and the association of reporter plasmids with PML NBs has been implicated in repression of reporter activity. Additionally, repression of various reporters in the presence of LMP1 has been noted. This study demonstrates that LMP1 suppresses expression of reporter activity in a dose responsive manner and corresponds with the LMP1 induced increase in PML NB intensity. Disruption of PML NBs with arsenic trioxide or a PML siRNA restores reporter activity. These data offer an explanation for previously conflicting data on LMP1 signaling and calls attention to the possibility of false-positives and false-negatives when using reporter assays as a research tool in cells expressing LMP1.","['Sides, Mark D', 'Block, Gregory J', 'Chadwick, Reid W', 'Shan, Bin', 'Flemington, Erik K', 'Lasky, Joseph A']","['Sides MD', 'Block GJ', 'Chadwick RW', 'Shan B', 'Flemington EK', 'Lasky JA']","['Department of Medicine, Section of Pulmonary Disease and Critical Care, Tulane University School of Medicine, 1430 Tulane Avenue, New Orleans, LA 70112, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111005,England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (EBV-associated membrane antigen, Epstein-Barr virus)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/complications/genetics/*metabolism/virology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/*drug effects', 'Gene Silencing/drug effects', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/complications/genetics/*metabolism/virology', 'Luciferases/analysis', 'Nuclear Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Oxides/pharmacology', 'Plasmids/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'beta-Galactosidase/analysis']",PMC3204298,2011/10/07 06:00,2012/01/13 06:00,['2011/10/07 06:00'],"['2011/09/25 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1743-422X-8-461 [pii]', '10.1186/1743-422X-8-461 [doi]']",epublish,Virol J. 2011 Oct 5;8:461. doi: 10.1186/1743-422X-8-461.,,,,['R01 CA138268/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Forty-two extramedullary lesions found in 24 leukemic patients treated with RT were reviewed. The radiation was delivered usually 2 Gy/day, up to a median of 20 Gy (range: 18.0-40.8). The clinical response and symptom palliation effect were analyzed. The factors affecting the response were also included in the analysis. RESULTS: After a median time of 7.9 weeks, the overall response rate was 76.2%. A complete response (CR) was achieved in 35.7%, a partial response in 40.5%. The symptom was relieved in 85.7% sites. The overall response rate was better in patients whose initial tumor size was smaller than 10 cm2 (p = 0.010) or who were treated with more than 25 Gy (p = 0.031). The overall CR rate was also higher in those who had smaller tumors (smaller than 6 cm or 30 cm2) (p = 0.015), or when the tumor was located in soft tissue (p = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS: Extramedullary lesions in leukemic patients can be successfully treated with RT. The tumor response rate was excellent and symptom relief was achieved in almost all patients. There was a better response to treatment when the tumor was small or it was located in soft tissue. Although, there was no definite correlation between volume reduction and total dose, it seems that higher total dose more of than 25 Gy is needed for better response.","['Song, Jin Ho', 'Son, Seok Hyun', 'Lee, Ju Hwan', 'Chung, Su Mi', 'Jang, Hong Seok', 'Choi, Byung Ock']","['Song JH', 'Son SH', 'Lee JH', 'Chung SM', 'Jang HS', 'Choi BO']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111006,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia/mortality/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Palliative Care', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC3196724,2011/10/07 06:00,2012/02/01 06:00,['2011/10/07 06:00'],"['2011/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-11-428 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-11-428 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2011 Oct 6;11:428. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-11-428.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conditioned media from the zinc-treated HL-CZ cells induced ICAM-1 protein expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Zinc treatment induced chemokine and inflammatory cytokine release from HL-CZ cells. Inhibition of NFkappaB activity by over-expression of IkappaBalpha in HL-CZ cells did not block the conditioned medium-induced ICAM-1 protein expression in HUVEC cells. Zinc treatment induced activation of multiple immune response-related transcription factors in HL-CZ cells. These results clearly show that zinc ions induce chemokine and inflammatory cytokine release from human promonocytes, accompanied with activation of multiple immune response-related transcription factors. Our in vitro evidence in the zinc-induced inflammatory responses of vascular cells provides a critical linkage between zinc exposure and pathogenesis of those inflammatory vascular diseases.","['Tsou, Tsui-Chun', 'Chao, How-Ran', 'Yeh, Szu-Ching', 'Tsai, Feng-Yuan', 'Lin, Ho-Jane']","['Tsou TC', 'Chao HR', 'Yeh SC', 'Tsai FY', 'Lin HJ']","['Division of Environmental Health and Occupational Medicine, National Health Research Institutes, Zhunan, Miaoli 350, Taiwan. tctsou@nhri.org.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110919,Netherlands,J Hazard Mater,Journal of hazardous materials,9422688,"['0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', 'EC 1.13.12.7 (Luciferases, Firefly)', 'FM5526K07A (Zinc Acetate)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemokines/genetics/*metabolism', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Cytokines/genetics/metabolism', 'Endothelium, Vascular/drug effects/immunology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/*biosynthesis', 'Luciferases, Firefly/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocyte-Macrophage Precursor Cells/*drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Zinc/*toxicity', 'Zinc Acetate/toxicity']",,2011/10/07 06:00,2012/03/17 06:00,['2011/10/07 06:00'],"['2011/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/08 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0304-3894(11)01135-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.09.035 [doi]']",ppublish,J Hazard Mater. 2011 Nov 30;196:335-41. doi: 10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.09.035.

This phytochemical has been intensively studied as an efficient antioxidant and anticancer agent, and a variety of substituted stilbenes have been developed in order to improve the potency of resveratrol. In this work, we described the synthesis of 3,4,4 -trihydroxy-trans-stilbene (3,4,4'-THS), an analogue of resveratrol, and studied its antioxidant and cytotoxic activity in vitro. 3,4,4 -THS was much more efficient than resveratrol in protecting against free radical-induced lipid peroxidation, photo-sensitized DNA oxidative damage, and free radical-induced hemolysis of human red blood cells. More potent growth inhibition in cultured human leukemia cells (HL-60) was also observed for 3,4,4 -THS. The relationship between the antioxidant efficiency and cytotoxic activity was discussed, with the emphasis on inhibition of the free radical enzyme ribonucleotide reductase by antioxidants. The result that this subtle structure modification of resveratrol drastically improves its bioactivity provides important strategy to develop novel resveratrol-based molecules.","['Cai, Wenqing', 'Zhang, Liangwei', 'Song, Yanlin', 'Zhang, Baoxin', 'Cui, Xuemei', 'Hu, Guanming', 'Fang, Jianguo']","['Cai W', 'Zhang L', 'Song Y', 'Zhang B', 'Cui X', 'Hu G', 'Fang J']","['State Key Laboratory of Applied Organic Chemistry, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111025,England,Free Radic Res,Free radical research,9423872,"[""0 (3,4,4'-trihydroxystilbene)"", '0 (Anisoles)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '9KJL21T0QJ (Linoleic Acid)', 'B3W693GAZH (anisole)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Anisoles/chemistry', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Free Radicals/chemistry', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Hemolysis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Linoleic Acid/chemistry', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Molecular Structure', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,2011/10/07 06:00,2012/03/07 06:00,['2011/10/07 06:00'],"['2011/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10715762.2011.629199 [doi]'],ppublish,Free Radic Res. 2011 Nov;45(11-12):1379-87. doi: 10.3109/10715762.2011.629199.

METHODS: Completeness of Indigenous identification was assessed for the eight Australian cancer registries using an innovative indirect assessment method based on registry-specific registration rates for smoking-related cancers. National age-standardised incidence rates and rate ratios (Indigenous:non-Indigenous) were calculated for all cancers combined and 26 individual cancer sites. Multivariate regression analysis was used to investigate trends in Indigenous cancer incidence by time or remoteness of residence, and whether the incidence rate ratio (Indigenous:non-Indigenous) was different in younger than older age-groups. RESULTS: Four registries covering 84% of the Indigenous population had sufficiently complete Indigenous identification to be included in analysis. Compared to other Australians, Indigenous Australians had much higher incidence of lung and other smoking-related cancers, cervix, uterus and liver cancer, but much lower incidence of breast, prostate, testis, colorectal and brain cancer, melanoma of skin, lymphoma and leukaemia. Incidence was higher in remote areas for some cancers (including several smoking-related cancers) but lower for others. The incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for smoking-related cancers were higher in younger than older people. CONCLUSIONS: Indigenous Australians have a different pattern of incidence of specific cancers than other Australians and large geographical variations for several cancers. IMPLICATIONS: All cancer registries need to further improve Indigenous identification, but national Indigenous cancer incidence statistics can, and should, be regularly reported. Tobacco control is a critical cancer-control issue for Indigenous Australians.","['Zhang, Xiaohua', 'Condon, John R', 'Rumbold, Alice R', 'Cunningham, Joan', 'Roder, David M']","['Zhang X', 'Condon JR', 'Rumbold AR', 'Cunningham J', 'Roder DM']","['Menzies School of Health Research, Charles Darwin University, Casuarina, Northern Territory 0811.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Australia,Aust N Z J Public Health,Australian and New Zealand journal of public health,9611095,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology/*ethnology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander/*statistics & numerical data', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*ethnology', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural Population', 'Smoking/adverse effects/*ethnology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Urban Population', 'Young Adult']",,2011/10/07 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/10/07 06:00'],"['2011/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1753-6405.2011.00762.x [doi]'],ppublish,Aust N Z J Public Health. 2011 Oct;35(5):477-85. doi: 10.1111/j.1753-6405.2011.00762.x.,,,,,['(c) 2011 The Authors.

We investigated the feasibility of enhancing CIK cell-mediated cytotoxicity by interleukin (IL)-15 against acute myeloid and lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma cells. METHODS: CIK cells were activated using IL-2 (CIK(IL-2)) or IL-15 (CIK(IL-15)) and phenotypically analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Cytotoxic potential was measured by europium release assay. RESULTS: CIK(IL-2) cells showed potent cytotoxicity against the T-lymphoma cell line H9, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cell line MOLT-4 and subtype M4 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line THP-1, but low cytotoxicity against the precursor B (pB)-cell ALL cell line Tanoue. IL-15 stimulation resulted in a significant enhancement of CIK cell-mediated cytotoxicity against acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma cell lines as well as against primary acute myeloid and defined lymphoblastic leukemia cells. However, the alloreactive potential of CIK(IL-15) cells remained low. Further analysis of CIK(IL-15) cells demonstrated that the NKG2D receptor is apparently involved in the recognition of target cells whereas killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR)-HLA mismatches contributed to a lesser extent to the CIK(IL-15) cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In this context, CD3 (+) CD8 (+) CD25 (+) CD56(-) CIK(IL-15) cell subpopulations were more effective in the lysis of AML cells, in contrast with CD56 (+) CIK(IL-15) cells, which showed the highest cytotoxic potential against ALL cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence that CIK(IL-15) cells may offer a therapeutic option for patients with refractory or relapsed leukemia following haplo-identical HSCT.","['Rettinger, Eva', 'Kuci, Selim', 'Naumann, Ivonne', 'Becker, Petra', 'Kreyenberg, Hermann', 'Anzaghe, Martina', 'Willasch, Andre', 'Koehl, Ulrike', 'Bug, Gesine', 'Ruthardt, Martin', 'Klingebiel, Thomas', 'Fulda, Simone', 'Bader, Peter']","['Rettinger E', 'Kuci S', 'Naumann I', 'Becker P', 'Kreyenberg H', 'Anzaghe M', 'Willasch A', 'Koehl U', 'Bug G', 'Ruthardt M', 'Klingebiel T', 'Fulda S', 'Bader P']","[""University Children's Hospital of Frankfurt/Main and Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Hemostaseology, Goethe-University Frankfurt/Main, Frankfurt/Main, Germany. eva.rettinger@kgu.de""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111006,England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Contraindications', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interleukin-15/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocyte Transfusion', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2011/10/07 06:00,2012/04/24 06:00,['2011/10/07 06:00'],"['2011/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3109/14653249.2011.613931 [doi]', 'S1465-3249(12)70618-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2012 Jan;14(1):91-103. doi: 10.3109/14653249.2011.613931.

There is strong epidemiological evidence that benzene exposure induces hematopoietic malignancies, especially acute myeloid leukemia, in humans, but the chemical mechanisms remain obscure. E,E-Muconaldehyde is one of the products of metabolic oxidation of benzene. This paper explores the proposition that E,E-muconaldehyde is capable of forming Gua-Gua cross-links. If formed in DNA, the replication and repair of such cross-links might introduce structural defects that could be the origin of the carcinogenicity. We have investigated the reaction of E,E-muconaldehyde with dGuo and found that the reaction yields two pairs of interconverting diastereomers of a novel heptacyclic bis-adduct having a spiro ring system linking the two Gua residues. The structures of the four diastereomers have been established by NMR spectroscopy and their absolute configurations by comparison of CD spectra with those of model compounds having known configurations. The final two steps in the formation of the bis-nucleoside (5-ring --> 6-ring --> 7-ring) have significant reversibility, which is the basis for the observed epimerization. The 6-ring precursor was trapped from the equilibrating mixture by reduction with NaBH(4). The anti relationship of the two Gua residues in the heptacyclic bis-adduct precludes it from being formed in B DNA, but the 6-ring precursor could readily be accommodated as an interchain or intrachain cross-link.

Asparagine synthetase (ASNS) and the basic region leucine zipper activating transcription factor 5 (ATF5) and arginosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1) have been shown to mediate the antileukemic effect of asparaginase and to display variable expression between leukemia cells that are resistant and sensitive to treatment. Fourteen polymorphisms in the regulatory and coding regions of these genes were investigated for an association with acute lymphoblastic leukemia outcome. Lower event-free survival (EFS) was associated with ATF5 T1562C, tandem-repeat ASNS polymorphism, derived haplotype, and ASS1 G1343T and G34T substitutions (P </= .03). Associations were limited to patients who received Escherichia coli asparaginase. Variations that sustained correction for multiple testing (ATF5 T1562C, P = .005; ASNS tandem-repeat and related haplotype, P </= .01) were subsequently analyzed in the replication cohort. The E coli-dependent association of the ATF5 T1562 allele with reduced EFS was confirmed (P = .01). A gene-reporter assay showed that the haplotype tagged by T1562 had higher promoter activity (P </= .01). The remaining regulatory polymorphisms also appeared to affect ATF5 function; 2 additional high-activity haplotypes were identified (P </= .02) and were further corroborated by quantitative mRNA analysis in lymphoblastoid cell lines.

We used the published literature to determine if aspects of PU.1 function can be inferred from the identity of target genes that are directly activated. This analysis revealed that 61% of described PU.1 target genes encode extracellular proteins or transmembrane proteins, most of which are involved in cellular communication. The genes activated by PU.1 can be grouped into pathways based on function. Specific examples of cellular communication pathways regulated by PU.1 include (1) antibodies and antibody receptors, (2) cytokines and cytokine receptors regulating leukocyte growth and development, and (3) cytokines and cytokine receptors regulating inflammation. As a consequence of mutation or repression of the gene encoding PU.1, hematopoietic progenitors may be generated but there is a ""failure to thrive"" because they cannot interact with their environment. The loss of cellular communication caused by reduced PU.1 levels can lead to leukemia.

Autophagy, a regulated process of degradation and recycling of cellular constituents, has recently caught increasing attention for its roles in conferring resistance to various commonly used anticancer therapies. Here we showed that the member of the S100 calcium-binding protein family, S100A8, is a critical regulator of chemoresistance in the autophagy process. It positively correlated with the clinical status in childhood acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and it was released from leukemia cells after chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity. Knockdown of S100A8 expression increased the sensitivity of leukemia cells to chemotherapy and apoptosis. Moreover, suppressing S100A8 expression decreased autophagy as evaluated by the increased expression of the autophagic marker microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3)-II, degradation of SQSTM1/Sequestosome 1 (p62) and formation of autophagosomes. Furthermore, stimuli that enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) promoted cytosolic translocation of S100A8 and thereby enhanced autophagy. S100A8 directly interacted with the autophagy protein Beclin1 displacing Bcl-2. These results suggest that S100A8 is a critical pro-autophagic protein that enhances cell survival and regulates chemoresistance in leukemia cells likely through disassociating the Beclin1-Bcl-2 complex.","['Yang, Liangchun', 'Yang, Minghua', 'Zhang, Hong', 'Wang, Zhuo', 'Yu, Yan', 'Xie, Min', 'Zhao, Mingyi', 'Liu, Liying', 'Cao, Lizhi']","['Yang L', 'Yang M', 'Zhang H', 'Wang Z', 'Yu Y', 'Xie M', 'Zhao M', 'Liu L', 'Cao L']","['Department of Pediatrics, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111003,Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (BECN1 protein, human)', '0 (Beclin-1)', '0 (Calgranulin A)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/drug effects', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Beclin-1', 'Calgranulin A/*genetics/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2011/10/06 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2011/10/06 06:00'],"['2011/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijmm.2011.806 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2012 Jan;29(1):65-72. doi: 10.3892/ijmm.2011.806.

Twenty-eight patients conditioned with RIC regimen were matched to 56 patients who received a myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimen. The main criteria for case matching among our CML allotransplant cohort were the Gratwohl scoring system. The median score was 2 (1-4) in each group. The pretransplant disease status was first chronic phase (CP1, n = 20), CP2 (n = 2), and advanced phase (n = 6) in RIC, and CP1 (n = 46), CP2 (n = 3), and advanced phase (n = 7) in MAC. The duration of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia was shorter in RIC than MAC. The grade and duration of mucositis were less in RIC. The need for total parenteral nutrition (21% vs. 77%, p < 0.0001) and febrile neutropenic episodes (50% vs. 95%, p < 0.0001) were observed less frequently in RIC compared with MAC-given patients. Acute or chronic graft versus host diseases (GvHD) were not affected by the intensity of conditioning regimen. The incidence of transplant-related mortality was higher in MAC (7% vs. 14%, p = 0.01). Although more relapse/progression was observed in the RIC group, the probability of 5- and 10-year leukemia-free- and overall survival were similar regardless of conditioning regimen intensity (p > 0.05). In early first CP, the pair of female donor-male recipient and the development of chronic GvHD prolonged both leukemia-free survival and overall survival in multivariate analysis. According to our single-center matched-pair analysis, the use of RIC regimens in patients with low-risk CML results with toxicities less, responses later, and relapses more frequent than the MAC regimens.","['Topcuoglu, Pervin', 'Arat, Mutlu', 'Ozcan, Muhit', 'Arslan, Onder', 'Ilhan, Osman', 'Beksac, Meral', 'Gurman, Gunhan']","['Topcuoglu P', 'Arat M', 'Ozcan M', 'Arslan O', 'Ilhan O', 'Beksac M', 'Gurman G']","['Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Ankara University, Cebeci Campus, 06590 Ankara, Turkey. topcuogl@medicine.ankara.edu.tr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111005,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Adult', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,2011/10/06 06:00,2012/05/11 06:00,['2011/10/06 06:00'],"['2011/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-011-1349-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2012 Apr;91(4):577-86. doi: 10.1007/s00277-011-1349-2.

Leukemia inhibitory factor receptor alpha (LIFR) is an integral component of the glycoprotein 130-LIFR signaling complex, which participates in signal transduction by members of the interleukin (IL)-6 cytokine family. The aim of this study was to investigate whether genetic polymorphisms of the LIFR gene are associated with schizophrenia in the Korean population. We also explored possible associations between the polymorphisms and the clinical symptoms of schizophrenia. We selected three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs2071237 -200C/G, rs2071236 -254C/T and rs6862038 -962A/G) on the promoter region of the LIFR gene and recruited 204 schizophrenia patients and 367 control subjects from the Korean population. All patients were evaluated according to the Operational Criteria Checklist for Psychotic Illness. SNP genotyping was performed by direct sequencing. An analysis of multiple logistic regression models (co-dominant 1, co-dominant 2, dominant, recessive and overdominant) was performed to evaluate odds ratios (ORs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and p-values. No significant difference was revealed between schizophrenia patients and controls. However, a significant association was detected between the LIFR gene polymorphisms and schizophrenia patients with persecutory delusion (rs2071236, OR=2.18, 95% CI=1.20-3.94, P=0.009 in the overdominant model; rs6862038, OR=2.08, 95% CI=1.16-3.74, P=0.013 in the overdominant model).

The kinases are overexpressed in a variety of cancer cells and are involved in tumorgenesis. Although aurora kinase inhibitors are potential agents for treatment of leukemia, the establishment of efficacious combination therapies is an attractive approach for making good use of these agents. In this study, we examined the effects of a specific aurora kinase inhibitor, VE-465, in combination with various conventional anti-leukemia agents, including doxorubicin, daunorubicin, idarubicin, mitoxantron, cytosine arabinoside, vincristine and etoposide, on acute myeloid leukemia cell lines (HL60, U937, THP-1 and KY821), chronic myeloid leukemia cell lines (KCL22, K562 and KU812) and primary leukemia cells. We found that a combination of VE-465 and vincristine had a synergistic/additive inhibitory effect on the growth of leukemia cells. VE-465 initially increased G2/M-phase cells, followed by induction of sub-G1 cells. Vincristine enhanced this effect of VE-465. The combination of VE-465 and vincristine increased the levels of cleaved caspase 3, cleaved caspase 7, cleaved caspase 9, cleaved PARP and Phospho-Chk2, suggesting that the combination caused Chk2-mediated activation of the G2/M checkpoint, resulting in sequential induction of apoptosis. Interestingly, the combination markedly decreased the level of Phospho-ERK1/2, suggesting that the combination alters a network of cellular signaling pathways. In contrast, combinations of VE-465 and other agents showed no synergistic inhibitory effect but rather had an antagonistic effect. In conclusion, our results indicate the utility of the combination of VE-465 and vincristine as a potential therapy for myeloid leukemia.","['Yoshida, Kozue', 'Nagai, Tadashi', 'Ohmine, Ken', 'Uesawa, Mitsuyo', 'Sripayap, Piyanuch', 'Ishida, Yoji', 'Ozawa, Keiya']","['Yoshida K', 'Nagai T', 'Ohmine K', 'Uesawa M', 'Sripayap P', 'Ishida Y', 'Ozawa K']","['Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke, Tochigi 329-0498, Japan. kozuey@idac.tohoku.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110929,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperazines)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '639089-54-6 (VX680)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Aurora Kinases', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology']",,2011/10/06 06:00,2012/01/10 06:00,['2011/10/06 06:00'],"['2011/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/09 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(11)00695-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2011.09.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2011 Dec 15;82(12):1884-90. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2011.09.015.

B cell commitment and development depend on many transcription factors including Pax5. Here, we review the different functions of Pax5 in regulating various aspects of B lymphopoiesis. At B cell commitment, Pax5 restricts the developmental potential of lymphoid progenitors to the B cell pathway by repressing B-lineage-inappropriate genes, while it simultaneously promotes B cell development by activating B-lymphoid-specific genes. Pax5 thereby controls gene transcription by recruiting chromatin-remodeling, histone-modifying, and basal transcription factor complexes to its target genes. Moreover, Pax5 contributes to the diversity of the antibody repertoire by controlling V(H)-DJ(H) recombination by inducing contraction of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus in pro-B cells, which is likely mediated by PAIR elements in the 5' region of the V(H) gene cluster. Importantly, all mature B cell types depend on Pax5 for their differentiation and function. Pax5 thus controls the identity of B lymphocytes throughout B cell development. Consequently, conditional loss of Pax5 allows mature B cells from peripheral lymphoid organs to develop into functional T cells in the thymus via dedifferentiation to uncommitted progenitors in the bone marrow. Pax5 has also been implicated in human B cell malignancies because it can function as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor or oncogenic translocation fusion protein in B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Medvedovic, Jasna', 'Ebert, Anja', 'Tagoh, Hiromi', 'Busslinger, Meinrad']","['Medvedovic J', 'Ebert A', 'Tagoh H', 'Busslinger M']","['Research Institute of Molecular Pathology, Vienna Biocenter, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Adv Immunol,Advances in immunology,0370425,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)', '0 (Pax5 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Diversity', 'Antibody Formation', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphopoiesis', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism']",,2011/10/06 06:00,2012/01/19 06:00,['2011/10/06 06:00'],"['2011/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/19 06:00 [medline]']","['B978-0-12-385991-4.00005-2 [pii]', '10.1016/B978-0-12-385991-4.00005-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Adv Immunol. 2011;111:179-206. doi: 10.1016/B978-0-12-385991-4.00005-2.,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Several detection methods have been developed, the most famous of which is the circular scan method. The present study, which was conducted in the context of a rare disease distributed over a large territory (7675 cases registered over 17 years and located in 1895 units), aimed to evaluate the performance of several of the methods in realistic hot-spot cluster situations. METHODS: All the methods considered aim to identify the most likely cluster area, i.e. the zone that maximizes the likelihood ratio function, among a set of cluster candidates. The circular and elliptic scan methods were developed to detect regularly shaped clusters. Four other methods that focus on irregularly shaped clusters were also considered (the flexible scan method, the genetic algorithm method, and the double connected and maximum linkage spatial scan methods). The power of the methods was evaluated via Monte Carlo simulations under 27 alternative scenarios that corresponded to three cluster population sizes (20, 45 and 115 expected cases), three cluster shapes (linear, U-shaped and compact) and three relative risk values (1.5, 2.0 and 3.0). RESULTS: Three situations emerged from this power study. All the methods failed to detect the smallest clusters with a relative risk lower than 3.0. The power to detect the largest cluster with relative risk of 1.5 was markedly better for all methods, but, at most, half of the true cluster was captured. For other clusters, either large or with the highest relative risk, the standard elliptic scan method appeared to be the best method to detect linear clusters, while the flexible scan method localized the U-shaped clusters more precisely than other methods. Large compact clusters were detected well by all methods, with better results for the circular and elliptic scan methods. CONCLUSIONS: The elliptic scan method and flexible scan method seemed the most able to detect clusters of a rare disease in a large territory. However, the probability of detecting small clusters with relative risk lower than 3.0 remained low with all the methods tested.","['Goujon-Bellec, Stephanie', 'Demoury, Claire', 'Guyot-Goubin, Aurelie', 'Hemon, Denis', 'Clavel, Jacqueline']","['Goujon-Bellec S', 'Demoury C', 'Guyot-Goubin A', 'Hemon D', 'Clavel J']","['INSERM, CESP Environmental epidemiology of cancer, U1018, Villejuif, France. stephanie.goujon@inserm.fr']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111004,England,Int J Health Geogr,International journal of health geographics,101152198,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Child', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Disease Outbreaks/*statistics & numerical data', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Population Surveillance/*methods', 'Rare Diseases/*epidemiology']",PMC3204219,2011/10/06 06:00,2012/02/15 06:00,['2011/10/06 06:00'],"['2011/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-072X-10-53 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-072X-10-53 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Health Geogr. 2011 Oct 4;10:53. doi: 10.1186/1476-072X-10-53.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although all histologic categories of malignant lymphoma develop in the gastrointestinal tract, large B-cell lymphomas predominate, followed by extranodal marginal zone lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type; the latter is especially prevalent in stomach. The acceptance of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of MALT type as a clinicopathologic entity has reduced the number of cases that formerly were interpreted as florid lymphoid hyperplasia (""pseudolymphoma""). Nonetheless, the distinction of lymphoid hyperplasia from a lymphoma of MALT type in small biopsy specimens remains problematic. OBJECTIVE: To assess the relevant morphologic, immunologic, molecular, and genetic properties of gastrointestinal lymphomas and to present a feasible tactic for diagnosis, expressly for small biopsy specimens. DATA SOURCES: Case-derived material and literature review using PubMed (National Library of Medicine). CONCLUSIONS: Most gastrointestinal lymphomas are readily amenable to an unqualified diagnosis, primarily those cases consisting of monomorphic large cells whether of B- or T-cell lineage, including cases associated with enteropathy. Diagnosis for infiltrates dominated by small lymphocytes remains taxing, as the differential diagnosis embraces not only MALT lymphoma and lymphoid hyperplasia but also mantle cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. Adherence to strict morphologic criteria is the standard for diagnosis, but these criteria should be augmented by immunologic studies together with judicious use of molecular techniques to determine clonality. In establishing a diagnosis of gastric marginal zone lymphoma of MALT type, determination of t(11;18)(q21;q21) status may be required since this translocation has clinical ramifications.","['Burke, Jerome S']",['Burke JS'],"['Department of Pathology, Alta Bates Summit Medical Center, Berkeley, California 94705, USA. burkej@sutterhealth.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,,IM,"['Diagnosis, Differential', 'Enteropathy-Associated T-Cell Lymphoma/diagnosis', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/*diagnosis', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/classification/diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/diagnosis/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/diagnosis', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis', 'Pseudolymphoma/diagnosis', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,2011/10/06 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/10/06 06:00'],"['2011/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['10.5858/arpa.2011-0145-RA [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2011 Oct;135(10):1283-97. doi: 10.5858/arpa.2011-0145-RA.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Natural killer (NK) cells rapidly expand after stem cell transplantation and are important for regulating GVHD and providing graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects. This review highlights the phenotypic and functional differences between UCB NK cells and adult peripheral blood (APB) NK cells, and discusses the possible therapeutic benefit of using UCB NK cells for adoptive immunotherapy in leukemia. Alloreactive NK cells show potent cytotoxic activities against human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-nonidentical leukemic cells and reduce leukemia relapses. The higher numbers of NK progenitors in UCB makes it a convenient source for ex vivo expansion of UCB NK cells for posttransplant treatment. UCB NK cells readily respond to interleukin-15, which may greatly enhance their antitumor effect. Activation and expansion protocols for UCB NK cells are currently being developed.","['Lin, Syh-Jae', 'Kuo, Ming-Ling']","['Lin SJ', 'Kuo ML']","[""Division of Asthma, Allergy, and Rheumatology, Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Children's Hospital, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan. sjlino@adm.cgmh.org.tw""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20111004,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,,IM,"['Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*immunology', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology/*immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia/*immunology/pathology/*therapy']",,2011/10/06 06:00,2012/09/14 06:00,['2011/10/06 06:00'],"['2011/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08880018.2011.613092 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2011 Nov;28(8):640-6. doi: 10.3109/08880018.2011.613092.

METHODS: This was a hospital-based cancer registry study carried out at the Pediatric Oncology Ward, Maternity & Children's Hospital and other institutes in Basrah, Iraq. All children with leukaemia, aged 0 to 14 years diagnosed and registered in Basrah from January 2004 to December 2009 were included in the study. Their records were retrieved and studied. The pattern of childhood leukaemia by year of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, morphological subtypes, and geographical distribution was analysed. Rates of childhood leukaemia over time were calculated for six years using standard linear regression. RESULTS: The total number of cases of childhood leukaemia was 181. The number of cases ranged from 21 in year 1, to 31 in the final year reaching a peak of 39 in 2006. Leukaemia rates did not change over the study period (test for trend was not significant, P = 0.81). The trend line shows a shift towards younger children (less than 5 years). The commonest types of leukaemia were acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), then acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and finally chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). CONCLUSION: Annual rates of childhood leukaemia in Basrah were similar to those in other countries with a trend towards younger children. This raises the question about the effect of environmental catastrophes in the alteration of some specific rates of childhood leukaemia, rather than the overall incidence rate. There is a need for further epidemiological studies to understand the aetiology of childhood leukaemia in Basrah.","['Alrudainy, Laith A', 'Hassan, Jenan G', 'Salih, Hussam M', 'Abbas, Mohammed K', 'Majeed, Athar As']","['Alrudainy LA', 'Hassan JG', 'Salih HM', 'Abbas MK', 'Majeed AA']","['Department of Community Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Basrah, Iraq;']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110515,Oman,Sultan Qaboos Univ Med J,Sultan Qaboos University medical journal,101519915,,,,PMC3121026,2011/10/05 06:00,2011/10/05 06:01,['2011/10/05 06:00'],"['2010/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/09 00:00 [revised]', '2010/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/05 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Sultan Qaboos Univ Med J. 2011 May;11(2):215-20.

However, after prolonged inactivation of MYC in a conditional transgenic mouse model of Emu-tTA/tetO-MYC T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, some of the tumors recur, recapitulating what is frequently observed in human tumors in response to targeted therapies. Here we report that these recurring lymphomas express either transgenic or endogenous Myc, albeit in many cases at levels below those in the original tumor, suggesting that tumors continue to be addicted to MYC. Many of the recurring lymphomas (76%) harbored mutations in the tetracycline transactivator, resulting in expression of the MYC transgene even in the presence of doxycycline. Some of the remaining recurring tumors expressed high levels of endogenous Myc, which was associated with a genomic rearrangement of the endogenous Myc locus or activation of Notch1. By gene expression profiling, we confirmed that the primary and recurring tumors have highly similar transcriptomes. Importantly, shRNA-mediated suppression of the high levels of MYC in recurring tumors elicited both suppression of proliferation and increased apoptosis, confirming that these tumors remain oncogene addicted. These results suggest that tumors induced by MYC remain addicted to overexpression of this oncogene.","['Choi, Peter S', 'van Riggelen, Jan', 'Gentles, Andrew J', 'Bachireddy, Pavan', 'Rakhra, Kavya', 'Adam, Stacey J', 'Plevritis, Sylvia K', 'Felsher, Dean W']","['Choi PS', 'van Riggelen J', 'Gentles AJ', 'Bachireddy P', 'Rakhra K', 'Adam SJ', 'Plevritis SK', 'Felsher DW']","['Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine and Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111003,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', '*Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*genetics/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*therapy', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Tetracycline Resistance/genetics', 'Trans-Activators/genetics']",PMC3198348,2011/10/05 06:00,2011/12/31 06:00,['2011/10/05 06:00'],"['2011/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/31 06:00 [medline]']","['1107303108 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1107303108 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Oct 18;108(42):17432-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1107303108.

The pi-pi stacking interactions between SWCNTs and aromatic residues (Trp, Phe, Tyr) are found to play a critical role in determining their adsorption capacity. Additional cellular cytotoxicity assays, with human acute monocytic leukemia cell line and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, reveal that the competitive bindings of blood proteins on the SWCNT surface can greatly alter their cellular interaction pathways and result in much reduced cytotoxicity for these protein-coated SWCNTs, according to their respective adsorption capacity.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We followed 5,798 patients with HL treated with chemotherapy in Britain from 1963 to 2001--of whom 3,432 also received radiotherapy--to assess second primary malignancy risks compared with general population-based expectations. RESULTS: Second malignancies occurred in 459 cohort members. Relative risk (RR) of second cancer was raised after chemotherapy alone (RR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.7 to 2.4) but was much lower than after combined modalities (RR, 3.9; 95% CI, 3.5 to 4.4). After chemotherapy alone, there were significantly raised risks of lung cancer, non-HL, and leukemia, each contributing approximately equal absolute excess risk. After combined modalities, there were raised risks of these and several other cancers. Second cancer risk peaked 5 to 9 years after chemotherapy alone, but it remained raised for 25 years and longer after combined modalities. Risk was raised after each common chemotherapy regimen except, based on limited numbers and follow-up, adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine. The age and time-course relations of lung cancer differed between chemotherapy alone and combined modalities. CONCLUSION: Although chemotherapy alone leads to raised risk of second malignancy, this risk is lower and affects fewer anatomic sites than that after combined modalities, and it is slight if at all after 15 years follow-up. The mechanism of lung cancer etiology may differ between chemotherapy and radiotherapy.","['Swerdlow, Anthony J', 'Higgins, Craig D', 'Smith, Paul', 'Cunningham, David', 'Hancock, Barry W', 'Horwich, Alan', 'Hoskin, Peter J', 'Lister, T Andrew', 'Radford, John A', 'Rohatiner, Ama Z S', 'Linch, David C']","['Swerdlow AJ', 'Higgins CD', 'Smith P', 'Cunningham D', 'Hancock BW', 'Horwich A', 'Hoskin PJ', 'Lister TA', 'Radford JA', 'Rohatiner AZ', 'Linch DC']","['Section of Epidemiology, Sir Richard Doll Building, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey SM2 5NG, United Kingdom. anthony.swerdlow@icr.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111003,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,2011/10/05 06:00,2011/12/21 06:00,['2011/10/05 06:00'],"['2011/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.34.8268 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.34.8268 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Nov 1;29(31):4096-104. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.34.8268.

We continue to use criteria for active disease to initiate therapy. Multivariable analysis was performed to identify prognostic factors independently associated with time to first treatment for patients with CLL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Traditional laboratory, clinical prognostic, and newer prognostic factors such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), IGHV mutation status, and ZAP-70 expression evaluated at first patient visit to MD Anderson Cancer Center were correlated by multivariable analysis with time to first treatment. This multivariable model was used to develop a nomogram-a weighted tool to calculate 2- and 4-year probability of treatment and estimate median time to first treatment. RESULTS: There were 930 previously untreated patients who had traditional and new prognostic factors evaluated; they did not have active CLL requiring initiation of treatment within 3 months of first visit and were observed for time to first treatment. The following were independently associated with shorter time to first treatment: three involved lymph node sites, increased size of cervical lymph nodes, presence of 17p deletion or 11q deletion by FISH, increased serum lactate dehydrogenase, and unmutated IGHV mutation status. CONCLUSION: We developed a multivariable model that incorporates traditional and newer prognostic factors to identify patients at high risk for progression to treatment. This model may be useful to identify patients for early interventional trials.","['Wierda, William G', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Wang, Xuemei', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Do, Kim-Anh', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Thomas, Deborah', 'Koller, Charles A', 'Burger, Jan A', 'Lerner, Susan', 'Schlette, Ellen', 'Abruzzo, Lynne', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Keating, Michael J']","['Wierda WG', ""O'Brien S"", 'Wang X', 'Faderl S', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Do KA', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Cortes J', 'Thomas D', 'Koller CA', 'Burger JA', 'Lerner S', 'Schlette E', 'Abruzzo L', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Keating MJ']","['The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. wwierda@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111003,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation', 'Nomograms', 'Odds Ratio', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Texas', 'Time Factors', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/metabolism']",PMC4876352,2011/10/05 06:00,2011/12/21 06:00,['2011/10/05 06:00'],"['2011/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2010.33.9002 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2010.33.9002 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Nov 1;29(31):4088-95. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.33.9002.

Eligibility for intensive AML treatment protocols is therefore typically based on age as the implied principal predictor of TRM, although other health- and disease-related factors modulate this age effect. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We empirically defined TRM using estimated weekly hazard rates in 3,365 adults of all ages administered intensive chemotherapy for newly diagnosed AML. We used the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) to quantify the relative effects of age and other covariates on TRM in a subset of 2,238 patients. In this approach, an AUC of 1.0 denotes perfect prediction, whereas an AUC of 0.5 is analogous to a coin flip. RESULTS: Regardless of age, risk of death declined once 4 weeks had elapsed from treatment start, suggesting that patients who die during this time comprise a qualitatively distinct group. Performance status (PS) and age were the most important individual predictors of TRM (AUCs of 0.75 and 0.65, respectively). However, multicomponent models were significantly more accurate in predicting TRM (AUC of 0.83) than PS or age alone. Elimination of age from such multicomponent models only minimally affected their predictive accuracy (AUC of 0.82). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that age is primarily a surrogate for other covariates, which themselves add significantly to predictive accuracy, thus challenging the wisdom of using age as primary or sole basis for assignment of intensive, curative intent treatment in AML.","['Walter, Roland B', 'Othus, Megan', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Pierce, Sherry A', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Kantarjian, Hagop A', 'Estey, Elihu H']","['Walter RB', 'Othus M', 'Borthakur G', 'Ravandi F', 'Cortes JE', 'Pierce SA', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Kantarjian HA', 'Estey EH']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Ave N, D2-190, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA. rwalter@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20111003,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk', 'Time Factors']",PMC3221524,2011/10/05 06:00,2012/01/05 06:00,['2011/10/05 06:00'],"['2011/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.35.7525 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.35.7525 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Nov 20;29(33):4417-23. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.35.7525.

Inter-individual variations in GSTM1 and GSTT1 loci have been associated with several types of cancer, including leukemias. In this study, we investigated the possible association between GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms and susceptibility to chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in a Turkish population. In a case-control study, 106 CML patients and 190 healthy controls were evaluated for GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms. GSTM1 null (GSTM1(-)) genotype frequencies in CML cases and controls were 45.3% and 42.6%, respectively. GSTT1 null (GSTT1(-)) genotype frequencies were 44.3% and 18.4%, respectively. The frequency of the GSTT1(-) genotype among CML patients was significantly higher than in controls [odds ratio (OR) 3.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.08-6.00; P < 0.0001]. Individuals with the GSTM1(-) genotype did not have increased risk of CML [OR: 1.11; 95% CI: 0.69-1.80; P = 0.714]. The combined GSTM1(-)/GSTT1(-) genotype was significantly associated with risk of CML compared to the GSTM1(+) /GSTT1(+) genotype which was most frequent in both cases and controls [OR: 9.47; 95% CI: 3.61-24.87]. Similar findings have only been obtained in Turkish and Indian populations but not elsewhere. The GSTM1(+) /GSTT1(-) genotype was associated with a 2.5-fold increased risk compared with the GSTM1(-)/GSTT1(+) genotype, the second most frequent genotype (OR; 2.46; 95% CI: 1.17, 5.20), suggesting a complex interaction between GSTM1 and GSTT1. Our results indicate an association between the GSTT1(-) genotype, either alone or in combination with GSTM1(-) genotype, and risk of CML, suggesting a possible interaction between GSTM1 and GSTT1. These findings, which are possibly restricted to Turkey and India, warrant further research.","['Ozten, Nur', 'Sunguroglu, Asuman', 'Bosland, Maarten C']","['Ozten N', 'Sunguroglu A', 'Bosland MC']","['Department of Medical Biology, School of Medicine, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey. nurozten@uic.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20111004,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['EC 2.5.1.- (glutathione S-transferase T1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Alleles', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Ethnicity/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Inactivation, Metabolic/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/epidemiology/ethnology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', 'Risk', 'Smoking/epidemiology/genetics', 'Turkey/epidemiology']",,2011/10/05 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2011/10/05 06:00'],"['2011/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/06 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hon.1018 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2012 Sep;30(3):150-5. doi: 10.1002/hon.1018.

To improve the power of multiple testing, Storey (J. Royal Statist. Soc.

However, in applying the ODP, we must estimate the true status of each significance test (null or alternative) and the true probability distribution corresponding to each test. In this article, we derive the ODP under hierarchical, random effects models and develop an empirical Bayes estimation method for the derived ODP. Our methods can effectively circumvent the estimation problems in applying the ODP presented by Storey. Simulations and applications to clinical studies of leukemia and breast cancer demonstrated that our empirical Bayes method achieved theoretical optimality and performed well in comparison with existing multiple testing procedures.","['Noma, Hisashi', 'Matsui, Shigeyuki']","['Noma H', 'Matsui S']","['Department of Biostatistics, Kyoto University School of Public Health, Yoshidakonoe-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8501, Japan. nomahi@bstat.mbox.media.kyoto-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111004,England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,,IM,"['*Bayes Theorem', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics', 'Computer Simulation', 'Female', 'Genome-Wide Association Study/*methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Microarray Analysis', '*Models, Statistical', 'Reproducibility of Results']",,2011/10/05 06:00,2012/05/02 06:00,['2011/10/05 06:00'],"['2010/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/sim.4375 [doi]'],ppublish,Stat Med. 2012 Jan 30;31(2):165-76. doi: 10.1002/sim.4375.

To assess the implications of the virus for human health it is very important to know the past and present prevalence. Most of the estimates of HTLV-1 prevalence are based on serological screening of blood donors, pregnant women and other selected population groups. The widely cited estimate that the number of HTLV-1 carriers in Japan is 1.2 million was calculated from data that are now more than 25 years old. Here I summarize previous reports of prevalence studies in the world and Japan. Then, a recent analysis of seroprevalence of healthy blood donors in Japan will be described in comparison with that of 1988. A decrease in the number of HTLV-1 carriers in Japan was demonstrated, however, it is still more than one million. The number has increased in the metropolitan areas, probably reflecting the migration of Japanese population. I conclude that there is a paucity of general population data in countries where HTLV-1 is endemic, and re-evaluation of HTLV-1 infection is required to understand the virus burden on the human health.","['Watanabe, Toshiki']",['Watanabe T'],"['Department of Medical Genome Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan. tnabe@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20111004,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,['0 (Viral Vaccines)'],IM,"['Carrier State/epidemiology/virology', 'Female', 'Global Health', 'HTLV-I Infections/*epidemiology/prevention & control/transmission/*virology', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/immunology/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Mass Screening', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Viral Vaccines']",,2011/10/05 06:00,2012/03/07 06:00,['2011/10/05 06:00'],"['2011/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/08/31 00:00 [revised]', '2011/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-011-0934-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2011 Nov;94(5):430-4. doi: 10.1007/s12185-011-0934-4.

Signaling downstream of mTORC1 has a critical role in leukemic cell biology by controlling mRNA translation of genes involved in both cell survival and proliferation. mTORC1 activity can be downmodulated by upregulating the liver kinase B1/AMP-activated protein kinase (LKB1/AMPK) pathway. Here, we have explored the therapeutic potential of the anti-diabetic drug, metformin (an LKB1/AMPK activator), against both T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cell lines and primary samples from T-ALL patients displaying mTORC1 activation. Metformin affected T-ALL cell viability by inducing autophagy and apoptosis. However, it was much less toxic against proliferating CD4(+) T-lymphocytes from healthy donors. Western blot analysis demonstrated dephosphorylation of mTORC1 downstream targets. Unlike rapamycin, we found a marked inhibition of mRNA translation in T-ALL cells treated with metformin. Remarkably, metformin targeted the side population of T-ALL cell lines as well as a putative leukemia-initiating cell subpopulation (CD34(+)/CD7(-)/CD4(-)) in patient samples. In conclusion, metformin displayed a remarkable anti-leukemic activity, which emphasizes future development of LKB1/AMPK activators as clinical candidates for therapy in T-ALL.","['Grimaldi, C', 'Chiarini, F', 'Tabellini, G', 'Ricci, F', 'Tazzari, P L', 'Battistelli, M', 'Falcieri, E', 'Bortul, R', 'Melchionda, F', 'Iacobucci, I', 'Pagliaro, P', 'Martinelli, G', 'Pession, A', 'Barata, J T', 'McCubrey, J A', 'Martelli, A M']","['Grimaldi C', 'Chiarini F', 'Tabellini G', 'Ricci F', 'Tazzari PL', 'Battistelli M', 'Falcieri E', 'Bortul R', 'Melchionda F', 'Iacobucci I', 'Pagliaro P', 'Martinelli G', 'Pession A', 'Barata JT', 'McCubrey JA', 'Martelli AM']","['Department of Human Anatomy, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111004,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9100L32L2N (Metformin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.4.3 (Adenylate Kinase)']",IM,"['Adenylate Kinase/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Primers', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1', 'Metformin/pharmacology', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases']",,2011/10/05 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/10/05 06:00'],"['2011/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011269 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.269 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Jan;26(1):91-100. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.269.

A total of 125 infants with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were treated in studies AML-BFM-98 (n = 59) and -2004 (n = 66). Treatment regimens of both studies were comparable, consisting of intensive induction followed by four courses (mainly high-dose cytarabine and anthracyclines). Allogeneic-hematopoietic stem-cell-transplantation (allo-HSCT) in 1st remission was optional for high-risk (HR) patients. Most infants (120/125=96%) were HR patients according to morphological, cytogenetic/molecular genetic and response criteria. Five-year overall survival was 66 +/- 4%, and improved from 61 +/- 6% in study-98 to 75 +/- 6% in study-2004 (P(logrank) 0.14) and event-free survival rates were 44 +/- 6% and 51 +/- 6% (P(logrank) 0.66), respectively. Results in HR infants were similar to those of older HR children (1-<2- or 2-<10-year olds, P(logrank) 0.90 for survival). Survival rates of HSCT in 1st remission, initial partial response and after relapse were high (13/14, 2/8 and 20/30 patients, respectively). The latter contributes to excellent 5-year survival after relapse (50+/-8%). Despite more severe infections and pulmonary toxicities in infants, treatment-related death rate was identical to that of older children (3%).

Stereotyped VH CDR3 sequences are often defined by the selective association of certain immunoglobulin heavy diversity (IGHD) genes in specific reading frames with certain immunoglobulin heavy joining (IGHJ ) genes. To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying VH CDR3 restrictions and also determine the developmental stage when restrictions in VH CDR3 are imposed, we analyzed partial IGHD-IGHJ rearrangements (D-J) in 829 CLL cases and compared the productively rearranged D-J joints (that is, in-frame junctions without junctional stop codons) to (a) the productive immunoglobulin heavy variable (IGHV )-IGHD-IGHJ rearrangements (V-D-J) from the same cases and (b) 174 D-J rearrangements from 160 precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases (pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL]). Partial D-J rearrangements were detected in 272/829 CLL cases (32.8%). Sequence analysis was feasible in 238 of 272 D-J rearrangements; 198 of 238 (83.2%) were productively rearranged. The D-J joints in CLL did not differ significantly from those in pre-B ALL, except for higher frequency of the IGHD7-27 and IGHJ6 genes in the latter. Among CLL carrying productively rearranged D-J, comparison of the IGHD gene repertoire in productive V-D-J versus D-J revealed the following: (a) overuse of IGHD reading frames encoding hydrophilic peptides among V-D-J and (b) selection of the IGHD3-3 and IGHD6-19 genes in V-D-J junctions. These results document that the IGHD and IGHJ gene biases in the CLL expressed VH CDR3 repertoire are not stochastic but are directed by selection operating at the immunoglobulin protein level.","['Tsakou, Eugenia', 'Agathangelidis, Andreas', 'Agathagelidis, Andreas', 'Boudjoghra, Myriam', 'Raff, Thorsten', 'Dagklis, Antonis', 'Chatzouli, Maria', 'Smilevska, Tatjana', 'Bourikas, George', 'Merle-Beral, Helene', 'Manioudaki-Kavallieratou, Eleni', 'Anagnostopoulos, Achilles', 'Bruggemann, Monika', 'Davi, Frederic', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas', 'Belessi, Chrysoula']","['Tsakou E', 'Agathangelidis A', 'Agathagelidis A', 'Boudjoghra M', 'Raff T', 'Dagklis A', 'Chatzouli M', 'Smilevska T', 'Bourikas G', 'Merle-Beral H', 'Manioudaki-Kavallieratou E', 'Anagnostopoulos A', 'Bruggemann M', 'Davi F', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Belessi C']","['Hematology Department, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120210,England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,"['0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Complementarity Determining Regions/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain/*genetics', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",PMC3276399,2011/10/05 06:00,2012/06/02 06:00,['2011/10/05 06:00'],"['2011/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/02 06:00 [medline]']","['molmed.2011.00216 [pii]', '10.2119/molmed.2011.00216 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Med. 2012 Feb 10;18:138-45. doi: 10.2119/molmed.2011.00216.,,,,,,,,,,,,['Mol Med. 2014 Jan;19:332.

To explore such intratumor complexities in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), we measured B-cell kinetics in vivo by quantifying deuterium ((2)H)-labeled cells as an indicator of a cell that had divided. Separating CLL clones on the basis of reciprocal densities of chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) and cluster designation 5 (CD5) revealed that the CXCR4(dim)CD5(bright) (proliferative) fraction contained more (2)H-labeled DNA and hence divided cells than the CXCR4(bright)CD5(dim) (resting) fraction. This enrichment was confirmed by the relative expression of two cell cycle-associated molecules in the same fractions, Ki-67 and minichromosome maintenance protein 6 (MCM6). Comparisons of global gene expression between the CXCR4(dim)CD5(bright) and CXCR4(bright)CD5(dim) fractions indicated higher levels of pro-proliferation and antiapoptotic genes and genes involved in oxidative injury in the proliferative fraction. An extended immunophenotype was also defined, providing a wider range of surface molecules characteristic of each fraction. These intraclonal analyses suggest a model of CLL cell biology in which the leukemic clone contains a spectrum of cells from the proliferative fraction, enriched in recently divided robust cells that are lymphoid tissue emigrants, to the resting fraction enriched in older, less vital cells that need to immigrate to lymphoid tissue or die. The model also suggests several targets preferentially expressed in the two populations amenable for therapeutic attack. Finally, the study lays the groundwork for future analyses that might provide a more robust understanding of the development and clonal evolution of this currently incurable disease.","['Calissano, Carlo', 'Damle, Rajendra N', 'Marsilio, Sonia', 'Yan, Xiao-Jie', 'Yancopoulos, Sophia', 'Hayes, Gregory', 'Emson, Claire', 'Murphy, Elizabeth J', 'Hellerstein, Marc K', 'Sison, Cristina', 'Kaufman, Matthew S', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Allen, Steven L', 'Rai, Kanti R', 'Ivanovic, Ivana', 'Dozmorov, Igor M', 'Roa, Sergio', 'Scharff, Matthew D', 'Li, Wentian', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas']","['Calissano C', 'Damle RN', 'Marsilio S', 'Yan XJ', 'Yancopoulos S', 'Hayes G', 'Emson C', 'Murphy EJ', 'Hellerstein MK', 'Sison C', 'Kaufman MS', 'Kolitz JE', 'Allen SL', 'Rai KR', 'Ivanovic I', 'Dozmorov IM', 'Roa S', 'Scharff MD', 'Li W', 'Chiorazzi N']","['The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, North Shore-LIJ Health System, Manhasset, New York, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110923,England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,"['0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",IM,"['CD5 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cell Compartmentation', '*Cell Division', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Cellular Senescence', 'Clone Cells', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, CXCR4/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism']",PMC3321822,2011/10/05 06:00,2012/08/04 06:00,['2011/10/05 06:00'],"['2011/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['molmed.2011.00360 [pii]', '10.2119/molmed.2011.00360 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Med. 2011;17(11-12):1374-82. doi: 10.2119/molmed.2011.00360.

Down-regulated CAT expression in AML-2/DX100 cells was completely recovered after treatment of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA) but was increased slightly by the treatment of DNA methylation inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AdC). Bisulfite-sequencing PCR revealed that a CpG island of CAT was not methylated in AML-2/DX100 cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed that acetylation of histone H4 in AML-2/DX100 cells significantly decreased as compared with that in AML-2/WT cells, which was significantly increased by TSA more than 5-AdC. Meanwhile, overexpression of other up-regulated peroxidase genes appears to make compensation for decreased H(2)O(2)-scavenging activity for the down-regulated CAT expression in AML-2/DX100 cells. These results suggest that histone H4 deacetylation is responsible for the down-regulated CAT expression in AML-2/DX100 cells, which are well adapted to oxidative stress.","['Lee, Tae-Bum', 'Moon, Young-Sook', 'Choi, Cheol-Hee']","['Lee TB', 'Moon YS', 'Choi CH']","['Research Center for Resistant Cells, Chosun University Medical School, Chosun University, Gwangju, 501-759, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111005,Netherlands,Cell Biol Toxicol,Cell biology and toxicology,8506639,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Catalase/drug effects/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Modification Methylases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Decitabine', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance/*genetics', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Histones/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*administration & dosage', 'Protein Modification, Translational']",,2011/10/05 06:00,2012/04/20 06:00,['2011/10/05 06:00'],"['2011/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10565-011-9201-y [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biol Toxicol. 2012 Feb;28(1):11-8. doi: 10.1007/s10565-011-9201-y.

The progressive aplastic anemia suggests a defect in the ability of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) to sustain hematopoieis. We have examined the role of the nuclear FA core complex gene Fancg in the functionality of HSC. In Fancg-/- mice, we observed a decay of long-term HSC and multipotent progenitors that account for the reduction in the LSK compartment containing primitive hematopoietic cells. Fancg-/- lymphoid and myeloid progenitor cells were also affected, and myeloid progenitors show compromised in vitro functionality. HSC from Fancg-/- mice failed to engraft and to reconstitute at short and long term the hematopoiesis in a competitive transplantation assay. Fancg-/- LSK cells showed a loss of quiescence, an impaired migration in vitro in response to the chemokine CXCL12 and a defective homing to the BM after transplantation. Finally, the expression of several key genes involved in self-renewal, quiescence and migration of HSC was dysregulated in Fancg-deficient LSK subset. Collectively, our data reveal that Fancg should play a role in the regulation of physiological functions of HSC.","['Barroca, Vilma', 'Mouthon, Marc Andre', 'Lewandowski, Daniel', 'Brunet de la Grange, Philippe', 'Gauthier, Laurent Robert', 'Pflumio, Francoise', 'Boussin, Francois Dominique', 'Arwert, Fre', 'Riou, Lydia', 'Allemand, Isabelle', 'Romeo, Paul Henri', 'Fouchet, Pierre']","['Barroca V', 'Mouthon MA', 'Lewandowski D', 'Brunet de la Grange P', 'Gauthier LR', 'Pflumio F', 'Boussin FD', 'Arwert F', 'Riou L', 'Allemand I', 'Romeo PH', 'Fouchet P']","[""Laboratoire de Gametogenese Apoptose et Genotoxicite, Institut de Radiobiologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire, Direction des Sciences du Vivant, Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives, Fontenay-aux-Roses 92265, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111003,England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,"['0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Fancg protein, mouse)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group G Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cell Movement', 'Chemokine CXCL12/metabolism', 'Fanconi Anemia/genetics/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group G Protein/*deficiency/genetics', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic']",,2011/10/05 06:00,2012/04/07 06:00,['2011/10/05 06:00'],"['2011/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['ddr447 [pii]', '10.1093/hmg/ddr447 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 2012 Jan 1;21(1):121-35. doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddr447.

BIPP-induced apoptosis was evident by characteristics such as altered annexin-V binding, caspase activation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and cytochrome c release. BIPP also differentially activates initiator and effector caspases combined with the loss of MMP strongly suggesting that BIPP causes an intrinsic apoptosis in U937 leukemia cells.

The case of a 65-year-old woman with acute myeloid leukaemia who developed symptoms of sepsis during induction chemotherapy is presented. E. faecium with normal and SCV phenotype was isolated from blood cultures. At the same time urine culture was positive with E. faecium suggesting that bacteraemia originated from the urinary tract. The SCV phenotype was characterized by atypical growth behaviour. Electron microscopic analyses revealed perturbation of the separation of daughter cells and the accumulation of cell wall material. Accordingly, the SCV variant showed a dysfunction or lack of spontaneous autolysis whereas the normal phenotype did not. In contrast to conventional identification systems based on biochemical characteristics, the E. faecium SCV was precisely identified by MALDI-TOF MS analysis implemented in our laboratory. Hence, the increasing use of MALDI-TOF MS analysis for the identification of bacteria might be an appropriate tool for the detection of SCV variants, the diagnosis of which is of importance for the clinical outcome and the antibiotic treatment.","['Grobner, Sabine', 'Beck, Julia', 'Schaller, Martin', 'Autenrieth, Ingo B', 'Schulte, Berit']","['Grobner S', 'Beck J', 'Schaller M', 'Autenrieth IB', 'Schulte B']","['Institute of Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, University of Tubingen, Germany. sabine.groebner@med.uni-tuebingen.de']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20111002,Germany,Int J Med Microbiol,International journal of medical microbiology : IJMM,100898849,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bacteremia/complications/*microbiology', 'Bacteriolysis', 'Colony Count, Microbial', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field', 'Enterococcus faecium/drug effects/genetics/*growth & development/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome, Bacterial/genetics', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/complications/*microbiology', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*complications', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization']",,2011/10/05 06:00,2014/03/13 06:00,['2011/10/05 06:00'],"['2011/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/19 00:00 [revised]', '2011/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S1438-4221(11)00066-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijmm.2011.07.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Med Microbiol. 2012 Jan;302(1):40-4. doi: 10.1016/j.ijmm.2011.07.001.

CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 65-year-old male Caucasian patient with right-sided chylothorax caused by a concomitantly diagnosed chronic lymphocytic leukemia. As first-line treatment four cycles of an immunochemotherapy, consisting of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab were administered. In addition, our patient received total parenteral nutrition for the first two weeks of treatment. Despite the very good clinical response of the lymphoma to treatment, the chylothorax persisted and percutaneous radiotherapy of the thoracic duct was applied. However, eight weeks after the radiotherapy the chylothorax still persisted and our patient agreed to a surgical intervention. A ligation of the thoracic duct via a muscle sparing thoracotomy was performed, resulting in a complete cessation of the pleural effusion. Apart from the first two weeks our patient was treated on an out-patient basis for nearly six months. CONCLUSION: In this case of chylothorax caused by chronic lymphocytic leukemia, immunochemotherapy in combination with conservative treatment, and even consecutive radiotherapy, were not able to stop pleural effusion, despite the very good clinical response of the chronic lymphocytic leukemia to treatment.Out-patient management using repetitive thoracocenteses can be safe as bridging until definitive surgical ligation of the thoracic duct.","['Scholz, Godehard A', 'Sirbu, Horia', 'Semrau, Sabine', 'Anders, Katharina', 'Mackensen, Andreas', 'Spriewald, Bernd M']","['Scholz GA', 'Sirbu H', 'Semrau S', 'Anders K', 'Mackensen A', 'Spriewald BM']","['Department of Internal Medicine 5 - Hematology/Oncology, University of Erlangen-Nurnberg, Krankenhausstrasse 12, 91054 Erlangen, Germany. bernd.spriewald@uk-erlangen.de.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111003,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,,,,PMC3204301,2011/10/05 06:00,2011/10/05 06:01,['2011/10/05 06:00'],"['2011/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/05 06:01 [medline]']","['1752-1947-5-492 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-1947-5-492 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2011 Oct 3;5:492. doi: 10.1186/1752-1947-5-492.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, in silico screening of public gene-expression datasets identified cyclooxygenase-derived cyclopentenone prostaglandins (CyPGs) as likely agents to target malignant stem cells. We show here that Delta(12)-PGJ(3), a novel and naturally produced CyPG from the dietary fish-oil omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5) alleviates the development of leukemia in 2 well-studied murine models of leukemia. IP administration of Delta(12)-PGJ(3) to mice infected with Friend erythroleukemia virus or those expressing the chronic myelogenous leukemia oncoprotein BCR-ABL in the hematopoietic stem cell pool completely restored normal hematologic parameters, splenic histology, and enhanced survival. More importantly, Delta(12)-PGJ(3) selectively targeted leukemia stem cells (LSCs) for apoptosis in the spleen and BM. This treatment completely eradicated LSCs in vivo, as demonstrated by the inability of donor cells from treated mice to cause leukemia in secondary transplantations. Given the potency of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid-derived CyPGs and the well-known refractoriness of LSCs to currently used clinical agents, Delta(12)-PGJ(3) may represent a new chemotherapeutic for leukemia that targets LSCs.","['Hegde, Shailaja', 'Kaushal, Naveen', 'Ravindra, Kodihalli C', 'Chiaro, Christopher', 'Hafer, Kelsey T', 'Gandhi, Ujjawal H', 'Thompson, Jerry T', 'van den Heuvel, John P', 'Kennett, Mary J', 'Hankey, Pamela', 'Paulson, Robert F', 'Prabhu, K Sandeep']","['Hegde S', 'Kaushal N', 'Ravindra KC', 'Chiaro C', 'Hafer KT', 'Gandhi UH', 'Thompson JT', 'van den Heuvel JP', 'Kennett MJ', 'Hankey P', 'Paulson RF', 'Prabhu KS']","['Center for Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease, Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, 16802, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20111003,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclopentanes)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Omega-3)', '0 (Prostaglandins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (delta12-prostaglandin J3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Atm protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'Q0U2IGF9CK (cyclopentenone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclopentanes/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fatty Acids, Omega-3/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Macrophages/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Prostaglandins/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Splenomegaly/pathology/prevention & control', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3245211,2011/10/05 06:00,2012/03/21 06:00,['2011/10/05 06:00'],"['2011/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40247-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-11-317750 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Dec 22;118(26):6909-19. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-11-317750.

We have performed a thorough prognostic evaluation of these genetic markers in patients with pediatric AML enrolled in the Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (NOPHO) 1993 or NOPHO 2004 protocols. Mutation status and expression levels were analyzed in 185 and 149 patients, respectively. Presence of FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) was associated with significantly inferior event-free survival (EFS), whereas presence of an NPM1 mutation in the absence of FLT3-ITD correlated with significantly improved EFS. Furthermore, high levels of ERG and BAALC transcripts were associated with inferior EFS. No significant correlation with survival was seen for mutations in CEBPA and WT1 or with gene expression levels of MN1, FLT3, and WT1. In multivariate analysis, the presence of FLT3-ITD and high BAALC expression were identified as independent prognostic markers of inferior EFS.

The primary endpoint was overall response rate (complete remission [CR] plus CR without platelet recovery [CRp]). Among the 25 patients (median age, 14 years; pre-B cell ALL, 84%; >/= 2 prior regimens: 84%; refractory to previous regimen: 60%), the overall response rate was 44% (7 CR, 4 CRp) with a 67.3-week median duration or remission censored at last follow-up. Most patients proceeded to alternative therapy, and 10 patients (40%) received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Six patients (24%) died because of treatment-related adverse events associated with infection, hepatotoxicity, and/or multiorgan failure. The study protocol was amended to exclude patients with prior hematopoietic stem cell transplantation after 4 of the first 8 patients developed severe hepatotoxicity suggestive of veno-occlusive disease. No additional cases of veno-occlusive disease occurred. The regimen offered encouraging response rates and sustained remission in R/R patients. Future investigation should include exploration of patient selection, dosing, and supportive care.

Genome analyses of lower and higher vertebrates revealed that the existence of Nanog is restricted to gnathostomata but absent from agnatha and invertebrates. To elucidate the function of Nanog in nonmammalia, we identified the Danio rerio ortholog of Nanog and characterized its role in gain and loss of function experiments. We found Nanog to be crucial for survival of early zebrafish embryos, because depletion of Nanog led to gastrulation defects with subsequent lethality. Mouse Nanog overexpression could rescue these defects. Vice versa, zebrafish Nanog was found to promote proliferation and to inhibit differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor. These findings indicate functional conservation of Nanog from teleost fishes to mammals. However, Nanog was lost in the genome of the anurans Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that deletion probably occurred in a common anuran ancestor along with chromosomal translocations. The closest homologs of Nanog in Xenopus are the Vent proteins. We, therefore, investigated whether the Xvent genes might substitute for Nanog function in Xenopus. Although we found some similarities in phenotypes after overexpression and in the regulation of several marker genes, Xvent1/2 and Nanog cannot substitute each other. Depletion of Nanog in zebrafish cannot be rescued by ectopic expression of Xvent, and Xvent depletion in Xenopus cannot be overcome by ectopic expression of zebrafish Nanog.","['Schuff, Maximilian', 'Siegel, Doreen', 'Philipp, Melanie', 'Bundschu, Karin', 'Heymann, Nicole', 'Donow, Cornelia', 'Knochel, Walter']","['Schuff M', 'Siegel D', 'Philipp M', 'Bundschu K', 'Heymann N', 'Donow C', 'Knochel W']","['Institute of Biochemistry, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111003,United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (Nanog protein, zebrafish)', '0 (Xenopus Proteins)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian/drug effects/metabolism', 'Embryonic Development/drug effects/genetics', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Genetic Variation/drug effects', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Species Specificity', 'Xenopus Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Xenopus laevis/*metabolism', 'Zebrafish/embryology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Zebrafish Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3353760,2011/10/05 06:00,2012/08/30 06:00,['2011/10/05 06:00'],"['2011/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/scd.2011.0285 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2012 May 20;21(8):1225-38. doi: 10.1089/scd.2011.0285.

They were found to predict worse overall survival (OS) of mutated patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: RT-PCR followed by direct sequencing was used to test the presence of DNMT3A mutations in 226 AML patients with an intermediate-risk (IR) cytogenetics. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients of 226 (29.6%) carried a mutation in the DNMT3A gene. Occurrence of DNMT3A mutations was associated with female sex (P = 0.027) and with the presence of FLT3/ITD (P = 0.003), but not with particular FAB subtypes. Patients with DNMT3A mutation had higher initial WBC counts than those without it (P = 0.064) only because of higher incidence of FLT3/ITD within these cases. There was no difference between mutated and wild-type groups in reaching complete remission (CR) (P = 0.380). OS was not affected by DNMT3A mutation (P = 0.251), but OS of patients who reached CR was longer in DNMT3A negative cases (P = 0.025). Patients with DNMT3A mutation had a higher relapse rate (P = 0.007). Patients carrying both the DNMT3A mutation and FLT3/ITD relapsed more often than either patients with single DNMT3A mutation (P = 0.044) or patients with FLT3/ITD only (P = 0.058). DNMT3A mutations were associated with higher relapse rate even within the FLT3/ITD-negative group (P = 0.072). After reaching CR, these two genetic factors were independent predictors of relapse at multivariate analysis (P < 0.001). Only three of 30 'double-mutated' (FLT3/ITD+, DNMT3A+) patients are still alive, all of them having undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplant. CONCLUSIONS: We have confirmed the high incidence of DNMT3A mutations in patients with AML with IR cytogenetics. Patients with DNMT3A mutations relapse more often and have inferior OS when only patients achieving CR are analyzed. 'Double-mutated' patients have a very poor prognosis.","['Markova, Jana', 'Michkova, Petra', 'Burckova, Katerina', 'Brezinova, Jana', 'Michalova, Kyra', 'Dohnalova, Alena', 'Maaloufova, Jacqueline Soukupova', 'Soukup, Petr', 'Vitek, Antonin', 'Cetkovsky, Petr', 'Schwarz, Jiri']","['Markova J', 'Michkova P', 'Burckova K', 'Brezinova J', 'Michalova K', 'Dohnalova A', 'Maaloufova JS', 'Soukup P', 'Vitek A', 'Cetkovsky P', 'Schwarz J']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111117,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Codon', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/metabolism']",,2011/10/05 06:00,2012/03/10 06:00,['2011/10/05 06:00'],"['2011/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01716.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2012 Feb;88(2):128-35. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01716.x.

Here, we investigated the role of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in human and murine decidualization. Ex vivo human (H) ESC decidualization was induced by estrogen (E, 10(-8) M) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA, 10(-7) M). Exogenous LIF (>/=50 ng/ml) induced STAT3 phosphorylation in non-decidualized and decidualized HESC and enhanced E+MPA-induced decidualization (measured by PRL secretion, P<0.05). LIF mRNA in HESC was down-regulated by decidualization treatment (E+MPA) whereas LIF receptor (R) mRNA was up-regulated, suggesting that the decidualization stimulus 'primed' HESC for LIF action, but that factors not present in our in vitro model were required to induce LIF expression. Ex vivo first trimester decidual biopsies secreted >100 pg/mg G-CSF, IL6, IL8, and MCP1. Decidualized HESC secreted IL6, IL8, IL15 and MCP1. LIF (50 ng/ml) up-regulated IL6 and IL15 (P<0.05) secretion in decidualized HESC compared to 0.5 ng/ml LIF. In murine endometrium, LIF and LIFR immunolocalized to decidualized stromal cells on day 5 of gestation (day 0 = day of plug detection). Western blotting confirmed that LIF and the LIFR were up-regulated in intra-implantation sites compared to inter-implantation sites on Day 5 of gestation. To determine the role of LIF during in vivo murine decidualization, intra-peritoneal injections of a long-acting LIF antagonist (PEGLA; 900 or 1200 microg) were given just post-attachment, during the initiation of decidualization on day 4. PEGLA treatment reduced implantation site decidual area (P<0.05) and desmin staining immuno-intensity (P<0.05) compared to control on day 6 of gestation. This study demonstrated that LIF was an important regulator of decidualization in humans and mice and data provides insight into the processes underlying decidualization, which are important for understanding implantation and placentation.","['Shuya, Lorraine Lin', 'Menkhorst, Ellen Melaleuca', 'Yap, Joanne', 'Li, Priscilla', 'Lane, Natalie', 'Dimitriadis, Evdokia']","['Shuya LL', 'Menkhorst EM', 'Yap J', 'Li P', 'Lane N', 'Dimitriadis E']","[""Embryo Implantation Laboratory, Prince Henry's Institute, Clayton, Melbourne, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110923,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Desmin)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Decidua/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Desmin/genetics/metabolism', 'Embryo Implantation/physiology', 'Endometrium/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Trimester, First/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3179507,2011/10/04 06:00,2012/02/11 06:00,['2011/10/04 06:00'],"['2011/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0025288 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-09735 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(9):e25288. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0025288.

Recently, we reported a role of misfolded-conformation dependent loss (MCDL) of N-CoR in the activation of oncogenic survival pathway in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Since N-CoR plays important role in cellular homeostasis in various tissues, therefore, we hypothesized that an APL like MCDL of N-CoR might also be involved in other malignancy. Indeed, our initial screening of N-CoR status in various leukemia and solid tumor cells revealed an APL like MCDL of N-CoR in primary and secondary tumor cells derived from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The NSCLC cell specific N-CoR loss could be blocked by Kaletra, a clinical grade protease inhibitor and by genistein, an inhibitor of N-CoR misfolding previously characterized by us. The misfolded N-CoR presented in NSCLC cells was linked to the amplification of ER stress and was subjected to degradation by NSCLC cell specific aberrant protease activity. In NSCLC cells, misfolded N-CoR was found to be associated with Hsc70, a molecular chaperone involved in chaperone mediated autophagy (CMA). Genetic and chemical inhibition of Lamp2A, a rate limiting factor of CMA, significantly blocked the loss of N-CoR in NSCLC cells, suggesting a crucial role of CMA in N-CoR degradation.

These cells were incubated with different concentrations of propolis and 48 hours after the IC(50) was calculated for each cell. The results showed that the red propolis has cytotoxic effect in vitro higher than green propolis. Red propolis was showed to be cytostatic in K562 cells and caused the same amount of apoptosis as its control Gleevec. In conclusion, these results showed that red propolis is more cytotoxic than the green propolis in a variety of human cell lines of leukemia. Red propolis may contain drugs capable of inhibiting cancer cell growth. Therefore, further isolation of respective chemical ingredients from the red propolis (G13) for identification of the activities is necessary.","['Franchi, Gilberto C Jr', 'Moraes, Cleber S', 'Toreti, Viviane C', 'Daugsch, Andreas', 'Nowill, Alexandre E', 'Park, Yong K']","['Franchi GC Jr', 'Moraes CS', 'Toreti VC', 'Daugsch A', 'Nowill AE', 'Park YK']","['Integrated Center for Childhood Onco-Hematological Investigation, State University of Campinas, P.O.

It is based on the highly selective interaction between the proteasome's catalytic beta5 subunit and immobilized inhibitors (the synthetic peptide PSI and epoxomicin). Inhibitor concentration and pH were optimized. Analytical responses, linear ranges, accuracy, precision and interferences were investigated. Biosensors based on either PSI and epoxomicin were found to be suitable for quantitative determination of the proteasome, with a precision of +/-10% for each, and recoveries of 102% and 113%, respectively, and with little interference by albumin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, cathepsin B and papain.

It occurs in 1-2.5% of AML and is also observed in myelodysplastic syndromes and in the blastic phase of chronic myeloid leukemia. The molecular consequence of the inv(3)/t(3;3) rearrangements is the juxtaposition of the ribophorin I (RPN1) gene (located in band 3q21) with the ecotropic viral integration site 1 (EVI1) gene (located in band 3q26.2). Following conventional cytogenetics to determine the karyotype, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with a panel of bacterial artificial chromosome clones was used to map the breakpoints involved in 15 inv(3)/t(3;3). Inv(3) or t(3;3) was the sole karyotypic anomaly in 6 patients, while additional abnormalities were identified in the remaining 9 patients, including 4 with monosomy of chromosome7 (-7) or a deletion of its long arm (7q-). Breakpoints in band 3q21 were distributed in a 235 kb region centromeric to and including the RPN1 locus, while those in band 3q26.2 were scattered in a 900 kb region located on each side of and including the EVI1 locus. In contrast to most of the inversions and translocations associated with AML that lead to fusion genes, inv(3)/t(3;3) does not generate a chimeric gene, but rather induces gene overexpression. The wide dispersion of the breakpoints in bands 3q21 and 3q26 and the heterogeneity of the genomic consequences could explain why the mechanisms leading to leukemogenesis are still poorly understood. Therefore, it is important to further characterize these chromosomal abnormalities by FISH.","['De Braekeleer, Etienne', 'Douet-Guilbert, Nathalie', 'Basinko, Audrey', 'Bovo, Clement', 'Gueganic, Nadia', 'Le Bris, Marie-Josee', 'Morel, Frederic', 'De Braekeleer, Marc']","['De Braekeleer E', 'Douet-Guilbert N', 'Basinko A', 'Bovo C', 'Gueganic N', 'Le Bris MJ', 'Morel F', 'De Braekeleer M']","['University of Brest, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Brest, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['*Chromosome Breakage', 'Chromosome Inversion/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Artificial, Bacterial/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3/*genetics', 'Cytogenetics/*methods', 'DNA Probes/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogenes/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,2011/10/04 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/10/04 06:00'],"['2011/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['31/10/3441 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2011 Oct;31(10):3441-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MDR is caused by overexpression of the efflux transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1). These transporters act to maintain sublethal intracellular drug concentrations within the cancer cell, making the population treatment unresponsive. Recently, we discovered a novel nongenetic basis to MDR whereby microparticles (MPs) transfer P-gp intercellularly from MDR donor cells to drug-sensitive recipient cells. MPs isolated from MDR leukemia and breast cancer cells were cocultured with their drug-sensitive counterparts. P-gp transfer was assessed by direct immunolabeling, and acquired transcripts and regulatory microRNAs by quantitative real-time PCR. We show that MDR MPs incorporate nucleic acids; MPs change recipient cells' transcriptional environment to reflect donor MDR phenotype, and distinct pathways exist among cancers of different origin that may be dependent on donor cells' ABCB1 overexpression. We demonstrate that this pathway exists for both hematological and nonhematological malignancies. By conferring MDR and ""retemplating"" the transcriptional landscape of recipient cells, MPs provide a novel pathway, having implications in the dissemination and acquisition of deleterious traits in clinical oncology.","['Jaiswal, Ritu', 'Gong, Joyce', 'Sambasivam, Shwetha', 'Combes, Valery', 'Mathys, Jean-Marie', 'Davey, Ross', 'Grau, Georges E R', 'Bebawy, Mary']","['Jaiswal R', 'Gong J', 'Sambasivam S', 'Combes V', 'Mathys JM', 'Davey R', 'Grau GE', 'Bebawy M']","['Sydney Medical School and Bosch Institute, University of Sydney,Sydney, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110930,United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Nucleic Acids)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Cell Communication/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell-Derived Microparticles/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleic Acids/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Protein Transport/physiology']",,2011/10/04 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/10/04 06:00'],"['2011/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['fj.11-186817 [pii]', '10.1096/fj.11-186817 [doi]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2012 Jan;26(1):420-9. doi: 10.1096/fj.11-186817.

Data suggest the interleukin (IL)6-type cytokines, leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), IL6, oncostatin M (OSM) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), are able to regulate the survival, proliferation and differentiation of fetal murine germ cells (GCs) in vivo and in vitro. We postulated that these factors may play a similar role during early human GC development and primordial follicle formation. To test this hypothesis, we have investigated the expression and regulation of IL6-type cytokines, using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Expression of transcripts encoding OSM increased significantly across the gestational range examined (8-20 weeks), while expression of IL6 increased specifically between the first (8-11 weeks) and early second (12-16 weeks) trimesters, co-incident with the initiation of meiosis. LIF and CNTF expression remained unchanged. Expression of the genes encoding the LIF and IL6 receptors, and their common signalling subunit gp130, was also found to be developmentally regulated, with expression increasing significantly with increasing gestation. LIF receptor and gp130 proteins localized exclusively to GCs, including oocytes in primordial follicles, indicating this cell type to be the sole target of IL6-type cytokine signalling in the human fetal ovary. These data establish that IL6-type cytokines and their receptors are expressed in the human fetal ovary and may directly influence GC development at multiple stages of maturation.","['Eddie, Sharon L', 'Childs, Andrew J', 'Jabbour, Henry N', 'Anderson, Richard A']","['Eddie SL', 'Childs AJ', 'Jabbour HN', 'Anderson RA']","[""MRC Centre for Reproductive Health, The Queen' s Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH16 4TJ, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110930,England,Mol Hum Reprod,Molecular human reproduction,9513710,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Oncostatin M)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fetus', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gestational Age', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncostatin M/genetics/metabolism', 'Oocytes/growth & development/*metabolism', 'Ovarian Follicle/growth & development/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Trimesters', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Oncostatin M/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics']",,2011/10/04 06:00,2012/09/15 06:00,['2011/10/04 06:00'],"['2011/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/15 06:00 [medline]']","['gar061 [pii]', '10.1093/molehr/gar061 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Hum Reprod. 2012 Feb;18(2):88-95. doi: 10.1093/molehr/gar061.

AMU-AML1 cells were positive for CD13, CD33, CD117, and HLA-DR by flow cytometry analysis and showed a single chromosomal abnormality, 46, XY, t(12;22)(p13;q11.2), by G-banding and spectral karyotyping. Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis indicated that the chromosomal breakpoint in band 12p13 was in the sequence from the 5' untranslated region to intron 1 of TEL and that the chromosomal breakpoint in band 22q11 was in the 3' untranslated region of MN1. The chimeric transcript and protein of MN1-TEL could not be detected by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or Western blot analysis.

To determine whether the lateral DEP microseparator was useful, it was used to detect acute leukemia by measuring the size distribution of blood cells. The lateral DEP microseparator provided a practical method for continuously and simultaneously separating multi-cell populations by size from a heterogeneous cell population. In the future, sensitivity of the lateral DEP microseparator could be improved and it could be automated by integrating subsequent advanced detection technologies in a micro-format.","['Han, Song-I', 'Lee, Sang-Min', 'Joo, Young-Don', 'Han, Ki-Ho']","['Han SI', 'Lee SM', 'Joo YD', 'Han KH']","['Department of Nano Engineering, Center for Nano Manufacturing, Inje University, GyongNam, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110930,England,Lab Chip,Lab on a chip,101128948,,IM,"['Blood Cells/*cytology/pathology', 'Cell Separation/*instrumentation', '*Cell Size', 'Electrophoresis/*instrumentation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood', 'Microtechnology/*instrumentation']",,2011/10/04 06:00,2012/02/24 06:00,['2011/10/04 06:00'],"['2011/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c1lc20413k [doi]'],ppublish,Lab Chip. 2011 Nov 21;11(22):3864-72. doi: 10.1039/c1lc20413k.

The aims of the present study were to evaluate and classify a subtype of AML (acute myeloid leukemia) that was induced by NMU. According to previous publications, NMU induces not only mammary cancer but also leukemia in Sprague-Dawley (S-D) rats. However, the subtype of leukemia involved in NMU-treated rats is unknown. We found that both organ weight and relative organ weights were significantly higher in NMU-exposed rats than in controls. Morphological changes of rat livers and spleens were assessed by histological evaluation (H&E staining), which found that these tissues were abnormal in appearance. Also, cytological examination of the blood showed immature white blood cells in a smear using Liu's and Papanicolaou stains, indicating that gross abnormalities and histopathological changes were pathologically observed. NMU leukemia incidence was 97.1%. In this study, immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was valuable in classifying the leukemia of poorly differentiated blasts induced by NMU. Paraffin blocks were stained for MPO, CD3, CD15, CD20, and CD34 markers. The NMU-induced group was positive for MPO, but negative for CD3, CD15, CD20, and CD34. These CD markers suggest that they are useful in helping diagnose APL (M3) leukemia. The model of NMU-induced leukemogenesis in an S-D rat suggests a more definite way to classify APL. This APL will provide an important tool for chemical carcinogenesis and leukemia studies.","['Chang, Yun-Ching', 'Hsu, Jeng-Dong', 'Lin, Wea-Lung', 'Lee, Yi-Ju', 'Wang, Chau-Jong']","['Chang YC', 'Hsu JD', 'Lin WL', 'Lee YJ', 'Wang CJ']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, Chung Shan Medical University, No. 110, Sec. 1, Jianguo N.

Overexpression of COX-2 or 5-LOX increases levels of PGE-2 and 5-HETE, respectively. Elevated levels of VEGF are common in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We prospectively measured VEGF in serum collected from patients enrolled in Cancer and Leukemia Group B 30203, a randomized phase II study of eicosanoid modulation in addition to chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC, to determine whether these levels had prognostic significance and whether they correlated with COX-2 expression and/or responded to inhibition of COX-2 or 5-LOX. METHODS: Pre- and post-treatment serum was collected from patients enrolled in CALGB 30203. Serum VEGF levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methodology. Statistical analyses were performed to determine the correlation between pretreatment serum VEGF levels and time of overall survival. Pretreatment formalin fixed tissue was stained for 5-LOX and COX-2 by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The median baseline VEGF level was 502 pg/ml (range, 55-3453 pg/ml). Dichotomized serum VEGF levels at median inversely correlated with survival time (p = 0.008), as did VEGF levels as a continuous variable in multivariate analysis (p = 0.035). VEGF levels were significantly correlated neither with baseline COX-2 expression (Pearson r = 0.1524, p = 0.271) nor with 5-LOX expression. Treatment with COX-2 or 5-LOX inhibitors did not alter the levels. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that elevated serum VEGF is a negative prognostic variable in NSCLC. VEGF levels are neither correlated with baseline tumor COX-2 expression nor do they respond to COX-2 and/or 5-LOX inhibition plus chemotherapy.","['Edelman, Martin J', 'Hodgson, Lydia', 'Wang, Xiaofei', 'Christenson, Robert', 'Jewell, Scott', 'Vokes, Everett', 'Kratzke, Robert']","['Edelman MJ', 'Hodgson L', 'Wang X', 'Christenson R', 'Jewell S', 'Vokes E', 'Kratzke R']","['University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center, Baltimore, Maryland 21201, USA. medelman@umm.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Thorac Oncol,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,101274235,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)', 'JCX84Q7J1L (Celecoxib)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/blood/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Carboplatin/administration & dosage', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*blood/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/blood/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Celecoxib', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/blood/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/blood/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pyrazoles/administration & dosage', 'Sulfonamides/administration & dosage', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*blood']",PMC5673085,2011/10/04 06:00,2012/02/10 06:00,['2011/10/04 06:00'],"['2011/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/JTO.0b013e31822a7383 [doi]', 'S1556-0864(15)32254-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Thorac Oncol. 2011 Nov;6(11):1902-6. doi: 10.1097/JTO.0b013e31822a7383.,,,,"['CA11789/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA29165/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA031946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45808/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA12046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77440/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77597/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77406/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA033601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA59518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60138/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45389/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37447/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA08025/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA003927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['NIHMS916023'],,,,,,,,,,

Determining the required molecular events for glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis will identify resistance mechanisms and suggest strategies for overcoming resistance. In this study, we found that glucocorticoid treatment of WEHI7.2 murine thymic lymphoma cells increased the steady-state [H(2)O(2)] and oxidized the intracellular redox environment before cytochrome c release. Removal of glucocorticoids after the H(2)O(2) increase resulted in a 30% clonogenicity; treatment with PEG-CAT increased clonogenicity to 65%. Human leukemia cell lines also showed increased H(2)O(2) in response to glucocorticoids and attenuated apoptosis after PEG-CAT treatment. WEHI7.2 cells that overexpress catalase (CAT2, CAT38) or were selected for resistance to H(2)O(2) (200R) removed enough of the H(2)O(2) generated by glucocorticoids to prevent oxidation of the intracellular redox environment. CAT2, CAT38, and 200R cells showed a 90-100% clonogenicity. The resistant cells maintained pERK survival signaling in response to glucocorticoids, whereas the sensitive cells did not. Treating the resistant cells with a MEK inhibitor sensitized them to glucocorticoids. These data indicate that: (1) an increase in H(2)O(2) is necessary for glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in lymphoid cells, (2) increased H(2)O(2) removal causes glucocorticoid resistance, and (3) MEK inhibition can sensitize oxidative stress-resistant cells to glucocorticoids.","['Tome, Margaret E', 'Jaramillo, Melba C', 'Briehl, Margaret M']","['Tome ME', 'Jaramillo MC', 'Briehl MM']","['Department of Pathology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85724, USA. mtome@u.arizona.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20110910,United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,"['0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC3208737,2011/10/04 06:00,2012/03/29 06:00,['2011/10/04 06:00'],"['2011/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/01 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0891-5849(11)00568-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2011.09.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 2011 Dec 1;51(11):2048-59. doi: 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2011.09.002.

BBR3378, a novel aza-anthrapyrazole, is structurally similar to mitoxantrone, but lacks the ring hydroxyls that may contribute to cardiotoxicity. Here, we investigated the therapeutic activity of BBR3378 in a C57BL/6 mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Mice given BBR3378, before or after the priming and expansion of MOG-specific responses, were protected from ascending paralysis. Strikingly, two doses of BBR3378 given a week after EAE induction were sufficient to provide significant protection from clinical symptoms and reduce MOG-specific proinflammatory T cell cytokine production, and serum IgG responses. Furthermore, while mitoxantrone is associated with persistent lymphopenia and cardiotoxicity, no such outcomes were detected in BBR3378-treated mice. Our findings show that BBR3378 can ameliorate encephalitogenic mechanisms in EAE and antagonize underlying autoimmune mechanisms.","['Kiraly, Alex', 'Koffman, Boyd', 'Hacker, Miles', 'Gunning, William', 'Rasche, Sarah', 'Quinn, Anthony']","['Kiraly A', 'Koffman B', 'Hacker M', 'Gunning W', 'Rasche S', 'Quinn A']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Toledo Medical Center, Toledo, OH 43614, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110830,United States,Clin Immunol,"Clinical immunology (Orlando, Fla.)",100883537,"['0 (BBR3378)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Mog protein, mouse)', '0 (Myelin Proteins)', '0 (Myelin-Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoimmunity/*drug effects/immunology', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/drug effects/immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Disease Progression', 'Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Female', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood/drug effects/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mitoxantrone/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Multiple Sclerosis/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Myelin Proteins/immunology', 'Myelin-Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology']",,2011/10/04 06:00,2012/01/27 06:00,['2011/10/04 06:00'],"['2011/04/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/17 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S1521-6616(11)00243-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clim.2011.08.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Immunol. 2011 Dec;141(3):304-16. doi: 10.1016/j.clim.2011.08.009.

Many MLL-fusion partners are members of the super elongation complex (SEC), a critical regulator of transcriptional elongation, suggesting that aberrant control of this process has an important role in leukaemia induction. Here we use a global proteomic strategy to demonstrate that MLL fusions, as part of SEC and the polymerase-associated factor complex (PAFc), are associated with the BET family of acetyl-lysine recognizing, chromatin 'adaptor' proteins. These data provided the basis for therapeutic intervention in MLL-fusion leukaemia, via the displacement of the BET family of proteins from chromatin. We show that a novel small molecule inhibitor of the BET family, GSK1210151A (I-BET151), has profound efficacy against human and murine MLL-fusion leukaemic cell lines, through the induction of early cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. I-BET151 treatment in two human leukaemia cell lines with different MLL fusions alters the expression of a common set of genes whose function may account for these phenotypic changes. The mode of action of I-BET151 is, at least in part, due to the inhibition of transcription at key genes (BCL2, C-MYC and CDK6) through the displacement of BRD3/4, PAFc and SEC components from chromatin. In vivo studies indicate that I-BET151 has significant therapeutic value, providing survival benefit in two distinct mouse models of murine MLL-AF9 and human MLL-AF4 leukaemia. Finally, the efficacy of I-BET151 against human leukaemia stem cells is demonstrated, providing further evidence of its potent therapeutic potential. These findings establish the displacement of BET proteins from chromatin as a promising epigenetic therapy for these aggressive leukaemias.","['Dawson, Mark A', 'Prinjha, Rab K', 'Dittmann, Antje', 'Giotopoulos, George', 'Bantscheff, Marcus', 'Chan, Wai-In', 'Robson, Samuel C', 'Chung, Chun-wa', 'Hopf, Carsten', 'Savitski, Mikhail M', 'Huthmacher, Carola', 'Gudgin, Emma', 'Lugo, Dave', 'Beinke, Soren', 'Chapman, Trevor D', 'Roberts, Emma J', 'Soden, Peter E', 'Auger, Kurt R', 'Mirguet, Olivier', 'Doehner, Konstanze', 'Delwel, Ruud', 'Burnett, Alan K', 'Jeffrey, Phillip', 'Drewes, Gerard', 'Lee, Kevin', 'Huntly, Brian J P', 'Kouzarides, Tony']","['Dawson MA', 'Prinjha RK', 'Dittmann A', 'Giotopoulos G', 'Bantscheff M', 'Chan WI', 'Robson SC', 'Chung CW', 'Hopf C', 'Savitski MM', 'Huthmacher C', 'Gudgin E', 'Lugo D', 'Beinke S', 'Chapman TD', 'Roberts EJ', 'Soden PE', 'Auger KR', 'Mirguet O', 'Doehner K', 'Delwel R', 'Burnett AK', 'Jeffrey P', 'Drewes G', 'Lee K', 'Huntly BJ', 'Kouzarides T']","['Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research and Addenbrookes Hospital, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 0XY, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111002,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (GSK1210151A)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Multiprotein Complexes/chemistry/metabolism', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Proteomics', 'Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",PMC3679520,2011/10/04 06:00,2012/01/27 06:00,['2011/10/04 06:00'],"['2011/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['nature10509 [pii]', '10.1038/nature10509 [doi]']",epublish,Nature. 2011 Oct 2;478(7370):529-33. doi: 10.1038/nature10509.,,,,"['092096/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'G0800784/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G116/187/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",,['EMS53285'],,,,['NLM: EMS53285'],,,,,,

These studies have been controversial because a number of laboratories have been unable to find evidence of XMRV in similar groups of patients or controls. Because the existence of XMRV raises many questions, we decided to study its presence in a group of patients infected with HIV-1 with a high proportion of intravenous drug use and coinfection by hepatitis C virus. METHODS: Forty HIV-1-infected patients under follow-up in our institution were screened for XMRV/MLV by nested polymerase chain reaction using primers targeting the gag and env region. Specific primers for mouse mitochondrial DNA were used to rule out contamination. RESULTS: No evidence of XMRV or polytropic MLV-related sequences was found in any sample from patients or controls. Four samples yielded polymerase chain reaction bands whose sequence corresponded to murine endogenous retroviral sequences, however, contamination with mouse cell DNA was subsequently confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: XMRV/MLV viruses do not seem to be associated with HIV-1 infection or intravenous drug use. Contamination of samples or reagents by genomic murine DNA or XMRV vectors could account for the sporadic detection of positive samples for XMRV and related agents.","['Luczkowiak, Joanna', 'Martinez-Prats, Lorena', 'Sierra, Olalla', 'Fiorante, Silvana', 'Rubio, Rafael', 'Pulido, Federico', 'Otero, Joaquin R', 'Delgado, Rafael']","['Luczkowiak J', 'Martinez-Prats L', 'Sierra O', 'Fiorante S', 'Rubio R', 'Pulido F', 'Otero JR', 'Delgado R']","['Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, Instituto de Investigacion i+12, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999),100892005,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA, Viral/analysis/genetics', 'HIV Infections/*virology', '*HIV-1', 'Hepatitis B/virology', 'Hepatitis C/virology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Mice', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Retroviridae Infections/genetics/*virology', 'Spain', 'Tumor Virus Infections/genetics/virology', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/genetics/*isolation & purification']",,2011/10/04 06:00,2012/03/09 06:00,['2011/10/04 06:00'],"['2011/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/QAI.0b013e318238b596 [doi]'],ppublish,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr. 2012 Feb 1;59(2):101-4. doi: 10.1097/QAI.0b013e318238b596.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wilms' tumor (WT1) protein is one of the potent tumor antigens inducing immunological response in mouse and human, because WT1 is over expressed in many types of leukemia and various kinds of solid tumors. A 9-mer peptide encoded in WT1 protein (CMTWNQMNL; amino acid 235-243) is known to serve as antigenic peptide for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*2402 molecule. It was reported that the replacement of the second amino residue, which is deeply responsible for the peptide binding to HLA, induced strong immunological response compared to the natural peptide. In this study, 19 kinds of single amino substitutions were introduced at position 2 of this 9-mer WT1 peptide. We performed molecular dynamics simulation on the complex of each of WT1 epitope peptides and HLA-beta2 micro globulin (beta2m) molecule, and subsequently estimated the binding affinity using molecular mechanics/generalized-Born surface area method combined with normal mode analysis. Our computation indicated that the peptide containing M2Y or M2W mutation showed high binding affinity to the HLA-beta2m molecule as well as the natural peptide. We have also examined the role of the residue at position 2 in peptide binding to HLA-beta2m. The calculation showed that van der Waals interaction between the side chain of the residue at position 2 and hydrophobic residues inside B-pocket of HLA are important.

We evaluated the ability of an MM ranking system, HistoCheck, to predict the risk associated with HLA class I disparity in a population of 744 single allele or antigen HLA-A, -B, or -C MM myeloablative unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients with acute myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome, facilitated through the National Marrow Donor Program between 1988 and 2003. Multivariate models were used to adjust for other significant clinical risk factors. HLA MMs were scored using the HistoCheck Web-based tool, and the patients were divided into 4 quartiles: dissimilarity score (DSS) 1.04-2.84 (allele MM), DSS >2.84-13.75 (allele and antigen MM), DSS >13.75-19.39 (antigen MM), and DSS >19.39-36.62 (antigen MM). Using the lowest scoring quartile as the reference, the DSS groups were evaluated for associations with relapse, treatment-related mortality, acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease, leukemia-free survival, and overall survival in the entire cohort and also in subset analyses by disease and disease stage. No significant associations were found between DSS and any outcomes in the overall cohort using the quartile categories or treating DSS as a continuous variable.

However, only a few studies report that IL-2RAs prevent GVHD. Here we first retrospectively explored the prophylactic effects of basiliximab or daclizumab against GVHD in 82 patients with hematologic malignancies following unrelated donor-peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (URD-PBSCT). All recipients achieved engraftment. The rates of grade II-IV and III-IV acute GVHD (aGVHD) were 35.4% and 15.9%, respectively. Chronic GVHD (cGVHD) developed in 38.7% of evaluable patients. The transplantation-related mortality was 13.4%, while relapse rate was 8.5%. The 2-year overall survival (OS) reached 77.1% and disease-free survival (DFS) accumulated to 72.2%. The side effects of basiliximab and daclizumab were moderate and tolerable. There were no significant differences in aGVHD onset and survival between the daclizumab and basiliximab groups. However, basiliximab presented superior prophylactic effects on cGVHD than daclizumab. In conclusion, basiliximab or daclizumab prevents GVHD efficiently and feasibly following URD-PBSCT, and contributes to favorable outcome. Basiliximab has a similar effect on aGVHD but superior activity against cGVHD. Further prospective and randomized control studies are needed.","['Fang, Jun', 'Hu, Chenghao', 'Hong, Mei', 'Wu, Qiuling', 'You, Yong', 'Zhong, Zhaodong', 'Li, Weiming', 'Zou, Ping', 'Hu, Yu', 'Xia, Linghui']","['Fang J', 'Hu C', 'Hong M', 'Wu Q', 'You Y', 'Zhong Z', 'Li W', 'Zou P', 'Hu Y', 'Xia L']","[""Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110929,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Antibodies, Blocking)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '9927MT646M (Basiliximab)', 'CUJ2MVI71Y (Daclizumab)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Blocking/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Basiliximab', 'Child', 'China', 'Daclizumab', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Grading', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Unrelated Donors']",,2011/10/04 06:00,2013/05/04 06:00,['2011/10/04 06:00'],"['2011/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(11)00381-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.09.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2012 May;18(5):754-62. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.09.005.

The purpose of our prospective single-center study was to examine the safety and efficacy of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) following a sequential conditioning regimen as first-line therapy for previously untreated patients with high-risk MDS or sAML. Between November 2003 and June 2010, 30 patients (20 high-risk MDS, 10 sAML) received fludarabine (4 x 30 mg/m(2)), amsacrine (4 x 100 mg/m(2)), and Ara-C (4 x 2 g/m(2), FLAMSA). After 2 to 3 days of rest, patients received high-dose melphalan alone (200 mg/m(2) for patients with an age <50 years, 150 mg/m(2) for patients with an age between 50 and 60 years, and 100 mg/m(2) for patients with an age >60 years; n = 24) or melphalan and thiotepa (10 mg/kg, Mel/Thio, n = 6). Following these high-dose conditioning regimens, a median number of 7.7 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg body weight (range: 2.9 x 10(6)-17.2 x 10(6)) were transplanted from 13 related or 17 unrelated donors. Antithymocyte globulin (Fresenius 30-60 mg/kg) as well as tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil were used for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. All patients except 1 with primary graft failure achieved complete remission after HSCT. After a median follow-up time of 28 months (range: 7-81), 21 patients (70%) were alive and free of disease. Overall, 4 patients relapsed. At 2 years, overall survival, event-free survival, and treatment-related mortality were 70%, 63%, and 30%, respectively. Because of undue toxicity, thiotepa is no longer part of the conditioning regimen.

This approach produced enough template for 100 inverse PCR reaction from as little as 20 ng of patient DNA, consequently enabling the use of up to 500 times less patient DNA compared to standard inverse PCR. The method is based on identifying restriction sites in a putative breakpoint area in a cancer-specific translocation, followed by circularization and amplification of the restriction DNA products by using T4 DNA ligase and Phi29 enzyme, respectively. The amplified DNA thus obtained is used as a template in long-distance inverse PCR to amplify and detect the precise breakpoint of the chromosomal rearrangements in question by sequencing of the obtained PCR products. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by identifying fusion genes TAF15-ZNF384 (brought about by a (12;17)(p13;q21) translocation) and BCR-ABL1 (produced by a (9:22)(q34;q11.2) translocation) in five leukemia samples.

Radiation therapy (RT) is often used in the treatment of chloromas; however, modern studies of RT are lacking. We reviewed our experience to analyze treatment response, disease control, and toxicity associated with RT to develop treatment algorithm recommendations for patients with chloroma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-eight patients who underwent treatment for chloromas at our institution between February 1990 and June 2010 were identified and their medical records were reviewed and analyzed. RESULTS: The majority of patients that presented with chloroma at the time of initial leukemia diagnosis (78%) have not received RT because it regressed after initial chemotherapy. Yet most patients that relapsed or remained with chloroma after chemotherapy are in the RT cohort (90%). Thirty-three courses of RT were administered to 22 patients. Radiation subsite breakdown was: 39% head and neck, 24% extremity, 9% spine, 9% brain, 6% genitourinary, 6% breast, 3% pelvis, and 3% genitourinary. Median dose was 20 (6-36) Gy. Kaplan-Meier estimates of progression-free survival and overall survival in the RT cohort were 39% and 43%, respectively, at 5 years. At a median follow-up of 11 months since RT, only 1 patient developed progressive disease at the irradiated site and 4 patients developed chloromas at other sites. RT was well tolerated without significant acute or late effects and provided symptom relief in 95% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with chloromas were referred for RT when there was extramedullary progression, marrow relapse, or rapid symptom relief required. RT resulted in excellent local disease control and palliation of symptoms without significant toxicity. We recommend irradiating chloromas to at least 20 Gy, and propose 24 Gy in 12 fractions as an appropriate regimen.","['Bakst, Richard', 'Wolden, Suzanne', 'Yahalom, Joachim']","['Bakst R', 'Wolden S', 'Yahalom J']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110928,United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Algorithms', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/drug therapy/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Young Adult']",PMC5045241,2011/10/04 06:00,2012/05/12 06:00,['2011/10/04 06:00'],"['2010/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/16 00:00 [revised]', '2011/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0360-3016(11)00455-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijrobp.2011.02.057 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2012 Apr 1;82(5):1816-22. doi: 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2011.02.057.

Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is an uncommon and underrecognized manifestation of cGVHD. We report a patient who developed NS 18 months after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. The onset of NS was accompanied by active manifestations of cGVHD, and immunosuppressants had not been tapered recently. Renal biopsy revealed membranous nephropathy. The patient failed to improve with three combined immunosuppressants (prednisolone, cyclosporine, and mycophenolate mofetil), but achieved partial remission after intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion. Twenty-four months after the diagnosis of NS, the patient was still in hematological remission, with normal serum creatinine level, urinary protein loss of 0.7-1.9 g/day and mild oral mucositis. Our report suggests that NS can be a cGVHD-related immune disorder in HSCT patients. Monitoring of renal parameters, especially proteinuria, is important in cGVHD patients. Our case indicated that post-transplant NS, occurring without history of tapering or following immunosuppressant withdrawal, presents a more severe activity of cGVHD and a relatively severe clinical course. IVIG may modify and control the refractory GVHD-related NS, and can be one of the choices of treatment.","['Wang, Hsin-Hui', 'Yang, An-Hang', 'Yang, Ling-Yu', 'Hung, Giun-Yi', 'Chang, Jei-Wen', 'Wang, Chun-Kai', 'Lee, Tzong-Yann', 'Tang, Ren-Bin']","['Wang HH', 'Yang AH', 'Yang LY', 'Hung GY', 'Chang JW', 'Wang CK', 'Lee TY', 'Tang RB']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Nephrology, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20110923,Netherlands,J Chin Med Assoc,Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,101174817,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*complications', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Male', 'Nephrotic Syndrome/*etiology/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2011/10/04 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/10/04 06:00'],"['2010/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2010/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S1726-4901(11)00213-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jcma.2011.08.008 [doi]']",ppublish,J Chin Med Assoc. 2011 Sep;74(9):419-22. doi: 10.1016/j.jcma.2011.08.008.

However its role in the carcinogenesis remains controversial. We performed a microarray expression analysis in three human acute leukemia cell lines (HL-60, U937 and TF-1) exposed to 10mM BC and found that BC stimulated the apoptosis in all studied cell lines. This effect was most evident in the HL-60 cell line and correlated with increased expression of proapoptotic BAX and CAPN2 genes. The micro-array findings were replicated by the quantitative BAX and CAPN2 expression analysis using real-time PCR and by Western Blot on protein level. The biological tests (TUNEL method) for apoptosis showed consistent proapoptotic effects in all studied cell lines. In this paper the stimulatory effect of BC on apoptosis (enhanced expression of proapoptotic genes and proteins) in human acute myeloid leukemia cells was confirmed. The most potent activation of apoptosis in the HL-60 cells is in line with other investigators observations suggesting distinct molecular mechanism of apoptosis stimulation by BC in different human acute myeloid leukemia cells.","['Sacha, Tomasz', 'Zawada, Magdalena', 'Dulinska-Litewka, Joanna', 'Lach, Zofia', 'Szostek, Marta', 'Bodzioch, Marek', 'Laidler, Piotr M', 'Dembinska-Kiec, Aldona', 'Florek, Izabela', 'Czekalska, Sylwia', 'Skotnicki, Aleksander B']","['Sacha T', 'Zawada M', 'Dulinska-Litewka J', 'Lach Z', 'Szostek M', 'Bodzioch M', 'Laidler PM', 'Dembinska-Kiec A', 'Florek I', 'Czekalska S', 'Skotnicki AB']",['Katedra i Klinika Hematologii Collegium Medicum UJ w Krakowie. sachatom@gmail.com'],['pol'],['Journal Article'],,Poland,Przegl Lek,Przeglad lekarski,19840720R,"['0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '01YAE03M7J (beta Carotene)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Calpain)', 'EC 3.4.22.53 (CAPN2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Calpain/*genetics', 'Gene Expression/physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*genetics', 'beta Carotene/*metabolism']",,2011/10/04 06:00,2012/02/15 06:00,['2011/10/04 06:00'],"['2011/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Przegl Lek. 2011;68(5):258-62.,,,,,,,,"Wplyw beta-karotenu na ekspresje proapoptotycznych genow BAX i CAPN2 w komorkach linii ostrej bialaczki szpikowej HL-60, U-937 i TF-1; analiza technika mikromacierzy, ilosciowej PCR i Western Blot.",,,,,,,,

There are several identified mechanisms of resistance to TKIs. The presence of ABL kinase domain point mutation, which could be detected by molecular methods is one of them. The aim of the study was to screen 60 CML patients resistant to TKI therapy for the presence of ABL point mutation. ABL mutation was detected in 19 (31,6%) patients.

Here, we report a rare case of rhabdomyolysis of the psoas muscle in an 82-year-old man with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). He was prescribed fenofibrate because of a hypertriglyceridemia. The patient reported generalized muscle pain and right abdominal pain while receiving fenofibrate monotherapy. An abdominal computed tomography scan and an abdominal ultrasound showed a large and low attenuation and high echogenicity, respectively, in the right middle abdominal area. Laboratory values included a serum creatine concentration of 4.1 mg/dl and a creatinine phosphokinase concentration of 5,882 IU/l. During laparotomy, a large hematoma and necrotic mass was identified in the right psoas muscle. Histological examination revealed that the resected specimens were of the psoas muscle with irregular fiber sizes, degenerating fibers surrounding the inflammatory reaction, and fiber necrosis that is typical for polymyositis. Based on these findings and the clinical history, a diagnosis of fenofibrate-induced rhabdomyolysis was made. To the best of our knowledge, no patient has ever been diagnosed with fulminant psoas rhabdomyolysis due to a fenofibrate monotherapy.

In this clinically diverse group, molecular aberrations, such as FLT3-ITD, NPM1, and CEBPA mutations, recently have added to the prognostic accuracy. Aberrant DNA methylation is a hallmark of cancer, including AML. We investigated in total 118 CN-AML samples in a test and a validation cohort for genome-wide promoter DNA methylation with Illumina Methylation Bead arrays and compared them with normal myeloid precursors and global gene expression. IDH and NPM1 mutations were associated with different methylation patterns (P = .0004 and .04, respectively). Genome-wide methylation levels were elevated in IDH-mutated samples (P = .006). We observed a negative impact of DNA methylation on transcription. Genes targeted by Polycomb group (PcG) proteins and genes associated with bivalent histone marks in stem cells showed increased aberrant methylation in AML (P < .0001). Furthermore, high methylation levels of PcG target genes were independently associated with better progression-free survival (odds ratio = 0.47, P = .01) and overall survival (odds ratio = 0.36, P = .001). In summary, genome-wide methylation patterns show preferential methylation of PcG targets with prognostic impact in CN-AML.","['Deneberg, Stefan', 'Guardiola, Philippe', 'Lennartsson, Andreas', 'Qu, Ying', 'Gaidzik, Verena', 'Blanchet, Odile', 'Karimi, Mohsen', 'Bengtzen, Sofia', 'Nahi, Hareth', 'Uggla, Bertil', 'Tidefelt, Ulf', 'Hoglund, Martin', 'Paul, Christer', 'Ekwall, Karl', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Lehmann, Soren']","['Deneberg S', 'Guardiola P', 'Lennartsson A', 'Qu Y', 'Gaidzik V', 'Blanchet O', 'Karimi M', 'Bengtzen S', 'Nahi H', 'Uggla B', 'Tidefelt U', 'Hoglund M', 'Paul C', 'Ekwall K', 'Dohner K', 'Lehmann S']","['Department of Internal Medicine/Hematology, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden. stefan.deneberg@ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110929,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Chromatin/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation/*physiology', 'Female', 'Genome-Wide Association Study/methods/standards', 'Histones/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/physiology', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Young Adult']",,2011/10/01 06:00,2012/01/17 06:00,['2011/10/01 06:00'],"['2011/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40335-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-01-332353 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Nov 17;118(20):5573-82. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-01-332353.

We assessed the status of BCR-ABL1 and IKZF1 genes in 2 pairs of monozygotic twins, one pair concordant, the other discordant for Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph(+)) ALL. The twin pair concordant for ALL shared identical BCR-ABL1 genomic sequence indicative of monoclonal, in utero origin. One twin had IKZF1 deletion and died after transplantation. The other twin had hyperdiploidy, no IKZF1 deletion, and is still in remission 8 years after transplantation. In the twin pair discordant for ALL, neonatal blood spots from both twins harbored the same clonotypic BCR-ABL1 sequence. Low level BCR-ABL1(+) cells were present in the healthy co-twin but lacked the IKZF1 deletion present in the other twin's leukemic cells. The twin with ALL relapsed and died after transplantation. The co-twin remains healthy and leukemia free. These data show that in childhood Ph(+) ALL, BCR-ABL1 gene fusion can be a prenatal and possibly initiating genetic event. In the absence of additional, secondary changes, the leukemic clone remains clinically silent. IKZF1 is a secondary and probable postnatal mutation in these cases, and as a recurrent but alternative copy number change is associated with poor prognosis.","['Cazzaniga, Giovanni', 'van Delft, Frederik W', 'Lo Nigro, Luca', 'Ford, Anthony M', 'Score, Joannah', 'Iacobucci, Ilaria', 'Mirabile, Elena', 'Taj, Mary', 'Colman, Susan M', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Greaves, Mel']","['Cazzaniga G', 'van Delft FW', 'Lo Nigro L', 'Ford AM', 'Score J', 'Iacobucci I', 'Mirabile E', 'Taj M', 'Colman SM', 'Biondi A', 'Greaves M']","['Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica, Universita di Milano-Bicocca, Ospedale San Gerardo, Monza, Italy. gianni.cazzaniga@hsgerardo.org']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20110929,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Breakpoints', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Dosage/genetics', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Male', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics', 'Twins, Monozygotic/*genetics']",PMC3217357,2011/10/01 06:00,2012/01/17 06:00,['2011/10/01 06:00'],"['2011/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40333-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-07-366542 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Nov 17;118(20):5559-64. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-07-366542.

However, to date, studies regarding its role in acute and chronic leukemias are lacking. Here, we have investigated the presence of promoter hypermethylation of two CpG islands of the PCDH10 gene by methylation-specific PCR in 215 cases of various subsets of myeloid- and lymphoid-lineage leukemias. We found that PCDH10 promoter hypermethylation was frequent in both B-cell (81.9%) and T-cell (80%) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), while it was present in low frequency in most subtypes of myeloid leukemias (25.9%) and rare in chronic myeloid leukemia (2.2%). PCDH10 expression was downregulated via promoter hypermethylation in primary ALL samples (N = 4) and leukemia cell lines (N = 11). The transcriptional repression caused by PCDH10 methylation could be restored by pharmacologic inhibition of DNA methyltransferases. ALL cell lines harboring methylation-mediated inactivation of PCDH10 were less sensitive to commonly used leukemia-specific drugs suggesting that PCDH10 methylation might serve as a biomarker of chemotherapy response. Our results demonstrate that PCDH10 is a target of epigenetic silencing in ALL, a phenomenon that may impact lymphoid-lineage leukemogenesis, serve as an indicator of drug resistance and may also have potential implications for targeted epigenetic therapy.","['Narayan, Gopeshwar', 'Freddy, Allen J', 'Xie, Dongxu', 'Liyanage, Hema', 'Clark, Lorraine', 'Kisselev, Sergey', 'Un Kang, Ji', 'Nandula, Subhadra V', 'McGuinn, Catherine', 'Subramaniyam, Shivakumar', 'Alobeid, Bachir', 'Satwani, Prakash', 'Savage, David', 'Bhagat, Govind', 'Murty, Vundavalli V']","['Narayan G', 'Freddy AJ', 'Xie D', 'Liyanage H', 'Clark L', 'Kisselev S', 'Un Kang J', 'Nandula SV', 'McGuinn C', 'Subramaniyam S', 'Alobeid B', 'Satwani P', 'Savage D', 'Bhagat G', 'Murty VV']","['Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110824,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Cadherins)', '0 (PCDH10 protein, human)', '0 (Protocadherins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cadherins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/genetics', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protocadherins', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics']",,2011/10/01 06:00,2012/04/14 06:00,['2011/10/01 06:00'],"['2011/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.20922 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2011 Dec;50(12):1043-53. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20922.

We tested the role of c-Myb in p190(BCR/ABL)-dependent B-cell leukemia in mice transplanted with p190(BCR/ABL)-transduced marrow cells with a c-Myb allele (Myb(f/d)) and in double transgenic p190(BCR/ABL)/Myb(w/d) mice. In both models, loss of a c-Myb allele caused a less aggressive B-cell leukemia. In p190(BCR/ABL)-expressing human B-cell leukemia lines, knockdown of c-Myb expression suppressed proliferation and colony formation. Compared with c-Myb(w/f) cells, expression of Bmi1, a regulator of stem cell proliferation and maintenance, was decreased in pre-B cells from Myb(w/d) p190(BCR/ABL) transgenic mice. Ectopic expression of a mutant c-Myb or Bmi1 enhanced the proliferation and colony formation of Myb(w/d) p190(BCR/ABL) B-cells; by contrast, Bmi1 downregulation inhibited colony formation of p190(BCR/ABL)-expressing murine B cells and human B-cell leukemia lines. Moreover, c-Myb interacted with a segment of the human Bmi1 promoter and enhanced its activity. In blasts from 19 Ph(1) adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients, levels of c-Myb and Bmi1 showed a positive correlation.

Therefore, novel gene targets for therapy are needed to further advance treatment for this disease. RNA interference technology has identified survivin as a potential therapeutic target. Survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins and chromosome passenger complex, is expressed in hematologic malignancies and overexpressed in relapsed pediatric ALL. Our studies show that survivin is uniformly expressed at high levels in multiple pediatric ALL cell lines. Furthermore, silencing of survivin expression in pediatric ALL cell lines as well as primary leukemic blasts reduces viability of these cells. This includes cell lines derived from patients with relapsed disease featuring cytogenetic anomalies such as t(12;21), Philadelphia chromosome t(9;22), t(1;19) as well as a cell line carrying t(17;19) from a patient with de novo ALL. Furthermore, inhibition of survivin increases p53-dependent apoptosis that can be rescued by inhibition of p53. Finally, a screen of randomly selected primary patient samples confirms that survivin-specific small interfering RNA and survivin-targeted drug, YM155, effectively reduce viability of leukemic blasts.","['Tyner, J W', 'Jemal, A M', 'Thayer, M', 'Druker, B J', 'Chang, B H']","['Tyner JW', 'Jemal AM', 'Thayer M', 'Druker BJ', 'Chang BH']","['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, and OHSU Knight Cancer Institute, OHSU, Portland, OR, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110930,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'G2 Phase', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Survivin', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*antagonists & inhibitors']",PMC3364442,2011/10/01 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2011/10/01 06:00'],"['2011/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011249 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.249 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Apr;26(4):623-32. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.249.

However, the efficacy and safety of allo-HSCT for ATL with central nervous system (CNS) involvement, which is highly resistant to chemotherapy, remain controversial. We analyzed 10 ATL patients with CNS involvement who received allo-HSCT at three institutions in Nagasaki prefecture between 2000 and 2007. The 3-year overall survival rate was 40%, and the median observation time of the four surviving patients was 1532 days (range 945-2212 days). Two of four surviving patients received highly intensive local treatment for the CNS; one with 26 intrathecal injections of antineoplastic agents, and the other with whole cerebrospinal irradiation before transplantation. However, the other two patients received conventional or reduced-intensity conditioning with standard intrathecal chemotherapy. Three of the four surviving patients experienced chronic GVHD, and two of three patients with grade 3 or 4 acute GVHD were free from CNS relapse. From these data, it seems that both intensive local treatment for CNS disease and systemic GVHD contributed to the long-term control of CNS involvement.

The rats underwent occlusion across the descending aorta for 13min, causing paraplegia or paresis of varying severity. They were divided into four groups based on neurological assessment: sham, mild paresis, moderate paresis, and severe (complete) paraplegia. To examine the origin of microglia and macrophages in the ischemic lesion, bone marrow from rats expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) was transplanted into test subjects one month before performing SCI/R. Many GFP(+)/CD68(+) microglia and macrophages were present 7d after SCI/R. Resident (GFP(-)/Iba1(+)/CD68(-)) microglia and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs; GFP(+)/Iba1(+)/CD68(+)) colocalized in the mild group 7d after SCI/R. In the moderate group, BMDMs outnumbered resident microglia. A greater accumulation of BMDMs expressing insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) was observed in lesions in the severe group, relative to the moderate group. BMDMs in the severe group strongly expressed tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1beta, and inducible nitric oxide synthase, in addition to IGF-1. A robust accumulation of BMDMs occupying the entire ischemic gray matter was observed only in the severe group. These results demonstrate that the magnitude of the microglial and BMDM responses varies considerably, and that it correlates with the severity of the neurological dysfunction. Remarkably, BMDMs appear to have a beneficial effect on the spinal cord in paresis. In contrast, BMDMs seem to exhibit both beneficial and harmful effects in severe paraplegia.","['Nakata, Tatsuhiro', 'Kawachi, Kanji', 'Nagashima, Mitsugi', 'Yasugi, Takumi', 'Izutani, Hironori', 'Ryugo, Masahiro', 'Okamura, Toru', 'Shikata, Fumiaki', 'Imagawa, Hiroshi', 'Yano, Hajime', 'Takahashi, Hisaaki', 'Tanaka, Junya']","['Nakata T', 'Kawachi K', 'Nagashima M', 'Yasugi T', 'Izutani H', 'Ryugo M', 'Okamura T', 'Shikata F', 'Imagawa H', 'Yano H', 'Takahashi H', 'Tanaka J']","['Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery and Regeneration Surgery, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Toon, Ehime 791-0295, Japan. tatsuhironakata@gmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110908,Netherlands,Brain Res,Brain research,0045503,"['0 (Aif1 protein, rat)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD68 antigen, human)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/genetics/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Count', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics', 'Ischemic Attack, Transient/complications', 'Macrophages/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Microfilament Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Microglia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neurologic Examination', 'Paraplegia/etiology/*pathology/surgery', 'Paresis/etiology/*pathology/surgery', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Rats, Transgenic', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Time Factors']",,2011/10/01 06:00,2012/02/18 06:00,['2011/10/01 06:00'],"['2011/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/26 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-8993(11)01652-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.brainres.2011.08.074 [doi]']",ppublish,Brain Res. 2011 Oct 28;1420:114-24. doi: 10.1016/j.brainres.2011.08.074.

K562 cells exhibit a low proportion of hemoglobin-synthesizing cells under standard cell growth conditions, but are able to undergo terminal erythroid differentiation when treated with a variety of anti-tumor compounds. In this paper we report a screening study on a set of different modified C(5) uracil derivatives for the evaluation of their antiproliferative effect in connection with erythroid differentiation pathways, and for defining a new class of drug candidates for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Activity of the derivatives tested can be classified in two effect: an antiproliferative effect linked to a high level of erythroid differentiation activity and an antiproliferative effect without activation of gamma globin genes The highest antiproliferative effect and erythroid induction was shown by compound 9, a thymine derivative bearing a n-octyl chain on nitrogen N(1), whereas thymine did not show any effect, suggesting the importance of the linear alkyl chain in position N(1). To our knowledge this compound should be considered among the most efficient inducers of erythroid differentiation of K562 cells.

Stress-protected action of alpha-tocoferoli acetate was more significantly in young mice compared to old ones. In our subsequent work (immunocytochemical reactions) we obtained further regular occurrences. Dehydration leads to increase of proapoptotic protein Bax synthesis in hypothalamic neurosecretory cells in young mice and in age-independent manner, this stress leads to decrease of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 synthesis. So, the apoptosis level increases. More significant antiapoptotic action of alpha-tocoferoli acetate in stress condition in young mice is obviously connected with quick reaction of compensatory mechanisms (low expression of proapoptotic proteins p53, Bax and high expression of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2).","['Azizova, Iu V', 'Teplyi, D L', 'Bazhanova, E D', 'Pozdniakova, O N']","['Azizova IuV', 'Teplyi DL', 'Bazhanova ED', 'Pozdniakova ON']",,['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Russia (Federation),Adv Gerontol,Advances in gerontology = Uspekhi gerontologii,100971443,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'H4N855PNZ1 (alpha-Tocopherol)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Paraventricular Hypothalamic Nucleus/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Stress, Physiological/*drug effects', 'Supraoptic Nucleus/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Water Deprivation', 'alpha-Tocopherol/*pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/biosynthesis/genetics']",,2011/10/01 06:00,2011/10/26 06:00,['2011/10/01 06:00'],"['2011/10/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Adv Gerontol. 2011;24(2):220-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The viral Tax oncoprotein plays a central role in initiating the process to ATL. However, after infection HTLV-1 enters into latency, during which virus gene expression is very low, so that the level of Tax is likely insufficient for exerting its oncogenic activities. Therefore only 5% of the infected individuals may develop ATL several decades after infection. It is assumed that the transition from latency to ATL development requires at least a temporary activation of the latent virus in order to elevate Tax to its oncogenic threshold. We have previously found that DNA damaging agents, which usually induce apoptosis, can also activate the viral LTR and that the anti apoptosis Bcl-2 protein not only avoid their apoptosis induction but concomitantly prevents their LTR activation effect. Therefore, the present study was designed to identify the factor that while participating in the apoptotic cascade acts also to activate the viral LTR. For this purpose we employed ectopic vectors expressing these apoptotic factors together with potent shRNAs against each of them and anti caspase peptide inhibitors. We have found that in addition to its function as initiator of the mitochondrial apoptotic cascade, caspase 9 can acts also as an executer which among other non-apoptotic functions it forms an Sp1-p53 complex that activates the LTR by binding to an Sp1 recognition site residing in the LTR. This finding can help in designing effective preventing strategies against ATL development in clinically latent HTLV-1 carriers.","['Abou-Kandil, Ammar', 'Chamias, Rachel', 'Huleihel, Mahmoud', 'Godbey, W T', 'Aboud, Mordechai']","['Abou-Kandil A', 'Chamias R', 'Huleihel M', 'Godbey WT', 'Aboud M']","['Shraga Segal Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111001,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Caspase 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/*metabolism', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA Damage', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Products, tax/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Virus Activation', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",,2011/10/01 06:00,2012/03/20 06:00,['2011/09/30 06:00'],"['2011/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['17620 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.10.19.17620 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2011 Oct 1;10(19):3337-45. doi: 10.4161/cc.10.19.17620.

In addition to its developmental functions, Hoxa1 has been shown to be an oncogene and to be overexpressed in the mammary gland in response to a deregulation of the autocrine growth hormone. It has therefore been suggested that Hoxa1 plays a pivotal role in the process linking autocrine growth hormone misregulation and mammary carcinogenesis. Like most Hox proteins, Hoxa1 can interact with Pbx proteins. This interaction relies on a Hox hexapeptidic sequence centred on conserved Tryptophan and Methionine residues. To address the importance of the Hox-Pbx interaction for the oncogenic activity of Hoxa1, we characterized here the properties of a Hoxa1 variant with substituted residues in the hexapeptide and demonstrate that the Hoxa1 mutant lost its ability to stimulate cell proliferation, anchorage-independent cell growth, and loss of contact inhibition. Therefore, the hexapeptide motif of Hoxa1 is required to confer its oncogenic activity, supporting the view that this activity relies on the ability of Hoxa1 to interact with Pbx.","['Delval, Stephanie', 'Taminiau, Arnaud', 'Lamy, Juliette', 'Lallemand, Cecile', 'Gilles, Christine', 'Noel, Agnes', 'Rezsohazy, Rene']","['Delval S', 'Taminiau A', 'Lamy J', 'Lallemand C', 'Gilles C', 'Noel A', 'Rezsohazy R']","['Molecular and Cellular Animal Embryology Group, Life Sciences Institute (ISV), Universite Catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110921,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (homeobox A1 protein)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Contact Inhibition/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mammary Glands, Human/metabolism/pathology', 'Oligopeptides/metabolism', '*Oncogenes', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3177904,2011/10/01 06:00,2012/02/04 06:00,['2011/09/30 06:00'],"['2010/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0025247 [doi]', 'PONE-D-10-06020 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(9):e25247. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0025247.

This activity can be counteracted by the FIV Vif protein, but the mechanism by which FIV Vif suppresses fA3s is unknown. In the present study, we demonstrated that FIV Vif could act via a proteasome-dependent pathway to overcome fA3s. FIV Vif interacted with feline cellular proteins Cullin5 (Cul5), ElonginB, and ElonginC to form an E3 complex to induce degradation of fA3s. Both the dominant-negative Cul5 mutant and a C-terminal hydrophilic replacement ElonginC mutant potently disrupted the FIV Vif activity against fA3s. Furthermore, we identified a BC-box motif in FIV Vif that was essential for the recruitment of E3 ubiquitin ligase and also required for FIV Vif-mediated degradation of fA3s. Moreover, despite the lack of either a Cul5-box or a HCCH zinc-binding motif, FIV Vif specifically selected Cul5. Therefore, FIV Vif may interact with Cul5 via a novel mechanism. These finding imply that SOCS proteins may possess distinct mechanisms to bind Cul5 during formation of the Elongin-Cullin-SOCS box complex.","['Wang, Jiawen', 'Zhang, Wenyan', 'Lv, Mingyu', 'Zuo, Tao', 'Kong, Wei', 'Yu, Xianghui']","['Wang J', 'Zhang W', 'Lv M', 'Zuo T', 'Kong W', 'Yu X']","[""National Engineering Laboratory for AIDS Vaccine, College of Life Science, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin Province 130012, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110928,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Cullin Proteins)', '0 (Elongin)', '0 (Gene Products, vif)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.5.4.1 (Cytosine Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['APOBEC Deaminases', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cats', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cullin Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cytidine Deaminase', 'Cytosine Deaminase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Elongin', 'Feline Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/genetics/metabolism/*virology', 'Gene Products, vif/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/genetics', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Plasmids', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3209414,2011/10/01 06:00,2012/01/20 06:00,['2011/09/30 06:00'],"['2011/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/20 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.05218-11 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.05218-11 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2011 Dec;85(23):12482-91. doi: 10.1128/JVI.05218-11.

Given the variety of applications of AAV-based vectors in the treatment of genetic disorders, numerous studies have focused on the immunogenicity of recombinant AAV. In general, AAV vectors appear not to induce strong inflammatory responses. We have found that AAV2, when it infects the osteosarcoma cells U2OS, can initiate part of its replicative cycle in the absence of helper virus. This does not occur in untransformed cells. We set out to test whether the cellular innate antiviral defenses control this susceptibility and found that, in nonimmune normal human fibroblasts, AAV2 induces type I interferon production and release and the accumulation of nuclear promyelocytic leukemia bodies. AAV fails to mobilize this defense pathway in the U2OS cells. This permissiveness is in large part due to impairment of the viral sensing machinery in these cells. Our investigations point to Toll-like receptor 9 as a potential intracellular sensor that detects AAV2 and triggers the antiviral state in AAV-infected untransformed cells. Efficient sensing of the AAV genome and the ensuing activation of an innate antiviral response are thus crucial cellular events dictating the parvovirus infectivity in host cells.","['Laredj, Leila N', 'Beard, Peter']","['Laredj LN', 'Beard P']","['Ecole Polytechnique Fe de rale de Lausanne, Department of Life Sciences, Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110928,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (TLR9 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 9)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Dependovirus/*immunology', 'Genetic Vectors/*immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Innate', 'Interferon Type I/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 9/immunology']",PMC3233128,2011/10/01 06:00,2012/01/24 06:00,['2011/09/30 06:00'],"['2011/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.05407-11 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.05407-11 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2011 Dec;85(24):13133-43. doi: 10.1128/JVI.05407-11.

Gag alone is capable of self-assembly in vitro, but host factors have been shown to play a role in efficient viral replication and particle morphogenesis within the living cell. In a series of affinity purification experiments, we identified the cellular protein Lyric to be an HIV-1 Gag-interacting protein. Lyric was previously described to be an HIV-inducible gene and is involved in various signaling pathways. Gag interacts with endogenous Lyric via its matrix (MA) and nucleocapsid (NC) domains. This interaction requires Gag multimerization and Lyric amino acids 101 to 289. Endogenous Lyric is incorporated into HIV-1 virions and is cleaved by the viral protease. Gag-Lyric interaction was also observed for murine leukemia virus and equine infectious anemia virus, suggesting that it represents a conserved feature among retroviruses. Expression of the Gag binding domain of Lyric increased Gag expression levels and viral infectivity, whereas expression of a Lyric mutant lacking the Gag binding site resulted in lower Gag expression and decreased viral infectivity. The results of the current study identify Lyric to be a cellular interaction partner of HIV-1 Gag and hint at a potential role in regulating infectivity. Further experiments are needed to elucidate the precise role of this interaction.","['Engeland, Christine E', 'Oberwinkler, Heike', 'Schumann, Michael', 'Krause, Eberhard', 'Muller, Gerd A', 'Krausslich, Hans-Georg']","['Engeland CE', 'Oberwinkler H', 'Schumann M', 'Krause E', 'Muller GA', 'Krausslich HG']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Virology, Universitatsklinikum Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 324, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110928,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (MTDH protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'HIV-1/*pathogenicity', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Infectious Anemia Virus, Equine/pathogenicity', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/pathogenicity', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Protein Binding', '*Protein Interaction Mapping', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/*metabolism']",PMC3233182,2011/10/01 06:00,2012/01/24 06:00,['2011/09/30 06:00'],"['2011/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00174-11 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00174-11 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2011 Dec;85(24):13322-32. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00174-11.

Normal osteoblastic cells have been shown to support hematopoiesis. To define the effects of leukemia on osteoblastic cells, we used an immunocompetent murine model of AML. Leukemic mice had inhibition of osteoblastic cells, with decreased serum levels of the bone formation marker osteocalcin. Osteoprogenitor cells and endosteal-lining osteopontin(+) cells were reduced, and osteocalcin mRNA in CD45(-) marrow cells was diminished. This resulted in severe loss of mineralized bone. Osteoclasts were only transiently increased without significant increases in bone resorption, and their inhibition only partially rescued leukemia-induced bone loss. In vitro data suggested that a leukemia-derived secreted factor inhibited osteoblastic cells. Because the chemokine CCL-3 was recently reported to inhibit osteoblastic function in myeloma, we tested its expression in our model and in AML patients. Consistent with its potential novel role in leukemic-dependent bone loss, CCL-3 mRNA was significantly increased in malignant marrow cells from leukemic mice and from samples from AML patients. Based on these results, we propose that therapeutic mitigation of leukemia-induced uncoupling of osteoblastic and osteoclastic cells may represent a novel approach to promote normal hematopoiesis in patients with myeloid neoplasms.","['Frisch, Benjamin J', 'Ashton, John M', 'Xing, Lianping', 'Becker, Michael W', 'Jordan, Craig T', 'Calvi, Laura M']","['Frisch BJ', 'Ashton JM', 'Xing L', 'Becker MW', 'Jordan CT', 'Calvi LM']","['Endocrine Metabolism Division, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, NY 14642, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110928,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Bone Density Conservation Agents)', '0 (Chemokine CCL3)', '0 (Diphosphonates)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '6XC1PAD3KF (Zoledronic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Density Conservation Agents/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Resorption/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CCL3/genetics/*metabolism', 'Diphosphonates/pharmacology', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Immunocompetence', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Osteoblasts/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Osteoclasts/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spleen/metabolism/pathology', 'Zoledronic Acid']",PMC3384480,2011/10/01 06:00,2012/03/07 06:00,['2011/09/30 06:00'],"['2011/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)38641-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-04-348151 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jan 12;119(2):540-50. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-04-348151.

There are no prospective, randomized studies that clearly demonstrate that anthracyclines, cyclophosphamide or cytarabine are required for optimal results in this leukemia.

Our ability to assign relapse risk to disease is evolving and incorporates cytogenetics, molecular lesions, and assessment of minimal residual disease after initial treatment. Allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (alloHCPT) is one of the most efficacious treatments available to the physician. In adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) despite the treatment risk, patients with a matched sibling who achieve CR should be referred for transplant. Prospective trials investigating the role of unrelated donors are in progress. There is little prospective evidence, but nonetheless encouraging data, to support referring older patients for alloHPCT using reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), all high-risk patients and the majority of intermediate-risk patients with a matched sibling should be offered alloHPCT in CR1. In addition there is evidence that some patients previously assigned as good-risk would benefit from sibling transplant. Use of unrelated donors will expand the numbers eligible for transplant and should be considered when a matched-sibling is not available particularly in high-risk patients. Similarly to ALL, the use of RIC is allowing transplantation to be offered to those deemed too old or unfit for myeloablative conditioning. The importance of enrolling patients into suitable prospective clinical trials cannot be overstated.","['Sellar, Rob', 'Goldstone, Anthony H', 'Lazarus, Hillard M']","['Sellar R', 'Goldstone AH', 'Lazarus HM']","['Department of Haematology, University College London Hospital, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Curr Treat Options Oncol,Current treatment options in oncology,100900946,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality/*therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Assessment', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Unrelated Donors']",,2011/10/01 06:00,2012/03/10 06:00,['2011/09/30 06:00'],"['2011/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11864-011-0166-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Treat Options Oncol. 2011 Dec;12(4):312-28. doi: 10.1007/s11864-011-0166-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Median overall survival (OS) from diagnosis was 92, 49, 27, and 14 months for low, intermediate-1, intermediate-2, and high-risk MDAS groups, respectively (P < .005). Median OS from referral was 61, 28, 15, and 8 months (P < .005), respectively. Among 484 patients classified by IPSS as low or intermediate-1 risk, 25% were up-staged as intermediate-2 or high risk by MDAS; 4 prognostically distinct subgroups were identified among lower risk IPSS categories with median OS of 93, 53, 31, and 18 months (P < .005). Among 201 intermediate-2 or high-risk IPSS patients, 15.4% were down-staged to intermediate-1 by MDAS, with 3 groups identified by MDAS having median OS of 33, 23, and 14 months. Acute myeloid leukemia transformation rate was highest among high-risk MDAS (50.4%). In Cox regression analysis, higher risk MDAS predicted inferior OS (hazard ratio 1.42; P < .005) independent of IPSS. CONCLUSIONS: Our data validated MDAS' prognostic value. MDAS is complementary to IPSS and refines prognostic precision.","['Komrokji, Rami S', 'Corrales-Yepez, Maria', 'Al Ali, Najla', 'Kharfan-Dabaja, Mohammad', 'Padron, Eric', 'Fields, Teresa', 'Lancet, Jeffrey E', 'List, Alan F']","['Komrokji RS', 'Corrales-Yepez M', 'Al Ali N', 'Kharfan-Dabaja M', 'Padron E', 'Fields T', 'Lancet JE', 'List AF']","['H.

Mouse B210 cells, which express p210bcr-abl fusion protein and induce leukemia-like disease and extremely rarely solid tumors after intravenous (i.v.) administration, were used. The cells were transfected with a plasmid carrying genes for mouse ES and resistance to blasticidine. Transduced cells were isolated in media supplemented with blasticidine. Production of ES was determined by Western blotting. For further tests, two clones were selected, and their pathogenicity after i.v. inoculation was tested. Compared with the parental B210 cells, the capability of both gene-modified cell clones to induce lethal leukemia was reduced. However, mice that did not succumb to leukemia subsequently developed solid tumors. They were composed of poorly differentiated cells with irregular nuclei and roughly granular chromatin and were well vascularized. FISH revealed the presence of the BCR-ABL fusion gene both in tumors and spleens. Immunohistological investigation of the tumors demonstrated the production of ES in vivo and the cell lines derived from the tumors produced detectable amounts of ES, this demonstrating that the formation of solid tumors was not associated with the loss or silencing of the ES gene.","['Krmencikova, Monika', 'Stanek, Libor', 'Petrackova, Martina', 'Dundr, Pavel', 'Vonka, Vladimir']","['Krmencikova M', 'Stanek L', 'Petrackova M', 'Dundr P', 'Vonka V']","['Department of Experimental Virology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, U Nemocnice 1, 128 20 Prague 2, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110928,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Endostatins)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Transformed/*metabolism/pathology/transplantation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Endostatins/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/metabolism', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/drug effects/physiology', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasm Transplantation']",,2011/10/01 06:00,2012/04/07 06:00,['2011/09/30 06:00'],"['2011/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2011.1213 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2012 Feb;40(2):487-93. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2011.1213.

This study examined the natural history of avascular necrosis of the femoral head in children with leukemia. From 1993 to 2006, a total of 865 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia were admitted to the hematology-oncology ward of a children's hospital. The diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia was established by bone marrow aspiration. Based on clinical and radiographic findings, avascular necrosis of the femoral head was found in 7 patients; these patients underwent follow-up for 4 to 9 years. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head was clinically symptomatic in all of the children, and they had advanced radiographic collapse of the femoral head. However, the head of the femur was not at risk in any patient based on clinical and radiographic findings. Patients received supportive treatment such as abduction brace and physiotherapy. After 4 to 9 years of follow-up, clinical and radiographic results were satisfactory. Provided that the head of the femur is not at risk, avascular necrosis of the femoral head in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia may be successfully managed with nonoperative care.","['Madadi, Firooz', 'Shamsian, Bibi Shahin', 'Alavi, Samin', 'Madadi, Firoozeh', 'Eajazi, Alireza', 'Aslani, Afshin']","['Madadi F', 'Shamsian BS', 'Alavi S', 'Madadi F', 'Eajazi A', 'Aslani A']","['Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Shahid Beheshti Medical University, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111005,United States,Orthopedics,Orthopedics,7806107,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Remodeling', 'Braces', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Femur Head/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Femur Head Necrosis/*complications/diagnosis/therapy', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Physical Therapy Modalities', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/diagnosis/therapy', 'Radiography', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2011/10/01 06:00,2012/02/09 06:00,['2011/09/30 06:00'],"['2011/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3928/01477447-20110826-07 [doi]'],epublish,Orthopedics. 2011 Oct 5;34(10):e593-7. doi: 10.3928/01477447-20110826-07.,,,,,"['Copyright 2011, SLACK Incorporated.']",,,,,,,,,,,

However, in the context of the complex pro-oncogenic signalling networks which ultimately lead to clonal expansion and disease progression, the exact contribution of BCR/ABL1 mutants remains uncertain. Recent data indicate that detection of BCR/ABL1 mutant subclones does not permit prediction of their expansion dynamics and their potential to become drivers of resistant disease. METHODS: To determine the patterns of clonal evolution and the distinct proliferation kinetics of individual BCR/ABL1 mutants during treatment, we employed ligase-dependent polymerase chain reaction (LD-PCR) analysis for quantitative surveillance of CML subclones with various tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations including M244V, L248V, G250E, E255K, T315I, F317L-A/G, M351T and F359V. FINDINGS: Inadequate treatment responses were observed in 27 of 100 patients investigated and 16 were found to bear one or more BCR/ABL1 TKD mutations in separate subclones. Rapid subclone expansion upon onset or switch of TKI treatment was common and sometimes preceded corresponding changes in BCR/ABL1 transcript levels. Mutant subclones were found to respond differentially and sometimes unexpectedly to various treatment modalities. Decline and persistent depletion of specific mutation-bearing subclones in response to treatment could be documented by LD-PCR surveillance. INTERPRETATION: The observations show that quantitative monitoring of mutant BCR/ABL1 subclones by LD-PCR is a powerful tool for detection of clonal evolution, subclone-expansion and subclone-depletion and can contribute to optimised management of patients with CML.","['Preuner, S', 'Mitterbauer, G', 'Mannhalter, C', 'Herndlhofer, S', 'Sperr, W R', 'Valent, P', 'Lion, T']","['Preuner S', 'Mitterbauer G', 'Mannhalter C', 'Herndlhofer S', 'Sperr WR', 'Valent P', 'Lion T']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110928,England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Clonal Evolution/*genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/*methods', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', '*Point Mutation', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2011/10/01 06:00,2012/02/18 06:00,['2011/09/30 06:00'],"['2011/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0959-8049(11)00641-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2011.08.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2012 Jan;48(2):233-6. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2011.08.015.

The shRNA (termed shPromA) targets the highly conserved tandem NF-kB binding sequences of the HIV-1 promoter. Recent articles have reported that TGS mediated by promoter-targeted siRNAs was exclusively the result of sequence non-specific off-target effects. Specifically, several mismatched siRNAs to the target promoter sequences were reported to also induce significant TGS, suggesting TGS was a consequence of off-target effects. Here, following extensive investigation, we report that shPromA induces sequence specific transcriptional silencing in HIV-1 infection in MOLT4 cells, while four shRNA variants, mismatched by 2-3 nucleotides, fail to suppress viral replication. We confirm similar levels of shRNA expression from the U6 promoter and the presence of processed/cleaved siRNAs for each construct in transduced MOLT-4 cells. HIV-1 sequence specific shPromA does not suppress HIV-2, which has an alternate NF-kB binding sequence. As a result of the unique sequence targeted, shPromA does not induce down-regulation of other NF-kB driven genes, either at the mRNA or protein level. Furthermore, we confirmed shPromA does not have sequence non-specific off-target effects through unaltered expression of CD4, CXCR4, and CCR5, which are used for viral entry. Additionally, shPromA does not alter PKR, IFN levels, and three downstream mediators of IFN-a response genes.

Therefore, new inhibitors that act regardless of the mode of enzyme activation need to be developed. Recently, we identified a novel class of thiazolinone-based compounds as potent 5-LOX inhibitors. Here, we present the molecular pharmacological profile of (Z)-5-(4-methoxybenzylidene)-2-(p-tolyl)-5H-thiazol-4-one, compound C06. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Inhibition of 5-LOX product formation was determined in intact cells [polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL), rat basophilic leukaemia-1, RAW264.7] and in cell-free assays [homogenates, 100, 000xg supernatant (S100), partially purified 5-LOX] applying different stimuli for 5-LOX activation. Inhibition of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2) ), 12-LOX, 15-LOX-1 and 15-LOX-2 as well as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) were measured in vitro. KEY RESULTS: C06 induced non-cytotoxic, direct 5-LOX inhibition with IC(50) values about 0.66 microM (intact PMNL, PMNL homogenates) and approximately 0.3 microM (cell-free PMNL S100, partially purified 5-LOX). Action of C06 was independent of the stimulus used for 5-LOX activation and cellular redox tone and was selective for 5-LOX compared with other arachidonic acid binding proteins (PPAR, cPLA(2) , 12-LOX, 15-LOX-1, 15-LOX-2, COX-2). Experimental results suggest an allosteric binding distinct from the active site and the C2-like domain of 5-LOX. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: C06 was identified as a potent selective direct 5-LOX inhibitor exhibiting a novel and unique mode of action, different from other established 5-LOX inhibitors. This thiazolinone may possess potential for intervention with inflammatory and allergic diseases and certain types of cancer.","['Hofmann, B', 'Rodl, C B', 'Kahnt, A S', 'Maier, T J', 'Michel, A A', 'Hoffmann, M', 'Rau, O', 'Awwad, K', 'Pellowska, M', 'Wurglics, M', 'Wacker, M', 'Zivkovic, A', 'Fleming, I', 'Schubert-Zsilavecz, M', 'Stark, H', 'Schneider, G', 'Steinhilber, D']","['Hofmann B', 'Rodl CB', 'Kahnt AS', 'Maier TJ', 'Michel AA', 'Hoffmann M', 'Rau O', 'Awwad K', 'Pellowska M', 'Wurglics M', 'Wacker M', 'Zivkovic A', 'Fleming I', 'Schubert-Zsilavecz M', 'Stark H', 'Schneider G', 'Steinhilber D']","['Institute of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany. hofmann@pharmchem.uni-frankfurt.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (5-(4-methoxybenzylidene)-2-p-tolylthiazol-4(5H)-one)', '0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)']",IM,"['Allosteric Site', 'Animals', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/chemistry/metabolism', 'Cell-Free System', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lipoxygenase Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Rats', 'Thiazoles/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",PMC3413864,2011/10/01 06:00,2012/07/24 06:00,['2011/09/30 06:00'],"['2011/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01707.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2012 Apr;165(7):2304-13. doi: 10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01707.x.,,,,,"['(c) 2011 The Authors.

Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis (NEH) presents as tender erythematous papules and plaques and is often associated with chemotherapy for AML. NEH is postulated to be due to toxic injury to the sweat glands followed by neutrophilic inflammation. Alternatively, some hypothesize that NEH represents a primary neutrophilic process. Our patient's clinical presentation was similar to previously reported cases of NEH; however, degenerative changes of the sweat ducts were noted on microscopy without neutrophilic inflammation. She had fewer than 0.01 thousand neutrophils per microliter for 4 days preceding the biopsy. At the same time, a separate area of superficial skin infection developed because of Staphylococcus epidermidis and also lacked neutrophilic inflammation. The similar clinical course and shared histopathologic features between our case and NEH argue that neutrophils are a secondary response to a toxic effect rather than the primary effector in NEH. Neutrophil-poor variants of hidradenitis, both infectious and due to drug toxicity, should be considered diagnostically in neutropenic patients.","['Yeh, Iwei', 'George, Evan', 'Fleckman, Philip']","['Yeh I', 'George E', 'Fleckman P']","['Department of Dermatology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. iwei.yeh@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Cutan Pathol,Journal of cutaneous pathology,0425124,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Cytarabine/adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/adverse effects', 'Eccrine Glands/drug effects/*pathology', 'Female', 'Hidradenitis/etiology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/complications/pathology', 'Neutrophils/*pathology', 'Staphylococcal Skin Infections/etiology/pathology', 'Staphylococcus epidermidis/isolation & purification/physiology']",,2011/10/01 06:00,2012/01/27 06:00,['2011/09/30 06:00'],"['2011/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0560.2011.01776.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Cutan Pathol. 2011 Nov;38(11):905-10. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0560.2011.01776.x.,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Nutrition, particularly intake of vegetables and certain plant components, has been reported to have a major role in cancer risk reduction. Recently, there has been a growing research interest in rosemary, a common household plant grown in many parts of the world. This study aims to review scientific evidence from all studies, published from 1996 to March 2010 that examined the protective effects of rosemary on colorectal cancer and other types of cancer. Literature evidence from animal and cell culture studies demonstrates the anticancer potential of rosemary extract, carnosol, carnosic acid, ursolic acid, and rosmarinic acid. No evidence for other rosemary constituents was found. The reported anticancer properties were found to arise through the molecular changes in the multiple-stage process of cancer development, which are dose related and not tissue or species specific. This is evidenced by the ability of rosemary to suppress the development of tumors in several organs including the colon, breast, liver, stomach, as well as melanoma and leukemia cells. The results suggested that the different molecular targets modulated by rosemary and its active constituents are useful indicators of success in clinical cancer chemo-prevention trials.","['Ngo, Suong N T', 'Williams, Desmond B', 'Head, Richard J']","['Ngo SN', 'Williams DB', 'Head RJ']","['School of Animal and Veterinary Sciences, University of Adelaide, Roseworthy, SA, Australia. suong.ngo@adelaide.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,8914818,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Oils, Volatile)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '8LGU7VM393 (rosemary oil)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*prevention & control', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Models, Animal', 'Oils, Volatile/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Rosmarinus/chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,2011/10/01 06:00,2012/01/21 06:00,['2011/09/30 06:00'],"['2011/09/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/10408398.2010.490883 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr. 2011 Dec;51(10):946-54. doi: 10.1080/10408398.2010.490883.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their primary target is tubulin, however recent research has shown that some of the vinca-alkaloids inhibit calmodulin binding to its targets. Vinka-alkaloids binding with other proteins could be responsible for their efficiency and neuroprotection. Here we investigated the thermodynamics of vinorelbine interactions with calmodulin and tubulin.

The enzyme is a complex of cytosolic and membranous subunits that need to assemble upon activation. Biochemical data suggest that the complex is renewed continuously during activity. Furthermore, it is generally assumed that complex assembly and activity occur in parallel. However, information about the oxidase assembly in individual phagosomes in live cells is scarce. We studied the dynamic behavior of the crucial cytosolic NADPH oxidase component p67(phox) during phagocytosis by videomicroscopy. p67(phox) is involved in the regulation of electron flow from NADPH to oxygen, leading to superoxide radical formation inside the phagosome. p67(phox)-citrine, expressed in myeloid PLB-985 cells, accumulated at the phagosomal membrane during phagocytosis of yeast particles. Using photobleaching techniques (FRAP, FLIP), we demonstrated that p67(phox)-citrine diffused freely in this phagosomal membrane, but the phagosomal pool of p67(phox)-citrine did not exchange with the cytosolic pool. This result suggests that once assembled in the NADPH oxidase complex, p67(phox) is stable in this complex. Furthermore, the time of the presence of p67(phox)-citrine at the phagosome increased substantially in the presence of complement in the opsonizing serum compared with decomplemented serum. PI(3)P also accumulated around phagosomes for twice as long in the presence of complement. The presence of p67(phox)-citrine was correlated with the duration of phagosomal ROS production in different opsonization conditions. These data support the critical role of p67(phox) for ROS production on the level of individual phagosomes.","['Tlili, Asma', 'Erard, Marie', 'Faure, Marie-Cecile', 'Baudin, Xavier', 'Piolot, Tristan', 'Dupre-Crochet, Sophie', 'Nusse, Oliver']","['Tlili A', 'Erard M', 'Faure MC', 'Baudin X', 'Piolot T', 'Dupre-Crochet S', 'Nusse O']","['University Paris-Sud, Orsay, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110927,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (citrine protein, bacteria)', '0 (neutrophil cytosol factor 67K)']",IM,"['Bacterial Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Neutrophils/cytology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Phagocytosis/*immunology', 'Phagosomes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism']",,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/09/29 06:00'],"['2011/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['jlb.1210701 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.1210701 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2012 Jan;91(1):83-95. doi: 10.1189/jlb.1210701.

It is caused by genetic abnormalities or bacterial infections/chronic inflammation. B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10) overexpression and nuclear expression have been associated with high-grade MALT lymphomas with genetic abnormalities that are unresponsive to Helicobacter pylori eradication treatment. To explore the molecular mechanism of BCL10 overexpression on the pathogenesis and malignant phenotype of MALT lymphoma, we generated EmicroSR-BCL10 transgenic mice. PROCEDURE: By generation of heterozygous and homozygous EuSR-BCL10 mice and showing BCL10 expression levels in these mice, we quantitatively examined relation of MZ B cell expansion and inhibition of caspase-8 activity with BCL10 protein level. We also investigated API2 and caspase-8 expression by Western blot and their interaction with BCL10 by co-immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: MZ B-cell expansion is directly related to BCL10 protein level in a dose-dependent manner. The activity of caspases-8 and -3, but not caspase-9, was inhibited with increasing of BCL10 protein level. Expanded MZ B cells showed selective survival under stimulation of anti-immunoglobulin M, but not dexamethasone, gamma-irradiation, or anti-CD95, implying that overexpressed BCL10 exerts anti-apoptotic effects through B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) pathway. Overexpressed BCL10 protein co-immunoprecipitated with caspase-8 and API2 protein, suggesting an in vivo interaction of them. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate a novel effect of overexpressed BCL10 in the pathogenesis of high-grade MALT lymphoma by increasing expression of API2 and it then forming a protein complex with BCL10/caspase-8 leading to caspase-8 activity suppression.","['Chen, Yan', 'Yang, Yishu', 'Sun, Min', 'Yan, Zhuohong', 'Wu, Lifeng', 'Cui, Xiaoli', 'Zhang, Ge', 'Morris, Stephan W', 'Zhang, Quangeng']","['Chen Y', 'Yang Y', 'Sun M', 'Yan Z', 'Wu L', 'Cui X', 'Zhang G', 'Morris SW', 'Zhang Q']","['Department of Immunology, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110923,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (B-Cell CLL-Lymphoma 10 Protein)', '0 (Bcl10 protein, mouse)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp8 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'B-Cell CLL-Lymphoma 10 Protein', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 8/*metabolism', 'Cell Separation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Up-Regulation']",,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/05/17 06:00,['2011/09/29 06:00'],"['2011/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.23331 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Jun;58(6):865-71. doi: 10.1002/pbc.23331.

Inhibition of bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei brucei and leukaemia HL-60 cell proliferation was assessed using resazurin as a vital stain. Xanthatin was found to be the major and most active compound against T. b. brucei with an IC(50) value of 2.63 microg/mL and a selectivity index of 20. The possible mode of action of xanthatin was further evaluated. Xanthatin showed antiinflammatory activity by inhibiting both PGE(2) synthesis (24% inhibition) and 5-lipoxygenase activity (92% inhibition) at concentrations of 100 microg/mL and 97 microg/mL, respectively. Xanthatin exhibited weak irreversible inhibition of parasite specific trypanothione reductase. Unlike xanthatin, diminazene aceturate and ethidium bromide showed strong DNA intercalation with IC(50) values of 26.04 microg/mL and 44.70 microg/mL, respectively. Substantial induction of caspase 3/7 activity in MIA PaCa-2 cells was observed after 6 h of treatment with 100 microg/mL of xanthatin. All these data taken together suggest that xanthatin exerts its biological activity by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting both PGE(2) synthesis and 5-lipoxygenase activity thereby avoiding unwanted inflammation commonly observed in diseases such as trypanosomiasis.","['Nibret, Endalkachew', 'Youns, Mahamoud', 'Krauth-Siegel, R Luise', 'Wink, Michael']","['Nibret E', 'Youns M', 'Krauth-Siegel RL', 'Wink M']","['Institut fur Pharmazie und Molekulare Biotechnologie, Universitat Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 364, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110923,England,Phytother Res,Phytotherapy research : PTR,8904486,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Trypanocidal Agents)', '298X1N12LS (xanthatin)', 'EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)', 'EC 1.6.- (NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.8.1.12 (trypanothione reductase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 7/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dinoprostone/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Furans/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Lipoxygenase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology', 'Plant Leaves/chemistry', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Trypanocidal Agents/pharmacology', 'Trypanosoma brucei brucei/*drug effects', 'Xanthium/*chemistry']",,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/03/17 06:00,['2011/09/29 06:00'],"['2010/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ptr.3651 [doi]'],ppublish,Phytother Res. 2011 Dec;25(12):1883-90. doi: 10.1002/ptr.3651.

We retrospectively analyzed 46 patients affected by CLL/MPN referred by 15 Italian GIMEMA centers. The aim of this retrospective multicenter study was to define the following: clinico-biological characteristics, possible familiarity, clinical course of both diseases, and influence of MPN chemotherapy on the course of CLL. Among 46 patients, 30 patients were males, 16 patients were females; median age was 71 years. Only one case had familiar CLL. Myeloproliferative disorders consisted of essential thrombocytemia in 18 cases, polycythemia vera in 10 cases, chronic myeloid leukemia in 9 cases, primary myelofibrosis in 6 cases, and MPN/myelodysplastic syndrome in 3 cases. The lymphoproliferative disorder was diagnosed as monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis in 8 patients and as Binet Stage A CLL in 38 patients. After a median follow-up of 49 months, 9 patients experienced progressive CLL and only 6 patients required treatment after a median of 57.5 months. The biological profile confirmed a subset of low-risk CLL. Twenty patients received chemotherapy for MPN without influence on the course of CLL: lymphocyte counts remained unchanged after 3, 6, and 12 months of treatment. This series is the largest so far reported in literature. The diagnosis of concomitant CLL/MPN is a rare event and lymphoproliferative disorders present a clinical indolent course with a low-risk biological profile. MPN therapy does not interfere with the prognosis of patients with CLL.","['Laurenti, Luca', 'Tarnani, Michela', 'Nichele, Ilaria', 'Ciolli, Stefania', 'Cortelezzi, Agostino', 'Forconi, Francesco', 'Rossi, Davide', 'Mauro, Francesca Romana', ""D'Arena, Giovanni"", 'Del Poeta, Giovanni', 'Montanaro, Marco', 'Morabito, Fortunato', 'Musolino, Caterina', 'Callea, Vincenzo', 'Falchi, Lorenzo', 'Tedeschi, Alessandra', 'Ambrosetti, Achille', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Leone, Giuseppe', 'Foa, Robin']","['Laurenti L', 'Tarnani M', 'Nichele I', 'Ciolli S', 'Cortelezzi A', 'Forconi F', 'Rossi D', 'Mauro FR', ""D'Arena G"", 'Del Poeta G', 'Montanaro M', 'Morabito F', 'Musolino C', 'Callea V', 'Falchi L', 'Tedeschi A', 'Ambrosetti A', 'Gaidano G', 'Leone G', 'Foa R']","['Hematology Institute, Catholic University, Largo A.

These disorders may undergo phenotypic shifts, and may specifically evolve into secondary myelofibrosis (MF) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We studied genomic changes associated with these transformations in 29 patients who had serial samples collected in different phases of disease. Genomic DNA from granulocytes, i.e., the myeloproliferative genome, was processed and hybridized to genome-wide human SNP 6.0 arrays. Most patients in chronic phase had chromosomal regions with uniparental disomy (UPD) and/or copy number changes. Disease progression to secondary MF or AML was associated with the acquisition of additional chromosomal aberrations in granulocytes (P = 0.002). A close relationship was observed between aberrations of chromosome 9p (UPD and/or gain) and progression from PV to post-PV MF (P = 0.002). The acquisition of one or more aberrations involving chromosome 5, 7, or 17p was specifically associated with progression to AML (OR 5.9, 95% CI 1.2-27.7, P = 0.006), and significantly affected overall survival (HR 18, 95% CI 1.9-164, P = 0.01).

Ten cases had an evaluable immunophenotyping. A B or T precursor ALL occurred in 7 and 3 patients, respectively. Eleven/12 patients (92%) achieved CR. At 48 months, overall survival and event-free survival rates were 73.3% and 67%, respectively. At CR, a parallel RT-PCR evaluation of the MLL/ENL expression was available in 5 cases. Of these latter, 2 tested MLL/ENL-negative and 3 positive. The minimal residual disease molecular monitoring showed that MLL/ENL status did not correlate with outcome. In fact, all the 2 PCR-negative and 1 of the 3 PCR-positive cases relapsed. Further, a MLL/ENL expression, not preceding a relapse, was detected several times during the follow-up of five long-survivors.

We analyzed the effects of Zn(2+) on reverse transcription and compared them to Ca(2+) and Mn(2+). Using nucleotide extension efficiency as a readout, Zn(2+) showed significant inhibition of reactions with 2 mM Mg(2+), even when present at only approximately 5 muM. Mn(2+) and Ca(2+) were also inhibitory but at higher concentrations. Both Mn(2+) and Zn(2+) (but not Ca(2+)) supported RT incorporation in the absence of Mg(2+) with Mn(2+) being much more efficient. The maximum extension rates with Zn(2+), Mn(2+), and Mg(2+) were approximately 0.1, 1, and 3.5 nucleotides per second, respectively. Zinc supported optimal RNase H activity at approximately 25 muM, similar to the optimal for nucleotide addition in the presence of low dNTP concentrations. Surprisingly, processivity (average number of nucleotides incorporated in a single binding event with enzyme) during reverse transcription was comparable with Zn(2+) and Mg(2+), and single RT molecules were able to continue extension in the presence of Zn(2+) for several hours on the same template. Consistent with this result, the half-life for RT-Zn(2+)-(primer-template) complexes was 220 +/- 60 min and only 1.7 +/- 1 min with Mg(2+), indicating approximately 130-fold more stable binding with Zn(2+). Essentially, the presence of Zn(2+) promotes the formation of a highly stable slowly progressing RT-(primer-template) complex.","['Fenstermacher, Katherine J', 'DeStefano, Jeffrey J']","['Fenstermacher KJ', 'DeStefano JJ']","['Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland 20742, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20110926,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Avian Myeloblastosis Virus/enzymology', 'Biocatalysis/*drug effects', 'Calcium/pharmacology', 'DNA Primers/*metabolism', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Stability/drug effects', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'HIV-1/drug effects/*enzymology/genetics/physiology', 'Kinetics', 'Magnesium/pharmacology', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/enzymology', 'Mutation', 'Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Ribonuclease H, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Virus Replication/drug effects', 'Zinc/*pharmacology']",PMC3220506,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/01/17 06:00,['2011/09/29 06:00'],"['2011/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)50393-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M111.289850 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 Nov 25;286(47):40433-42. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.289850.

Here, we employ Sabutoclax, a potent and effective Mcl-1 antagonist, as a competing agent to screen a randomized 12-residue phage display library for peptides that bind strongly to the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) binding groove of Mcl-1. Although the screen identified a number of alpha-helical peptides with canonical BH3 domain sequences, it also isolated a pair of unique peptide sequences. These sequences exhibit a reverse organization of conserved hydrophobic and acidic residues when compared with canonical BH3 sequences, and we therefore refer to them as reverse BH3 (rBH3) peptides. Furthermore, studies of the rBH3 peptides using NMR spectroscopy, fluorescence polarization displacement assays, and alanine scanning data all suggest that they bind to the BH3 binding groove of Mcl-1 selectively over Bcl-x(L). A search for proteins containing the rBH3 motif has identified a number of interesting Mcl-1 protein partners, some of which have previously been associated with apoptosis regulation involving Mcl-1. These findings provide insights into the development of more specific Mcl-1 antagonists and open the way to the identification of a previously unknown family of apoptosis-regulating and Mcl-1 interacting proteins.","['Placzek, William J', 'Sturlese, Mattia', 'Wu, Bainan', 'Cellitti, Jason F', 'Wei, Jun', 'Pellecchia, Maurizio']","['Placzek WJ', 'Sturlese M', 'Wu B', 'Cellitti JF', 'Wei J', 'Pellecchia M']","['Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110927,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Bax protein (53-86))', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular', 'Peptide Fragments/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'bcl-X Protein/chemistry/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3220561,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/01/06 06:00,['2011/09/29 06:00'],"['2011/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)50482-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M111.305326 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 Nov 18;286(46):39829-35. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.305326.

One difficulty has been the need to propagate cancer cells in vitro to produce the infectious agent in detectable quantity. We hypothesized that genome amplification from small numbers of cells could be adapted to circumvent this difficulty. A patient with concomitant chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and polycythemia vera (PV) requiring therapeutic phlebotomy donated a large amount of phlebotomized blood to test this possibility. Using genome amplification methods, we identified a new isolate (BIS8-17) of torque teno virus (TTV) 10. The presence of blood isolate sequence 8-17 (BIS8-17) in the original plasma was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), validating the approach, since TTV is a known plasma virus. Subsequent PCR testing of plasmas from additional patients showed that BIS8-17 had a similar incidence (~20%) in CLL (n = 48) or PV (n = 10) compared with healthy controls (n = 52). CLL cells do not harbor BIS8-17; PCR did not detect it in CLL peripheral blood genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (n = 20). CLL patient clinical outcome or prognostic markers (immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region [IGHV ] mutation, CD38 or zeta-chain associated protein kinase 70 kDa [ZAP-70]) did not correlate with BIS8-17 infection. Although not causative to our knowledge, this is the first reported isolation and detection of TTV in either CLL or PV. TTV could serve as a covirus with another infectious agent or TTV variant with rearranged genetic components that contribute to disease pathogenesis. These results prove that this method identifies infectious agents and provides an experimental methodology to test correlation with disease.","['Chu, Charles C', 'Zhang, Lu', 'Dhayalan, Arjun', 'Agagnina, Briana M', 'Magli, Amanda R', 'Fraher, Gia', 'Didier, Sebastien', 'Johnson, Linda P', 'Kennedy, William J', 'Damle, Rajendra N', 'Yan, Xiao-Jie', 'Patten, Piers E M', 'Teichberg, Saul', 'Koduru, Prasad', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Allen, Steven L', 'Rai, Kanti R', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas']","['Chu CC', 'Zhang L', 'Dhayalan A', 'Agagnina BM', 'Magli AR', 'Fraher G', 'Didier S', 'Johnson LP', 'Kennedy WJ', 'Damle RN', 'Yan XJ', 'Patten PE', 'Teichberg S', 'Koduru P', 'Kolitz JE', 'Allen SL', 'Rai KR', 'Chiorazzi N']","['The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, North Shore-Long Island Jewish-LIJ Health System, Manhasset, New York, United States of America. cchu@nshs.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110921,England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Donors', 'Case-Control Studies', 'DNA Virus Infections/blood/complications/virology', 'DNA, Viral/blood/genetics', 'Female', 'Genome, Viral/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*complications/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques/*methods', 'Polycythemia Vera/blood/*complications/*virology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Torque teno virus/*genetics/*isolation & purification']",PMC3321826,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/08/04 06:00,['2011/09/29 06:00'],"['2010/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['molmed.2010.00110 [pii]', '10.2119/molmed.2010.00110 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Med. 2011;17(11-12):1338-48. doi: 10.2119/molmed.2010.00110.

Draft genome sequences have been reported for schistosomes, but functional genomics tools are needed to investigate the role and essentiality of the newly reported genes. Vector based RNA interference can contribute to functional genomics analysis for schistosomes. Using mRNA encoding reporter firefly luciferase as a model target, we compared the performance of a schistosome and a human promoter from the U6 gene in driving shRNA in human fibrosarcoma cells and in cultured schistosomes. Further, both a retroviral [Murine leukemia virus (MLV)] and plasmid (piggyBac, pXL-Bac II) vector were utilized. The schistosome U6 gene promoter was 270 bp in length, the human U6 gene promoter was 264 bp; they shared 41% identity. Following transduction of both HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells and schistosomules of Schistosoma mansoni with pseudotyped MLV virions, stronger knockdown of luciferase activity was seen with the virions encoding the human U6 promoter driven shRNA than the schistosome U6 promoter. A similar trend was seen after transfection of HT1080 cells and schistosomules with the pXL-Bac-II constructs-stronger knockdown of luciferase activity was seen with constructs encoding the human compared to schistosome U6 promoter. The findings indicate that a human U6 gene promoter drives stronger shRNA activity than its schistosome orthologue, not only in a human cancer cell line but also in larval schistosomes. This RNA polymerase III promoter represents a potentially valuable component for vector based RNA interference studies in schistosomes and related platyhelminth parasites.","['Duvoisin, Raphael', 'Ayuk, Mary A', 'Rinaldi, Gabriel', 'Suttiprapa, Sutas', 'Mann, Victoria H', 'Lee, Clarence M', 'Harris, Nicola', 'Brindley, Paul J']","['Duvoisin R', 'Ayuk MA', 'Rinaldi G', 'Suttiprapa S', 'Mann VH', 'Lee CM', 'Harris N', 'Brindley PJ']","['Department of Microbiology, Immunology & Tropical Medicine, The George Washington University Medical Center, Ross Hall 448, 2300 I Street NW, Washington, DC 20037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20110928,Netherlands,Transgenic Res,Transgenic research,9209120,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Ribonucleoprotein, U4-U6 Small Nuclear)', 'EC 1.13.12.7 (Luciferases, Firefly)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fibrosarcoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genes, Helminth', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/metabolism', 'Luciferases, Firefly/genetics/metabolism', 'Plasmids/genetics/metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ribonucleoprotein, U4-U6 Small Nuclear/*genetics', 'Schistosoma mansoni/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",PMC3271131,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/09/07 06:00,['2011/09/29 06:00'],"['2011/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11248-011-9548-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Transgenic Res. 2012 Jun;21(3):511-21. doi: 10.1007/s11248-011-9548-0.

Therefore, new rational strategies are needed for HL treatment. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a promising anticancer agent due to its tumor selectivity and its lack of toxicity for normal cells. Unfortunately, many cancers remain resistant to TRAIL including HL. HL is characterized by enhanced expression of cellular caspase-8 (FLICE)-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), which block receptor-mediated apoptosis by inhibiting caspase-8 and caspase-3, respectively. We have recently discovered the herbal compound Rocaglamide, which breaks TRAIL-resistance in acute T cell leukemia through inhibition of c-FLIP expression. We have also shown that small molecule XIAP inhibitors can sensitize TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in several resistant tumors. However, whether targeting XIAP or c-FLIP is also a suitable strategy to prime HL cells for TRAIL-induced apoptosis has not yet been investigated. In our study, we show that Rocaglamide suppresses c-FLIP expression in HL cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. However, downregulation of c-FLIP alone was not sufficient to sensitize TRAIL-induced apoptosis in HL cells. Similarly, treatment of HL cells with a small molecule XIAP inhibitor resulted in a moderate induction of apoptosis. However, inhibition of XIAP alone was also not sufficient to enhance TRAIL-induced cell death. Synergistic increase in TRAIL-mediated killing of HL cells was only obtained by combination of Rocaglamide and XIAP inhibitors. Our study demonstrates that targeting both c-FLIP and XIAP are necessary for an efficient treatment of HL.","['Giaisi, Marco', 'Kohler, Rebecca', 'Fulda, Simone', 'Krammer, Peter H', 'Li-Weber, Min']","['Giaisi M', 'Kohler R', 'Fulda S', 'Krammer PH', 'Li-Weber M']","['German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111108,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Benzofurans)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '84573-16-0 (rocaglamide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Benzofurans/*pharmacology', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Hodgkin Disease/*pathology', 'Humans', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*physiology', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/09/01 06:00,['2011/09/29 06:00'],"['2011/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.26458 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2012 Aug 15;131(4):1003-8. doi: 10.1002/ijc.26458.

Since 2003 an international collaboration had a major contribution in many aspects like provision of drugs and medical supplies, attendance of scientific workshops, and updating doctor's knowledge and experience through telemedicine programs which resulted in decreasing the induction mortality in acute lymphoblastic leukemia from 24% in the year 2007% to 10% in 2010 after introduction of pre-phase steroids and in acute promyelocytic leukemia from 95% to 5% after introduction of all trans-retinoic acid. A collaborative work with Rome University resulted in changing diagnosis of 20% of pathological samples sent there for reevaluation. Iraqi pediatric oncologists still need real attempts to improve infrastructure and human resources in addition to twinning programs with internationally recognized cancer centers to face these management challenges.","['Al-Hadad, Salma Abbass', 'Al-Jadiry, Mazin Faisal', 'Al-Darraji, Amir Fadhil', 'Al-Saeed, Raghad Majid', 'Al-Badr, Safaa Faraj', 'Ghali, Hasanein Habeeb']","['Al-Hadad SA', 'Al-Jadiry MF', 'Al-Darraji AF', 'Al-Saeed RM', 'Al-Badr SF', 'Ghali HH']","['Oncology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Children Welfare Teaching Hospital, Baghdad College of Medicine, Baghdad, Iraq. cancer@mecc-research.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Bone Neoplasms/mortality/therapy', 'Child', 'Delivery of Health Care/organization & administration/statistics & numerical data/*trends', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/mortality/therapy', 'Humans', 'Iraq/epidemiology', 'Kidney Neoplasms/mortality/therapy', 'Medical Oncology/organization & administration/statistics & numerical data/*trends', 'Neoplasms/*mortality/*therapy', 'Pediatrics/organization & administration/statistics & numerical data/*trends', 'Retinal Neoplasms/mortality/therapy', 'Retinoblastoma/mortality/therapy', 'Wilms Tumor/mortality/therapy']",,2011/10/05 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/09/29 06:00'],"['2011/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MPH.0b013e318230e218 [doi]', '00043426-201110001-00018 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2011 Oct;33 Suppl 2:S154-6. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e318230e218.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two years after treatment, the patient developed an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) which harbored del(11q23) in 8% of the blast cells. The patient was submitted for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (aSCT) from her HLA-compatible sister. Ten months after transplantation, she relapsed with an AML with basophilic maturation characterized by CD45(low) CD33(high), CD117(+), CD13(-/+), HLA Dr(high), CD123(high), and CD203c(+) blast cells lacking expression of CD7, CD10, CD34, CD15, CD14, CD56, CD36, CD64, and cytoplasmic tryptase. Karyotype analysis showed the emergence of a new clone with t(2;14) and FISH analysis indicated the presence of MLL gene rearrangement consistent with del(11q23). Interestingly, AML blast cell DNA tested with microsatellite markers showed the same pattern as the donor's, suggesting that this AML emerged from donor cells. Additionally, polymorphisms of the XPA, XPD, XRCC1, XRCC3 and RAD51 DNA repair genes revealed three unfavorable alleles with low DNA repair capacity.In summary, we report the first case of AML involving XPD and XRCC3 polymorphisms from donor origin following allogeneic stem cell transplantation and highlight the potential need for careful analysis of DNA repair gene polymorphisms in selecting candidate donors prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation.","['Diamond, Hilda Rachel', 'Ornellas, Maria Helena', 'Orfao, Alberto', 'Gomes, Bernadete E', 'Campos, Mercia M', 'Fernandez, Teresa S', 'da Silva, Roberto I', 'Alves, Gilda', 'Lage, Claudia', 'da Silva, Dayse A', 'Moellmann-Coelho, Arthur', 'da Cruz, Geydson S', 'Bouzas, Luis Fernando', 'Abdelhay, Eliana']","['Diamond HR', 'Ornellas MH', 'Orfao A', 'Gomes BE', 'Campos MM', 'Fernandez TS', 'da Silva RI', 'Alves G', 'Lage C', 'da Silva DA', 'Moellmann-Coelho A', 'da Cruz GS', 'Bouzas LF', 'Abdelhay E']","['Laboratory of Immunology, Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, National Cancer Institute, Praca Cruz Vermelha n degrees 23, 6 degrees andar.

Several lines of evidences have indicated that miRNAs act as tumor suppressors and oncogenes. However, the role of miRNAs in pathogenesis of multiple myeloma (MM) remains unclear. In this study, we examined the profile of miRNA expression of primary MM cells, using miRNA microarray and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) techniques. These results showed that in the bone marrow specimens analyzed, miRNA-29b was significantly downregulated. Similar results were also observed in human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs). Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of miR-29b induced apoptosis and elevated caspase-3 activation in HMCLs. Using a bioinformatics approach, we found a perfect complementarity between miRNA-29b and the 3'UTR of myeloid-cell-leukemia 1(Mcl-1). It is further confirmed that miRNA-29b downregulated the level of Mcl-1 without effect on the mRNA level using both qRT-PCR assays and Western blot analyses. Moreover, we observed that enforced miR-29b expression by using a retarget miRNA-29b expression vector (Ad5F11p-miR-29b) could induce apoptosis and elevate caspase-3 activation in HMCLs. Our results also indicated that miRNA-29b-induced apoptosis acted antagonistically with IL-6 in HMCLs. These findings suggest that miRNA-29b may play an important role in MM as a tumor suppressor.","['Zhang, Yi-Kun', 'Wang, Hua', 'Leng, Yun', 'Li, Ze-Liang', 'Yang, Yue-Feng', 'Xiao, Feng-Jun', 'Li, Qing-Fang', 'Chen, Xie-Qun', 'Wang, Li-Sheng']","['Zhang YK', 'Wang H', 'Leng Y', 'Li ZL', 'Yang YF', 'Xiao FJ', 'Li QF', 'Chen XQ', 'Wang LS']","[""Department of Haematology, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an 710032, PR China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110917,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (MIRN29a microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Up-Regulation']",,2011/09/29 06:00,2011/12/14 06:00,['2011/09/29 06:00'],"['2011/09/06 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(11)01667-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.09.063 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2011 Oct 14;414(1):233-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.09.063.

Patients with AML (16-60 years) in CR1 after 2 cycles of intensive chemotherapy and not eligible for allogeneic SCT were randomized between intensive chemotherapy with etoposide and mitoxantrone or ASCT ater high-dose cyclophosphamide and busulfan. Of patients randomized (chemotherapy, n = 259; ASCT, n = 258), more than 90% received their assigned treatment. The 2 groups were comparable with regard to prognostic factors. The ASCT group showed a markedly reduced relapse rate (58% vs 70%, P = .02) and better relapse-free survival at 5 years (38% vs 29%, P = .065, hazard ratio = 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.66-1.1) with nonrelapse mortality of 4% versus 1% in the chemotherapy arm (P = .02). Overall survival was similar (44% vs 41% at 5 years, P = .86) because of more opportunities for salvage with second-line chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation in patients relapsing on the chemotherapy arm. This large study shows a relapse advantage for ASCT as postremission therapy but similar survival because more relapsing patients on the chemotherapy arm were salvaged with a late transplantation for relapse.

The aberrant expression of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) is considered to contribute to the malignant phenotype and chemo-resistance of ATL cells. Because of the poor prognosis of ATL, the development of new therapeutic strategies is direly needed. In the present study, we show that an IkappaB kinase 2 (IKK2) inhibitor, IMD-0354, efficiently inhibits the survival of CD4(+) CD25(+) primary ATL cells and prevents the growth of or induces apoptosis of patient-derived ATL cell lines.

Bone marrow transplants improve hematopoietic phenotypes but do not prevent other cancers. FA arises from mutation in any of the 15 FANC genes that cooperate to repair double stranded DNA breaks by homologous recombination. Zebrafish has a single ortholog of each human FANC gene and unexpectedly, mutations in at least two of them (fancl and fancd1(brca2)) lead to female-to-male sex reversal. Investigations show that, as in human, zebrafish fanc genes are required for genome stability and for suppressing apoptosis in tissue culture cells, in embryos treated with DNA damaging agents, and in meiotic germ cells. The sex reversal phenotype requires the action of Tp53 (p53), an activator of apoptosis. These results suggest that in normal sex determination, zebrafish oocytes passing through meiosis signal the gonadal soma to maintain expression of aromatase, an enzyme that converts androgen to estrogen, thereby feminizing the gonad and the individual. According to this model, normal male and female zebrafish differ in genetic factors that control the strength of the late meiotic oocyte-derived signal, probably by regulating the number of meiotic oocytes, which environmental factors can also alter. Transcripts from fancd1(brca2) localize at the animal pole of the zebrafish oocyte cytoplasm and are required for normal oocyte nuclear architecture, for normal embryonic development, and for preventing ovarian tumors. Embryonic DNA repair and sex reversal phenotypes provide assays for the screening of small molecule libraries for therapeutic substances for FA.","['Rodriguez-Mari, Adriana', 'Postlethwait, John H']","['Rodriguez-Mari A', 'Postlethwait JH']","['University of Oregon, Institute of Neuroscience, Eugene, Oregon, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Methods Cell Biol,Methods in cell biology,0373334,"['0 (BRCA2 Protein)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)']",IM,"['Animals', 'BRCA2 Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Repair', 'Developmental Biology/*methods', 'Drug Discovery', 'Fanconi Anemia/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Genomic Instability', 'Germ Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Gonads/cytology/metabolism', '*High-Throughput Screening Assays', 'Homologous Recombination', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Meiosis', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Sex Determination Processes/*genetics', 'Small Molecule Libraries/therapeutic use', 'Zebrafish/*genetics/metabolism']",,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/01/14 06:00,['2011/09/29 06:00'],"['2011/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['B978-0-12-381320-6.00020-5 [pii]', '10.1016/B978-0-12-381320-6.00020-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Methods Cell Biol. 2011;105:461-90. doi: 10.1016/B978-0-12-381320-6.00020-5.,,,,"['GM08531801/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL048546/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR020833/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Concurrent technological advances have significantly improved the genetic tractability and unique advantage of in vivo imaging in zebrafish, providing a means to dissect the molecular pathways underlying tumor initiation, progression and metastasis. Comparisons of cancer-associated gene expression profiles have demonstrated a high degree of similarity in the gene signatures of specific types of tumor cells in fish and humans, indicating that the contributing genetic pathways leading to cancer are evolutionarily conserved. Furthermore, the high fecundity, optical clarity and small embryo size of zebrafish continue to make it particularly amenable to performing whole-organism small molecule screens to identify targets for therapeutic development.

Its structure was determined using data obtained from (1) H and (13) C NMR spectra, as well as by various correlation experiments (COSY, HMQC and HMBC). Both EA extract and I3-O-R were investigated for their ability to induce apoptosis in human chronic myelogenous erythroleukaemia cells (K562). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Apoptosis of cells from the K562 line was detected by DNA fragmentation, PARP cleavage and by evaluating activities of caspases 3 and 8. RESULTS: Apoptosis, revealed by DNA fragmentation and PARP cleavage, was observed after 48-h incubation of these human myelogenous erythroleukaemia cells (K562), with the tested products. Likewise, caspase 3 and caspase 8 activities were induced in the presence of the EA extract and I3-O-R after 48 h of incubation.

A distinct subset of CD26++ lymphocytes in autologous hematopoietic progenitor cell transplants (HPCTs) was investigated with regard to clinical outcome after autologous HPCT. The phenotype of these cells was characterized in more detail. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Forty-two eligible patients (multiple myeloma, n = 31; Hodgkin's disease, n = 3; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, n = 6; peripheral neuroectodermal tumor, n = 1; acute myeloid leukemia, n = 1) were included in a retrospective analysis. Distinct cellular subsets, including CD26+/- and CD26++ subpopulations, were analyzed for correlations with kinetics of engraftment, progression-free survival, and overall survival. RESULTS: The numbers of CD26++ T lymphocytes in the autograft correlated inversely with progression-free survival (p = 0.013). CD26++ T lymphocytes transfused per kg of body weight were predictive for the occurrence of disease progression or relapse (p = 0.006). Importantly, the numbers of CD26++ cells showed a highly variable degree of enrichment in the autograft, but no significant variations in the peripheral blood before apheresis. The characterization of CD26++ cells revealed that CD26++/CD8+ cells form a homogeneous population with a distinct T memory cell phenotype (CD45RO+, CD161++, interleukin-18Ralpha++, CCR7-). CONCLUSION: CD26++ lymphocytes define a discrete phenotype of T memory cells with known chemoresistance and T-cell-repopulating capacity. Their enrichment during apheresis and corresponding depletion from the circulation are associated with an adverse outcome in autologous HPCT.","['Hildebrandt, Martin', 'Dijkstra, Dorothea', 'Gollasch, Hella', 'Daemen, Kerstin', 'Stevanovic-Meyer, Maja', 'Ludwig, Wolf-Dieter']","['Hildebrandt M', 'Dijkstra D', 'Gollasch H', 'Daemen K', 'Stevanovic-Meyer M', 'Ludwig WD']","['GMP Development Unit, Integrated Research and Treatment Center Transplantation (IFB-Tx), Medical School Hannover, Hannover, Germany. martin.hildebrandt@lrz.tu-muenchen.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110926,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['EC 3.4.14.5 (DPP4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.14.5 (Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4)']",IM,"['Blood Component Removal', 'Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4/*analysis', 'Hematopoiesis', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/06/06 06:00,['2011/09/29 06:00'],"['2011/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1537-2995.2011.03351.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2012 Apr;52(4):765-76. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2011.03351.x.

In the present study, we investigated the ability of UA to induce apoptosis in human leukaemia cells in relation to its effects on caspase activation, Mcl-1 down-regulation and perturbations in stress-induced signalling pathways such as PKB and JNK. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Leukaemia cells were treated with UA after which apoptosis, caspase activation, PKB and JNK signalling pathways were evaluated. The anti-tumour activity of UA was evaluated using xenograft mouse model. KEY RESULTS: UA induced apoptosis in human leukaemia cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner; this was associated with caspase activation, down-regulation of Mcl-1 and inactivation of PKB accompanied by activation of JNK. Enforced activation of PKB by a constitutively active PKB construct prevented UA-mediated JNK activation, Mcl-1 down-regulation, caspase activation and apoptosis. Conversely, UA lethality was potentiated by the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002. Interruption of the JNK pathway by pharmacological or genetic (e.g. siRNA) attenuated UA-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, UA-mediated inhibition of tumour growth in vivo was associated with induction of apoptosis, inactivation of PKB as well as activation of JNK. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Collectively, these findings suggest a hierarchical model of UA-induced apoptosis in human leukaemia cells in which UA induces PKB inactivation, leading to JNK activation and culminating in Mcl-1 down-regulation, caspase activation and apoptosis. These findings indicate that interruption of PKB/JNK pathways may represent a novel therapeutic strategy in haematological malignancies.","['Gao, Ning', 'Cheng, Senping', 'Budhraja, Amit', 'Gao,

As a result, the asymptotic null distribution of the Wald, score, and likelihood ratio tests will not have the typical chi(2) distribution. Although it has been proved that the correct asymptotic distribution is a mixture of chi(2) distributions, the appropriate mixture distribution is rather cumbersome and nonintuitive when the null and alternative hypotheses differ by more than one random effect. As alternatives, we present two permutation tests, one that is based on the best linear unbiased predictors and one that is based on the restricted likelihood ratio test statistic. Both methods involve weighted residuals, with the weights determined by the among- and within-subject variance components. The null permutation distributions of our statistics are computed by permuting the residuals both within and among subjects and are valid both asymptotically and in small samples. We examine the size and power of our tests via simulation under a variety of settings and apply our test to a published data set of chronic myelogenous leukemia patients.","['Lee, Oliver E', 'Braun, Thomas M']","['Lee OE', 'Braun TM']","['Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-2029, USA. oel@umich.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Validation Study']",20110927,United States,Biometrics,Biometrics,0370625,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Adenosine Deaminase/blood', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Biometry/*methods', 'Computer Simulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology', 'Likelihood Functions', '*Linear Models', 'Longitudinal Studies']",PMC3883440,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/11/06 06:00,['2011/09/29 06:00'],"['2011/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1541-0420.2011.01675.x [doi]'],ppublish,Biometrics. 2012 Jun;68(2):486-93. doi: 10.1111/j.1541-0420.2011.01675.x.

One approach to improve its selectivity and to decrease the side effects is the conjugation of Dau with oligopeptide carriers, which might alter the drug uptake and intracellular fate. Here, we report on the synthesis, characterization, and in vitro biological properties of a novel conjugate in which Dau is attached, via an oxime bond, to one of the cancer specific small peptides (LTVSPWY) selected from a random phage peptide library. The in vitro cytostatic effect and cellular uptake of Dau horizontal lineAoa-LTVSPWY-NH(2) conjugate were studied on various human cancer cell lines expressing different levels of ErbB2 receptor which could be targeted by the peptide. We found that the new daunomycin-peptide conjugate is highly cytostatic and could be taken up efficiently by the human cancer cells studied. However, the conjugate was less effective than the free drug itself. RP-HPLC data indicate that the conjugate is stable at least for 24 h in the pH 2.5-7.0 range of buffers, as well as in cell culture medium. The conjugate in the presence of rat liver lysosomal homogenate, as indicated by LC-MS analysis, could be degraded. The smallest, Dau-containing metabolite (Dau horizontal lineAoa-Leu-OH) identified and prepared expresses DNA-binding ability. In order to get insight on the potential mechanism of action, we compared the protein expression profile of HL-60 human leukemia cells after treatment with the free and peptide conjugated daunomycin. Proteomic analysis suggests that the expression of several proteins has been altered. This includes three proteins, whose expression was lower (tubulin beta chain) or markedly higher (proliferating cell nuclear antigen and protein kinase C inhibitor protein 1) after administration of cells with Dau-conjugate vs free drug.","['Orban, Erika', 'Manea, Marilena', 'Marquadt, Andreas', 'Banoczi, Zoltan', 'Csik, Gabriella', 'Fellinger, Erzsebet', 'Bosze, Szilvia', 'Hudecz, Ferenc']","['Orban E', 'Manea M', 'Marquadt A', 'Banoczi Z', 'Csik G', 'Fellinger E', 'Bosze S', 'Hudecz F']","['Research Group of Peptide Chemistry, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111005,United States,Bioconjug Chem,Bioconjugate chemistry,9010319,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cytostatic Agents)', '0 (Peptides)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ERBB2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Cytostatic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/genetics']",,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/02/09 06:00,['2011/09/29 06:00'],"['2011/09/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/bc2004236 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioconjug Chem. 2011 Oct 19;22(10):2154-65. doi: 10.1021/bc2004236.

To investigate the mechanisms behind this oncogenic stress response we used Bcr-Abl over-expressing cells cultivated in presence of imatinib. Imatinib deprivation led to rapid induction of Bcr-Abl activity and over-stimulation of PI3K/Akt-, Ras/MAPK-, and JAK/STAT pathways. This resulted in a delayed necrosis-like cell death starting not before 48 hours after imatinib withdrawal. Cell death was preceded by enhanced glycolysis, glutaminolysis, and amino acid metabolism leading to elevated ATP and protein levels. This enhanced metabolism could be linked to induction of cell death as inhibition of glycolysis or glutaminolysis was sufficient to sustain cell viability. Therefore, these data provide first evidence that metabolic changes induced by Bcr-Abl hyper-activation are important mediators of oncogenic stress-induced cell death.During the first 30 hours after imatinib deprivation, Bcr-Abl hyper-activation did not affect proliferation but resulted in cellular swelling, vacuolization, and induction of eIF2alpha phosphorylation, CHOP expression, as well as alternative splicing of XPB, indicating endoplasmic reticulum stress response. Cell death was dependent on p38 and RIP1 signaling, whereas classical death effectors of ER stress, namely CHOP-BIM were antagonized by concomitant up-regulation of Bcl-xL.Screening of 1,120 compounds for their potential effects on oncogenic stress-induced cell death uncovered that corticosteroids antagonize cell death upon Bcr-Abl hyper-activation by normalizing cellular metabolism. This protective effect is further demonstrated by the finding that corticosteroids rendered lymphocytes permissive to the transforming activity of Bcr-Abl. As corticosteroids are used together with imatinib for treatment of Bcr-Abl positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia these data could have important implications for the design of combination therapy protocols.In conclusion, excessive induction of Warburg type metabolic alterations can cause cell death. Our data indicate that these metabolic changes are major mediators of oncogenic stress induced by Bcr-Abl.","['Dengler, Michael A', 'Staiger, Annette M', 'Gutekunst, Matthias', 'Hofmann, Ute', 'Doszczak, Malgorzata', 'Scheurich, Peter', 'Schwab, Matthias', 'Aulitzky, Walter E', 'van der Kuip, Heiko']","['Dengler MA', 'Staiger AM', 'Gutekunst M', 'Hofmann U', 'Doszczak M', 'Scheurich P', 'Schwab M', 'Aulitzky WE', 'van der Kuip H']","['Dr. Margarete Fischer-Bosch Institute of Clinical Pharmacology and University of Tuebingen, Stuttgart, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110920,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/*pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', '*Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', '*Glycolysis', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Metabolomics', 'Mice', 'Necrosis', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/*drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC3176818,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/02/04 06:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0025139 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-03620 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(9):e25139. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0025139.

Its expression is significantly reduced in leukemia and lymphoma patients. ARTS binds and inhibits XIAP (X-linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis protein) by interacting with its Bir3 domain. ARTS promotes degradation of XIAP through the proteasome pathway. By doing so, ARTS removes XIAP inhibition of caspases and enables apoptosis to proceed. ARTS contains 27 unique residues in its C-terminal domain (CTD, residues 248-274) which are important for XIAP binding. Here we characterized the molecular details of this interaction. Biophysical and computational methods were used to show that the ARTS CTD is intrinsically disordered under physiological conditions. Direct binding of ARTS CTD to Bir3 was demonstrated using NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy. The Bir3 interacting region in ARTS CTD was mapped to ARTS residues 266-274, which are the nine C-terminal residues in the protein. Alanine scan of ARTS 266-274 showed the importance of several residues for Bir3 binding, with His268 and Cys273 contributing the most. Adding a reducing agent prevented binding to Bir3. A dimer of ARTS 266-274 formed by oxidation of the Cys residues into a disulfide bond bound with similar affinity and was probably required for the interaction with Bir3. The detailed analysis of the ARTS - Bir3 interaction provides the basis for setting it as a target for anti cancer drug design: It will enable the development of compounds that mimic ARTS CTD, remove IAPs inhibition of caspases, and thereby induce apoptosis.","['Reingewertz, Tali H', 'Shalev, Deborah E', 'Sukenik, Shahar', 'Blatt, Ofrah', 'Rotem-Bamberger, Shahar', 'Lebendiker, Mario', 'Larisch, Sarit', 'Friedler, Assaf']","['Reingewertz TH', 'Shalev DE', 'Sukenik S', 'Blatt O', 'Rotem-Bamberger S', 'Lebendiker M', 'Larisch S', 'Friedler A']","['Institute of Chemistry, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Safra Campus, Givat Ram, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110920,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Peptides)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Septins)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)']",IM,"['Alanine/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Apoptosis', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/chemistry/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Septins/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/*chemistry/*metabolism']",PMC3176765,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/01/31 06:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0024655 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-13266 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(9):e24655. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0024655.

By comparing bound regions found in U937 cells expressing endogenous PLZF with PLZF/RARA-induced U937 cells, we isolated specific PLZF/RARA target gene promoters. We next analysed gene expression profiles of our identified target genes in PLZF/RARA APL patients and analysed DNA sequences and epigenetic modification at PLZF/RARA binding sites. We identify 413 specific PLZF/RARA target genes including a number encoding transcription factors involved in the regulation of haematopoiesis. Among these genes, 22 were significantly down regulated in primary PLZF/RARA APL cells. In addition, repressed PLZF/RARA target genes were associated with increased levels of H3K27me3 and decreased levels of H3K9K14ac. Finally, sequence analysis of PLZF/RARA bound sequences reveals the presence of both consensus and degenerated RAREs as well as enrichment for tissue-specific transcription factor motifs, highlighting the complexity of targeting fusion protein to chromatin. Our study suggests that PLZF/RARA directly targets genes important for haematopoietic development and supports the notion that PLZF/RARA acts mainly as an epigenetic regulator of its direct target genes.","['Spicuglia, Salvatore', 'Vincent-Fabert, Christelle', 'Benoukraf, Touati', 'Tiberi, Guillaume', 'Saurin, Andrew J', 'Zacarias-Cabeza, Joaquin', 'Grimwade, David', 'Mills, Ken', 'Calmels, Boris', 'Bertucci, Francois', 'Sieweke, Michael', 'Ferrier, Pierre', 'Duprez, Estelle']","['Spicuglia S', 'Vincent-Fabert C', 'Benoukraf T', 'Tiberi G', 'Saurin AJ', 'Zacarias-Cabeza J', 'Grimwade D', 'Mills K', 'Calmels B', 'Bertucci F', 'Sieweke M', 'Ferrier P', 'Duprez E']","[""Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy, Universite de la Mediterranee, Campus de Luminy, Marseille, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110920,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PLZF-RARalpha fusion protein, human)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation/methods', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Methylation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",PMC3176768,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/03/02 06:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0024176 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-04722 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(9):e24176. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0024176.

The compound 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), in contrast, partially blocks glycolysis, slowing cell growth but rarely causing cell death. Injected into an animal, 2DG accumulates predominantly in tumors but does not harm other tissues. However, when cells that were highly resistant to ABT were pre-treated with 2DG for 3 hours, ABT became a potent inducer of apoptosis, rapidly releasing cytochrome c from the mitochondria and activating caspases at submicromolar concentrations in a Bak/Bax-dependent manner. Bak is normally sequestered in complexes with Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL. 2DG primes cells by interfering with Bak-Mcl-1 association, making it easier for ABT to dissociate Bak from Bcl-xL, freeing Bak to induce apoptosis. A highly active glucose transporter and Bid, as an agent of the mitochondrial apoptotic signal amplification loop, are necessary for efficient apoptosis induction in this system. This combination treatment of cancer-bearing mice was very effective against tumor xenograft from hormone-independent highly metastasized chemo-resistant human prostate cancer cells, suggesting that the combination treatment may provide a safe and effective alternative to genotoxin-based cancer therapies.","['Yamaguchi, Ryuji', 'Janssen, Edith', 'Perkins, Guy', 'Ellisman, Mark', 'Kitada, Shinichi', 'Reed, John C']","['Yamaguchi R', 'Janssen E', 'Perkins G', 'Ellisman M', 'Kitada S', 'Reed JC']","['Program of Cell Death and Apoptosis, Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, La Jolla, California, United States of America. rudy.yamaguchi@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20110919,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', '9G2MP84A8W (Deoxyglucose)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biphenyl Compounds/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Deoxyglucose/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Nitrophenols/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC3176271,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/03/02 06:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0024102 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-06976 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(9):e24102. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0024102.

During herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) infection this response can lead to the repression of viral gene expression but is counteracted by the viral ubiquitin ligase ICP0. Here we address the mechanisms by which ICP0 overcomes this antiviral response. We report that ICP0 induces the widespread proteasome-dependent degradation of SUMO-conjugated proteins during infection and has properties related to those of cellular SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligases (STUbLs). Mutation of putative SUMO interaction motifs within ICP0 not only affects its ability to degrade SUMO conjugates, but also its capacity to stimulate HSV-1 lytic infection and reactivation from quiescence. We demonstrate that in the absence of this viral countermeasure the SUMO conjugation pathway plays an important role in mediating intrinsic antiviral resistance and the repression of HSV-1 infection. Using PML as a model substrate, we found that whilst ICP0 preferentially targets SUMO-modified isoforms of PML for degradation, it also induces the degradation of PML isoform I in a SUMO modification-independent manner. PML was degraded by ICP0 more rapidly than the bulk of SUMO-modified proteins in general, implying that the identity of a SUMO-modified protein, as well as the presence of SUMO modification, is involved in ICP0 targeting. We conclude that ICP0 has dual targeting mechanisms involving both SUMO- and substrate-dependent targeting specificities in order to counteract intrinsic antiviral resistance to HSV-1 infection.","['Boutell, Chris', 'Cuchet-Lourenco, Delphine', 'Vanni, Emilia', 'Orr, Anne', 'Glass, Mandy', 'McFarlane, Steven', 'Everett, Roger D']","['Boutell C', 'Cuchet-Lourenco D', 'Vanni E', 'Orr A', 'Glass M', 'McFarlane S', 'Everett RD']","['MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR), Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom. chris.boutell@glasgow.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110915,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SIM1 protein, human)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Vmw110 protein, Human herpesvirus 1)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/genetics/immunology/*metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Protein Isoforms/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'SUMO-1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3174244,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1002245 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-11-00546 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS Pathog. 2011 Sep;7(9):e1002245. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002245.

Hence, there is an urgent need for studies that enable the timely selection of appropriate agents for Phase I clinical studies. The Pediatric Oncology Experimental Therapeutics Investigators' Consortium (POETIC) is systematically evaluating libraries of known and novel compounds for activity against subsets of high-risk pediatric malignancies with defined molecular aberrations for future clinical development. In this report, we describe the in-vitro activity of a diverse panel of approved oncology drugs against MLL-rearranged pediatric leukemia cell lines. Agents in the Approved Oncology Drug Set II (National Cancer Institute/National Institutes of Health Developmental Therapeutics Program) were evaluated by in-vitro cytotoxicity assays in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia cell lines with MLL gene rearrangements. Validation studies were carried out with patient leukemia cells in culture. Comparative analysis for toxicity against nonmalignant cells was evaluated in normal bone marrow stromal cells and normal human lymphocytes. Results from this study show that 42 of the 89 agents tested have measurable cytotoxicity against leukemia cells, and among these, 12 were effective against all five MLL-rearranged cell lines (IC(50) [half maximal inhibitory concentration] < 1 muM). These 12 agents include cladribine, dactinomycin, daunorubicin, docetaxel, etoposide, gemcitabine, mitomycin C, mitoxantrone, teniposide, topotecan, triethylenemelamine, and vinblastine. We show that the Approved Oncology Drug Set II contains a number of agents with potent antileukemic activity in the tested cell lines. As approved drugs, these agents have been used in clinical settings for many years for other malignancies, thus their toxicity profile, pharmacokinetics, and other properties are readily available. Further evaluation of their use in future clinical trials for pediatric leukemia with MLL abnormalities should be considered.","['Hoeksema, Kimberley A', 'Jayanthan, Aarthi', 'Cooper, Todd', 'Gore, Lia', 'Trippett, Tanya', 'Boklan, Jessica', 'Arceci, Robert J', 'Narendran, Aru']","['Hoeksema KA', 'Jayanthan A', 'Cooper T', 'Gore L', 'Trippett T', 'Boklan J', 'Arceci RJ', 'Narendran A']","[""Division of Pediatric Oncology, Alberta Children's Hospital, Calgary, AB, Canada.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110905,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,PMC3176174,2011/09/29 06:00,2011/09/29 06:01,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/29 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S21553 [doi]', 'ott-4-149 [pii]']",ppublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2011;4:149-68. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S21553.

However, pharmacologic inhibition of MYC function has proven challenging because of both the diverse mechanisms driving its aberrant expression and the challenge of disrupting protein-DNA interactions. Here, we demonstrate the rapid and potent abrogation of MYC gene transcription by representative small molecule inhibitors of the BET family of chromatin adaptors. MYC transcriptional suppression was observed in the context of the natural, chromosomally translocated, and amplified gene locus. Inhibition of BET bromodomain-promoter interactions and subsequent reduction of MYC transcript and protein levels resulted in G(1) arrest and extensive apoptosis in a variety of leukemia and lymphoma cell lines. Exogenous expression of MYC from an artificial promoter that is resistant to BET regulation significantly protected cells from cell cycle arrest and growth suppression by BET inhibitors. MYC suppression was accompanied by deregulation of the MYC transcriptome, including potent reactivation of the p21 tumor suppressor. Treatment with a BET inhibitor resulted in significant antitumor activity in xenograft models of Burkitt's lymphoma and acute myeloid leukemia. These findings demonstrate that pharmacologic inhibition of MYC is achievable through targeting BET bromodomains. Such inhibitors may have clinical utility given the widespread pathogenetic role of MYC in cancer.","['Mertz, Jennifer A', 'Conery, Andrew R', 'Bryant, Barbara M', 'Sandy, Peter', 'Balasubramanian, Srividya', 'Mele, Deanna A', 'Bergeron, Louise', 'Sims, Robert J 3rd']","['Mertz JA', 'Conery AR', 'Bryant BM', 'Sandy P', 'Balasubramanian S', 'Mele DA', 'Bergeron L', 'Sims RJ 3rd']","['Constellation Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110926,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 ((+)-JQ1 compound)', '0 (Azepines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MYCBP protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Triazoles)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics/*physiology', 'Azepines/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Triazoles/pharmacology']",PMC3189078,2011/09/29 06:00,2011/12/14 06:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1108190108 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1108190108 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Oct 4;108(40):16669-74. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1108190108.

Establishing a definite diagnosis of IFI in immunocompromised patients is particularly challenging and time consuming, but delayed initiation of antifungal treatment increases mortality. The limited overall outcome has led to the strategy of initiating either 'empirical' or 'preemptive' antifungal therapy before the final diagnosis. However, diagnostic procedures have been vastly improved in recent years.

Although its role in T-ALL is well characterized and further supported by a high frequency of activating NOTCH1 mutations in T-ALL patients, it still remains an open question whether the effects of Notch signaling are causative in other types of cancer, including solid tumors. Growing evidence supported by recent studies unexpectedly shows that Notch signaling can also have a potent tumor suppressor function in both solid tumors and hematological malignancies. We discuss the intriguing possibility that the pleiotropic functions of Notch can be tumor suppressive or oncogenic depending on the cellular context.","['Lobry, Camille', 'Oh, Philmo', 'Aifantis, Iannis']","['Lobry C', 'Oh P', 'Aifantis I']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Department of Pathology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)']",IM,"['*Carcinogens', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Receptors, Notch/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",PMC3182047,2011/09/29 06:00,2011/11/15 06:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [medline]']","['jem.20111855 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20111855 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2011 Sep 26;208(10):1931-5. doi: 10.1084/jem.20111855.,,,,"['R01 CA173636/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA133379/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA133379/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21CA141399/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA149655/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA105129/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'R21 CA141399/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA149655/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA105129/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM088847/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01GM088847/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA169784/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the feasibility of intensified preemptive immunotherapy in children receiving allo-SCT for AML. Eighty-four children were registered in our trial from May 2005 to April 2009; of these, 71 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were treated according to the study protocol. Serial and semiquantitative analyses of posttransplantation chimerism were performed. Defined immunotherapy approaches were considered in MC patients. Continuous complete chimerism (CC) was observed in 51 of 71 patients. MC was detected in 20 patients and was followed by immunotherapy in 13. Six of 13 MC patients returned to CC without toxicity and remained in long-term remission. Overall, the probability of event-free survival (pEFS) was 66% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 53%-76%) for all patients and 46% (95% CI = 19%-70%) in MC patients with intervention; however, this number increased to 71% (95% CI = 26%-92%) in 7 of 13 MC patients on immunotherapy who were in remission at the time of transplantation. All MC patients without intervention relapsed. These results suggest that MC is a prognostic factor for impending relapse in childhood AML, and that preemptive immunotherapy may improve the outcome in defined high-risk patients after transplantation.","['Rettinger, Eva', 'Willasch, Andre M', 'Kreyenberg, Hermann', 'Borkhardt, Arndt', 'Holter, Wolfgang', 'Kremens, Bernhard', 'Strahm, Brigitte', 'Woessmann, Wilhelm', 'Mauz-Koerholz, Christine', 'Gruhn, Bernd', 'Burdach, Stefan', 'Albert, Michael H', 'Schlegel, Paul-Gerhardt', 'Klingebiel, Thomas', 'Bader, Peter']","['Rettinger E', 'Willasch AM', 'Kreyenberg H', 'Borkhardt A', 'Holter W', 'Kremens B', 'Strahm B', 'Woessmann W', 'Mauz-Koerholz C', 'Gruhn B', 'Burdach S', 'Albert MH', 'Schlegel PG', 'Klingebiel T', 'Bader P']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Hemostaseology, Goethe-University, University Children's Hospital, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110926,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/*prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Chimera/*immunology', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/01/17 06:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40346-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-04-348805 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Nov 17;118(20):5681-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-04-348805.

NUP98 is known to be fused to at least 28 different partner genes in patients with hematopoietic malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis, myelodysplastic syndrome, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and bilineage/biphenotypic leukemia. NUP98 gene fusions typically encode a fusion protein that retains the amino terminus of NUP98; in this context, it is important to note that several recent studies have demonstrated that the amino-terminal portion of NUP98 exhibits transcription activation potential. Approximately half of the NUP98 fusion partners encode homeodomain proteins, and at least 5 NUP98 fusions involve known histone-modifying genes. Several of the NUP98 fusions, including NUP98-homeobox (HOX)A9, NUP98-HOXD13, and NUP98-JARID1A, have been used to generate animal models of both lymphoid and myeloid malignancy; these models typically up-regulate HOXA cluster genes, including HOXA5, HOXA7, HOXA9, and HOXA10. In addition, several of the NUP98 fusion proteins have been shown to inhibit differentiation of hematopoietic precursors and to increase self-renewal of hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells, providing a potential mechanism for malignant transformation.","['Gough, Sheryl M', 'Slape, Christopher I', 'Aplan, Peter D']","['Gough SM', 'Slape CI', 'Aplan PD']","['Leukemia Biology Section, Genetics Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20110926,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Nup98 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/metabolism', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Pore/physiology', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Sequence Inversion', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic']",PMC3236115,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/02/15 06:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40490-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-07-328880 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Dec 8;118(24):6247-57. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-07-328880.

Our ultimate purpose is to establish a standard second-line salvage chemotherapy regimen for curing relapsed/refractory lymphoma. In this basic pre-clinical study, we evaluated a combination regimen consisting of 9-beta-D: -arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoroadenine (F-araA) and carboplatin that targeted nucleotide excision repair (NER) of DNA in five representative leukemia lineages in vitro. Isobologram analysis demonstrated that simultaneous exposure to these two drugs produced synergistic interactions in U937 and K562 cells, in which lines showed enhanced NER activity by the measurement of UV or drug-induced DNA strand break (comet assay), or quantitation of ERCC1 mRNA (RT-PCR), a key enzyme for NER. Histone gammaH2AX formation was synergistically induced, but no such formation was observed after exposure to either agent alone in K562 cells. In summary, we synergistically inhibited the NER activity of leukemia cells by treating them with a combination of F-araA and carboplatin, suggesting that this combinatory regimen could be used as a novel salvage therapy for refractory or drug-resistant lymphoma.","['Takagi, Kazutaka', 'Kawai, Yasukazu', 'Yamauchi, Takahiro', 'Iwasaki, Hiromichi', 'Ueda, Takanori']","['Takagi K', 'Kawai Y', 'Yamauchi T', 'Iwasaki H', 'Ueda T']","['Hematology and Oncology Division, School of Medical Science, University of Fukui, Matsuoka Shimoaizuki 23, Eiheiji, Fukui, 910-1193, Japan. ktakagi@u-fukui.ac.jp.', 'Hematology and Oncology Division, School of Medical Science, University of Fukui, Matsuoka Shimoaizuki 23, Eiheiji, Fukui, 910-1193, Japan.', 'Hematology and Oncology Division, School of Medical Science, University of Fukui, Matsuoka Shimoaizuki 23, Eiheiji, Fukui, 910-1193, Japan.', 'Hematology and Oncology Division, School of Medical Science, University of Fukui, Matsuoka Shimoaizuki 23, Eiheiji, Fukui, 910-1193, Japan.', 'Hematology and Oncology Division, School of Medical Science, University of Fukui, Matsuoka Shimoaizuki 23, Eiheiji, Fukui, 910-1193, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110923,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Carboplatin/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Repair/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/04/14 06:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/08/25 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12185-011-0930-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-011-0930-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2011 Oct;94(4):378-389. doi: 10.1007/s12185-011-0930-8.

The thymus is an organ where hematopoietic progenitors undergo sequential developmental processes to give rise to this variety of T-cell subsets with diverse antigen specificity. In the periphery, naive T cells further differentiate into effector cells upon encountering antigens. There are several developmental checkpoints during T-cell development, where regulation by a combination of transcription factors imprints specific functional properties on precursors. The transcription factors E2A, GATA-binding protein 3 (Gata3) and RUNT-related transcription factor (Runx) are involved at various stages in the differentiation of double-negative thymocytes and in beta-selection, as are transcription factors from the Notch signaling pathway; other transcription factors such as B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11b (Bcl11b), myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog (Myb) and inhibitor of DNA binding 3 (Id3) are involved at specific stages. Differentiation of T cells into helper versus cytotoxic cells involves not only antagonistic interplay between Runx and T(h) inducing POZ-Kruppel factor (ThPOK) but also complex interactions between MAZR, Gata3 and Myb in the activation and silencing of genes such as Cd4 and Cd8 as well as the gene that encodes ThPOK itself. A wide range of well-defined transcription factors, including signal transducer and activator of transcriptions (STATs), T-bet, Gata3, nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT), adaptor-related protein complex 1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), are known to shape T(h)1/T(h)2 differentiation. Runx and Gata3 also operate in this process, as do c-Maf and recombining binding protein for immunoglobulin Jkappa region (RBP-J) and the chromatin-reorganizing protein special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 1 (SATB1). In this review, we briefly discuss how T-cell characteristics are acquired and become divergent from the point of view of transcriptional regulation.","['Naito, Taku', 'Tanaka, Hirokazu', 'Naoe, Yoshinori', 'Taniuchi, Ichiro']","['Naito T', 'Tanaka H', 'Naoe Y', 'Taniuchi I']","['Laboratory of Transcriptional Regulation, RIKEN Research Institute for Allergy and Immunology, 1-7-22 Suehiro-cho, Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama, 230-0045, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20110923,England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Lineage/immunology', 'Cytokines/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/classification/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Thymocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*immunology', 'Transcriptional Activation/immunology']",,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/02/10 06:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/10 06:00 [medline]']","['dxr078 [pii]', '10.1093/intimm/dxr078 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunol. 2011 Nov;23(11):661-8. doi: 10.1093/intimm/dxr078.

Concerns have been raised about the possibility that MSCs undergo malignant transformation. Several studies, including one from our own group, have shown the presence of cytogenetic abnormalities in MSCs from leukemia patients. The aim of the present study was to compare genetic aberrations in hematopoietic cells (HCs) and MSCs of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Cytogenetic aberrations were detected in HCs from 25 of 51 AML patients (49%) and 16 of 43 MDS patients (37%). Mutations of the FLT3 and NPM1 genes were detected in leukemic blasts in 12 (23%) and 8 (16%) AML patients, respectively. Chromosomal aberrations in MSCs were detected in 15 of 94 MDS/AML patients (16%). No chromosomal abnormalities were identified in MSCs of 36 healthy subjects. We demonstrate herein that MSCs have distinct genetic abnormalities compared with leukemic blasts. We also analyzed the main characteristics of patients with MSCs carrying chromosomal aberrations.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cumulative incidence of osteonecrosis was assessed prospectively in 694 patients treated with the dexamethasone-based Dutch Child Oncology Group-ALL9 protocol. Osteonecrosis was defined by development of symptoms (National Cancer Institute grade 2 to 4) during treatment or within 1 year after treatment discontinuation, confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. We evaluated risk factors for osteonecrosis using logistic multivariate regression. To describe outcome, we reviewed clinical and radiologic information after antileukemic treatment 1 year or more after osteonecrosis diagnosis. RESULTS: Cumulative incidence of osteonecrosis at 3 years was 6.1%. After adjustment for treatment center, logistic multivariate regression identified age (odds ratio [OR], 1.47; P < .01) and female sex (OR, 2.23; P = .04) as independent risk factors. Median age at diagnosis of ALL in patients with osteonecrosis was 13.5 years, compared with 4.7 years in those without. In 21 (55%) of 38 patients with osteonecrosis, chemotherapy was adjusted. Seven patients (18%) underwent surgery: five joint-preserving procedures and two total-hip arthroplasties. Clinical follow-up of 35 patients was evaluated; median follow-up was 4.9 years. In 14 patients (40%), symptoms completely resolved; 14 (40%) had symptoms interfering with function but not with activities of daily living (ADLs; grade 2); seven (20%) had symptoms interfering with ADLs (grade 3). In 24 patients, radiologic follow-up was available; in six (25%), lesions improved/disappeared; in 13 (54%), lesions remained stable; five (21%) had progressive lesions. CONCLUSION: Six percent of pediatric patients with ALL developed symptomatic osteonecrosis during or shortly after treatment. Older age and female sex were risk factors. After a median follow-up of 5 years, 60% of patients had persistent symptoms.","['te Winkel, Mariel L', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Hop, Wim C J', 'de Groot-Kruseman, Hester A', 'Lequin, Maarten H', 'van der Sluis, Inge M', 'Bokkerink, Jos P M', 'Leeuw, Jan A', 'Bruin, Marrie C A', 'Egeler, R Maarten', 'Veerman, Anjo J P', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M']","['te Winkel ML', 'Pieters R', 'Hop WC', 'de Groot-Kruseman HA', 'Lequin MH', 'van der Sluis IM', 'Bokkerink JP', 'Leeuw JA', 'Bruin MC', 'Egeler RM', 'Veerman AJ', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM']","[""Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Dr Molewaterplein 60, 3015 GJ Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110926,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Logistic Models', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Netherlands/epidemiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Osteonecrosis/*chemically induced/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiography', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2011/09/29 06:00,2011/12/21 06:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/21 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.37.3217 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.37.3217 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Nov 1;29(31):4143-50. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.37.3217.

The values of binding constant, number of molecules that interact simultaneously with the binding site and thermodynamic parameters were evaluated by carrying out the interactions at three different temperatures. Based on thermodynamic parameters and displacement studies with site probes, it was proposed that the drug bound at Sudlow's site I of subdomain IIA.

PMNs were more sensitive to NDMA than PBMCs.","['Jablonski, Jakub', 'Jablonska, Ewa', 'Leonik, Agnieszka']","['Jablonski J', 'Jablonska E', 'Leonik A']","['Department of Toxicology, Medical University of Bialystok, Mickiewicza 2c, 15-222, Bialystok, Poland. toksykologia@wp.pl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110927,United States,Bull Environ Contam Toxicol,Bulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology,0046021,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'M43H21IO8R (Dimethylnitrosamine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Dimethylnitrosamine/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neutrophils/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Young Adult', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3223349,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/03/23 06:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2010/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00128-011-0400-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Bull Environ Contam Toxicol. 2011 Dec;87(6):638-42. doi: 10.1007/s00128-011-0400-2.

METHODS: Respondents included parents of children receiving intensive chemotherapy for leukemia/lymphoma or undergoing stem cell transplantation and HCPs caring for children with cancer. Importance of mild and severe oral mucositis was estimated using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Mucositis-associated utilities were elicited using the time trade-off technique (TTO). WTP to avoid mucositis was obtained using contingent valuation. These techniques quantify how much time or money the participant is willing to relinquish in order to prevent mucositis. RESULTS: Eighty-two parents and 60 HCPs were included. Parents and HCPs believed mild mucositis to be of similar importance (median VAS 2.5 versus 3.6; P = 0.357) while parents considered severe mucositis less important than HCPs (median VAS 8.3 versus 9.0; P < 0.0001). No differences in parent versus HCP responses were seen with TTO (mild or severe mucositis) and most parents were not willing to trade any survival time to prevent severe mucositis. Parents were willing to pay significantly more than HCPs to prevent mild mucositis (average median WTP $1,371 CAN vs. $684 CAN, P = 0.031). No differences were seen in WTP to prevent severe mucositis. CONCLUSIONS: Parents and HCP believe severe mucositis to be important, although it is more important to HCPs. Parents would not be willing to reduce life expectancy to eliminate mucositis.","['Ethier, Marie-Chantal', 'Regier, Dean A', 'Tomlinson, Deborah', 'Judd, Peter', 'Doyle, John', 'Gassas, Adam', 'Naqvi, Ahmed', 'Sung, Lillian']","['Ethier MC', 'Regier DA', 'Tomlinson D', 'Judd P', 'Doyle J', 'Gassas A', 'Naqvi A', 'Sung L']","['Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110925,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Female', 'Health Personnel/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications/*therapy', 'Parents/*psychology', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Stomatitis/*prevention & control']",,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00520-011-1274-x [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2012 Aug;20(8):1771-7. doi: 10.1007/s00520-011-1274-x.

The single agent of As2O3 was inefficient for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in phase II trial demonstrating that new modalities of treatment with enhanced therapeutic effect are needed. In this study, we showed that oridonin, a diterpenoid isolated from traditional Chinese medicine Rabdosia rubescences, greatly potentiated apoptosis induced by As2O3 in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. The synergistic pro-apoptosis effect of combination of these two drugs led to increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a thiol-containing anti-oxidant, was able to completely block the effect. The combination treatment induced ROS-dependent decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) decrease, and relocation of Bax and cytochrome C. Besides, oridonin dramatically increased the intracellular Ca2+ overload triggered by As2O3. Furthermore, the co-treatment of oridonin and As2O3 induced ROS-mediated down-regulation of Akt and XIAP, and inhibition of NF-kappaB activation. The two drug combination enhanced tumor suppression activity in murine HCC model compared with single agent treatment in vivo. These findings demonstrate that oridonin can sensitize hepatocellular carcinoma cells to As2O3 treatment and will facilitate the optimization of As2O3 therapy for HCC patients.","['Chen, Guo', 'Wang, Ke', 'Yang, Bing-Ya', 'Tang, Bo', 'Chen, Jian-Xiang', 'Hua, Zi-Chun']","['Chen G', 'Wang K', 'Yang BY', 'Tang B', 'Chen JX', 'Hua ZC']","['The State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology and Department of Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, P.R.

Here, we investigated the role of this upregulation in the pro-apoptotic activity of hyperforin in the cells of CLL patients and MEC-1 cell line. We found that the increase in Noxa expression is a time- and concentration-dependent effect of hyperforin occurring without change in Noxa mRNA levels. A post-translational regulation is suggested by the capacity of hyperforin to inhibit proteasome activity in CLL cells. Noxa silencing by siRNA reduces partially hyperforin-elicited apoptosis. Furthermore, treatment with hyperforin, which has no effect on the expression of the prosurvival protein Mcl-1, induces the interaction of Noxa with Mcl-1 and the dissociation of Mcl-1/Bak complex, revealing that upregulated Noxa displaces the proapoptotic protein Bak from Mcl-1. This effect is accompanied with Bak activation, known to allow the release of apoptogenic factors from mitochondria. Our data indicate that Noxa upregulation is one of the mechanisms by which hyperforin triggers CLL cell apoptosis. They also favor that new agents capable of mimicking specifically the BH3-only protein Noxa should be developed for apoptosis-based therapeutic strategy in CLL.","['Zaher, Murhaf', 'Tang, Ruoping', 'Bombarda, Isabelle', 'Merhi, Faten', 'Bauvois, Brigitte', 'Billard, Christian']","['Zaher M', 'Tang R', 'Bombarda I', 'Merhi F', 'Bauvois B', 'Billard C']","['Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, INSERM U872, Equipe 18, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110922,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Terpenes)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', 'DHD7FFG6YS (Phloroglucinol)', 'RM741E34FP (hyperforin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Phloroglucinol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/administration & dosage/genetics', 'Terpenes/*pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism']",,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/01/21 06:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2011.1206 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2012 Jan;40(1):269-76. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2011.1206.

Patients were treated with azacitidine 75 mg/m(2) for 7 days subcutaneously and cytarabine 20 mg/m(2) intravenously for 7 days every 28 days. The assigned regimen was repeated for two cycles, then the patients treated with azacytidine alone until progression or allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Eighteen patients with 5 RAEB-1 and 13 RAEB-2 were enrolled in the current study. After two cycles of the combination therapy, responses were achieved in nine patients (50.0%): four complete response (CR) (22.2%), one partial response (5.6%), two marrow-CR (11.1%), and two hematologic improvement (11.1%). Four patients (22.2%) progressed to acute leukemia during two cycles of the combination therapy. The 1-year overall survival (OS) was 87.5% for the early response group (responses at two cycles) and 0% for the late response group (responses at four cycles, p = 0.042). Plus, the median survival time was 476 days (range, 37-718 days) for the early response group and 221 days (range, 193-249 days) for the late response group. The 1-year OS was 100% for the patients who underwent allo-SCT and 73.4% for those without allo-SCT. In summary, the combination therapy showed promising response rate when compared to treatment with azacitidine alone. However, it was limited in terms of preventing leukemic transformation. Allo-SCT would seem to be the only available treatment that can alter disease progression.","['Moon, Joon Ho', 'Lee, Soo Jung', 'Lee, Yoo Jin', 'Kang, Byung Woog', 'Chae, Yee Soo', 'Kim, Jong Gwang', 'Suh, Jang Soo', 'Sohn, Sang Kyun']","['Moon JH', 'Lee SJ', 'Lee YJ', 'Kang BW', 'Chae YS', 'Kim JG', 'Suh JS', 'Sohn SK']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Kyungpook National University Hospital, Kyungpook National University School of Medicine, Jung-Gu, Daegu, South Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110927,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/*drug therapy/physiopathology/surgery', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/03/31 06:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-011-1321-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2012 Mar;91(3):367-73. doi: 10.1007/s00277-011-1321-1.

Recently, we demonstrated that aberrant Notch1 activity is a negative regulator of the B cell program in B cell-derived Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells. Despite abundant evidence for a complex context-dependent cross talk between Notch and NF-kappaB signaling in hematopoietic cells, it is unknown whether these pathways interact in HRS cells. Here, we show that Notch-signaling inhibition in HRS cells by the gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) XII results in decreased alternative p52/RelB NF-kappaB signaling, interfering with processing of the NF-kappaB2 gene product p100 into its active form p52. As a result, expression of Notch and NF-kappaB target genes is reduced, and survival of HRS cells is impaired. Stimulation of alternative NF-kappaB signaling in the Hodgkin cell line L540cy by activation of the CD30 receptor rescued GSI-mediated loss of cell viability and apoptosis induction. Our data reveal that Notch is an essential upstream regulator of alternative NF-kappaB signaling and indicate cross talk between both the pathways in HRS cells. Therefore, we suggest that targeting the Notch pathway is a promising therapeutic option in cHL.","['Schwarzer, R', 'Dorken, B', 'Jundt, F']","['Schwarzer R', 'Dorken B', 'Jundt F']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Charite, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110927,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Ki-1 Antigen)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)']",IM,"['Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Ki-1 Antigen/physiology', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/*physiology', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Receptors, Notch/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Reed-Sternberg Cells/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction']",,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011265 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.265 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Apr;26(4):806-13. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.265.

Molecular monitoring with BCR-ABL quantification shows that a status of undetectable molecular residual disease (UMRD) is obtained in a significant minority of patients. However, it remains unclear whether these patients are definitively cured of their leukemia. Imatinib mesylate withdrawal trials have demonstrated the rapid appearance of the malignant clone in the majority of the patients whereas some patients remain in a state of UMRD. It has clearly been demonstrated that the most primitive stem cells are refractory to all TKIs used in clinical practice. In addition, long-term dormancy is one of the most fundamental characteristics of hematopoietic stem cells. In this context, we have recently undertaken a systematic analysis of the bone marrow stem cell compartment in several patients in durable UMRD. We have demonstrated the long-term persistence of a considerable amount of BCR-ABL-expressing stem cells, even in the absence of relapse. The phenomenon of long-term leukemic stem cell dormancy is of major importance in CML and one of the key questions in cancer biology in general. We discuss, here, the potential mechanisms, including intrinsic and microenvironmental factors, that control the response of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) to targeted therapies and potential novel strategies currently in progress with a curative intent. Moreover, we propose a molecular evaluation of the residual LSC compartment in selected patients in order to develop rational TKI-cessation strategies in CML.","['Chomel, Jean-Claude', 'Turhan, Ali G']","['Chomel JC', 'Turhan AG']","[""Service d'Hematologie et Oncologie Biologique, CHU de Poitiers, Universite de Poitiers, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/*pathology', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC3248215,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/05/02 06:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [medline]']","['333 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.333 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2011 Sep;2(9):713-27. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.333.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that leukemia cells from a substantial proportion of children ( approximately 11%) with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia have low or undetectable MSH2 protein levels, despite abundant wild-type MSH2 mRNA. Leukemia cells with low levels of MSH2 contained partial or complete somatic deletions of one to four genes that regulate MSH2 degradation (FRAP1 (also known as MTOR), HERC1, PRKCZ and PIK3C2B); we also found these deletions in individuals with adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (16%) and sporadic colorectal cancer (13.5%). Knockdown of these genes in human leukemia cells recapitulated the MSH2 protein deficiency by enhancing MSH2 degradation, leading to substantial reduction in DNA mismatch repair and increased resistance to thiopurines. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism whereby somatic deletions of genes regulating MSH2 degradation result in undetectable levels of MSH2 protein in leukemia cells, DNA mismatch repair deficiency and drug resistance.","['Diouf, Barthelemy', 'Cheng, Qing', 'Krynetskaia, Natalia F', 'Yang, Wenjian', 'Cheok, Meyling', 'Pei, Deqing', 'Fan, Yiping', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'Krynetskiy, Evgeny Y', 'Geng, Hui', 'Chen, Siying', 'Thierfelder, William E', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'Downing, James R', 'Hsieh, Peggy', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Relling, Mary V', 'Evans, William E']","['Diouf B', 'Cheng Q', 'Krynetskaia NF', 'Yang W', 'Cheok M', 'Pei D', 'Fan Y', 'Cheng C', 'Krynetskiy EY', 'Geng H', 'Chen S', 'Thierfelder WE', 'Mullighan CG', 'Downing JR', 'Hsieh P', 'Pui CH', 'Relling MV', 'Evans WE']","[""Hematological Malignancies Program, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110925,United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,"['0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (HERC1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class II Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (PIK3C2B protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (protein kinase C zeta)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MSH2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MutS Homolog 2 Protein)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Class II Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'DNA Mismatch Repair/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/deficiency', 'Humans', 'MutS Homolog 2 Protein/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/deficiency', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Protein Kinase C/deficiency', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/deficiency', 'Thioguanine', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",PMC3192247,2011/09/29 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2010/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['nm.2430 [pii]', '10.1038/nm.2430 [doi]']",epublish,Nat Med. 2011 Sep 25;17(10):1298-303. doi: 10.1038/nm.2430.,,,,"['U01 GM92666/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA036401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA036401-28/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM092666-01/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM092666/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,['NIHMS309529'],,,,,,,,,,

A total of 84 parents (49 mothers/35 fathers) of patients diagnosed mainly with leukemia completed a HRQOL measure before SCT, 46 at 1 year (26 mothers/20 fathers) and 50 parents (31 mothers/19 fathers) at 2 years post SCT. Physical and psychosocial HRQOL summary scores are reported. Parents' age and gender, child's diagnosis, radiation history, age, behavior and physical health were examined. Linear mixed models for repeated measures with a covariate structure were used for analysis. Physical HRQOL did not differ between mothers and fathers or over time. Maternal and paternal psychosocial HRQOL scores improved by 2 years post SCT. Child's behavior problems and poor health, and maternal age (younger) predicted poor maternal psychosocial HRQOL 2 years post SCT. Child's behavior problems, diagnosis and treatment severity predicted poor paternal psychosocial HRQOL. These findings identify similar (child's poor behavior) and differential risk factors (parental young age, disease and treatment severity, and child's poor health status) for poor HRQOL for mothers and fathers. These findings can guide comprehensive family-care interventions before, during and after pediatric SCT.","['Barrera, M', 'Atenafu, E', 'Doyle, J', 'Berlin-Romalis, D', 'Hancock, K']","['Barrera M', 'Atenafu E', 'Doyle J', 'Berlin-Romalis D', 'Hancock K']","['Department of Psychology, Division of Hematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. maru.barrera@sickkids.ca']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110926,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child Behavior/psychology', 'Child, Preschool', '*Father-Child Relations', '*Fathers', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*psychology/therapy', 'Male', '*Mother-Child Relations', '*Mothers', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*psychology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/10/04 06:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/04 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt2011190 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2011.190 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2012 Jun;47(6):855-9. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2011.190.

We have used PU-H71 affinity capture to design a proteomic approach that, when combined with bioinformatic pathway analysis, identifies dysregulated signaling networks and key oncoproteins in chronic myeloid leukemia. The identified interactome overlaps with the well-characterized altered proteome in this cancer, indicating that this method can provide global insights into the biology of individual tumors, including primary patient specimens. In addition, we show that this approach can be used to identify previously uncharacterized oncoproteins and mechanisms, potentially leading to new targeted therapies. We further show that the abundance of the PU-H71-enriched Hsp90 species, which is not dictated by Hsp90 expression alone, is predictive of the cell's sensitivity to Hsp90 inhibition.","['Moulick, Kamalika', 'Ahn, James H', 'Zong, Hongliang', 'Rodina, Anna', 'Cerchietti, Leandro', 'Gomes DaGama, Erica M', 'Caldas-Lopes, Eloisi', 'Beebe, Kristin', 'Perna, Fabiana', 'Hatzi, Katerina', 'Vu, Ly P', 'Zhao, Xinyang', 'Zatorska, Danuta', 'Taldone, Tony', 'Smith-Jones, Peter', 'Alpaugh, Mary', 'Gross, Steven S', 'Pillarsetty, Nagavarakishore', 'Ku, Thomas', 'Lewis, Jason S', 'Larson, Steven M', 'Levine, Ross', 'Erdjument-Bromage, Hediye', 'Guzman, Monica L', 'Nimer, Stephen D', 'Melnick, Ari', 'Neckers, Len', 'Chiosis, Gabriela']","['Moulick K', 'Ahn JH', 'Zong H', 'Rodina A', 'Cerchietti L', 'Gomes DaGama EM', 'Caldas-Lopes E', 'Beebe K', 'Perna F', 'Hatzi K', 'Vu LP', 'Zhao X', 'Zatorska D', 'Taldone T', 'Smith-Jones P', 'Alpaugh M', 'Gross SS', 'Pillarsetty N', 'Ku T', 'Lewis JS', 'Larson SM', 'Levine R', 'Erdjument-Bromage H', 'Guzman ML', 'Nimer SD', 'Melnick A', 'Neckers L', 'Chiosis G']","['Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry Program, Sloan-Kettering Institute, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110925,United States,Nat Chem Biol,Nature chemical biology,101231976,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzodioxoles)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Purines)', '06IVK87M04 (9H-purine-9-propanamine,', '6-amino-8-((6-iodo-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)thio)-N-(1-methylethyl)-)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Benzodioxoles/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Computational Biology', 'Drug Discovery', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/*physiology', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Purines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC3265389,2011/09/29 06:00,2011/12/23 06:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/23 06:00 [medline]']","['nchembio.670 [pii]', '10.1038/nchembio.670 [doi]']",epublish,Nat Chem Biol. 2011 Sep 25;7(11):818-26. doi: 10.1038/nchembio.670.,,,,"['1 DP2 OD007399-01/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 AG032969-03/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA155226/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA158609/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50-CA86483/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA155226-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 AG032969/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA172546/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA155226-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DP2 OD007399/OD/NIH HHS/United States', '1U01 AG032969-01A1/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', '1R01 CA155226-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['NIHMS350612'],,,,,,,,,,

To clarify the indications for allogeneic transplantation vis-a-vis autologous transplant and to discuss the rationale and potential benefits of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC), nonmyeloablative (NMA) transplant, T-cell depletion and variations in graft vs. host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. RECENT FINDINGS: Considerable effort has been spent in developing transplant regimens with reduced toxicity and reduced GVHD. The role of allogeneic transplantation has also been redefined in light of advances in lymphoma classification, diagnostic methods, particularly PET scan and advances in transplant technology. Haplo and umbilical cord blood SCT allow identification of a donor for nearly all patients. SUMMARY: In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, the outcome of allo-SCT depends on patient characteristics and chemosensitivity. It is useful after failure of auto-SCT and in partial responses to salvage therapy. Allo-SCT may be the treatment of choice for advanced T-cell and natural killer cell lymphoma and for adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma. Prophylactic or preemptive donor lymphocyte infusion may be useful, but requires controlled studies. RIC and NMA conditioning have reduced early toxicity but are associated with increased risk for disease recurrence. Promising data have been reported from a novel conditioning regimen combining NMA with ibritumomab tiuxetan. T-cell depletion reduces chronic GVHD but has some increase in rate of recurrence. Rapamycin may be associated with reduction in risk for disease recurrence.","['van Besien, Koen']",['van Besien K'],"['Stem Cell Transplant Program, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,,IM,"['Graft vs Tumor Effect', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/immunology/surgery', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/immunology/*surgery', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",PMC4811671,2011/09/29 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CCO.0b013e32834bb88e [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2011 Nov;23(6):681-91. doi: 10.1097/CCO.0b013e32834bb88e.,,,,"['K24 CA116471/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5K24CA116471-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['NIHMS348484'],,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 104 patients with hematological malignancy, who underwent allo-HSCT in Xiangya Hospital from December 1999 to January 2010, were retrospectively analyzed. Of the patients, the transplantation related mortality (TRM), relapse rate (RR), 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) were estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. The unfavorable prognostic factors were also statistically examined. RESULTS: Hematopoietic reconstitution was achieved in 101 patients. At the last data of follow-up, the incidences of severe acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) and extensive chronic GVHD were 15.38% and 25.53%, and the TRM and RR were 15.66% and 21.76%, respectively. The estimated 5-year OS and DFS for all patients were (73.49+/-4.59)% and (63.10+/-5.32)%, respectively. Those for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients were (63.00+/-9.51)% and (49.30+/-9.96)%, and those for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients were (83.87+/-5.06)% and (74.55+/-6.79)%, respectively. The survival analysis suggested the poor prognostic factors for allo-HSCT recipients including female sex, severe aGVHD and refractory hematological malignancy. Further multivariate analyses revealed that severe aGVHD and refractory hematological malignancy were the independent risk factors of poor prognosis for the recipients (P<0.05). The 5-year DFS of severe aGVHD and refractory hematological malignancy patients was (48.22+/-12.69)% and (42.09+/-12.31)%, respectively. The TRM of severe aGVHD, HLA-mismatched graft and unrelated donor transplant was significantly higher than that of the corresponding control groups (57.14% vs. 4.81%, 33.33% vs. 10.41%, 26.09% vs. 9.28%; P<0.05). The RR of refractory hematological malignancy was significantly higher than that of the control group (41.09% vs. 15.63%, P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The treatment of allo-HSCT can improve the disease free survival of patients with hematological malignany and is an important therapeutic method for hematological malignancy. Severe aGVHD and refractory hematological malignancy are the independent risk factors of poor prognosis for the allo-HSCT recipients with hematological malignancy.","['Chen, Yan', 'Xu, Yajing', 'Zhu, Yan', 'Fu, Gan', 'Liu, Yi', 'Peng, Jie', 'Fu, Bin', 'He, Qun', 'Wu, Dengshu', 'Li, Xiaolin', 'Zhao, Xielan', 'Chen, Fangping']","['Chen Y', 'Xu Y', 'Zhu Y', 'Fu G', 'Liu Y', 'Peng J', 'Fu B', 'He Q', 'Wu D', 'Li X', 'Zhao X', 'Chen F']","['Department of Hematology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China. yanchenangel@163.com']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

As a result, prognosis has improved, and approximately 80% of children diagnosed with cancer survive into adulthood. Care has also shifted from a sole inpatient setting to include outpatient treatment where possible, and both these trends have resulted in a shift in the focus of research to the psychosocial and psychological effects of treatment on children and their families. Increasingly, parents are taking on the role of providing ""nursing"" care for their children, for example, managing medications and emergency situations as well as everyday treatment needs. This article critically reviews the current literature surrounding the approaches and methods used by nursing staff to educate families to perform this care within the context of a planned first discharge from hospital. Twenty-two relevant articles were identified covering different aspects of education and discharge planning, including the following: facilitation of education and discharge planning, collaboration between professional disciplines and family, responsibilities and contractual agreements, timing and approach, care planning, and the information needs of families. Only 4 articles discussed what the family felt they needed to know and be prepared for prior to discharge. This review indicates that further research is required to establish the needs of parents and caregivers with regard to education prior to their child's first discharge from hospital in the pediatric hematology and oncology setting.","['Aburn, Gemma', 'Gott, Merryn']","['Aburn G', 'Gott M']","['Auckland District Health Board, New Zealand. gaburn@adhb.govt.nz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,J Pediatr Oncol Nurs,Journal of pediatric oncology nursing : official journal of the Association of Pediatric Oncology Nurses,8917825,,IM,"['Child', 'Humans', 'Nursing Methodology Research', 'Oncology Nursing', 'Parents/*education', 'Patient Discharge', '*Patient Education as Topic', 'Pediatric Nursing', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*nursing', '*Professional-Family Relations']",,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/01/27 06:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['28/5/300 [pii]', '10.1177/1043454211409585 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Oncol Nurs. 2011 Sep-Oct;28(5):300-5. doi: 10.1177/1043454211409585.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has potent antitumor activity against both leukemia cell P388 and carcinoma cell M109. To further explore its potential as a cancer therapeutic, the mechanism of its antitumor activity was investigated. We found that korkormicin A can bind to DNA through intercalation. It also induces p53 phosphorylation, which leads to inhibition of p53 degradation and activation of p53-dependent transcription. Furthermore, korkormicin A preferentially induces apoptosis in transformed cells retaining wild type p53. As it has been shown that p53 usually induces apoptosis in transformed cells, but only growth arrest in untransformed cells, these results indicate that korkormicin A is a potential antitumor agent for cancers with wild type p53.","['Kitagaki, Jirouta', 'Yang, Yili']","['Kitagaki J', 'Yang Y']","['Cancer and Developmental Biology Laboratory, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, MD 21702, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110916,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (korkormicin A)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Depsipeptides/chemistry/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Intercalating Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination/drug effects']",,2011/09/29 06:00,2011/12/14 06:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(11)01645-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.09.054 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2011 Oct 14;414(1):186-91. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.09.054.

Recent pooled analysis confirm results from previous studies, namely an approximately two-fold risk increase at ELF-MF exposures >/=0.4 muT, and demonstrate consistency of studies across countries, with different design, different methods of exposure assessment, and different systems of power transmission and distribution. On the other hand, recent pooled analyses for childhood brain tumour show little evidence for an association with ELF-MF, also at exposures >/=0.4 muT. Overall, the assessment that ELF-MF are a possible carcinogen and may cause childhood leukaemia remains valid.

AIM: Pharmacokinetic and toxicity evaluation of high-dose methotrexate treatments in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 43 children (28 boys, 15 girls, mean age: 7.03 years) in 147 cases were treated with 5 g/m2/24h MTX according to ALL-BFM 1995 and 2002 protocols. Methotrexate and 7-hydroxi-methotrexate levels were measured with high pressure liquid chromatography at 24, 36, 48 hours. Authors registered the development of hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, grade III/IV oral mucositis. RESULTS: Therapeutic methotrexate serum concentrations (30-100micromol/l) were achieved in 72.5% of the cases. Repeated treatments resulted similar serum levels. Hepatotoxicity and hypoproteinemia occurred in 17% and in 48.9% of the cases. There was significant correlation between serum 7-hydroxi-methotrexate and creatinine levels (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: 5 g/m2 methotrexate resulted reliable therapeutic serum levels with mild and reversible toxicity. 7-hydroxi-methotexate measurements might be more useful than methotrexate levels to detect toxicity.","['Csordas, Katalin', 'Eipel, Oliver', 'Hegyi, Marta', 'Csoka, Monika', 'Pap, Eva', 'Kovacs, Gabor']","['Csordas K', 'Eipel O', 'Hegyi M', 'Csoka M', 'Pap E', 'Kovacs G']","['Semmelweis Egyetem, Altalanos Orvostudomanyi Kar II.

Host defense peptides as effector molecules of innate immunity represent a novel strategy for the development of alternative anticancer drug molecules. These cationic amphipathic peptides are able to discriminate between neoplastic and non-neoplastic cells interacting specifically with negatively charged membrane components such as phosphatidylserine (PS), sialic acid or heparan sulfate, which differ between cancer and non-cancer cells. Furthermore, an increased number of microvilli has been found on cancer cells leading to an increase in cell surface area, which may in turn enhance their susceptibility to anticancer peptides. Thus, part of this review will be devoted to the differences in membrane composition of non-cancer and cancer cells with a focus on the exposure of PS on the outer membrane. Normally, surface exposed PS triggers apoptosis, which can however be circumvented by cancer cells by various means. Host defense peptides, which selectively target differences between cancer and non-cancer cell membranes, have excellent tumor tissue penetration and can thus reach the site of both primary tumor and distant metastasis. Since these molecules kill their target cells rapidly and mainly by perturbing the integrity of the plasma membrane, resistance is less likely to occur. Hence, a chapter will also describe studies related to the molecular mechanisms of membrane damage as well as alternative non-membrane related mechanisms. In vivo studies have demonstrated that host defense peptides display anticancer activity against a number of cancers such as e.g. leukemia, prostate, ascite and ovarian tumors, yet so far none of these peptides has made it on the market. Nevertheless, optimization of host defense peptides using various strategies to enhance further selectivity and serum stability is expected to yield novel anticancer drugs with improved properties in respect of cancer cell toxicity as well as reduced development of drug resistance.","['Riedl, Sabrina', 'Zweytick, Dagmar', 'Lohner, Karl']","['Riedl S', 'Zweytick D', 'Lohner K']","['Institute of Biophysics and Nanosystems Research, Austrian Academy of Sciences, Schmiedlstrasse 6, Graz, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20110916,Ireland,Chem Phys Lipids,Chemistry and physics of lipids,0067206,"['0 (Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Discovery/*methods', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate']",PMC3220766,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/03/06 06:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/07 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-3084(11)00329-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2011.09.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Phys Lipids. 2011 Nov;164(8):766-81. doi: 10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2011.09.004.

Conceivably, while conventional treatment eliminates the bulk of MCL cells, residual lymphoma cells may lurk in protective tissue niches, where they receive signals from accessory cells that promote survival and drug-resistance, thereby paving the way for residual disease and relapses. Based on this concept, the lymphoma microenvironment has become a growing area of current research, and initial clinical trials targeting cross talk between MCL cells and their microenvironment are showing promising early results. In this review, we summarize key cellular and molecular interactions between MCL cells and their microenvironment, and update new clinical developments in this area.","['Burger, Jan A', 'Ford, Richard J']","['Burger JA', 'Ford RJ']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77230-1402, USA. jaburger@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20110918,England,Semin Cancer Biol,Seminars in cancer biology,9010218,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*drug effects']",,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/03/02 06:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S1044-579X(11)00055-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.semcancer.2011.09.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Cancer Biol. 2011 Nov;21(5):308-12. doi: 10.1016/j.semcancer.2011.09.006.

In the p53-mediated tumor surveillance system, p53 induces apoptosis or replicative senescence in oncogene-expressing cells, resulting in elimination of such cells. In this context, we previously found that Noxa and Puma synergistically induce apoptosis. Here, we found the adenovirus oncogene E1A to induce p53-dependently expression of Puma, but not Noxa. The induced Puma associates with antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein Mcl-1, accompanied by accumulated Mcl-1 protein on mitochondria. Moreover, E1A also reduces expression of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein Bcl-X(L). In contrast, the DNA-damaging agent adriamycin induces Noxa expression in E1A-expressing cells. Interestingly, Mcl-1 knockdown itself induced apoptosis in E1A-expressing MEFs. Furthermore, Noxa displaced Puma's association with Mcl-1, accompanied by Mcl-1 degradation and apoptosis induction by activating mitochondrial apoptotic executers Bax and Bak. These results suggest that p53-induced apoptosis in oncogene-expressing cells is regulated by differential induction and sequential activation of Noxa and Puma. Accumulated Puma by oncogene enhances susceptibility to apoptosis through ""catch"" in mitochondria by Mcl-1. Subsequently, in response to DNA-damage, Noxa efficiently induces apoptosis by ""release"" of Puma from Mcl-1.","['Nakajima, Wataru', 'Tanaka, Nobuyuki']","['Nakajima W', 'Tanaka N']","['Department of Molecular Oncology, Institute of Gerontology, Nippon Medical School, 1-396 Kosugi-cho, Nakahara-ku, Kawasaki 211-8533, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110914,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Adenovirus E1A Proteins)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Bak1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bax protein, mouse)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PUMA protein, mouse)', '0 (Pmaip1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,"['Adenovirus E1A Proteins/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Mitochondria/genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', '*Oncogenes', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",,2011/09/29 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/09/06 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(11)01625-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.09.036 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2011 Oct 7;413(4):643-8. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.09.036.

A novel doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded composite micelle consisting of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-polycaprolactone (PCL)/Pluronic P105 has been developed and was proved to inhibit the drug resistance of human myelogenous leukemia (K562/ADR) cells. The modulation mechanism that DOX-loaded the composite micelle inhibited MDR was for the first time investigated at cell levels. Results indicated that the cytotoxicity in K562/ADR cells treated by DOX-loaded PEG-PCL/P105 composite micelle was about 4 times higher than DOX solution at 12 mug/mL of DOX. Confocal images showed that the DOX-loaded composite micelles gradually entered into cytoplasm and nucleus, and stayed in intracellular much longer than DOX solution. All the micelles (PEG-PCL micelle, P105 micelle and PEG-PCL/P105 composite micelle) did not change Pgp expression on the surface of K562/ADR cells. However, further study revealed that micelle containing of P105 (P105 or PEG-PCL/P105 composite micelle) significantly decreased ATP level, and consequently restricted the activity of Pgp by down-regulation of mitochondrial membrane potential. On the other hand, the PEG-PCL micelle had no effect on both mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP level of the K562/ADR cells, but its access to K562/ADR cells through endocytic pathway avoided the recognition of Pgp. The PEG-PCL/P105 composite micelle was designed based on the combination of P105-mediated down regulation of mitochondrial membrane potential the malignant cells and PEG-PCL-mediated internalization effect. Therefore, the novel composite micelle is a promising drug delivery system for anticancer drug to overcome MDR.","['Han, Min', 'Diao, Yuan-Yuan', 'Jiang, Hong-Liang', 'Ying, Xiao-Ying', 'Chen, Da-Wei', 'Liang, Wen-Quan', 'Gao, Jian-Qing']","['Han M', 'Diao YY', 'Jiang HL', 'Ying XY', 'Chen DW', 'Liang WQ', 'Gao JQ']","['Institute of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110916,Netherlands,Int J Pharm,International journal of pharmaceutics,7804127,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Micelles)', '0 (Polyesters)', '0 (methoxy poly(ethylene glycol-co-epsilon-caprolactone))', '106392-12-5 (Poloxamer)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'G6DQL26D50 (pluronic P105)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Drug Carriers/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', '*Micelles', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Poloxamer/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Polyesters/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Polyethylene Glycols/chemistry/*pharmacology']",,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/02/09 06:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/31 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-5173(11)00833-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijpharm.2011.09.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Pharm. 2011 Nov 28;420(2):404-11. doi: 10.1016/j.ijpharm.2011.09.009.

Patients treated with bimolane have been reported to have an increased risk of developing therapy-related leukemias. Although bimolane has been identified as a human leukemia-inducing agent, little is known about its genotoxic effects, and a systematic study of the types of chromosomal alterations induced by this compound has not been performed. In this study, a combination of immunochemical, molecular and conventional cytogenetic techniques has been used to study the chromosomal alterations induced by bimolane in cultured human lymphocytes. Immunochemical staining with the CREST antibody indicated that bimolane induces micronuclei (MN) originating primarily from chromosome breakage. Interestingly fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with differentially labeled chromosomes 1 and 9 centromeric probes indicated that bimolane also caused non-disjunction and polyploidy. Consistent with this, an expedited analysis of Giemsa-stained metaphase chromosomes in bimolane-treated lymphocytes revealed a high frequency of polyploidy/hyperdiploidy as well as dicentric chromosomes, and premature centromeric division (PCD). In addition, bimolane was also found to produce binucleated cells, possibly through an interference with normal functioning of intermediate filaments. As a follow-up to these studies, three different types of commercially available bimolane formulations obtained from different Chinese manufacturers were also evaluated. The effects seen with the formulated bimolane were similar to those seen with the synthesized compound. Our studies indicate that bimolane effectively induces a variety of cellular and chromosomal changes in cultured lymphocytes and that similar alterations occurring in bone marrow stem cells could contribute to the development of the secondary cancers seen in bimolane-treated patients.","['Roy, Shambhu K', 'Eastmond, David A']","['Roy SK', 'Eastmond DA']","['Department of Cell Biology & Neuroscience, University of California, Riverside, CA 92521, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110916,Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Mutagens)', '25O7OKR315 (bimolane)', '5AR83PR647 (Razoxane)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia/chemically induced', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Male', 'Micronuclei, Chromosome-Defective/drug effects', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced', 'Nondisjunction, Genetic/drug effects', 'Polyploidy', 'Razoxane/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity']",,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/02/14 06:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/09 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S1383-5718(11)00271-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mrgentox.2011.09.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2011 Dec 24;726(2):181-7. doi: 10.1016/j.mrgentox.2011.09.006.

Basically two types of BCR-ABL1 chimeric mRNA transcripts have been observed: (1) e13a2/e14a2 transcripts in CML and ALL, resulting from chromosomal breaks in the major breakpoint cluster region (M-bcr) of the BCR gene and (2) e1a2 transcripts in ALL resulting from breaks in the minor breakpoint cluster region (m-bcr) of the BCR gene. To gain a better understanding of this molecular alteration, we developed a long-distance inverse PCR (LDI PCR) method for M-bcr breakpoint identification in BCR-ABL1-positive cases and were thus able to identify the chromosomal breakpoints within the M-bcr in 62 BCR-ABL1-positive samples. The corresponding reciprocal breakpoints were identified and molecularly characterized in 45 of these cases. In 2 samples, the breaks were located 5' to the ABL1 locus and in one case, the der(9) break was identified on 9q34.13 several hundred kB 3' telomeric to ABL1. The analysis of breaks revealed no significant clustering and no association with repetitive elements (Alu, L1, L2) or recombination signal sequence sites. The established LDI PCR permits fast, relatively easy and unbiased identification of breakpoints in the M-bcr region of BCR and also enables the molecular analysis of more complex translocations with breakpoints outside the ABL1 gene locus or other BCR fusion genes.","['Burmeister, Thomas', 'Groger, Daniela', 'Kuhn, Anett', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Thiel, Eckhard', 'Reinhardt, Richard']","['Burmeister T', 'Groger D', 'Kuhn A', 'Hoelzer D', 'Thiel E', 'Reinhardt R']","['Charite, CBF, Medizinische Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12200 Berlin, Germany. thomas.burmeister@charite.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110922,Netherlands,DNA Repair (Amst),DNA repair,101139138,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosome Breakpoints', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Order', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/09 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S1568-7864(11)00234-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.dnarep.2011.08.010 [doi]']",ppublish,DNA Repair (Amst). 2011 Nov 10;10(11):1131-7. doi: 10.1016/j.dnarep.2011.08.010.

HMGB1 decreases the sensitivity of human myeloid leukemia cells K562 to anti-cancer drug induced death through up-regulating the autophagy pathway, which is confirmed by the observation with an increase in fusion of autophagosomes and autophagolysosomes. When overexpressing HMGB1, both mRNA levels of Beclin-1, VSP34 and UVRAG which are key genes involved in mammalian autophagy and protein levels of p-Bcl-2 and LC3-II are increased. Luciferase assays document that over-expression of HMGB1 increases the transcriptional activity of JNK and ERK, which may be silenced by siRNA.

We identified long-term risks of other cause mortality associated with comorbidities in the Charlson index and applied these to the creation of a prostate cancer specific comorbidity index. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We sampled 1,598 cases of prostate cancer diagnosed in 1997 to 2004 at the Greater Los Angeles and Long Beach Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. We used Cox proportional hazards modeling to determine the risks of other cause mortality associated with comorbidities and used these hazard ratios to re-weight the Charlson index. We then compared the ability of each index to predict other cause mortality. RESULTS: Cox modeling showed that moderate to severe liver disease, metastatic solid tumor, lymphoma and leukemia carried the highest risk (HR greater than 5) for other cause mortality, followed by moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, moderate to severe renal disease, dementia, hemiplegia and congestive heart failure (HR 2.5 to less than 3.5). The revised and original Charlson indices performed similarly in predicting other cause mortality across all patients (c-index 0.816 vs 0.802). However, in survival analysis our revised index identified 137 men with a greater than 90% probability of other cause mortality within 10 years while the original Charlson identified only 51. In multivariate modeling the odds of 5-year other cause mortality for men with original Charlson scores 1, 2, 3 and 4+ were 2.9, 6.0, 9.2 and 29.8, respectively, compared with 3.9, 6.2, 12.8 and 84.2 for the revised index. CONCLUSIONS: Re-weighting the Charlson index allowed for more accurate identification of men at highest risk for other cause mortality. Our revised index may be used to aid medical decision making for men with prostate cancer.","['Daskivich, Timothy J', 'Chamie, Karim', 'Kwan, Lorna', 'Labo, Jessica', 'Dash, Atreya', 'Greenfield, Sheldon', 'Litwin, Mark S']","['Daskivich TJ', 'Chamie K', 'Kwan L', 'Labo J', 'Dash A', 'Greenfield S', 'Litwin MS']","['Department of Urology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California-Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California 90095-1738, USA. tdaskivich@ucla.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110923,United States,J Urol,The Journal of urology,0376374,,IM,"['California/epidemiology', '*Cause of Death', 'Comorbidity', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Veterans']",,2011/09/29 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-5347(11)04382-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.juro.2011.07.033 [doi]']",ppublish,J Urol. 2011 Nov;186(5):1868-73. doi: 10.1016/j.juro.2011.07.033.

They have been shown to improve transfusion requirements and to change the natural history of the disease. However, with increasing cumulative clinical experience, it has become apparent that these agents are not curative and have their own shortcomings. There is a subgroup of patients who do not respond to frontline therapy and a large, growing cohort of patients that lose response or progress while on hypomethylating agent-based therapy. There are no standard treatment options in this arena and it is therefore a focus of significant research interest. Since the mechanisms of resistance to hypomethylating agents are not known, selection of therapy is largely empiric but must take into account the age, comorbidities, and performance status of the patient, as well as the characteristics of the disease at the time of treatment failure. Higher intensity approaches and allogeneic stem cell transplant can yield improved response rates and long-term disease control but should be limited to a selected cohort of patients who can tolerate the treatment-related morbidities. For the majority of patients who likely will be better candidates for lower intensity therapy, several novel, investigational approaches are becoming available. Among these are newer nucleoside analogues, inhibitors of protein tyrosine kinases, molecules that interact with redox signaling within the cell, immunotherapy approaches, and others. Patients with MDS whose disease has failed to respond to hypomethylating agent therapy should be referred for clinical trials when available. As we learn more about the patterns and mechanisms of failure, the next challenge will be to determine which therapies are suitable for each individual patient.","['Kadia, Tapan M', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Kadia TM', 'Jabbour E', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA. tkadia@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Sulfones)', '0 (gamma-Glu-S-BzCys-PhGly diethyl ester)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '67DOW7F9GL (ON 01910)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'TE7660XO1C (Glycine)', 'W335P73C3L (sapacitabine)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleosides/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Clofarabine', 'Cytosine/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Decitabine', '*Drug Resistance', 'Drug Substitution', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Glutathione/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Glycine/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Sulfones/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Failure']",PMC4098768,2011/09/29 06:00,2011/11/16 06:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0093-7754(11)00126-6 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminoncol.2011.04.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2011 Oct;38(5):682-92. doi: 10.1053/j.seminoncol.2011.04.011.,,,,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In some cases of MDS, especially those in which the bone marrow is hypocellular, there is increasing experimental and clinical indication that an immune-mediated damage to hematopoietic precursors and changes in the hematopoiesis-supporting microenvironment contribute to disease development. Increased serum levels of type-1 cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interferon-gamma (INF-gamma), and oligoclonal expansion of cytotoxic T cells are observed in human MDS. In some cases, the immunologic attack to the marrow appears to be triggered by MDS-specific antigens, damaging the microenvironment and inducing cell apoptosis especially of normal progenitors. In murine models, dysregulation of osteoprogenitors leads to disrupted hematopoiesis of healthy hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells, eventually resulting in MDS and leukemia. In hypocellular MDS, marrow failure appears to be not only the result of ineffective erythropoiesis of abnormal clones, but also due to inhibition of normal progenitors. Immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine, anti-thymocyte globulin, or alemtuzumab may alleviate cytopenias and in some instances induce cytogenetic remission. However, not all patients respond to immunosuppression, and the identification of relevant biomarkers for an immune mechanism is necessary to identify those patients who may benefit from this treatment modality.","['Calado, Rodrigo T']",['Calado RT'],"['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']",IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/diagnosis/immunology', 'Cytokines/blood', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Patient Selection', 'Stem Cell Niche/immunology']",PMC3187571,2011/09/29 06:00,2011/11/16 06:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0093-7754(11)00121-7 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminoncol.2011.04.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2011 Oct;38(5):667-72. doi: 10.1053/j.seminoncol.2011.04.006.,,,,['Z99 HL999999/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],['Published by Elsevier Inc.'],['NIHMS292869'],,,,,,,,,,

The 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) classification currently provides the best diagnostic approach to MDS and also has considerable prognostic relevance. The WHO classification-based prognostic scoring system (WPSS) is able to classify MDS patients into five risk groups showing different survivals and probabilities of leukemic evolution. The WPSS is able to predict survival and leukemia progression at any time during follow-up, and can therefore be used for implementing risk-adapted treatment strategies in patients with primary MDS. Since comorbidities have a significant impact on the outcome of patients with MDS, accounting for both disease status and comorbid conditions considerably improves risk stratification.","['Cazzola, Mario', 'Della Porta, Matteo G', 'Travaglino, Erica', 'Malcovati, Luca']","['Cazzola M', 'Della Porta MG', 'Travaglino E', 'Malcovati L']","['Department of Hematology Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo and University of Pavia Medical School, Italy. mario.cazzola@unipv.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,,IM,"['Comorbidity', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/classification/epidemiology/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment']",,2011/09/29 06:00,2011/11/16 06:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0093-7754(11)00122-9 [pii]', '10.1053/j.seminoncol.2011.04.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2011 Oct;38(5):627-34. doi: 10.1053/j.seminoncol.2011.04.007.,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Since then numerous reports failed to detect XMRV in other cohorts of CFS patients, and some studies suggested that XMRV sequences in human samples might be due to contamination of these samples with mouse DNA. RESULTS: We determined the prevalence of XMRV in patients with CFS from similar areas in the United States as the original 2009 study, along with patients with chronic inflammatory disorders and healthy persons. Using quantitative PCR, we initially detected very low level signals for XMRV DNA in 15% of patients with CFS; however, the frequency of PCR positivity was no different between patients with CFS and controls. Repeated attempts to isolate PCR products from these reactions were unsuccessful. These findings were supported by our observations that PHA and IL-2 stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with apparently low levels of XMRV, which induced virus replication in the 2009 report, resulted in the disappearance of the signal for XMRV DNA in the cells. Immunoprecipitation of XMRV-infected cell lysates using serum from patients from whom we initially detected low levels of XMRV DNA followed by immunoblotting with antibodies to XMRV gp70 protein failed to detect antibody in the patients, although one control had a weak level of reactivity. Diverse murine leukemia virus (MLV) sequences were obtained by nested PCR with a similar frequency in CFS patients and controls. Finally, we did not detect XMRV sequences in patients with several chronic inflammatory disorders including rheumatoid arthritis, Bechet's disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus. CONCLUSIONS: We found no definitive evidence for XMRV DNA sequences or antibody in our cohort of CFS patients, which like the original 2009 study, included patients from diverse regions of the United States. In addition, XMRV was not detected in a cohort of patients with chronic inflammatory disorders.","['Ali, Mir A', 'Dale, Janet K', 'Kozak, Christine A', 'Goldbach-Mansky, Raphaela', 'Miller, Frederick W', 'Straus, Stephen E', 'Cohen, Jeffrey I']","['Ali MA', 'Dale JK', 'Kozak CA', 'Goldbach-Mansky R', 'Miller FW', 'Straus SE', 'Cohen JI']","['Medical Virology Section, Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20110924,England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Viral/*blood', 'Blood/*virology', 'Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic/etiology/*virology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Prevalence', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retroviridae Infections/*complications/virology', 'United States', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/*isolation & purification/*pathogenicity']",PMC3210120,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/02/23 06:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1743-422X-8-450 [pii]', '10.1186/1743-422X-8-450 [doi]']",epublish,Virol J. 2011 Sep 24;8:450. doi: 10.1186/1743-422X-8-450.,,,,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Few studies have investigated the molecular pathways potentially capable of predicting said response. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) acts as a 'master switch' protein in cancer cells, modulating metabolism, the cell cycle, and apoptosis. Cancer treatment with mTOR inhibitors (rapamycin analogs, or rapalogs) has produced promising results in various malignancies (renal cell carcinoma, breast cancer, prostate cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, and melanoma). The novel aim of the present study was to ascertain the prognostic role of mTOR expression in a series of patients with LSCC treated with primary surgery followed by RT. METHODS: The retrospective study involved 25 consecutive patients with LSCC given postoperative RT. Immunohistochemical mTOR expression was evaluated in primary LSCC by image analysis. RESULTS: The locoregional recurrence rate was significantly higher in patients with LSCC whose mTOR expression was >2.5% (P = 0.013). After postoperative RT, the locoregional recurrence risk ratio was 3.25 in LSCCs with mTOR >2.5%. The different disease-free survival was significantly shorter in cases of LSCC with mTOR >2.5% (P = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS: mTOR should be studied as a potential predictor for identifying LSCCs at higher risk of early recurrence after postoperative RT.

Blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway restores anti-virus immune responses, with concomitant reduction in viral load. In a previous report, we showed that, in bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection, the expression of bovine PD-1 is closely associated with disease progression. However, the functions of bovine PD-L1 are still unknown. To investigate the role of PD-L1 in BLV infection, we identified the bovine PD-L1 gene, and examined PD-L1 expression in BLV-infected cattle in comparison with uninfected cattle. The deduced amino acid sequence of bovine PD-L1 shows high homology to the human and mouse PD-L1. The proportion of PD-L1 positive cells, especially among B cells, was upregulated in cattle with the late stage of the disease compared to cattle at the aleukemic infection stage or uninfected cattle. The proportion of PD-L1 positive cells correlated positively with prediction markers for the progression of the disease such as leukocyte number, virus load and virus titer whilst on the contrary, it inversely correlated with the degree of interferon-gamma expression. Blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in vitro by PD-L1-specific antibody upregulated the production of interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma, and correspondingly, downregulated the BLV provirus load and the proportion of BLV-gp51 expressing cells. These data suggest that PD-L1 induces immunoinhibition in disease progressed cattle during chronic BLV infection. Therefore, PD-L1 would be a potential target for developing immunotherapies against BLV infection.","['Ikebuchi, Ryoyo', 'Konnai, Satoru', 'Shirai, Tatsuya', 'Sunden, Yuji', 'Murata, Shiro', 'Onuma, Misao', 'Ohashi, Kazuhiko']","['Ikebuchi R', 'Konnai S', 'Shirai T', 'Sunden Y', 'Murata S', 'Onuma M', 'Ohashi K']","['Department of Disease Control, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, 060-0818, Japan. okazu@vetmed.hokudai.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110926,England,Vet Res,Veterinary research,9309551,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/blood/immunology/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cattle', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics/metabolism', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*immunology/virology', 'Flow Cytometry/veterinary', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*immunology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Species Specificity', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Viral Load/veterinary']",PMC3195098,2011/09/29 06:00,2014/07/01 06:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1297-9716-42-103 [pii]', '10.1186/1297-9716-42-103 [doi]']",epublish,Vet Res. 2011 Sep 26;42:103. doi: 10.1186/1297-9716-42-103.,,,,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/AB510902'],,,,,

Hydroxy-chavicol (HCH), a constituent of the alcoholic extract of Piper betle leaves, was evaluated for anti-CML activity. Here, we report that HCH and its analogues induce killing of primary cells in CML patients and leukemic cell lines expressing wild type and mutated Bcr-Abl, including the T315I mutation, with minimal toxicity to normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. HCH causes early but transient increase of mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species. Reactive oxygen species-dependent persistent activation of JNK leads to an increase in endothelial nitric oxide synthase-mediated nitric oxide generation. This causes loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, cleavage of caspase 9, 3 and poly-adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase leading to apoptosis. One HCH analogue was also effective in vivo in SCID mice against grafts expressing the T315I mutation, although to a lesser extent than grafts expressing wild type Bcr-Abl, without showing significant bodyweight loss. Our data describe the role of JNK-dependent endothelial nitric oxide synthase-mediated nitric oxide for anti-CML activity of HCH and this molecule merits further testing in pre-clinical and clinical settings.","['Chakraborty, Jayashree B', 'Mahato, Sanjit K', 'Joshi, Kalpana', 'Shinde, Vaibhav', 'Rakshit, Srabanti', 'Biswas, Nabendu', 'Choudhury Mukherjee, Indrani', 'Mandal, Labanya', 'Ganguly, Dipyaman', 'Chowdhury, Avik A', 'Chaudhuri, Jaydeep', 'Paul, Kausik', 'Pal, Bikas C', 'Vinayagam, Jayaraman', 'Pal, Churala', 'Manna, Anirban', 'Jaisankar, Parasuraman', 'Chaudhuri, Utpal', 'Konar, Aditya', 'Roy, Siddhartha', 'Bandyopadhyay, Santu']","['Chakraborty JB', 'Mahato SK', 'Joshi K', 'Shinde V', 'Rakshit S', 'Biswas N', 'Choudhury Mukherjee I', 'Mandal L', 'Ganguly D', 'Chowdhury AA', 'Chaudhuri J', 'Paul K', 'Pal BC', 'Vinayagam J', 'Pal C', 'Manna A', 'Jaisankar P', 'Chaudhuri U', 'Konar A', 'Roy S', 'Bandyopadhyay S']","['Department of Cancer and Cell Biology, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111107,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '1126-61-0 (2-hydroxychavicol)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '3T8H1794QW (Eugenol)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (NOS3 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Western', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Eugenol/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piper betle/*chemistry', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology', 'Plant Leaves/chemistry', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2011.02107.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2012 Jan;103(1):88-99. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2011.02107.x.

In this review, we discuss contributions from the major CD4(+) T cell subpopulations to retroviral immunity.

In this study, we analyzed type I IFN subtypes for their effect on prophylactic adenovirus-based anti-retroviral vaccination of mice against Friend retrovirus (FV) or HIV. RESULTS: Mice were vaccinated with adenoviral vectors encoding FV Env and Gag proteins alone or in combination with vectors encoding IFNalpha1, IFNalpha2, IFNalpha4, IFNalpha5, IFNalpha6, IFNalpha9 or IFNbeta. Only the co-administration of adenoviral vectors encoding IFNalpha2, IFNalpha4, IFNalpha6 and IFNalpha9 resulted in strongly improved immune protection of vaccinated mice from subsequent FV challenge infection with high control over FV-induced splenomegaly and reduced viral loads. The level of protection correlated with augmented virus-specific CD4(+) T cell responses and enhanced antibody titers. Similar results were obtained when mice were vaccinated against HIV with adenoviral vectors encoding HIV Env and Gag-Pol in combination with various type I IFN encoding vectors. Here mainly CD4(+) T cell responses were enhanced by IFNalpha subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that certain IFNalpha subtypes have the potential to improve the protective effect of adenovirus-based vaccines against retroviruses. This correlated with augmented virus-specific CD4(+) T cell and antibody responses. Thus, co-expression of select type I IFNs may be a valuable tool for the development of anti-retroviral vaccines.","['Bayer, Wibke', 'Lietz, Ruth', 'Ontikatze, Teona', 'Johrden, Lena', 'Tenbusch, Matthias', 'Nabi, Ghulam', 'Schimmer, Simone', 'Groitl, Peter', 'Wolf, Hans', 'Berry, Cassandra M', 'Uberla, Klaus', 'Dittmer, Ulf', 'Wildner, Oliver']","['Bayer W', 'Lietz R', 'Ontikatze T', 'Johrden L', 'Tenbusch M', 'Nabi G', 'Schimmer S', 'Groitl P', 'Wolf H', 'Berry CM', 'Uberla K', 'Dittmer U', 'Wildner O']","['Department of Molecular and Medical Virology, Institute of Microbiology and Hygiene, Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany. wibke.bayer@uni-due.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110926,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/immunology', 'Antigens, Viral/administration & dosage/genetics/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics/immunology/physiology', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics/metabolism', 'HIV/genetics/immunology/physiology', 'HIV Infections/immunology/*prevention & control/virology', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/administration & dosage/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/*prevention & control/virology', 'Viral Load', 'Viral Vaccines/administration & dosage/genetics/*immunology']",PMC3193818,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/01/31 06:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-8-75 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-8-75 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2011 Sep 26;8:75. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-8-75.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we analyzed the functions of PTHrP and MIP-1alpha on T-cell growth and death both in vitro and in vivo by overexpressing either factor in human Jurkat T-cells. PTHrP or MIP-1alpha did not affect Jurkat cell growth in vitro, but PTHrP increased their sensitivity to apoptosis. Importantly, PTHrP and MIP-1alpha decreased both tumor incidence and growth in vivo. To investigate possible mechanisms, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) arrays and real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays were performed. Both PTHrP and MIP-1alpha increased the expression of several factors including signal transducer and activator of transcription 4, tumor necrosis factor alpha, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand and death-associated protein kinase 1, and decreased the expression of inhibitor of DNA binding 1, interferon gamma and CD40 ligand in Jurkat cells. In addition, MIP-1alpha also increased the expression of transcription factor AP-2alpha and PTHrP increased expression of the vitamin D3 receptor.

The major challenges of recent works are to improve drug loading, increase selectivity to target cells, and control the precise release of drugs. In the present study, we devised a smart drug carrier, an aptamer/hairpin DNA-gold nanoparticle (apt/hp-Au NP) conjugate for targeted delivery of drugs. The DNA aptamer sgc8c, which possesses strong affinity for protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7), abundantly expressed on the surface of CCRF-CEM (T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia) cells, was assembled onto the surface of Au NPs. The repeated d(CGATCG) sequence within the hpDNA on the Au NP surface was used for the loading of the anticancer drug doxorubicin (Dox). After optimization, 25 (+/-3) sgc8c and 305 (+/-9) Dox molecules were successfully loaded onto the AuNP (13 nm) surface. The binding capability of apt/hp-Au NP conjugates toward targeted cells was investigated by flow cytometry and atomic absorption spectroscopy, which showed that the aptamer-functionalized nanoconjugates were selective for targeting of cancer cells. A cell toxicity (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tet razolium, MTT) assay also demonstrated that these drug-loaded nanoconjugates could kill targeted cancer cells more effectively than nontargeted (control) cells. Most importantly, when illuminated with plasmon-resonant light (532 nm), Dox:nanoconjugates displayed enhanced antitumor efficacy with few side effects. The marked release of Dox from these nanoconjugates in living cells was monitored by increasing fluorescence signals upon light exposure. In vitro studies confirmed that aptamer-functionalized hp-Au NPs can be used as carriers for targeted delivery of drugs with remote control capability by laser irradiation with high spatial/temporal resolution.","['Luo, Yun-Ling', 'Shiao, Yi-Syun', 'Huang, Yu-Fen']","['Luo YL', 'Shiao YS', 'Huang YF']","['Department of Biomedical Engineering and Environmental Sciences, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111003,United States,ACS Nano,ACS nano,101313589,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Aptamers, Nucleotide)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '7440-57-5 (Gold)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Aptamers, Nucleotide/chemistry/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxorubicin/chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Drug Carriers/*chemistry', 'Gold/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Inverted Repeat Sequences/genetics', 'Lasers', '*Light', 'Metal Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods']",,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/02/22 06:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/nn201592s [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Nano. 2011 Oct 25;5(10):7796-804. doi: 10.1021/nn201592s.

Increased resolution revealed major interphase intermediates consisting of (1) veil-like chromatin, (2) chromatin ribbon, (3) chromatin funnel, (4) chromatin bodies, (5) elongated prechromosomes, (6) seal-ring, spiral shaped, and circular chromosomal subunits, (7) elongated, bent, u- and v-shaped prechromosomes, and (8) metaphase chromosomes. Results confirmed the existence of the chromatin funnel, the first visible interphase chromosome generated by the supercoiling of the chromatin ribbon. Other intermediates not seen previously included the spiral subunits that are involved in the chromonemic folding of metaphase chromosomes. The existence of spiral subunits favors the helical coil model of chromosome condensation. Incomplete chromatin condensation in leukemia cells throughout the cell cycle is an indication of euchromatization contributing to enhanced gene expression and is regarded as a leukemic factor.","['Trencsenyi, Gyorgy', 'Nagy, Gabor', 'Bako, Fruzsina', 'Kertai, Pal', 'Banfalvi, Gaspar']","['Trencsenyi G', 'Nagy G', 'Bako F', 'Kertai P', 'Banfalvi G']","['Department of Microbial Biotechnology and Cell Biology, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110923,United States,DNA Cell Biol,DNA and cell biology,9004522,"['0 (Indoles)', '47165-04-8 (DAPI)', '57-97-6 (9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene)']",IM,"['9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly/*physiology', 'Chromosomes, Mammalian/*ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*physiology', 'Indoles', 'Interphase/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*physiopathology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Models, Biological', 'Rats', 'Rats, Long-Evans']",PMC3322398,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/06/19 06:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/dna.2011.1374 [doi]'],ppublish,DNA Cell Biol. 2012 Apr;31(4):470-8. doi: 10.1089/dna.2011.1374.

The positive prognostic value of high WT1 expression does not have a clear explanation; it may be implicated either with WT1 anti-oncogenic function, or with the stimulating effect of WT1 oncogene on the leukemic cellular cycle, possibly associated with an enhanced response to chemotherapy.","['Miglino, Maurizio', 'Colombo, Nicoletta', 'Pica, Gianmatteo', 'Grasso, Raffaella', 'Clavio, Marino', 'Bergamaschi, Micaela', 'Ballerini, Filippo', 'Ghiso, Anna', 'Ghiggi, Chiara', 'Mitscheunig, Laura', 'Beltrami, Germana', 'Cagnetta, Antonia', 'Vignolo, Luana', 'Lucchetti, Maria Vita', 'Aquino, Sara', 'Pierri, Ivana', 'Sessarego, Mario', 'Carella, Angelo Michele', 'Gobbi, Marco']","['Miglino M', 'Colombo N', 'Pica G', 'Grasso R', 'Clavio M', 'Bergamaschi M', 'Ballerini F', 'Ghiso A', 'Ghiggi C', 'Mitscheunig L', 'Beltrami G', 'Cagnetta A', 'Vignolo L', 'Lucchetti MV', 'Aquino S', 'Pierri I', 'Sessarego M', 'Carella AM', 'Gobbi M']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria San Martino, Genova, Italy. ematlab@unige.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (BAALC protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', '*Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'WT1 Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/analysis/genetics']",,2011/09/29 06:00,2012/03/23 06:00,['2011/09/28 06:00'],"['2011/09/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.585673 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2011 Oct;52(10):1961-9. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.585673.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODOLOGY: Using a retrospective cohort method, the records of all the patients registered at the Paediatric Oncology Unit at The WFPH, receiving chemotherapy for haematological or solid tumour malignancies from May 2001 to April 2008 and having episodes of febrile neutropenia were analysed. RESULTS: Seventy one episodes of febrile neutropenia were analysed from the 36 patient records. Episode frequency ranged from 1 to 5. The mean duration of febrile neutropenic episodes was 5.01 days (+/- SD 5.2), with range from 1-25 days. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) accounted for 43.7%. The mean WBC for the study population was 0.88 x 10(9)/L (+/- SD 0.61), with the mean absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at 0.16 x 10(9)/L (+/- SD 0.23). Antifungal therapy was used in 6 cases and the incidence of blood culture positive sepsis was 8.5%. Complete resolution occurred in 65 episodes CONCLUSION: Febrile neutropenia episodes treated at the WFPH have a very favourable outcome (91.5%).

The extracellular NM23-H1 protein promotes the in vitro growth and survival of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells and inversely inhibits the in vitro survival of normal peripheral blood monocytes in primary culture at concentrations equivalent to the levels found in the serum of AML patients. The growth and survival promoting activity to AML cells is associated with cytokine production and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) signaling pathways. Inhibitors specific for MAPK signaling pathways inhibit the growth/survival-promoting activity of NM23-H1. These findings indicate a novel biological action of extracellular NM23-H1 and its association with poor prognosis.

However, resistance to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BTZ, Velcade) is an emerging clinical impediment. Mutations in the beta5 subunit of the proteasome, the primary target of BTZ, have been associated with drug resistance. However, the exact mechanism by which these mutations contribute to BTZ resistance, is still largely unknown. Toward this end, we here developed BTZ-resistant multiple myeloma (8226) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (CCRF-CEM) cell line models by exposure to stepwise increasing concentrations of BTZ. Characterization of the various BTZ-resistant cells revealed upregulation of mutant beta5 subunit of the proteasome. These newly identified beta5-subunit mutations, along with previously described mutations, formed a mutation cluster region in the BTZ-binding pocket of the beta5 subunit, that of the S1 specificity pocket in particular. Moreover, we provide the first evidence that the mechanism underlying BTZ resistance in these tumor cells is impaired binding of BTZ to the mutant beta5 subunit of the proteasome. We propose that proteasome subunit overexpression is an essential compensatory mechanism for the impaired catalytic activity of these mutant proteasomes. Our findings further suggest that second-generation proteasome inhibitors that target the alpha7 subunit of the proteasome can overcome this drug resistance modality.","['Franke, N E', 'Niewerth, D', 'Assaraf, Y G', 'van Meerloo, J', 'Vojtekova, K', 'van Zantwijk, C H', 'Zweegman, S', 'Chan, E T', 'Kirk, C J', 'Geerke, D P', 'Schimmer, A D', 'Kaspers, G J L', 'Jansen, G', 'Cloos, J']","['Franke NE', 'Niewerth D', 'Assaraf YG', 'van Meerloo J', 'Vojtekova K', 'van Zantwijk CH', 'Zweegman S', 'Chan ET', 'Kirk CJ', 'Geerke DP', 'Schimmer AD', 'Kaspers GJ', 'Jansen G', 'Cloos J']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110923,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (PSMB11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism', 'Boronic Acids/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', '*Mutation', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Pyrazines/*metabolism/therapeutic use']",,2011/09/24 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2011/09/24 06:00'],"['2011/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011256 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.256 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Apr;26(4):757-68. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.256.

The independent contribution of these factors toward skeletal morbidity (SM) requires further investigation. AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of activity, age, and mineral status over the first 12 months of chemotherapy on subsequent SM. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records of 56 children presenting with ALL between 2003 and 2007 and treated on UKALL2003 were reviewed for the number of inpatient days over the first 12 months of chemotherapy as a surrogate marker of inactivity and lack of well-being. Data for serum Ca, albumin, Mg, and Pho were also collected over this period. SM was defined as any episode of musculoskeletal pain or fractures. RESULTS: The median duration of inpatient days over the first 12 months of treatment in children with no SM was 58 days (40,100), whereas the median number of inpatient days during the first 12 months in those children with any SM, musculoskeletal pain only, or fractures only was 83 days (54,131), 81 days (52,119) and 91 days (59,158), respectively (P=0.003). Children with SM and fractures particularly had lower levels of serum Ca, Mg, and Pho compared with those without SM over the first 12 months of chemotherapy. There was a higher risk of SM in those who were diagnosed after the age of 8 years (P=0.001, odds ratio=16, 95% confidence interval: 3.80). Multiple regression analysis showed that the incidence of SM only had a significant independent association with age at diagnosis (P=0.001) and the number of inpatient days (P=0.03) over the first 12 months (r=23). All children who were diagnosed after the age of 8 years with an inpatient stay of more than 75 days, in the first 12 months of the chemotherapy (n,14) children had some form of SM (odds ratio=64). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of SM in children receiving chemotherapy for ALL is associated with a higher likelihood of being older and having longer periods of inpatient stay. The close link between age and changes in bone mineral status may be one explanation for the increased bone morbidity in ALL children.","['Elmantaser, Musab Elmabrouk', 'Young, David', 'Gibson, Brenda', 'Ahmed, Syed Faisal']","['Elmantaser ME', 'Young D', 'Gibson B', 'Ahmed SF']","['Departments of Child Health, Bone and Endocrine Research Group, Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,['0 (Minerals)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Fractures, Bone/blood/*chemically induced', 'Homeostasis/*drug effects', 'Humans', '*Inpatients', 'Minerals/*blood', 'Musculoskeletal Pain/blood/*chemically induced', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk Factors']",,2011/09/24 06:00,2012/02/02 06:00,['2011/09/24 06:00'],"['2011/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MPH.0b013e3182329cbd [doi]', '00043426-201110000-00008 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2011 Oct;33(7):516-20. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3182329cbd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is highly expressed in vascular endothelial cells, but its impact on monocyte adhesion and the related mechanisms are not fully understood. The present study was designed to evaluate the impact of and gain mechanistic insight into the signaling coupling AMPK function to the antiinflammatory response. METHODS AND RESULTS: 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-ribonucleotide (AICAR) treatment or overexpression of constitutively active AMPK markedly reduced human monocytic human acute monocytic leukemia cell line-1 cell adhesion and the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 in tumor necrosis factor-alpha-activated human aortic endothelial cells. Furthermore, AICAR or constitutively active AMPK overexpression strongly inhibited the histone acetyltransferase activity of the transcriptional coactivator p300 by phosphorylation of Ser89, which in turn decreased tumor necrosis factor-alpha-activated p300-mediated acetylation of nuclear factor-kappaB p65 on Lys221 and reduced the DNA binding activity of nuclear factor-kappaB by inhibiting its recruitment to its target gene promoters. AMPK phosphorylates the transcriptional coactivator p300 via the atypical protein kinase Ciota/lambda. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that transcriptional coactivator p300 phosphorylation at Ser89 by AMPK is critical for the therapeutic effect of AMPK and may be a potential target for pharmaceutical intervention in inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis.","['Zhang, Yuan', 'Qiu, Jian', 'Wang, Xiaoming', 'Zhang, Yuhua', 'Xia, Min']","['Zhang Y', 'Qiu J', 'Wang X', 'Zhang Y', 'Xia M']","['Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, General Hospital of Guangzhou Military Command, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110922,United States,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",9505803,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '360-97-4 (Aminoimidazole Carboxamide)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (E1A-Associated p300 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (EP300 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.31 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'F0X88YW0YK (AICA ribonucleotide)']",IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Aminoimidazole Carboxamide/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Aorta/cytology', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'E1A-Associated p300 Protein/*metabolism', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/*metabolism/physiopathology/*prevention & control', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Ribonucleotides/pharmacology', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism']",,2011/09/24 06:00,2012/01/28 06:00,['2011/09/24 06:00'],"['2011/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/28 06:00 [medline]']","['ATVBAHA.111.237453 [pii]', '10.1161/ATVBAHA.111.237453 [doi]']",ppublish,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2011 Dec;31(12):2897-908. doi: 10.1161/ATVBAHA.111.237453.

The integrity of Rac signaling has also been found to critically regulate cellular functions in the initiation and maintenance of hematopoietic malignancies. Using an in vivo gene targeting approach, we demonstrate that Rac2, but not Rac1, is critical to the initiation of acute myeloid leukemia in a retroviral expression model of MLL-AF9 leukemogenesis. However, loss of either Rac1 or Rac2 is sufficient to impair survival and growth of the transformed MLL-AF9 leukemia. Rac2 is known to positively regulate expression of Bcl-2 family proteins toward a prosurvival balance. We demonstrate that disruption of downstream survival signaling through antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins is implicated in mediating the effects of Rac2 deficiency in MLL-AF9 leukemia. Indeed, overexpression of Bcl-xL is able to rescue the effects of Rac2 deficiency and MLL-AF9 cells are exquisitely sensitive to direct inhibition of Bcl-2 family proteins by the BH3-mimetic, ABT-737. Furthermore, concurrent exposure to NSC23766, a small-molecule inhibitor of Rac activation, increases the apoptotic effect of ABT-737, indicating the Rac/Bcl-2 survival pathway may be targeted synergistically.","['Mizukawa, Benjamin', 'Wei, Junping', 'Shrestha, Mahesh', 'Wunderlich, Mark', 'Chou, Fu-Sheng', 'Griesinger, Andrea', 'Harris, Chad E', 'Kumar, Ashish R', 'Zheng, Yi', 'Williams, David A', 'Mulloy, James C']","['Mizukawa B', 'Wei J', 'Shrestha M', 'Wunderlich M', 'Chou FS', 'Griesinger A', 'Harris CE', 'Kumar AR', 'Zheng Y', 'Williams DA', 'Mulloy JC']","[""Division of Oncology, Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, OH 45229, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110922,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Aminoquinolines)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (NSC 23766)', '0 (Neuropeptides)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Rac1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (rac2 GTP-binding protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac1 GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Aminoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neuropeptides/*antagonists & inhibitors/deficiency/genetics', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics', 'rac GTP-Binding Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/deficiency/genetics', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein']",PMC3217406,2011/09/24 06:00,2012/01/04 06:00,['2011/09/24 06:00'],"['2011/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40374-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-04-351817 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Nov 10;118(19):5235-45. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-04-351817.

To investigate the effects of elevated endogenous TAA expression on variant peptide-induced responses, we used the GP70 TAA model. Although young BALB/c mice display T cell tolerance to the TAA GP70(423-431) (AH1), expression of GP70 and suppression of AH1-specific responses increases with age. We hypothesized that as TAA expression increases, the AH1 cross-reactivity of variant peptide-elicited T cell responses diminishes. Controlling for immunosenescence, we showed that elevated GP70 expression suppressed AH1 cross-reactive responses elicited by two AH1 peptide variants. A variant that elicited almost exclusively AH1 cross-reactive T cells in young mice elicited few or no T cells in aging mice with Ab-detectable GP70 expression. In contrast, a variant that elicited a less AH1 cross-reactive T cell response in young mice successfully expanded AH1 cross-reactive T cells in all aging mice tested. However, these T cells bound the AH1/MHC complex with a relatively short half-life and responded poorly to ex vivo stimulation with the AH1 peptide. Variant peptide vaccine responses were also suppressed when AH1 peptide is administered tolerogenically to young mice before vaccination. Analyses of variant-specific precursor T cells from naive mice with Ab-detectable GP70 expression determined that these T cells expressed PD-1 and had downregulated IL-7Ralpha expression, suggesting they were anergic or undergoing deletion. Although variant peptide vaccines were less effective as TAA expression increases, data presented in this article also suggest that complementary immunotherapies may induce the expansion of T cells with functional TAA recognition.","['Kemmler, Charles B', 'Clambey, Eric T', 'Kedl, Ross M', 'Slansky, Jill E']","['Kemmler CB', 'Clambey ET', 'Kedl RM', 'Slansky JE']","['Integrated Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, University of Colorado Denver and National Jewish Health, Denver, CO 80206, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110921,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Vaccines, Subunit)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Aging/immunology', 'Animals', 'Antigenic Variation/*immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/antagonists & inhibitors/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Down-Regulation/immunology', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Up-Regulation/genetics/*immunology', 'Vaccines, Subunit/administration & dosage/antagonists & inhibitors/*immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*biosynthesis/deficiency/genetics']",PMC3334317,2011/09/24 06:00,2012/01/24 06:00,['2011/09/24 06:00'],"['2011/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1101555 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1101555 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2011 Nov 1;187(9):4431-9. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1101555.

METHODS: A literature search was conducted in PubMed for articles on hypercholesterolemia occurring in the context of graft-vs-host disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The review included the type of lipid abnormalities observed, complications, and available management strategies. RESULTS: Severe hypercholesterolemia can occur in patients who develop graft-vs-host disease after transplant. We describe 8 patients with severe hypercholesterolemia occurring in the context of graft-vs-host disease affecting the liver after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (7 from the literature and 1 from our institution). No association was observed with a specific age, sex, type of hematologic malignancy, or use of a specific immunosuppressant. The elevated cholesterol is either due to high concentrations of lipoprotein X or low-density lipoprotein. Unlike low-density lipoprotein, lipoprotein X may not be atherogenic. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment may not be required when lipoprotein X is the major elevated lipoprotein unless hyperviscosity occurs, but treatment is indicated when there is elevation in low-density lipoprotein.

The Notch3 receptor is frequently expressed in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). METHODS: To explore its possibility as a therapeutic target for T-ALL, we investigated the effect of Notch3 silencing on Jurkat and SupT1 cells using a novel tumor-specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) driven by survivin promoters. RESULTS: We found that downregulated expression of Notch3 correlated with significant apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation. CONCLUSION: These facts suggest that downregulating expression of Notch3 could attenuate the Notch signaling activity in T-ALL. All these results indicate that inhibition of Notch3 expression can result in potent antitumor activity in T-ALL.","['Xiang, Jie', 'Ouyang, Yongri', 'Cui, Ying', 'Lin, Fang', 'Ren, Jihong', 'Long, Min', 'Chen, Xi', 'Wei, Junxia', 'Zhang, Huizhong']","['Xiang J', 'Ouyang Y', 'Cui Y', 'Lin F', 'Ren J', 'Long M', 'Chen X', 'Wei J', 'Zhang H']","[""Department of Clinical Laboratory and Research Center, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110921,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (NOTCH3 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptor, Notch3)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Survivin)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*genetics', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*genetics', 'Receptor, Notch3', 'Receptors, Notch/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Survivin']",,2011/09/24 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2011/09/24 06:00'],"['2011/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/15 00:00 [revised]', '2011/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(11)00243-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2011.07.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2012 Feb;12(1):59-65. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2011.07.005.

Adoptive immunotherapy by the use of donor-derived expanded leukaemia-specific T cells has showed some kind of clinical response, but the major advance is nowadays represented by gene manipulation of donor immune cells, so that they acquire strict specificity towards the tumour target and potent lytic activity, followed by significant proliferation, increased survival and possibly anti-tumour memory state. This is achieved by gene insertion of Chimeric T-cell Antigen Receptors (CARs), which are artificial molecules containing antibody-derived fragments (to bind the specific target), joined with potent signalling T-Cell Receptor (TCR)-derived domains that activate the manipulated cells.

METHOD: A retrospective study of hospitalized patients with hematological disease was conducted at National Taiwan University Hospital between January 1995 and December 2009. RESULTS: Clinical characteristics and outcomes with their associated radiographic and microbiological findings were analyzed. Forty-six patients with IFS and 64 patients with chronic non-invasive sinusitis were enrolled as comparsion. IFS developed more commonly in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and with prolonged neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count less than 500/mm(3) for more than 10 days) (p < 0.001). Aspergillus flavus was the most common pathogen isolated (44%). Serum Aspergillus galactomannan antigen was elevated in seven of eleven patients (64%) with IFS caused by aspergillosis but negative for all three patients with mucormycosis. Bony erosion and extra-sinus infiltration was found in 15 of 46 (33%) patients on imaging. Overall, 19 of 46 patients (41.3%) died within 6 weeks. Patients with disease subtype of AML (p = 0.044; Odds Ratio [OR], 5.84; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.02-30.56) and refractory leukemia status (p = 0.05; OR, 4.27; 95% CI, 1.003-18.15) had worse prognosis. Multivariate analysis identified surgical debridement as an independent good prognostic factor (p = 0.047) in patients with IFS. CONCLUSIONS: Patients of AML with prolonged neutropenia (> 10 days) had significantly higher risk of IFS. Early introduction of anti-fungal agent and aggressive surgical debridement potentially decrease morbidity and mortality in high risk patients with IFS.","['Chen, Chien-Yuan', 'Sheng, Wang-Huei', 'Cheng, Aristine', 'Chen, Yee-Chun', 'Tsay, Woei', 'Tang, Jih-Luh', 'Huang, Shang-Yi', 'Chang, Shan-Chwen', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang']","['Chen CY', 'Sheng WH', 'Cheng A', 'Chen YC', 'Tsay W', 'Tang JL', 'Huang SY', 'Chang SC', 'Tien HF']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110922,England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Fungi/classification/isolation & purification', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/*epidemiology/microbiology/mortality/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sinusitis/*epidemiology/microbiology/mortality/pathology', 'Taiwan/epidemiology']",PMC3196720,2011/09/24 06:00,2012/02/09 06:00,['2011/09/24 06:00'],"['2011/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2334-11-250 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2334-11-250 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2011 Sep 22;11:250. doi: 10.1186/1471-2334-11-250.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, stably-transfected U937 cells with a pMTH1 vector containing the beta2 integrin gene of CD11b in antisense orientation (asCD11b-U937) demonstrated a significantly reduced proliferative capacity in contrast to control vector transfectants (pMTH1-U937) or wild-type U937 cells. Phorbol ester exposure induced adherence and growth arrest in more than 90% of pMTH1-U937 and wild-type U937 cells after 72 h. In contrast, TPA-treated asCD11b-U937 failed to attach and the proliferation continued in more than 30% of the cells. Moreover, increased apoptosis appeared in asCD11b-U937 after TPA induction in contrast to pMTH1-U937 cells. In addition, non-specific inhibition of adherence on an agarose surface demonstrated internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in both, pMTH1-U937 and asCD11b-U937 after TPA treatment indicating a functional relationship between abolished adherence, regulation of proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Western blot analysis revealed differences in the expression levels and altered phosphorylation patterns of Pyk-2, pp60src and p42/p44 MAP kinases between pMTH1-U937 and asCD11b-U937 following TPA exposure which was also substantiated by Pyk-2 immunoprecipitation. These findings suggested that induced adherence predominantly mediated by a functional CD11b/CD18 integrin in U937 cells is involved in the activation of downstream signaling kinases and contributes to cell cycle regulation and apoptosis during monocytic maturation.","['Otte, Anna', 'Mandel, Katharina', 'Reinstrom, Gesche', 'Hass, Ralf']","['Otte A', 'Mandel K', 'Reinstrom G', 'Hass R']","['Biochemistry and Tumor Biology Lab, Gynecology Research Unit, Dept, of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Medical University, Hannover, Germany. hass.ralf@mh-hannover.de.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110922,England,Cell Commun Signal,Cell communication and signaling : CCS,101170464,,,,PMC3191470,2011/09/24 06:00,2011/09/24 06:01,['2011/09/24 06:00'],"['2011/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/24 06:01 [medline]']","['1478-811X-9-20 [pii]', '10.1186/1478-811X-9-20 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Commun Signal. 2011 Sep 22;9:20. doi: 10.1186/1478-811X-9-20.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinically, FA is associated with high risk for marrow failure, leukemia and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Radiosensitivity in FA patients compromises the use of total-body irradiation for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and radiation therapy for HNSCC. A radioprotector for the surrounding tissue would therefore be very valuable during radiotherapy for HNSCC. Clonogenic radiation survival curves were determined for pre- or postirradiation treatment with the parent nitroxide Tempol or JP4-039 in cells of four FA patient-derived cell lines and two transgene-corrected subclonal lines. FancG(-/-) (PD326) and FancD2(-/-) (PD20F) patient lines were more sensitive to the DNA crosslinking agent mitomycin C (MMC) than their transgene-restored subclonal cell lines (both P < 0.0001). FancD2(-/-) cells were more radiosensitive than the transgene restored subclonal cell line (n = 2.0 +/- 0.7 and 4.7 +/- 2.2, respectively, P = 0.03). In contrast, FancG(-/-) cells were radioresistant relative to the transgene-restored subclonal cell line (n = 9.4 +/- 1.5 and 2.2 +/- 05, respectively, P = 0.001). DNA strand breaks measured by the comet assay correlated with radiosensitivity. Cell lines from a Fanc-C and Fanc-A patients showed radiosensitivity similar to that of Fanc-D2(-/-) cells. A fluorophore-tagged JP4-039 (BODIPY-FL) analog targeted the mitochondria of the cell lines. Preirradiation or postirradiation treatment with JP4-039 at a lower concentration than Tempol significantly increased the radioresistance and stabilized the antioxidant stores of all cell lines. Tempol increased the toxicity of MMC in FancD2(-/-) cells.

The purpose was to determine if early intervention can prevent declines in mathematics abilities. PROCEDURES: Fifty-seven children with ALL were enrolled and randomized to a Mathematics Intervention or Standard Care. Subjects completed neurocognitive assessments prior to the intervention, post-intervention, and 1 year later. Parents received written results and recommendations for use with their school. The Mathematics Intervention was based on Multiple Representation Theory and delivered individually over 1 year. RESULTS: Thirty-two of 57 subjects completed the study and were included in data analyses. These 32 subjects completed all neurocognitive assessments and, for those in the Intervention Group, 40-50 hours of the Mathematics Intervention. There were no group differences on relevant demographic variables; risk stratification; number of intrathecal methotrexate injections; or high dose systemic methotrexate. Significant improvements in calculation and applied mathematics from Baseline to Post-Intervention (P = 0.003 and 0.002, respectively) and in visual working memory from Baseline to 1 year Follow-up (P = 0.02) were observed in the Intervention but not the Standard Care Group.

The proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) play an important role in cell proliferation, survival, and resistance to glucocorticoid-mediated cell death. Several transcription factors such as NF-KB and AP-1 are activated in response to physiopathological increases and modulation of intracellular calcium levels. Our previous study demonstrated that lymphocytes from CML patients showed dysregulated calcium homeostasis and oxidative stress. Alteration in ionized calcium concentration in the cytosol has been implicated in the initiation of secretion, contraction, and cell proliferation. In this study, we hypothesized that IL-6, IL-8, NF-kB, AP-1, and intracellular calcium may be used as selective and prognostic factors to address the follow-up in CML patients treated with imatinib. Our results demonstrated a significant down-regulation in IL-6 and IL-8 release as well as NF-kB and AP-1 activation in lymphomonocytes from Imatinib-treated patients, compared to samples from untreated patients. In parallel, IM treatment, in vivo and in vitro, were able to modulate the intracellular calcium concentration of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of CML patients by acting at the level of InsP(3) receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum and at the level of the purinergic receptors on plasma membrane. The results of this study show that measurements of NF-kB, AP-1, IL-6, IL-8, and intracellular calcium in CML patients treated with Imatinib may give important information to the hematologist on diagnostic criteria and are highly predictive in patients with newly diagnosed CML.","['Ciarcia, Roberto', 'Vitiello, Maria Teresa', 'Galdiero, Massimiliano', 'Pacilio, Carmen', 'Iovane, Valentina', ""d'Angelo, Danila"", 'Pagnini, David', 'Caparrotti, Giuseppe', 'Conti, Daniele', 'Tomei, Valentina', 'Florio, Salvatore', 'Giordano, Antonio']","['Ciarcia R', 'Vitiello MT', 'Galdiero M', 'Pacilio C', 'Iovane V', ""d'Angelo D"", 'Pagnini D', 'Caparrotti G', 'Conti D', 'Tomei V', 'Florio S', 'Giordano A']","['Department of Structures, Functions and Biological Technologies, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Naples Federico II Naples, Italy. roberto.ciarcia@unina.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CXCL8 protein, human)', '0 (IL6 protein, human)', '0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/drug effects/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors/drug effects/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-8/*metabolism', 'Italy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/immunology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects/enzymology/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Purinergic/drug effects/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2011/09/23 06:00,2012/04/20 06:00,['2011/09/23 06:00'],"['2011/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.23029 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2012 Jun;227(6):2798-803. doi: 10.1002/jcp.23029.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,['Lancet Respir Med. 2021 Sep;9(9):939-941.

METHODS: Siglec-8 mRNA and cell surface expression was monitored during in vitro maturation of human eosinophils and mast cells. Flow cytometry was performed on human blood and bone marrow samples, and on blood samples from dogs, baboons, and rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys. RESULTS: Siglec-8 is a late maturation marker. It is detectable on eosinophils and basophils from subjects with chronic eosinophilic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and on malignant and non-malignant bone marrow mast cells, as well as the HMC-1.2 cell line. None of the Siglec-8 monoclonal antibodies tested recognized leukocytes from dogs, baboons, and rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys. CONCLUSIONS: Siglec-8-based therapies should not target immature human leukocytes but should recognize mature and malignant eosinophils, mast cells, and basophils.

To facilitate the optimization of DCs-based vaccination protocols, we investigated the efficiency of in vitro generation of DCs from bone marrow mononuclear cells of CML patients by clinical reagents of GM-CSF and IFN-alpha. Bone marrow mononuclear cells were isolated from eight CML patients and CML-DCs were generated in the presence of different cytokines (Group A: GM-CSF for research and IL-4 for research; Group B: GM-CSF for injection and IFN-alpha for injection) in RMPI-1640 medium containing 10% human AB serum. After 8 days, the morphologic features of CML-DCs were observed and their immunophenotypes were analyzed by flow cytometry. The activity of CML-DCs was determined by evaluating their ability to stimulate allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction (allo-MLR) and anti-leukemic cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). The culture protocols were successful in generating functional CML-DCs from all the CML patients as evidenced by the significant upregulation of CD80, CD86, CD83 HLA-DR and CD1a compared to pre-cultured (p < 0.05), and increased allogeneic T cell stimulating proliferation capacity (p < 0.05). CML-DCs could stimulate a specific anti-leukemia response. In summary, we demonstrate that the combination of clinical reagents GM-CSF and IFN-alpha induced the generation of DCs that have the ability to stimulate a specific anti-leukemia CTLs response in vitro, indicating their feasibility for clinical vaccination protocols for CML patients.","['Weng, Kaizhi', 'Xie, Xiaobao', 'Qiu, Guoqiang', 'Gu, Weiying']","['Weng K', 'Xie X', 'Qiu G', 'Gu W']","[""Zhangzhou Municipal Hospital, Affiliated to Fujian Medical University, Zhangzhou, 363000, People's Republic of China, lqlrandywkz@163.com.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110922,United States,Cytotechnology,Cytotechnology,8807027,,,,PMC3261453,2011/09/23 06:00,2011/09/23 06:01,['2011/09/23 06:00'],"['2011/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10616-011-9393-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytotechnology. 2012 Jan;64(1):75-81. doi: 10.1007/s10616-011-9393-2.

In RUNX1-ETO(+) patient samples, differing classes of activating c-KIT receptor tyrosine kinase mutations have been observed. The most common (12%-48%) involves mutations, such as D816V, which occur in the tyrosine kinase domain, whereas another involves mutations within exon 8 in a region mediating receptor dimerization (2%-13% of cases). To test whether distinct subtypes of activating c-KIT mutations differ in their leukemogenic potential in association with RUNX1-ETO, we used a retroviral transduction/transplantation model to coexpress RUNX1-ETO with either c-Kit(D814V) or c-Kit(T417IDelta418-419) in murine hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells used to reconstitute lethally irradiated mice. Analysis of reconstituted animals showed that RUNX1-ETO;c-Kit(D814V) coexpression resulted in 3 nonoverlapping phenotypes. In 45% of animals, a transplantable AML of relatively short latency and frequent granulocytic sarcoma was noted. Other mice exhibited a rapidly fatal myeloproliferative phenotype (35%) or a lethal, short-latency pre-B-cell leukemia (20%). In contrast, RUNX1-ETO;c-Kit(T417IDelta418-419) coexpression promoted exclusively AML in a fraction (51%) of reconstituted mice. These observations indicate that c-Kit(D814V) promotes a more varied and aggressive leukemic phenotype than c-Kit(T417IDelta418-419), which may be the result of differing potencies of the activating c-Kit alleles.","['Nick, Heidi J', 'Kim, Hyung-Gyoon', 'Chang, Chia-Wei', 'Harris, Kevin W', 'Reddy, Vishnu', 'Klug, Christopher A']","['Nick HJ', 'Kim HG', 'Chang CW', 'Harris KW', 'Reddy V', 'Klug CA']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, AL 35294, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20110921,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Mutation', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics/metabolism', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic']",PMC3286215,2011/09/23 06:00,2012/04/04 06:00,['2011/09/23 06:00'],"['2011/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)46116-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-02-338228 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Feb 9;119(6):1522-31. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-02-338228.

We studied whether expression changes of more than 1600 ubiquitination related genes correlated with clinical outcome in 525 adult AML patients. High expression of one of these genes, BRE, was observed in 3% of the cases and predicted favorable prognosis independently of known prognostic factors (5-year overall survival: 57%). Remarkably, unsupervised expression profiling showed that 86% of high BRE-expressing patients were confined to a previously unrecognized cluster. High BRE expression was mutually exclusive with FLT3 ITD, CEBPA, IDH1, and IDH2 mutations, EVI1 overexpression, and favorable karyotypes. In contrast, high BRE expression co-occurred strongly with FAB M5 morphology and MLL-AF9 fusions. Within the group of MLL-AF9-positive patients, high BRE expression predicted superior survival, while normal BRE expression predicted extremely poor survival (5-year overall survival of 80% vs 0%, respectively, P = .0002). Both the co-occurrence of high BRE expression with MLL-AF9 and its prognostic impact were confirmed in an independent cohort of 436 AML patients. Thus, high BRE expression defines a novel subtype of adult AML characterized by a favorable prognosis. This work contributes to improved risk stratification in AML, especially among MLL-AF9-positive patients.","['Noordermeer, Sylvie M', 'Sanders, Mathijs A', 'Gilissen, Christian', 'Tonnissen, Evelyn', 'van der Heijden, Adrian', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Jansen, Joop H', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'van der Reijden, Bert A']","['Noordermeer SM', 'Sanders MA', 'Gilissen C', 'Tonnissen E', 'van der Heijden A', 'Dohner K', 'Bullinger L', 'Jansen JH', 'Valk PJ', 'van der Reijden BA']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Laboratory of Hematology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110921,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (BABAM2 protein, human)', '0 (MLL-AF9 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cohort Studies', 'Databases, Factual', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic Testing/methods/standards', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*mortality/therapy', 'Leukocytes/cytology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Ubiquitination/physiology']",,2011/09/23 06:00,2012/01/17 06:00,['2011/09/23 06:00'],"['2011/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40339-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-06-359182 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Nov 17;118(20):5613-21. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-06-359182.

To directly elucidate the requirement of GRP78 in leukemogenesis, we created a biallelic conditional knockout mouse model of GRP78 and PTEN in the hematopoietic system. Strikingly, heterozygous knockdown of GRP78 in PTEN null mice is sufficient to restore the hematopoietic stem cell population back to the normal percentage and suppress leukemic blast cell expansion. AKT/mTOR activation in PTEN null BM cells is potently inhibited by Grp78 heterozygosity, corresponding with suppression of the PI3K/AKT pathway by GRP78 knockdown in leukemia cell lines. This is the first demonstration that GRP78 is a critical effector of leukemia progression, at least in part through regulation of oncogenic PI3K/AKT signaling. In agreement with PI3K/AKT as an effector for cytosine arabinoside resistance in acute myeloid leukemia, overexpression of GRP78 renders human leukemic cells more resistant to cytosine arabinoside-induced apoptosis, whereas knockdown of GRP78 sensitizes them. These, coupled with the emerging association of elevated GRP78 expression in leukemic blasts of adult patients and early relapse in childhood leukemia, suggest that GRP78 is a novel therapeutic target for leukemia.","['Wey, Shiuan', 'Luo, Biquan', 'Tseng, Chun-Chih', 'Ni, Min', 'Zhou, Hui', 'Fu, Yong', 'Bhojwani, Deepa', 'Carroll, William L', 'Lee, Amy S']","['Wey S', 'Luo B', 'Tseng CC', 'Ni M', 'Zhou H', 'Fu Y', 'Bhojwani D', 'Carroll WL', 'Lee AS']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Los Angeles, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20110921,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Hspa5 protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Cre recombinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (Pten protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic System/*physiology', 'Integrases/metabolism', 'Leukemia/etiology/*mortality/*prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survival Rate']",PMC3265205,2011/09/23 06:00,2012/03/14 06:00,['2011/09/23 06:00'],"['2011/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40941-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-06-357384 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Jan 19;119(3):817-25. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-06-357384.

Increased PIM2 protein expression was associated with an aggressive clinical course in activated B-like-DLBCL patients. Pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of PIM2 revealed p4E-BP1(Thr37/46) and p4E-BP1(Ser65) as molecular biomarkers characteristic of PIM2 activity and indicated the involvement of PIM2 kinase in regulating mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1. The simultaneous genetic inhibition of all 3 PIM kinases induced changes in apoptosis and cell cycle.

Two major problems are related to what constitutes treatment versus disease-related cause of death and to TRM attribution (for example, death because of infection or hemorrhage). To address the former, we conducted a systematic review of randomized therapeutic pediatric acute leukemia and adult/pediatric acute promyelocytic leukemia trials and any study type focused on TRM in pediatric acute leukemia. We described definitions used for TRM. Sixty-six studies were included. Few therapeutic pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia studies (2/32, 6.3%) provided definitions for TRM, whereas more therapeutic pediatric AML studies (6/9, 66.7%) provided definitions. There was great heterogeneity in TRM classification. The authors of most studies relied on deaths during induction or in remission to delineate whether a death was TRM. However, 44.4% of therapeutic AML studies used death within a specific time frame to delineate TRM. We suggest that a consistent approach to defining and determining attribution for TRM in acute leukemia is an important future goal.

It has been suggested that FGFR1 proteins lose their ability to recruit Src kinase, an important mediator of FGFR1 signaling, as a result of the translocations that delete the extended FGFR substrate-2 (FRS2) interacting domain that Src binds. In this study, we report evidence that refutes this hypothesis and reinforces the notion that Src is a critical mediator of signaling from the FGFR1 chimeric fusion genes generated by translocation in SCLL. Src was constitutively active in BaF3 cells expressing exogenous FGFR1 chimeric kinases cultured in vitro as well as in T-cell or B-cell lymphomas they induced in vivo. Residual components of the FRS2-binding site retained in chimeric kinases that were generated by translocation were sufficient to interact with FRS2 and activate Src. The Src kinase inhibitor dasatinib killed transformed BaF3 cells and other established murine leukemia cell lines expressing chimeric FGFR1 kinases, significantly extending the survival of mice with SCLL syndrome. Our results indicated that Src kinase is pathogenically activated in lymphomagenesis induced by FGFR1 fusion genes, implying that Src kinase inhibitors may offer a useful option to treatment of FGFR1-associated myeloproliferative/lymphoma disorders.","['Ren, Mingqiang', 'Qin, Haiyan', 'Ren, Ruizhe', 'Tidwell, Josephine', 'Cowell, John K']","['Ren M', 'Qin H', 'Ren R', 'Tidwell J', 'Cowell JK']","['Georgia Health Sciences University School of Medicine, Augusta, Georgia, USA. mren@georgiahealth.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20110921,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FRS2alpha protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zmym2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FGFR1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Fgfr1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Bcr protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Death/genetics', 'Cell Growth Processes/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Dasatinib', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics', 'src-Family Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3228896,2011/09/23 06:00,2012/04/05 06:00,['2011/09/23 06:00'],"['2011/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/05 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-11-1109 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-1109 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2011 Dec 1;71(23):7312-22. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-1109.

In this study, we have compared transcriptional profiles of haematopoietic progenitors derived from hESCs at various developmental stages of a feeder- and serum-free differentiation method and show that the largest transcriptional changes occur during the first 4 days of differentiation. Data mining on the basis of molecular function revealed Rho-GTPase signalling as a key regulator of differentiation. Inhibition of this pathway resulted in a significant reduction in the numbers of emerging haematopoietic progenitors throughout the differentiation window, thereby uncovering a previously unappreciated role for Rho-GTPase signalling during human haematopoietic development. Our analysis indicated that SCL was the 11th most upregulated transcript during the first 4 days of the hESC differentiation process. Overexpression of SCL in hESCs promoted differentiation to meso-endodermal lineages, the emergence of haematopoietic and erythro-megakaryocytic progenitors and accelerated erythroid differentiation. Importantly, intrasplenic transplantation of SCL-overexpressing hESC-derived haematopoietic cells enhanced recovery from induced acute anaemia without significant cell engraftment, suggesting a paracrine-mediated effect.","['Yung, Sun', 'Ledran, Maria', 'Moreno-Gimeno, Inmaculada', 'Conesa, Ana', 'Montaner, David', 'Dopazo, Joaquin', 'Dimmick, Ian', 'Slater, Nicholas J', 'Marenah, Lamin', 'Real, Pedro J', 'Paraskevopoulou, Iliana', 'Bisbal, Viviana', 'Burks, Deborah', 'Santibanez-Koref, Mauro', 'Moreno, Ruben', 'Mountford, Joanne', 'Menendez, Pablo', 'Armstrong, Lyle', 'Lako, Majlinda']","['Yung S', 'Ledran M', 'Moreno-Gimeno I', 'Conesa A', 'Montaner D', 'Dopazo J', 'Dimmick I', 'Slater NJ', 'Marenah L', 'Real PJ', 'Paraskevopoulou I', 'Bisbal V', 'Burks D', 'Santibanez-Koref M', 'Moreno R', 'Mountford J', 'Menendez P', 'Armstrong L', 'Lako M']","['Institute of Genetic Medicine, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110921,England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Anemia, Hemolytic/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Erythroid Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology', 'Paracrine Communication/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcriptome/*genetics', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",,2011/09/23 06:00,2012/03/09 06:00,['2011/09/23 06:00'],"['2011/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/09 06:00 [medline]']","['ddr431 [pii]', '10.1093/hmg/ddr431 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 2011 Dec 15;20(24):4932-46. doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddr431.

Within the immature double-negative (DN; CD4(-)CD8(-)) thymocyte subpopulation, the DN1 subset contains the most primitive cells including the rare early T-cell progenitors (ETPs). In the present study, a human MCL1 transgene, under the control of its endogenous promoter, resulted in enlargement of an undistorted thymus in C57/BL6 mice. Enlargement occurred in females but not males, being seen at 1 month of age and maintained during progression into adulthood as the thymus underwent involution. The small DN1 subset was expanded disproportionally (ETPs increasing from approximately 0.016 to 0.03% of thymocytes), while more mature thymocytes were increased proportionally (1.5-fold) along with the stroma. DN1 cells from transgenic females exhibited increased viability with maintained proliferation, and their survival in primary culture was extended. Exposure of transgenic females to gamma-irradiation also revealed an expanded pool of radioresistant DN1 cells exhibiting increased viability. While the viability of DN1 cells from transgenic males was equivalent to that of their non-transgenic counterparts directly after harvest, it was enhanced in culture-suggesting that the effect of the transgene was suppressed in the in vivo environment of the male. Viability was increased in ETPs from transgenic females, but unchanged in more mature thymocytes, indicating that primitive cells were affected selectively. The MCL1 transgene thus increases the viability and pool size of primitive ETP/DN1 cells, promoting thymopoiesis and radioresistance in peripubescent females and into adulthood.","['Gui, Jingang', 'Morales, Amanda J', 'Maxey, Sophie E', 'Bessette, Katherine A', 'Ratcliffe, Nora R', 'Kelly, John A', 'Craig, Ruth W']","['Gui J', 'Morales AJ', 'Maxey SE', 'Bessette KA', 'Ratcliffe NR', 'Kelly JA', 'Craig RW']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH 03755, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110921,England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,"['0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Congenic', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/deficiency/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology', 'Thymocytes/*cytology/immunology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/*growth & development/immunology', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",PMC3182299,2011/09/23 06:00,2012/02/22 06:00,['2011/09/23 06:00'],"['2011/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [medline]']","['dxr073 [pii]', '10.1093/intimm/dxr073 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunol. 2011 Oct;23(10):647-59. doi: 10.1093/intimm/dxr073.

However, the fundamental mechanisms underlying how inflammation and joint destruction in RA develop and are sustained chronically remain largely unknown. Here, we show that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is the key mediator of both chronic inflammation and joint destruction in RA. We found that inflammatory cytokines highly expressed in RA patients, such as IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha and IL-6, activated STAT3 either directly or indirectly and in turn induced expression of IL-6 family cytokines, further activating STAT3 in murine osteoblastic and fibroblastic cells. STAT3 activation also induced expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), a cytokine essential for osteoclastogenesis, and STAT3 deficiency or pharmacological inhibition promoted significant reduction in expression of both IL-6 family cytokines and RANKL in vitro. STAT3 inhibition was also effective in treating an RA model, collagen-induced arthritis, in vivo through significant reduction in expression of IL-6 family cytokines and RANKL, inhibiting both inflammation and joint destruction. Leukemia inhibitory factor expression and STAT3 activation by IL-1beta were mainly promoted by IL-6 but still induced in IL-6-deficient cells. Thus, our data provide new insight into RA pathogenesis and provide evidence that inflammatory cytokines trigger a cytokine amplification loop via IL-6-STAT3 that promotes sustained inflammation and joint destruction.","['Mori, Tomoaki', 'Miyamoto, Takeshi', 'Yoshida, Hideyuki', 'Asakawa, Mayoko', 'Kawasumi, Miyuri', 'Kobayashi, Takashi', 'Morioka, Hideo', 'Chiba, Kazuhiro', 'Toyama, Yoshiaki', 'Yoshimura, Akihiko']","['Mori T', 'Miyamoto T', 'Yoshida H', 'Asakawa M', 'Kawasumi M', 'Kobayashi T', 'Morioka H', 'Chiba K', 'Toyama Y', 'Yoshimura A']","['Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinano-machi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110921,England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (RANK Ligand)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tnfsf11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '87LA6FU830 (tofacitinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arthritis, Experimental/drug therapy/*immunology/pathology', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/complications/drug therapy/*immunology/pathology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/immunology', 'Gene Expression/immunology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/complications/drug therapy/*immunology/pathology', 'Interleukin-1beta/adverse effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/*immunology/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Joints/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Osteoclasts/drug effects/immunology', 'Piperidines', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'RANK Ligand/antagonists & inhibitors/*immunology/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/deficiency/genetics/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/adverse effects/immunology/metabolism']",,2011/09/23 06:00,2012/02/10 06:00,['2011/09/23 06:00'],"['2011/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/10 06:00 [medline]']","['dxr077 [pii]', '10.1093/intimm/dxr077 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunol. 2011 Nov;23(11):701-12. doi: 10.1093/intimm/dxr077.

It consists of an N-terminal FG-rich portion of the nucleoporin NUP98 fused to the homeodomain region of the homeobox protein HOXA9, and acts as an aberrant transcription factor. To identify interacting partners of NUP98-HOXA9, we used a cytoplasmic yeast two-hybrid assay to avoid the nonspecific trans-activation that would occur with the traditional yeast two-hybrid assay due to the transactivating properties of NUP98-HOXA9. We identified amino-terminal enhancer of split (AES), a transcriptional regulator of the transducin-like enhancer/Groucho family as a novel interaction partner of NUP98-HOXA9. The interaction was confirmed by in vitro pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation assays and was shown to require the FG repeat region of NUP98-HOXA9. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that AES localizes primarily to the interior of the nucleus. AES also showed a strong interaction with wild-type NUP98. AES augmented the transcriptional activity of NUP98-HOXA9. In the presence of NUP98-HOXA9, AES caused an increase in long-term proliferation of primary human CD34+ cells with a marked increase in the numbers of primitive cells. These effects of AES were not observed in the absence of NUP98-HOXA9. AES knockdown diminished the transcriptional and proliferative effects of NUP98-HOXA9. AES caused a shift away from the erythroid lineage in cells expressing NUP98-HOXA9. These data establish AES as an interacting partner of NUP98-HOXA9 and show that it cooperates with NUP98-HOXA9 in transcriptional regulation and cell transformation.","['Sarma, Nayan J', 'Yaseen, Nabeel R']","['Sarma NJ', 'Yaseen NR']","['Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20110921,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (NUP98-HOXA9 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Nup98 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TLE5 protein, human)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",PMC3234724,2011/09/23 06:00,2011/12/28 06:00,['2011/09/23 06:00'],"['2011/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)50558-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M111.297952 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 Nov 11;286(45):38989-9001. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.297952.

The aim of the present study was to determine whether patients with a familial aggregation of hematological malignancies harbor germline perforin gene mutations. For this purpose, 81 unrelated families from Tunisia and France with aggregated hematological malignancies were investigated. The variants detected in the PRF1 coding region amounted to 3.7% (3/81). Two of the three variants identified were previously described: the p.Ala91Val pathogenic mutation and the p.Asn252Ser polymorphism. A new p.Ala 211Val missense substitution was identified in two related Tunisian patients. In order to assess the pathogenicity of this new variation, bioinformatic tools were used to predict its effects on the perforin protein structure and at the mRNA level.

Due to its rarity, these two cytogenetic subgroups are generally included in the hyperdiploid group (model # > 51). Therefore separate informations about these two subgroups are limited to a few reports. Some studies found that near-tetraploidy is relatively more frequent in higher median ages and it is associated to Frech-American-British Classification subtype L2. Although the mechanisms by which leukemic blast cells divide is still unclear, studies have suggested that hyperdiploidy, near-triploidy and near-tetraploidy do not seem to share the same mechanism. FINDINGS: Herewith, we present a new childhood T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia case of near-tetraploid karyotype with loss of two p53-gene copies, characterized in detail by cytogenetic and molecular studies. CONCLUSION: We suggest that p53 is a good target gene to be screened, once p53 is one of the main effectors of cell cycle checkpoints.","['Garcia, Daniela Rn', 'Bhatt, Samarth', 'Manvelyan, Marina', 'de Souza, Mariana T', 'Binato, Renata', 'Aguiar, Thais F', 'Abdelhay, Eliana', 'Silva, Maria Luiza M']","['Garcia DR', 'Bhatt S', 'Manvelyan M', 'de Souza MT', 'Binato R', 'Aguiar TF', 'Abdelhay E', 'Silva ML']","['Cytogenetics Department, Bone Marrow Unit (CEMO), The National Cancer Institute (INCA), Praca da Cruz Vermalha, 23, 6th floor, Centro, 20,230-130, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil. luizamacedo@inca.gov.br.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110921,England,Mol Cytogenet,Molecular cytogenetics,101317942,,,,PMC3197555,2011/09/23 06:00,2011/09/23 06:01,['2011/09/23 06:00'],"['2011/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/23 06:01 [medline]']","['1755-8166-4-20 [pii]', '10.1186/1755-8166-4-20 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cytogenet. 2011 Sep 21;4(1):20. doi: 10.1186/1755-8166-4-20.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the exact aetiology is poorly understood, there is evidence to suggest that both genetic and environmental factors are involved in AA pathogenesis. OBJECTIVES: To analyse DNA methylation and histone modification patterns in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with AA. METHODS: PBMC samples were obtained from 25 patients with AA and 20 healthy controls. Global DNA methylcytosine levels, as well as histone acetylation and methylation levels, were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. mRNA expression levels were determined using real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Genomic DNA methylation in PBMCs of patients with AA was increased relative to controls. DNMT1, MBD1 and MBD4 expression levels were significantly higher in AA PBMCs than in controls, and DNMT1 transcription levels positively correlated with global DNA methylation levels in patient samples. Histone H3 acetylation was significantly increased and histone H3 lysine 4 methylation was significantly decreased in patient PBMCs compared with healthy controls. Histone H3 acetylation levels were positively correlated with AA disease severity, and with RANTES (CCL5) mRNA expression in PBMCs of patients with AA. These changes were accompanied by increased p300 (EP300), histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), myeloid/lymphoid or mixed lineage leukemia (MLL), SET7/9 (SETD7), G9A (EHMT2), JMJD2C (KDM4C) and JARID1A (KDM5A) expression, as well as reduced HDAC2, HDAC7, LSD1 (KDM1A), JMJD2A (KDM4A) and JMJD2B (KDM4B) expression. CONCLUSIONS: DNA methylation and histone modification status are altered in PBMCs of patients with AA, possibly due to the deregulation of epigenetic regulatory genes. These changes may contribute to the activation of pathological immune responses in AA.","['Zhao, M', 'Liang, G', 'Wu, X', 'Wang, S', 'Zhang, P', 'Su, Y', 'Yin, H', 'Tan, Y', 'Zhang, J', 'Lu, Q']","['Zhao M', 'Liang G', 'Wu X', 'Wang S', 'Zhang P', 'Su Y', 'Yin H', 'Tan Y', 'Zhang J', 'Lu Q']","['Hunan Key Laboratory of Medical Epigenomics, Department of Dermatology, Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, 139 Renmin Middle Road, Changsha, Hunan 410011, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120109,England,Br J Dermatol,The British journal of dermatology,0004041,"['0 (Chemokine CCL5)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA-Cytosine Methylases)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Histone Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alopecia Areata/*genetics/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chemokine CCL5/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'DNA-Cytosine Methylases/metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genes, Modifier/genetics', 'Genes, Regulator/*genetics', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Histone Demethylases/metabolism', 'Histone Methyltransferases', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/metabolism', 'Histones/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*physiology', 'Male', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",,2011/09/23 06:00,2012/03/28 06:00,['2011/09/23 06:00'],"['2011/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2133.2011.10646.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Dermatol. 2012 Feb;166(2):226-73. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2011.10646.x.

This often involves targeting the protein-protein interactions of regulatory multiprotein assemblies. Protein-protein interfaces are widely recognized to be challenging targets as they tend to be large and relatively flat, and therefore usually do not have the concave binding sites that characterize the so-called 'druggable genome'. One such prototypic multiprotein target is the Notch transcription complex, where an extensive network of protein-protein interactions stabilize the ternary complex comprising the ankyrin domain, CSL (CBF1/suppressor of Hairless/Lag-1) and MAML (Mastermind-like). Enhanced Notch activity is implicated in the development of T-ALL (T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia) and selective inhibitors of Notch would be useful cancer medicines. In the present paper, we describe a fragment-based approach to explore the druggability of the ankyrin domain. Using biophysical methods and X-ray crystal structure analyses, we demonstrate that molecules can bind to the surface of the ankyrin domain at the interface region with CSL and MAML. We show that they probably represent starting points for designing larger compounds that can inhibit important protein-protein interactions that stabilize the Notch complex. Given the relatively featureless topography of the ankyrin domain, this unexpected development should encourage others to explore the druggability of such challenging multiprotein systems using fragment-based approaches.","['Abdel-Rahman, Noha', 'Martinez-Arias, Alfonso', 'Blundell, Tom L']","['Abdel-Rahman N', 'Martinez-Arias A', 'Blundell TL']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1GA, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biochem Soc Trans,Biochemical Society transactions,7506897,"['0 (Ankyrins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Ankyrins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Dimerization', '*Drug Design', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Structure', 'Peptide Fragments/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', '*Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptor, Notch1/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,2011/09/23 06:00,2012/01/18 06:00,['2011/09/23 06:00'],"['2011/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['BST0391327 [pii]', '10.1042/BST0391327 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Soc Trans. 2011 Oct;39(5):1327-33. doi: 10.1042/BST0391327.,,,,['079281/Z/06/Z/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The function of the GPCRs cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLT1) and CysLT2 remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that in CLL and normal B lymphocytes, CysLT1 mRNA is consistently expressed, in contrast to low CysLT2 levels. Similar to the CXCR4 ligand CXCL12, the cysteinyl leukotriene (cysLT) LTD(4) induces calcium fluxes, actin polymerization, and chemotaxis. These effects are blocked by specific CysLT1 antagonists. Their inhibition by pertussis toxin suggests Gialpha/o protein involvement. Furthermore, CysLT1 mediates MAP-kinase phosphorylation, which implicates contribution of cysLT to survival. Indeed, CysLT1 antagonists induce apoptosis and reduce viability independent of Galphai/o protein signaling. Considering the production of cysLTs in the bone marrow, our data suggest that CysLT1 induces chemokine-like effects, supports accumulation and survival of CLL cells in the bone marrow and thus represents a potential treatment target.","['Drost, Adriana C', 'Seitz, Gabriele', 'Boehmler, Andreas', 'Funk, Mirjam', 'Norz, Karoline Pia', 'Zipfel, Anne', 'Xue, Xingkui', 'Kanz, Lothar', 'Mohle, Robert']","['Drost AC', 'Seitz G', 'Boehmler A', 'Funk M', 'Norz KP', 'Zipfel A', 'Xue X', 'Kanz L', 'Mohle R']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, Rheumatology, Clinical Immunology and Pulmology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany. adriana.drost@med.uni-tuebingen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Acetophenones)', '0 (Actins)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Leukotriene Antagonists)', '0 (Leukotrienes)', '0 (Propionates)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (Receptors, Leukotriene)', '0 (Tetrazoles)', '0 (cysteinyl-leukotriene)', '5Q9O54P0H7 (verlukast)', '73836-78-9 (Leukotriene D4)', '88107-10-2 (LY 171883)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)', 'LRF7RW46ID (leukotriene D4 receptor)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Acetophenones/pharmacology', 'Actins/metabolism', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chemokines/pharmacology', 'Chemotaxis/drug effects', 'Cysteine/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukotriene Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Leukotriene D4/*pharmacology', 'Leukotrienes/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Propionates/pharmacology', 'Quinolines/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Leukotriene/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tetrazoles/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2011/09/23 06:00,2012/08/24 06:00,['2011/09/23 06:00'],"['2011/09/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.625578 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2012 Apr;53(4):665-73. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.625578.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the apoptotic effects of piceatannol and myricetin, naturally occurring polyphenols in red wine, alone or in combination, in two human cell lines: HL-60 (leukemia) and HepG2 (hepatoma). Apoptotic cells were identified by chromatin condensation, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and flow cytometry analysis. Results from TUNEL assay showed that piceatannol or myricetin alone induced apoptotic cell death in a concentration- and time-dependent manners in HL-60 cells. Furthermore, in combined treatment the percentage of apoptotic HL-60 cells was significantly higher. Nevertheless, the percentage of TUNEL positive HepG2 cells only was significant after piceatannol treatment and in combined treatment was even lower than in cells treated with piceatannol alone. Moreover, we also studied the relative reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Our results indicate that apoptosis induced by piceatannol or myricetin occurs through an ROS-independent cell death pathway. In conclusion, piceatannol and myricetin synergistically induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells but not in HepG2 cells. These findings suggest that the potential anticarcinogenic properties of dietary polyphenols depend largely on the cell line used. The relevance of these data needs to be verified in human epidemiological studies.","['Morales, Paloma', 'Haza, Ana I']","['Morales P', 'Haza AI']","['Departamento de Nutricion, Bromatologia y Tecnologia de los Alimentos, Facultad de Veterinaria, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, 28040, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110920,England,J Appl Toxicol,Journal of applied toxicology : JAT,8109495,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Polyphenols)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Stilbenes)', ""6KS3LS0D4F (3,3',4,5'-tetrahydroxystilbene)"", '76XC01FTOJ (myricetin)']",IM,"['Anticarcinogenic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Flavonoids/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Polyphenols/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Stilbenes/administration & dosage/*pharmacology']",,2011/09/22 06:00,2013/03/26 06:00,['2011/09/22 06:00'],"['2011/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/15 00:00 [revised]', '2011/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jat.1725 [doi]'],ppublish,J Appl Toxicol. 2012 Dec;32(12):986-93. doi: 10.1002/jat.1725.

Ectopic expression of dominant-negative Tcf-4 mutant significantly attenuates Jab1 expression while over-expression of beta-catenin and STAT1 cooperatively up-regulates Jab1 promoter activity and mRNA expression. Our results also demonstrate that the AKT signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of Jab1 by Bcr-Abl because the AKT inhibitor LY294002 but not the ERK inhibitor PD98059 reduces Jab1 promoter activity and mRNA expression. Taken together, our results suggest that Bcr-Abl stimulates Jab1 expression via the cooperative interaction of beta-catenin and STAT1 in leukemia cells.","['Yang, Kuei-Ting', 'Wang, Ming-Chung', 'Chen, Jing-Yi', 'Hsu, Ming-Chuan', 'Hung, Wen-Chun']","['Yang KT', 'Wang MC', 'Chen JY', 'Hsu MC', 'Hung WC']","['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (TCF4 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor 4)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.4.-.- (COPS5 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (COP9 Signalosome Complex)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Benzamides', 'COP9 Signalosome Complex', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Peptide Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factor 4', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'beta Catenin/*metabolism']",,2011/09/22 06:00,2011/11/16 06:00,['2011/09/22 06:00'],"['2011/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.22633 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2011 Nov;226(11):2849-56. doi: 10.1002/jcp.22633.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

We have analyzed the outcome and prognostic value of karyotype in 84 adults diagnosed with Philadelphia-negative ALL from a single institution that received induction chemotherapy and had successful karyotype performed. The most frequent finding was normal karyotype in 35 (42%) cases, followed by aneuploidies in 20 cases (24%) and t(4;11)(q21;q23)/MLL/AF4 in 5 (6%), and the remaining 24(27%) cases carried miscellaneous clonal abnormalities. The group of patients with t(4;11)(q21;q23)/MLL/AF4, hypodiploidy and low hyperdiploidy (less than 50 chromosomes) showed a worse outcome than those with normal karyotype and miscellaneous abnormalities in terms of overall survival (OS) (3 years OS; 47% vs. 13%, p = 0.014) and relapse-free survival (RFS) (3 years RFS; 44% vs. 27%, p = 0.005).

In this study, we utilized a breast epithelial cell line lacking mitochondrial DNA (rho(0)) that exhibits the Warburg Effect associated with breast cancer. We developed a MitoExpress array for rapid analysis of all known nuclear genes encoding the mitochondrial proteome. The gene-expression pattern was compared among a normal breast epithelial cell line, its rho(0) derivative, breast cancer cell lines and primary breast tumors. Among several genes, our study revealed that over-expression of mitochondrial uncoupling protein UCP2 in rho(0) breast epithelial cells reflects gene expression changes in breast cancer cell lines and in primary breast tumors. Furthermore, over-expression of UCP2 was also found in leukemia, ovarian, bladder, esophagus, testicular, colorectal, kidney, pancreatic, lung and prostate tumors. Ectopic expression of UCP2 in MCF7 breast cancer cells led to a decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and increased tumorigenic properties as measured by cell migration, in vitro invasion and anchorage independent growth. Consistent with in vitro studies, we demonstrate that UCP2 over-expression leads to development of tumors in vivo in an orthotopic model of breast cancer. Genipin, a plant derived small molecule, suppressed the UCP2 led tumorigenic properties, which were mediated by decreased reactive oxygen species and down-regulation of UCP2. However, UCP1, 3, 4 and 5 gene expression was unaffected. UCP2 transcription was controlled by SMAD4. Together, these studies suggest a tumor-promoting function of UCP2 in breast cancer. In summary, our studies demonstrate that i) the Warburg Effect is mediated by UCP2; ii) UCP2 is over-expressed in breast and many other cancers; iii) UCP2 promotes tumorigenic properties in vitro and in vivo and iv) genipin suppresses the tumor promoting function of UCP2.","['Ayyasamy, Vanniarajan', 'Owens, Kjerstin M', 'Desouki, Mohamed Mokhtar', 'Liang, Ping', 'Bakin, Andrei', 'Thangaraj, Kumarasamy', 'Buchsbaum, Donald J', 'LoBuglio, Albert F', 'Singh, Keshav K']","['Ayyasamy V', 'Owens KM', 'Desouki MM', 'Liang P', 'Bakin A', 'Thangaraj K', 'Buchsbaum DJ', 'LoBuglio AF', 'Singh KK']","['Department of Cancer Genetics, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110915,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Ion Channels)', '0 (Iridoid Glycosides)', '0 (Iridoids)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Smad4 Protein)', '0 (UCP2 protein, human)', '0 (Uncoupling Protein 2)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'A3V2NE52YG (genipin)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Ion Channels/genetics/*metabolism', 'Iridoid Glycosides/*pharmacology', 'Iridoids', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Smad4 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Uncoupling Protein 2']",PMC3174207,2011/09/22 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/09/22 06:00'],"['2011/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0024792 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-08782 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(9):e24792. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0024792.

Previous research has identified most of the components that comprise the doxorubicin bioactivation network; however, adaptation of the network to changes in doxorubicin treatment or to patient-specific changes in network components is much less understood. To investigate the properties of the coupled reduction/oxidation reactions of the doxorubicin bioactivation network, we analyzed metabolic differences between two patient-derived acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines exhibiting varied doxorubicin sensitivities. We developed computational models that accurately predicted doxorubicin bioactivation in both ALL cell lines at high and low doxorubicin concentrations. Oxygen-dependent redox cycling promoted superoxide accumulation while NADPH-dependent reductive conversion promoted semiquinone doxorubicin. This fundamental switch in control is observed between doxorubicin sensitive and insensitive ALL cells and between high and low doxorubicin concentrations. We demonstrate that pharmacological intervention strategies can be employed to either enhance or impede doxorubicin cytotoxicity in ALL cells due to the switching that occurs between oxygen-dependent superoxide generation and NADPH-dependent doxorubicin semiquinone formation.","['Finn, Nnenna A', 'Findley, Harry W', 'Kemp, Melissa L']","['Finn NA', 'Findley HW', 'Kemp ML']","['Wallace H.

The study investigated patterns and trends in survival from childhood cancer in patients from northern England diagnosed 1968-2005. METHODS: Five-year survival was analysed using Kaplan-Meier estimation for four successive time periods. Cox regression analysis was used to explore associations with age and demographic factors. RESULTS: The study included 2958 cases (1659 males and 1299 females). Five-year survival for all cancers improved significantly from 39% in 1968-1977 to 79% in 1998-2005 (P<0.001). Five-year survival for leukaemia increased from 24% to 81% (P<0.001), lymphoma from 46% to 87% (P<0.001), central nervous system tumours from 43% to 73% (P<0.001), bone tumours from 21% to 75% (P<0.001), soft tissue sarcoma from 30% to 58% (P<0.001) and germ cell tumours from 59% to 97% (P<0.001). Survival was worse for cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (P<0.001) and astrocytoma (P<0.001) aged 10-14 years compared with 0-4-year olds. CONCLUSION: There were marked improvements in survival over a 38-year time span.

Here, we have identified an alternative mechanism of action for the proapoptotic chimeric peptide D-NuBCP-9-r8. Integral to D-NuBCP-9-r8 is the Nur-77-derived D-isoform sequence fsrslhsll that targets Bcl-2, and the cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) octaarginine (r8) that is required for intracellular delivery. We find that the N-terminal phenylalanine of fsrslhsll acts in synergy with the cell-penetrating moiety to enhance peptide uptake at low nontoxic levels and cause rapid membrane blebbing and cell necrosis at higher (IC(50)) concentrations. These effects were not observed when a single phenylalanine-alanine mutation was introduced at the N-terminus of D-NuBCP-9-r8. Using primary samples from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients and cancer cell lines, we show that NuBCP-9-r8 induced toxicity, via membrane disruption, is independent of Bcl-2 expression. Overall, this study demonstrates a new mechanism of action for this peptide and cautions its use as a highly specific entity for targeting Bcl-2. For delivery of therapeutic peptides the work emphasizes that key amino acids in cargo, located several residues away from the cell-penetrating sequence, can significantly influence their cellular uptake and mode of action.","['Watkins, Catherine L', 'Sayers, Edward J', 'Allender, Chris', 'Barrow, David', 'Fegan, Christopher', 'Brennan, Paul', 'Jones, Arwyn T']","['Watkins CL', 'Sayers EJ', 'Allender C', 'Barrow D', 'Fegan C', 'Brennan P', 'Jones AT']","['Welsh School of Pharmacy, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110920,United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,"['0 (Cell-Penetrating Peptides)', '0 (NR4A1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (phenylalanyl-seryl-arginyl-seryl-leucyl-histidyl-seryl-leucyl-leucine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', '*Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Cell-Penetrating Peptides/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tissue Distribution']",PMC3232455,2011/09/22 06:00,2012/03/23 06:00,['2011/09/22 06:00'],"['2011/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S1525-0016(16)32697-1 [pii]', '10.1038/mt.2011.175 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2011 Dec;19(12):2124-32. doi: 10.1038/mt.2011.175.

Bcr/Abl-positive K562 and Bcr/Abl-negative HL-60 human leukemia cells were used to investigate the effect of PRI-2191, a calcitriol analog, on the biological effects of imatinib combined with other anticancer drugs. The results show that PRI-2191 enhances the antiproliferative effect of imatinib on HL-60 cells. When these two agents together are applied with either docetaxel or cisplatin, but not with idarubicin, the antiproliferative effect could still be enhanced. Moreover, when the interaction between the chemotherapy agents was antagonistic or additive, PRI-2191 could even shift it to synergism. This effect correlated with an accumulation of HL-60 cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and a decrease in the percentage of cells in the G2/M and S stage in the ternary combinations used. PRI-2191 did not influence apoptosis induced by imatinib alone or in ternary combinations with all the chemotherapy agents used. These results may suggest that the stronger antiproliferative effect of the combined treatment with PRI-2191 on HL-60 cells is related to cell cycle arrest rather than to the induction of apoptosis.","['Switalska, Marta', 'Nasulewicz-Goldeman, Anna', 'Opolska, Aleksandra', 'Maciejewska, Magdalena', 'Kutner, Andrzej', 'Wietrzyk, Joanna']","['Switalska M', 'Nasulewicz-Goldeman A', 'Opolska A', 'Maciejewska M', 'Kutner A', 'Wietrzyk J']","['Ludwik Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy, Wroclaw, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Dihydroxycholecalciferols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Taxoids)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', '60965-80-2 (1 alpha,24-dihydroxyvitamin D3)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Dihydroxycholecalciferols/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Docetaxel', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells/drug effects', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Taxoids/administration & dosage']",,2011/09/22 06:00,2012/06/19 06:00,['2011/09/22 06:00'],"['2011/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CAD.0b013e32834b72de [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2012 Jan;23(1):70-80. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0b013e32834b72de.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since IL-6 plays an essential role in regulating growth and survival of multiple myeloma (MM) cells, methylation-associated dysregulation of SOCS3 may contribute to the malignant phenotype of MM cells. We used methylation-specific PCR (MSP) to assess the methylation status of the SOCS3 CpG island in five MM cell lines and 70 patient samples. Additional bisulfite sequencing and RNA expression analysis using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was performed in two cell lines. We identified aberrant SOCS3 methylation in 3/5 MM cell lines. Methylation of SOCS3 in cell lines was associated with transcriptional downregulation. Treatment of OPM-2 cells, which carry a methylated SOCS3 gene, with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored SOCS3 expression in association with partial demethylation. In patient samples with malignant plasma cell disorders, SOCS3 was methylated in 5/70 (7.1 %) cases, while there was no aberrant SOCS3 methylation in normal peripheral blood and non-malignant bone marrow cells. We found an association of SOCS3 methylation with extramedullary manifestations (p = 0.03), plasma cell leukemia (p = 0.003), elevated LDH (p = 0.001), increased creatinine ( p = 0.01) and remarkably shortened survival (6.9 vs. 56.1 months, HR 5.9, p = 0.0007). Our findings reveal a novel epigenetic event possibly implicated in the pathogenesis of MM and representing a potential prognostic biomarker. Epigenetic dysregulation of the SOCS3 gene may interfere with the cellular response to the complex cytokine network thus supporting survival and expansion of MM cells.","['Wilop, Stefan', 'van Gemmeren, Thomas B', 'Lentjes, Marjolein H F M', 'van Engeland, Manon', 'Herman, James G', 'Brummendorf, Tim H', 'Jost, Edgar', 'Galm, Oliver']","['Wilop S', 'van Gemmeren TB', 'Lentjes MH', 'van Engeland M', 'Herman JG', 'Brummendorf TH', 'Jost E', 'Galm O']","['Medizinische Klinik IV, Universitatsklinikum Aachen; RWTH Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110801,United States,Epigenetics,Epigenetics,101265293,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (SOCS3 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Azacitidine/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'CpG Islands/genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/*genetics']",,2011/09/22 06:00,2012/02/09 06:00,['2011/09/22 06:00'],"['2011/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['16167 [pii]', '10.4161/epi.6.8.16167 [doi]']",ppublish,Epigenetics. 2011 Aug;6(8):1047-52. doi: 10.4161/epi.6.8.16167.

Unlike this, alkylating chemotherapy is still a backbone of anti-myeloma drug treatment in the vast majority of 'medically fit' subjects. With the introduction of the immunomodulatory drugs thalidomide and lenalidomide, a novel class of compounds was integrated into therapy of multiple myeloma. Either drug may be delivered for a prolonged time; however fatigue, constipation and neuropathy prevent thalidomide from serving as a 'continuous' treatment. Lenalidomide has been approved for treatment of relapsed multiple myeloma, to be delivered as a continuous therapy. Since the drug lacks thalidomide's severe side effects, it is being explored on a continuous maintenance basis both after conventional therapy and after autologous stem cell transplantation. Preliminary data of respective clinical trials that have become available show highly significant differences in event-free survival times, favoring continuous lenalidomide over placebo. Currently, it is still unclear whether this will translate also into an overall survival benefit after prolonged follow-up.","['Knop, Stefan']",['Knop S'],"['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik II, Schwerpunkt Hamatologie und Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20110822,Switzerland,Onkologie,Onkologie,7808556,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Lenalidomide', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Thalidomide/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity']",,2011/09/22 06:00,2012/03/13 06:00,['2011/09/22 06:00'],"['2011/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['000331062 [pii]', '10.1159/000331062 [doi]']",ppublish,Onkologie. 2011;34(8-9):461-6. doi: 10.1159/000331062.

However, we could not find any correlation between bcr/abl activity and the BRIT1/MCPH1 level. In order to study the genomic instability of CML cells, we evaluated the ability of these cells to arrest mitotic division after exposure to hydroxyurea, a known genotoxic agent. We showed that CML cells continue to proliferate without the activation of the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint arrest or of the apoptotic mechanism.

Genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis was subsequently implemented as the first line diagnostic test for ID/CA patients in our laboratory in 2009, because its diagnostic yield is significantly higher than that of routine cytogenetic analysis. In addition to the detection of copy number variations, the genotype information obtained with SNP array analysis enables the detection of stretches of homozygosity and thereby the possible identification of recessive disease genes, mosaic aneuploidy, or uniparental disomy. Patient-parent (trio) information analysis is used to screen for the presence of any form of uniparental disomy in the patient and can determine the parental origin of a de novo copy number variation. Moreover, the outcome of a genotype analysis is used as a final quality control by ruling out potential sample mismatches due to non-paternity or sample mix-up. SNP array analysis is now also used in our laboratory for patients with disorders for which locus heterogeneity is known (homozygosity pre-screening), in prenatal diagnosis in case of structural ultrasound anomalies, and for patients with leukemia. In this report, we summarize our array findings and experiences in the various diagnostic applications and demonstrate the power of a SNP-based array platform for molecular karyotyping, because it not only significantly improves the diagnostic yield in both constitutional and cancer genome diagnostics, but it also enhances the quality of the diagnostic laboratory workflow.","['de Leeuw, N', 'Hehir-Kwa, J Y', 'Simons, A', 'Geurts van Kessel, A', 'Smeets, D F', 'Faas, B H W', 'Pfundt, R']","['de Leeuw N', 'Hehir-Kwa JY', 'Simons A', 'Geurts van Kessel A', 'Smeets DF', 'Faas BH', 'Pfundt R']","['Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands. n.deleeuw@antrg.umcn.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20110916,Switzerland,Cytogenet Genome Res,Cytogenetic and genome research,101142708,,IM,"['Comparative Genomic Hybridization/*methods/standards', 'Congenital Abnormalities/diagnosis/genetics', '*DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Intellectual Disability/diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods/standards', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Diagnosis/methods', 'Reference Values']",,2011/09/22 06:00,2012/01/31 06:00,['2011/09/22 06:00'],"['2011/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [medline]']","['000331273 [pii]', '10.1159/000331273 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytogenet Genome Res. 2011;135(3-4):212-21. doi: 10.1159/000331273.

The culture of multilineage cells from easily available adipose tissue is another source of multipotent mesenchymal stem cells, and is referred to as adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs). While ADSCs are being used to treat various conditions, some lacuna exists regarding the specific proteins in these. It was therefore decided to analyze the specific proteins of embryonic cells in ADSCs. AIMS: To analyze the specific protein of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in ADSCs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult human adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) were harvested from 13 patients after obtaining patients' consent. The specific markers of ESCs included surface proteins CD10, CD13, CD44, CD59, CD105, and CD166, and further nucleostemin, (NS) NANOG, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-ggamma, collagen type 1 (Coll1), alkaline phosphate, (ALP) osteocalcin (OC), and core binding factor 1 (Cbfa1) were analyzed using by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, (RT-PCR) immunofluorescence (IF), and western blot. RESULTS: All the proteins were expressed distinctly, except CD13 and OC. CD13 was found individually with different expressions, and OC expression was discernable. CONCLUSIONS: Although the ESC with its proven self-renewal capacity and pluripotency seems appropriate for clinical use, the recent work on ADSCs suggests that these adult stem cells would be a valuable source for future biotechnology, especially since there is a relative ease of procurement.","['Arumugam, Sarasa Bharati', 'Trentz, Omana A', 'Arikketh, Devi', 'Senthinathan, Vijayalakshmi', 'Rosario, Barry', 'Mohandas, P V A']","['Arumugam SB', 'Trentz OA', 'Arikketh D', 'Senthinathan V', 'Rosario B', 'Mohandas PV']","['Research, Training and Applications, MIOT Hospitals, 4/112, Mount Poonamallee Road, Manapakkam, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. sarasabharati@yahoo.co.in']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Indian J Pathol Microbiol,Indian journal of pathology & microbiology,7605904,['0 (Proteins)'],IM,"['Adipose Tissue/*cytology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*chemistry/*physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Proteins/*analysis']",,2011/09/22 06:00,2012/01/20 06:00,['2011/09/22 06:00'],"['2011/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/20 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJPatholMicrobiol_2011_54_3_501_85082 [pii]', '10.4103/0377-4929.85082 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Pathol Microbiol. 2011 Jul-Sep;54(3):501-8. doi: 10.4103/0377-4929.85082.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: The present study was aimed at evaluating the various clinical, biochemical and histological parameters in CrGN with respect to these categories and clinical outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Renal biopsies diagnosed as CrGN between Jan 2008 and Feb 2010 were included. Clinical and laboratory parameters were retrieved along with the therapeutic approach and clinical outcome, wherever available. Renal biopsy slides were evaluated for various glomerular, tubulo-interstitial and arteriolar features. Appropriate statistical tests were applied for significance. RESULTS: A total of 46 cases of CrGN were included; majority (71.7%) of cases were pauci-immune (PI) while 28.3% were immune complex-mediated (IC). Among clinical features, gender ratio was significantly different between PI and IC groups (P = 0.006). The various histological parameters, including proportion of cellular crescents, tuft necrosis and Bowman's capsule rupture, were similar in both the groups. Four unusual associations, including idiopathic membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), multibacillary leprosy, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and C1q nephropathy were detected. Adequate follow-up information was available in 21 (46%) of the patients. Of these, 11 (52.4%) were dialysis-dependent at the last follow-up. Adult patients required renal replacement therapy more frequently than pediatric cases (P = 0.05). Presence of arteriolar fibrinoid necrosis also showed association with poor clinical outcome (P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Crescentic glomerulonephritis remains one of the main causes of acute renal failure with histological diagnosis. Immunohistologic examination is essential for accurate classification into one of the three categories. This condition should be considered in rare causal associations like leprosy or MPGN with renal failure, to allow for timely performed renal biopsy and appropriate aggressive therapy.","['Gupta, Ruchika', 'Singh, Lavleen', 'Sharma, Alok', 'Bagga, Arvind', 'Agarwal, Sanjay K', 'Dinda, Amit K']","['Gupta R', 'Singh L', 'Sharma A', 'Bagga A', 'Agarwal SK', 'Dinda AK']","['Department of Pathology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Indian J Pathol Microbiol,Indian journal of pathology & microbiology,7605904,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody-Associated Vasculitis/pathology', 'Biopsy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dialysis', 'Female', 'Glomerular Basement Membrane/pathology', 'Glomerulonephritis/complications/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immune Complex Diseases/pathology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kidney/*pathology', 'Male', 'Microscopy', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Renal Insufficiency/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,2011/09/22 06:00,2012/01/20 06:00,['2011/09/22 06:00'],"['2011/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/20 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJPatholMicrobiol_2011_54_3_497_85081 [pii]', '10.4103/0377-4929.85081 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Pathol Microbiol. 2011 Jul-Sep;54(3):497-500. doi: 10.4103/0377-4929.85081.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, their relevance is limited owing to low number of cases, the use of selection criteria, and the lack of modern ancillary studies. We present a histopathological review of splenectomy specimens referred as a case of lymphoma to our center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical charts and laboratory data on all patients of all splenectomy specimens between the years 2003 and 2008 were reviewed. Morphological and immunohistochemical features were analyzed and the lymphomas were sub-typed in accordance to 2008 WHO Classification of Hematolymphoid Neoplasms. Flow cytometry immunophenotyping available in few cases was correlated. RESULTS: A total of 46 cases studied included splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) (19 cases), splenic diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (14 cases), splenic diffuse red pulp B-cell lymphoma (DRP) (five cases), follicular lymphoma (three cases), hairy cell leukemia (HCL) (two cases), HCL variant (HCLv) (1 case), 1 case of hepatosplenic gamma delta T-cell lymphoma (TCL), and 1 cases of TCL (not otherwise specified). CONCLUSIONS: Predominantly splenic lymphoma is a biologically heterogeneous entity, ranging from low-grade SMZL to high-grade DLBCLs. TCLs constituted only 4% of all our cases. DRP, HCL, and HCLv have similar diffuse red pulp patterns of splenic involvement and are differentiated based on flow cytometric immunophenotyping. We had a large number of splenic DLBCL and none of these involved bone marrow (BM), while all other lymphoma subtypes had BM involvement (stage IV disease).

MYC is deregulated in many human cancers, making its downstream target genes attractive candidates for drug development. We report the unexpected finding that B-cell lymphomas from mice and patients exhibit a striking correlation between high levels of Myc and checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: By in vitro cell biology studies as well as preclinical studies using a genetically engineered mouse model, we evaluated the role of Chk1 in Myc-overexpressing cells. RESULTS: We show that Myc indirectly induces Chek1 transcript and protein expression, independently of DNA damage response proteins such as ATM and p53. Importantly, we show that inhibition of Chk1, by either RNA interference or a novel highly selective small molecule inhibitor, results in caspase-dependent apoptosis that affects Myc-overexpressing cells in both in vitro and in vivo mouse models of B-cell lymphoma. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that Chk1 inhibitors should be further evaluated as potential drugs against Myc-driven malignancies such as certain B-cell lymphoma/leukemia, neuroblastoma, and some breast and lung cancers.","['Hoglund, Andreas', 'Nilsson, Lisa M', 'Muralidharan, Somsundar Veppil', 'Hasvold, Lisa A', 'Merta, Philip', 'Rudelius, Martina', 'Nikolova, Viktoriya', 'Keller, Ulrich', 'Nilsson, Jonas A']","['Hoglund A', 'Nilsson LM', 'Muralidharan SV', 'Hasvold LA', 'Merta P', 'Rudelius M', 'Nikolova V', 'Keller U', 'Nilsson JA']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110920,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Chek1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*metabolism']",,2011/09/22 06:00,2012/03/27 06:00,['2011/09/22 06:00'],"['2011/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-11-1198 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-1198 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2011 Nov 15;17(22):7067-79. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-1198.

Although the phenotype of these cells remains unclear in most patients, these cells are enriched within the CD34(+)CD38(low/-) compartment expressing the interleukin-3 alpha chain receptor, CD123. The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic value of the percentage of blasts with the CD34(+)CD38(low/-)CD123(+) phenotype. DESIGN AND METHODS: The percentage of CD34(+)CD38(low/-)CD123(+) cells in the blast population was determined at diagnosis using flow cytometry. One hundred and eleven patients under 65 years of age with de novo acute myeloid leukemia and treated with intensive chemotherapy were retrospectively included in the study. Correlations with complete response, disease-free survival and overall survival were evaluated with univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: A proportion of CD34(+)CD38(low/-)CD123(+) cells greater than 15% at diagnosis and an unfavorable karyotype were significantly correlated with a lack of complete response. By logistic regression analysis, a percentage of CD34(+)CD38(low/-)CD123(+) higher than 15% retained significance with an odds ratio of 0.33 (0.1-0.97; P=0.044). A greater than 1% population of CD34(+)CD38(low/-)CD123(+) cells negatively affected disease-free survival (0.9 versus 4.7 years; P<0.0001) and overall survival (1.25 years versus median not reached; P<0.0001). A greater than 1% population of CD34(+)CD38(low/-)CD123(+) cells retained prognostic significance for both parameters after multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of CD34(+)CD38(low/-)CD123(+) leukemic cells at diagnosis was significantly correlated with response to treatment and survival. This prognostic marker might be easily adopted in clinical practice to rapidly identify patients at risk of treatment failure.","['Vergez, Francois', 'Green, Alexa S', 'Tamburini, Jerome', 'Sarry, Jean-Emmanuel', 'Gaillard, Baptiste', 'Cornillet-Lefebvre, Pascale', 'Pannetier, Melanie', 'Neyret, Aymeric', 'Chapuis, Nicolas', 'Ifrah, Norbert', 'Dreyfus, Francois', 'Manenti, Stephane', 'Demur, Cecile', 'Delabesse, Eric', 'Lacombe, Catherine', 'Mayeux, Patrick', 'Bouscary, Didier', 'Recher, Christian', 'Bardet, Valerie']","['Vergez F', 'Green AS', 'Tamburini J', 'Sarry JE', 'Gaillard B', 'Cornillet-Lefebvre P', 'Pannetier M', 'Neyret A', 'Chapuis N', 'Ifrah N', 'Dreyfus F', 'Manenti S', 'Demur C', 'Delabesse E', 'Lacombe C', 'Mayeux P', 'Bouscary D', 'Recher C', 'Bardet V']","['Institut Cochin, Immuno-hematology Department, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110920,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (IL3RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*blood', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/*blood', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*blood', 'Blast Crisis/*blood/*diagnosis/mortality/therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/*diagnosis/mortality/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",PMC3232261,2011/09/22 06:00,2012/04/05 06:00,['2011/09/22 06:00'],"['2011/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/05 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.047894 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.047894 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2011 Dec;96(12):1792-8. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.047894.

DESIGN AND METHODS: After retro-orbital injection of 1,000 leukemic cells expressing Mixed Lineage Leukemia-Eleven Nineteen Leukemia fusion protein in non-conditioned syngenic mice, kinetics of leukemic burden and alterations of femoral hematopoietic populations were followed using an in vivo confocal imaging system and flow cytometry. RESULTS: Three days after injection, 5% of leukemic cells were found in femurs. Little proliferation of engrafted leukemic cells could then be detected for more than two weeks while the number of femoral leukemic cells remained stable. Twenty days after injection, leukemic cells preferentially proliferated in femoral diaphysis where they formed clusters on the surface of blood vessels and bone. B220(+) lymphoid cells were found near these leukemic cell clusters and this association is correlated with a decreased number of femoral B220(+)IgM(+) cells. Increasing the number of injected leukemic cells or conditioning recipient mice with gamma-irradiation resulted in leukemic cell development in diaphysis and knee. Competition experiments indicate that proliferation but not engraftment is a rate-limiting factor of leukemic cells spreading in diaphysis. Finally, 30 days after injection leukemia developed. CONCLUSIONS: After retro-orbital injection of 1,000 leukemic cells expressing Mixed Lineage Leukemia-Eleven Nineteen Leukemia into syngenic mice, leukemic cell burden preferentially initiates in femoral diaphysis and is preceded by changes of femoral B-lymphoid populations.","['Jaracz-Ros, Agnieszka', 'Lewandowski, Daniel', 'Barroca, Vilma', 'Lavau, Catherine', 'Romeo, Paul-Henri']","['Jaracz-Ros A', 'Lewandowski D', 'Barroca V', 'Lavau C', 'Romeo PH']","['CEA, iRCM, Laboratoire de recherche sur la, Reparation et la Transcription dans les cellules Souches, Fontenay-aux-Roses cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110920,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Mllt1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Diaphyses/metabolism/pathology', 'Femoral Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Femur/*metabolism/pathology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Burden/genetics']",PMC3232258,2011/09/22 06:00,2012/04/05 06:00,['2011/09/22 06:00'],"['2011/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/05 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.045153 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.045153 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2011 Dec;96(12):1770-8. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.045153.

We tested this hypothesis by changing from a double- to a single-unit red blood cell transfusion policy. DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study in patients with hematologic malignancies receiving intensive chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The major end-points were the reduction in the total number of red blood cell units per therapy cycle and per day of aplasia. The study comprised 139 patients who received 272 therapy cycles. Overall 2212 red blood cell units were administered in 1548 transfusions. RESULTS: During the periods of the double- and single-unit policies, one red blood cell unit was transfused in 25% and 84% of the cases and the median number of red blood cell units per transfusion was two and one, respectively. Single-unit transfusion led to a 25% reduction of red blood cell usage per therapy cycle and 24% per aplasia day, but was not associated with a higher out-patient transfusion frequency. In multivariate analysis, single-unit transfusion resulted in a reduction of 2.7 red blood cell units per treatment cycle (P = 0.001). The pre-transfusion hemoglobin levels were lower during the single-unit period (median 61 g/L versus 64 g/L) and more transfusions were administered to patients with hemoglobin values of 60 gl/L or less (47% versus 26%). There was no evidence of more severe bleeding or more platelet transfusions during the single-unit period and the overall survival was similar in both cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing a single-unit transfusion policy saves 25% of red blood cell units and, thereby, reduces the risks associated with allogeneic blood transfusions.","['Berger, Martin David', 'Gerber, Bernhard', 'Arn, Kornelius', 'Senn, Oliver', 'Schanz, Urs', 'Stussi, Georg']","['Berger MD', 'Gerber B', 'Arn K', 'Senn O', 'Schanz U', 'Stussi G']","['Clinic of Hematology, University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110920,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Blood Transfusion, Autologous', '*Erythrocyte Transfusion/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Medication Adherence', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC3248939,2011/09/22 06:00,2012/05/02 06:00,['2011/09/22 06:00'],"['2011/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.047035 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.047035 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Jan;97(1):116-22. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.047035.

Telomere length and telomerase levels have been proposed as prognostic factors; however, very few cases have been characterized for both parameters and no study has analyzed the prognostic value of the telomere/telomerase profile. DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred and seventy-three cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia were characterized for telomere lengths and telomerase levels by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Data were correlated with established prognostic markers, IGVH mutational status and chromosomal aberrations, and clinical outcome. RESULTS: Telomere lengths were inversely correlated with telomerase levels (r(s) = -0.213; P = 0.012), and most of the cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia with high levels (above median) of telomerase had short (below median) telomeres (P = 0.0001). Telomerase levels were higher and telomeres were shorter in unmutated IGVH cases than in mutated IGVH ones (P<0.0001). Chronic lymphocytic leukemias with 11q, 17p deletion or 12 trisomy had significantly higher levels of telomerase and shorter telomeres than those with no chromosomal aberration or the sole 13q deletion (P < 0.001). Telomere length/telomerase level profiles identified subgroups of patients with different clinical outcomes (P < 0.0001), even within the subsets of chronic lymphocytic leukemia defined by IGVH mutational status or chromosomal aberrations. Short telomere/high telomerase profile was independently associated with more rapid disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive analyses of telomeres, telomerase, chromosomal aberrations, and IGVH mutational status delineate groups of chronic lymphocytic leukemias with distinct biological characteristics and clinical outcomes. The telomere/telomerase profile may be particularly useful in refining the prognosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with mutated IGVH and no high-risk chromosomal aberrations.","['Rampazzo, Enrica', 'Bonaldi, Laura', 'Trentin, Livio', 'Visco, Carlo', 'Keppel, Sonia', 'Giunco, Silvia', 'Frezzato, Federica', 'Facco, Monica', 'Novella, Elisabetta', 'Giaretta, Ilaria', 'Del Bianco, Paola', 'Semenzato, Gianpietro', 'De Rossi, Anita']","['Rampazzo E', 'Bonaldi L', 'Trentin L', 'Visco C', 'Keppel S', 'Giunco S', 'Frezzato F', 'Facco M', 'Novella E', 'Giaretta I', 'Del Bianco P', 'Semenzato G', 'De Rossi A']","['Department of Oncology and Surgical Sciences, Oncology Section, University of Padova,Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110920,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/*genetics/*metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Telomerase/genetics/*metabolism', '*Telomere Homeostasis', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/metabolism']",PMC3248931,2011/09/22 06:00,2012/05/02 06:00,['2011/09/22 06:00'],"['2011/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.049874 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.049874 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Jan;97(1):56-63. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.049874.

The role of constitutional ATM mutations in the pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia is unknown. Here we investigated the frequency of constitutional ATM mutations in either of two chronic lymphocytic leukemia cohorts, those with and without a chromosome 11q deletion. We found that in comparison to controls, constitutional pathogenic ATM mutations were increased in patients with chromosome 11q deletions (6 of 140 vs. 0 of 281, P = 0.001) but not in those without 11q deletions (2 of 178 vs. 0 of 281, P = 0.15).

While its incidence is dramatically increasing worldwide, the disease is still associated with high morbidity due to ineffectiveness of conventional therapies, creating an urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches. Unconventional compounds, including polyphenols and the cytokine TRAIL, are being extensively studied for their capacity to restore apoptosis in a large number of tumors, including lymphomas. DESIGN AND METHODS: Molecular mechanisms of TRAIL-resistance and reactivation of the apoptotic machinery by quercetin in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cell lines were determined by Hoescht, flow cytometry, Western blot, qPCR, by use of siRNA or pharmacological inhibitors of the mitochondrial pathway and by immunoprecipitation followed by post-translational modification analysis. RESULTS: Results demonstrate that quercetin, a natural flavonoid, restores TRAIL-induced cell death in resistant transformed follicular lymphoma B-cell lines, despite high Bcl-2 expression levels due to the chromosomal translocation t(14;18). Quercetin rescues mitochondrial activation by inducing the proteasomal degradation of Mcl-1 and by inhibiting survivin expression at the mRNA level, irrespective of p53. Restoration of the TRAIL pathway requires Bax and Bak but is independent of enhanced TRAIL DISC formation. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that inactivation of survivin and Mcl-1 expression by quercetin is sufficient to restore TRAIL sensitivity in resistant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma B cells. Our results suggest, therefore, that combining quercetin with TRAIL treatments may be useful in the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.","['Jacquemin, Guillaume', 'Granci, Virginie', 'Gallouet, Anne Sophie', 'Lalaoui, Najoua', 'Morle, Aymeric', 'Iessi, Elisabetta', 'Morizot, Alexandre', 'Garrido, Carmen', 'Guillaudeux, Thierry', 'Micheau, Olivier']","['Jacquemin G', 'Granci V', 'Gallouet AS', 'Lalaoui N', 'Morle A', 'Iessi E', 'Morizot A', 'Garrido C', 'Guillaudeux T', 'Micheau O']","['INSERM, U866, Dijon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110920,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 10)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Caspase 10/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Quercetin/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Survivin', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",PMC3248929,2011/09/22 06:00,2012/05/02 06:00,['2011/09/22 06:00'],"['2011/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.046466 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.046466 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Jan;97(1):38-46. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.046466.

In the multi-center AML-BFM 98 study we prospectively evaluated the impact of allogeneic stem cell transplantation in children with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia in first complete remission. DESIGN AND METHODS: HLA-typed patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia, who achieved first complete remission (n = 247), were included in this analysis. All patients received double induction and consolidation. Based on the availability of a matched-sibling donor, patients were allocated by genetic chance to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (n = 61) or chemotherapy-only (i.e. intensification and maintenance therapy; n = 186). The main analysis was done on an intention-to-treat basis according to this allocation. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analysis did not show a significantly different 5-year disease-free survival (49 +/- 6% versus 45 +/- 4%, P(log rank) = 0.44) or overall survival (68 +/- 6% versus 57 +/- 4%, P(log rank) = 0.17) between the matched-sibling donor and no-matched-sibling donor groups, whereas late adverse effects occurred more frequently after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (72.5% versus 31.8%, P(Fischer)<0.01). These results were confirmed by as-treated analysis corrected for the time until transplantation (5-year overall survival: 72 +/- 8% versus 60 +/- 4%, P(Mantel-Byar) 0.21). Subgroup analysis demonstrated improved survival rates for patients with 11q23 aberrations allocated to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (5-year overall survival: 94 +/- 6% versus 52 +/- 7%, P(log-rank) = 0.01; n = 18 versus 49) in contrast to patients without 11q23 aberrations (5-year overall survival: 58 +/- 8% versus 55 +/- 5%, P(log-rank) = 0.66). CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses defined a genetic subgroup of children with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia who benefited from allogeneic stem cell transplantation in the prospective multi-center AML-BFM 98 study. For the remainder of the pediatric high-risk acute myeloid leukemia patients the prognosis was not improved by allogeneic stem cell transplantation, which was, however, associated with a higher rate of late sequelae.","['Klusmann, Jan-Henning', 'Reinhardt, Dirk', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Kremens, Bernhard', 'Vormoor, Josef', 'Dworzak, Michael', 'Creutzig, Ursula', 'Klingebiel, Thomas']","['Klusmann JH', 'Reinhardt D', 'Zimmermann M', 'Kremens B', 'Vormoor J', 'Dworzak M', 'Creutzig U', 'Klingebiel T']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology University Children's Hospital Albert-Schweitzer-Campus 1, 48149 Muenster, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110920,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/complications', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Remission Induction', 'Siblings', 'Survival Analysis', '*Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC3248927,2011/09/22 06:00,2012/05/02 06:00,['2011/09/22 06:00'],"['2011/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.051714 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.051714 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2012 Jan;97(1):21-9. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.051714.

We explored whether cells reported as minimal residual disease by flow cytometry represent the malignant clone harboring clone-specific genomic markers (53 follow-up bone marrow samples from 28 children with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia). Cell populations (presumed leukemic and non-leukemic) were flow-sorted during standard flow cytometry-based minimal residual disease monitoring and explored by PCR and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization. We found good concordance between flow cytometry and genomic analyses in the individual flow-sorted leukemic (93% true positive) and normal (93% true negative) cell populations. Four cases with discrepant results had plausible explanations (e.g. partly informative immunophenotype and antigen modulation) that highlight important methodological pitfalls.

DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured survivin and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in serum of 30 ALL patients before and after induction therapy and compared to 30 age and sex matched normal adults. RESULTS: Survivin at cutoff value 15.18 pg/mL was detected in all ALL patients before therapy but in only 83.33% after therapy and not detected in the control group; P<0.001. However TNF-alpha at cutoff value 60.05 pg/mL was detected in 90% ALL patients before therapy and 86.6% after therapy that was significantly higher than the control group (20%); P<0.001. Survivin showed a significant positive correlation with TNF-alpha (P<0.05), bone marrow blast cells (P<0.01), peripheral blast cells (P<0.05) and Philadelphia chromosome (P<0.01).

METHODS: We have previously isolated fetal liver kinase-1-positive (Flk1(+)) cells carrying the BCR/ABL fusion gene from the bone marrow of Ph(+) patients with hemangioblast property. In this study, we isolated CML patient-derived Flk1(+)CD31(-)CD34(-) mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and detected their biological characteristics and immunological regulation using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay, mixed lymphocyte reaction assays; then we compared these characters with those of the healthy donors. RESULTS: CML patient-derived Flk1(+)CD31(-)CD34(-) MSCs had normal morphology, phenotype and karyotype while appeared impaired in immuno-modulatory function. The capacity of patient Flk1(+)CD31(-)CD34(-) MSCs to inhibit T lymphocyte activation and proliferation was impaired in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: CML patient-derived MSCs have impaired immuno-modulatory functions, suggesting that the dysregulation of hematopoiesis and immune response may originate from MSCs rather than hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), the percentage of patients with abnormalities rises to almost 80%, among them, the most frequent abnormalities were 13q14, 11q22, p53 deletions and trisomy 12. The aim of this study was to explore the incidence of cytogenetic changes in Chinese patients with B-CLL. METHODS: We used FISH methods to detect the cytogenetic features in 275 cases of B-CLL from 48 hospitals. The correlation between FISH abnormalities and clinical characteristics such as age, gender, white blood cell count, peripheral hemoglobin (Hb) level, peripheral platelet count (PLT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, Rai stage, Binet stage, and overall survival was analyzed, and the relationship between them and overall survival was also analyzed to evaluate their prognostic implications. RESULTS: Of the 275 patients, genetic aberrations were found in 77.8% using FISH. The frequencies of abnormalities were as follows: 13q deletion (56.4%), trisomy 12 (34.5%), p53 deletion (33.5%) and 11q22 deletion (30.5%). It was obvious that the patients with p53 deletion had lower level of Hb (P = 0.001) and PLT (P = 0.003) when compared to patients without p53 deletion. Significant differences were obtained in the distribution of p53 deletion according to Rai and Binet classification systems (P = 0.016 and 0.008 respectively). Significant differences were also observed when the overall survival was correlated with p53 deletion (P = 0.043), Rai stage (P = 0.006), Binet stage (P = 0.013), Hb level (P = 0.004) and PLT level (P = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: Chinese CLL patients have the similar frequencies of del(13q), trisomy 12, del(11q) and a higher frequency of del(17p) when compared to literatures. Del(17p) is associated with advanced stage and low levels of Hb and PLT.

METHODS: Thirteen patients with leukemia received double-unit UCBT with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatched at 0 - 2 loci. We analyzed the engraftment, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and survival. RESULTS: Twelve evaluable patients (92.3%) had neutrophil and platelet engraftment at a median of 21 days (range, 16-38 days) and 34 days (range, 25 - 51 days), respectively. At day 30, engraftment was derived from one donor in 8 patients (66.7%, 95%CI 40.0% - 93.4%), and from both donors in 4 patients (33.3%, 95%CI 6.7% - 60.0%) with 1 unit predominated. Unit with larger nucleated cell (NC) dose would predominate in engraftment (P = 0.039), whereas CD34(+) cell dose or HLA-match failed to demonstrate any relationship with unit predominance. Only one patient developed grade II acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). Chronic GVHD (cGVHD) was observed in 2 of 11 patients who survived more than 100 days, and both were limited.

METHODS: According to the data from Shanghai CDC, 544 patients, with a median age of 32 years (ranging 1.2 - 89 years), were diagnosed as de novo ALL from January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2006, and they were followed up until December 31, 2007. RESULTS: The average annual incidence of ALL in Shanghai was 0.81/100 000. The incidence in men (0.86/100 000) was slightly higher than that in women (0.75/100 000). The age-stratified incidence showed that the incidence was 2.31/100 000 in patients >/= 17 years old, 0.54/100 000 in those 18 - 34 years old, 0.46/100 000 in those 35 - 59 years old, and 0.94/100 000 in those >/= 60 years old. Moreover, there were substantial geographic variations in the incidence of ALL, with the incidence in Chongming county, an island in the east of Shanghai city being 0.60/100 000, much lower than those of other districts. Both French-American-British (FAB) and World Health Organization (WHO) classification systems were applied in the present study. Eighty-eight patients were diagnosed as L1 (26.2%), 193 L2 (57.4%), and 55 L3 (16.4%). For 302 patients with immunophenotypic results, 242 were identified as B cell origin (80.1%), 59 as T cell origin (19.5%), and 1 as biphenotype (0.4%). The leukemia cells in 61 patients co-expressed one or two myeloid antigen (20.2%). For 269 patients with cytogenetic results, the incidences of t(9;22) in patients aged < 10, 11 - 17, 18 - 44, 45 - 59 and >/= 60 years old were 4.2%, 11.4%, 19.2%, 23.1% and 5.3%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Compared with the previous data, the incidence of ALL is increased in Shanghai, and has a geographic distribution characteristic.","['Ni, Xiong', 'Shen, Zhi-Xiang', 'Chen, Fang-Yuan', 'Liang, Hui', 'Lu, Feng-Juan', 'Chen, Jing', 'Wang, Chun', 'Shao, Jing-Bo', 'Hou, Jian', 'Zou, Shan-Hua', 'Wang, Jian-Min']","['Ni X', 'Shen ZX', 'Chen FY', 'Liang H', 'Lu FJ', 'Chen J', 'Wang C', 'Shao JB', 'Hou J', 'Zou SH', 'Wang JM']","['Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'China/epidemiology', 'Data Collection', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,2011/09/22 06:00,2012/04/28 06:00,['2011/09/22 06:00'],"['2011/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/28 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2011 Aug;124(16):2406-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Using the same oral rinse protocol, we studied neutrophil tissue delivery kinetics and its relationship to clinical parameters and outcomes following HSCT in 29 adult patients. Oral neutrophil counts were compared to circulating neutrophil levels, oral mucositis scores and patient health status at 6 months post-HSCT. RESULTS: Neutrophils were detected on average 8.4 +/- 3.4 SD days earlier in the oral tissues than in the blood circulation, enabling us to confirm successful engraftment more than one week earlier than when using blood neutrophil counts alone. As well, in this population the time-span between oral engraftment (OE) and blood engraftment (BE) was a consistent predictor of treatment outcome at 6 months following HSCT where a BE-OE of <6 days resulted in 100% of patients having a negative outcome. CONCLUSION: We conclude that monitoring the timing of neutrophil delivery to the oral tissues with a non-invasive oral rinse has the potential to allow the physician to identify those patients who are at a high risk of HSCT failure within just a few weeks of the initiation of treatment.","['Forster, Carol', 'Aboodi, Guy', 'Lipton, Jeff', 'Glogauer, Michael']","['Forster C', 'Aboodi G', 'Lipton J', 'Glogauer M']","['Matrix Dynamics Group, Dental Research Institute, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110920,Denmark,J Oral Pathol Med,Journal of oral pathology & medicine : official publication of the International Association of Oral Pathologists and the American Academy of Oral Pathology,8911934,['0 (Mouthwashes)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cytodiagnosis/*methods', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft Survival', 'Health Status', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/surgery', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphoma/surgery', 'Mouth Mucosa/*pathology', 'Mouthwashes/*administration & dosage', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/surgery', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/pathology', 'Neutrophils/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Stomatitis/classification/pathology', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2011/09/22 06:00,2012/07/21 06:00,['2011/09/22 06:00'],"['2011/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0714.2011.01076.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Oral Pathol Med. 2012 Feb;41(2):165-70. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0714.2011.01076.x.

Furthermore, previous studies addressing this issue have mainly focused on cases in which +21 was part of a complex karyotype. METHODS: We ascertained the incidence of +21, both as a sole change (T21s) and irrespective of additional changes (T21all), in relation to disease type, morphologic subgroup, gender, and age in all published AML, MDS, MPN, and MDS/MPN cases. Furthermore, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis was performed on 11 myeloid malignancies with T21s, followed by mutation analysis of the FGFR1, FLT3, GATA1, JAK2, KIT, NPM1, NRAS, RUNX1, and TET2 genes. RESULTS: The frequencies of T21s and/or T21all varied significantly among the AML, MDS, MPN, and MDS/MPN cases, among the AML and MPN subtypes, and in relation to the age of the AML, MDS, and MPN patients. In the 11 cases analyzed by SNP array, a total of nine genomic imbalances, comprising seven deletions and two duplications, were identified in six cases; none of the alterations were recurrent. Partial uniparental disomies (UPDs) were found in five cases; two recurrent UPDs were identified, namely UPD4q and UPD7q. Mutations in NPM1, RUNX1, and TET2 were detected in five cases, three of which harbored a pathogenic RUNX1 mutation. The TET2 mutation was found in one of the cases with UPD4q. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that trisomy 21-positive myeloid malignancies are clinically highly variable and that they display a heterogeneous pattern of copy number alterations and mutations.","['Larsson, Nina', 'Lilljebjorn, Henrik', 'Lassen, Carin', 'Johansson, Bertil', 'Fioretos, Thoas']","['Larsson N', 'Lilljebjorn H', 'Lassen C', 'Johansson B', 'Fioretos T']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, University and Regional Laboratories, Skane University Hospital, Lund University, Lund, Sweden. nina.larsson@med.lu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111117,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', '*Trisomy', 'Young Adult']",,2011/09/22 06:00,2012/03/10 06:00,['2011/09/22 06:00'],"['2011/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01710.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2012 Feb;88(2):136-43. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01710.x.

We investigated the potential of the multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib to relieve anaphylactic reactions in food allergy and systemic anaphylaxis. METHODS: Efficacy of oral sunitinib on oral and parenteral antigen-induced anaphylaxes in Balb/c mice was evaluated. IgE-dependent degranulation and growth of rat basophilic leukemia RBL2H3 and bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) in response to sunitinib were investigated. RESULTS: Daily administration of sunitinib throughout antigen challenges prevented oral antigen-induced anaphylaxis including diarrhea, anaphylactic symptoms, and hypothermia. The mouse mast cell protease (MMCP)-1 concentration in serum and mast cell number in intestinal tissue after challenge were also decreased by the treatment. Spleen cells from sunitinib-treated mice contained smaller numbers of antigen-specific IgG-producing cells and secreted lower amounts of both Th1 and Th2 cytokines than those of the control mice, whereas the levels of antigen-specific antibodies in serum were not decreased. The reactions and MMCP-1 release in oral antigen-induced anaphylaxis and passive systemic anaphylaxis were attenuated even by a single predose of sunitinib. Degranulation and growth of RBL2H3 cells and BMMCs were greatly reduced by sunitinib. CONCLUSION: These results suggested that sunitinib relieves systemic and oral antigen-induced anaphylaxes by the prevention of mast cell activation and hyperplasia in intestinal tissue directly and indirectly through an immunosuppressive effect. Sunitinib and its related kinase inhibitors might be potential drugs for the treatment of food allergy and systemic anaphylaxis.","['Yamaki, K', 'Yoshino, S']","['Yamaki K', 'Yoshino S']","['Department of Pharmacology, Kobe Pharmaceutical University, 4-19-1 Motoyamakita-machi, Higashinada-ku, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan. yam@kobepharma-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110921,Denmark,Allergy,Allergy,7804028,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrroles)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'V99T50803M (Sunitinib)']",IM,"['Anaphylaxis/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Animals', 'Antigens/adverse effects/immunology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Sunitinib']",,2011/09/22 06:00,2012/03/29 06:00,['2011/09/22 06:00'],"['2011/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1398-9995.2011.02717.x [doi]'],ppublish,Allergy. 2012 Jan;67(1):114-22. doi: 10.1111/j.1398-9995.2011.02717.x.

Recently, the cytometric bead array (CBA) system has been used to identify BCR-ABL proteins in leukemic cell lysates. To evaluate the accuracy of this new technique, we tested 70 patients with hematological diseases using the CBA system, cytogenetic analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR). Most of the results obtained by the CBA system were concordant with those by cytogenetic analysis, FISH and RQ-PCR. In the CBA system, dilution experiments with positive control samples revealed sensitivities of at least 1%. The statistical analysis revealed that the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values of the BCR-ABL fusion proteins from mononuclear cells (MNCs) were higher than those from WBC or BM samples. The MFI values of cells were not dramatically reduced after 24 hours of storage at room temperature. The CBA technique detected all types of BCR-ABL proteins in leukemic cells with high specificity and sensitivity. Therefore, CBAs will contribute to the fast and easy diagnosis of leukemias, the classification of leukemias and the monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD).","['Yujie, Wu', 'Yu, Zhu', 'Sixuan, Qian', 'Li, Wang', 'Peng, Liu', 'Zeng, Ge', 'Sujiang, Zhang', 'Jianyong, Li']","['Yujie W', 'Yu Z', 'Sixuan Q', 'Li W', 'Peng L', 'Zeng G', 'Sujiang Z', 'Jianyong L']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China. wuyujie123456@163.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20111128,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antibodies, Immobilized)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Antibodies, Immobilized', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis/blood/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/chemistry', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Direct/*methods', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis/blood/immunology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes/chemistry', 'Male', 'Microspheres', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/chemistry', 'Polycythemia Vera/blood/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specimen Handling', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/blood/genetics/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",,2011/09/22 06:00,2012/08/04 06:00,['2011/09/22 06:00'],"['2011/09/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.625100 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2012 Mar;53(3):451-5. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.625100.

Nevertheless, disparity in the ease with which different strains of mice yield ESC lines has long been acknowledged. Indeed, the generation of bona fide ESCs from the non obese diabetic (NOD) mouse, a well-characterized model of human type I diabetes, has historically proved especially difficult to achieve. Here, we report the development of protocols for the derivation of novel ESC lines from C57Bl/6 mice based on the combined use of high concentrations of leukemia inhibitory factor and serum-replacement, which is equally applicable to fresh and cryo-preserved embryos. Further, we demonstrate the success of this approach using Balb/K and CBA/Ca mice, widely considered to be refractory strains. CBA/Ca ESCs contributed to the somatic germ layers of chimeras and displayed a very high competence at germline transmission. Importantly, we were able to use the same protocol for the derivation of ESC lines from nonpermissive NOD mice. These ESCs displayed a normal karyotype that was robustly stable during long-term culture, were capable of forming teratomas in vivo and germline competent chimeras after injection into recipient blastocysts.

However, a causal relationship between XMRV and prostate cancer remains controversial due to conflicting reports on its etiologic occurrence. Even though gammaretroviruses are known to induce cancer in animals, a mechanism for XMRV-induced carcinogenesis remains unknown. Several mechanisms including insertional mutagenesis, proinflammatory effects, oncogenic viral proteins, immune suppression, and altered epithelial/stromal interactions have been proposed for a role of XMRV in prostate cancer. However, biochemical data supporting any of these mechanisms are lacking. Therefore, our aim was to evaluate a potential role of XMRV in prostate carcinogenesis. METHODS: Growth kinetics of prostate cancer cells are conducted by MTT assay. In vitro transformation and invasion was carried out by soft agar colony formation, and Matrigel cell invasion assay, respectively. p27(Kip1) expression was determined by Western blot and MMP activation was evaluated by gelatin-zymography. Up-regulation of miR221 and miR222 expression was examined by real-time PCR. RESULTS: We demonstrate that XMRV infection can accelerate cellular proliferation, enhance transformation, and increase invasiveness of slow growing prostate cancer cells. The molecular basis of these viral induced activities is mediated by the downregulation of cyclin/cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1) . Downstream analyses illustrated that XMRV infection upregulates miR221 and miR222 expression that target p27(Kip1) mRNA. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that downregulation of p27(Kip1) by XMRV infection facilitates transition of G1 to S, thereby accelerates growth of prostate cancer cells. Our findings implicate that if XMRV is present in humans, then under appropriate cellular microenvironment it may serve as a cofactor to promote cancer progression in the prostate.","['Pandhare-Dash, Jui', 'Mantri, Chinmay K', 'Gong, Yuanying', 'Chen, Zhenbang', 'Dash, Chandravanu']","['Pandhare-Dash J', 'Mantri CK', 'Gong Y', 'Chen Z', 'Dash C']","['Laboratory of Retrovirology and Epigenetics, Center for AIDS Health Disparities Research, Vanderbilt-Meharry Center For AIDS Research (CFAR), Meharry Medical College School of Medicine, 1005 Dr. DB Todd Jr Blvd., Nashville, TN 37208, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110919,United States,Prostate,The Prostate,8101368,"['0 (MIRN221 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN222 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 3.4.- (Metalloproteases)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*pathology/physiopathology/virology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*pathology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/*metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Down-Regulation/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Metalloproteases/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*pathology/physiopathology/virology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/*physiology']",PMC3275676,2011/09/21 06:00,2012/06/27 06:00,['2011/09/21 06:00'],"['2011/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pros.21491 [doi]'],ppublish,Prostate. 2012 Jun 1;72(8):886-97. doi: 10.1002/pros.21491.

However, over-expression of the N1 intracellular domain (ICN1) renders N1 activation ligand-independent and drives leukemic transformation during beta-selection. DN3 progenitors also express Notch3 (N3) mRNA, and over-expression of ligand-independent mutant N3 (ICN3) influences beta-selection and drives T cell leukemogenesis. However, the importance of ligand-activated N3 in promoting beta-selection and ICN1-induced T cell leukemogenesis has not been examined. To address these questions we generated mice lacking functional N3. We confirmed that DN3 progenitors express N3 protein using a N3-specific antibody. Surprisingly however, N3-deficient DN3 thymocytes were not defective in generating DP thymocytes under steady state conditions or in more stringent competition assays. To determine if N3 co-operates with N1 to regulate beta-selection, we generated N1;N3 compound mutants. However, N3 deficiency did not exacerbate the competitive defect of N1(+)/(-) DN3 progenitors, demonstrating that N3 does not compensate for limiting N1 during T cell development. Finally, N3 deficiency did not attenuate T cell leukemogenesis induced by conditional expression of ICN1 in DN3 thymocytes. Importantly, we showed that in contrast to N1, N3 has a low binding affinity for DL4, the most abundant intrathymic DL ligand. Thus, despite the profound effects of ectopic ligand-independent N3 activation on T cell development and leukemogenesis, physiologically activated N3 is dispensable for both processes, likely because N3 interacts poorly with intrathymic DL4.","['Suliman, Sara', 'Tan, Joanne', 'Xu, Keli', 'Kousis, Philaretos C', 'Kowalski, Paul E', 'Chang, Greg', 'Egan, Sean E', 'Guidos, Cynthia']","['Suliman S', 'Tan J', 'Xu K', 'Kousis PC', 'Kowalski PE', 'Chang G', 'Egan SE', 'Guidos C']","['Program in Stem Cell and Developmental Biology, Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110913,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Notch3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptor, Notch3)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch3', 'Receptors, Notch/genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Thymocytes/*cytology/*metabolism']",PMC3172312,2011/09/21 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/09/21 06:00'],"['2011/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0024937 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-13455 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(9):e24937. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0024937.

CXCL12 is also a potent chemokine involved in chemoattraction of T cells to the site of infection or inflammation. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine-threonine kinase that modulates different cellular processes, such as metabolism, nutrient sensing, protein translation, and cell growth. The role of mTOR in CXCL12-mediated resting T cell migration has yet to be elucidated. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, significantly inhibits CXCL12 mediated migration of both primary human resting T cells and human T cell leukemia cell line CEM. p70(S6K1), an effector molecule of mTOR signaling pathway, was knocked down by shRNA in CEM cells using a lentiviral gene transfer system. Using p70(S6K1) knock down cells, we demonstrate the role of mTOR signaling in T cell migration both in vitro and in vivo.

Accordingly, LL-37 is upregulated in irradiated BM cells and enhances the chemotactic responsiveness of hematopoietic progenitors from all lineages to a low physiological SDF-1 gradient as well as increasing their (i) adhesiveness, (ii) SDF-1-mediated actin polymerization and (iii) MAPK(p42/44) phosphorylation. Mice transplanted with BM cells ex vivo primed by LL-37 showed accelerated recovery of platelet and neutrophil counts by approximately 3-5 days compared with mice transplanted with unprimed control cells. These priming effects were not mediated by LL-37 binding to its receptor and depended instead on the incorporation of the CXCR4 receptor into membrane lipid rafts. We propose that LL-37, which has primarily antimicrobial functions and is harmless to mammalian cells, could be clinically applied to accelerate engraftment as an ex vivo priming agent for transplanted human HSPCs. This novel approach would be particularly important in cord blood transplantations, where the number of HSCs available is usually limited.","['Wu, W', 'Kim, C H', 'Liu, R', 'Kucia, M', 'Marlicz, W', 'Greco, N', 'Ratajczak, J', 'Laughlin, M J', 'Ratajczak, M Z']","['Wu W', 'Kim CH', 'Liu R', 'Kucia M', 'Marlicz W', 'Greco N', 'Ratajczak J', 'Laughlin MJ', 'Ratajczak MZ']","['Department of Medicine, Stem Cell Institute at the James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110920,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Cxcl12 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (formyl peptide receptor 2, mouse)', '3DD771JO2H (ropocamptide)', '80295-54-1 (Complement C5a)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Chemokine CXCL12/*physiology', 'Chemotaxis', 'Complement C5a/physiology', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Membrane Microdomains/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Receptors, CXCR4/physiology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/physiology', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide/physiology']",PMC3244577,2011/09/21 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2011/09/21 06:00'],"['2011/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011252 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.252 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Apr;26(4):736-45. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.252.

But the mechanism by which the fibrinolytic system can modulate lymphoma progression has been elusive. The main fibrinolytic enzyme, plasminogen (Plg)/plasmin (Plm), can activate matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), such as MMP-9, which has been linked to various malignancies. Here we provide the evidence that blockade of Plg reduces T-cell lymphoma growth by inhibiting MMP-9-dependent recruitment of CD11b(+)F4/80(+) myeloid cells locally within the lymphoma tissue. Genetic Plg deficiency and drug-mediated Plm blockade delayed T-cell lymphoma growth and diminished MMP-9-dependent CD11b(+)F4/80(+) myeloid cell infiltration into lymphoma tissues. A neutralizing antibody against CD11b inhibited T-cell lymphoma growth in vivo, which indicates that CD11b(+) myeloid cells have a role in T-cell lymphoma growth. Plg deficiency in T-cell lymphoma-bearing mice resulted in reduced plasma levels of the growth factors vascular endothelial growth-A and Kit ligand, both of which are known to enhance myeloid cell proliferation. Collectively, the data presented in this study demonstrate a previously undescribed role of Plm in lymphoproliferative disorders and provide strong evidence that specific blockade of Plg represents a promising approach for the regulation of T-cell lymphoma growth.","['Ishihara, M', 'Nishida, C', 'Tashiro, Y', 'Gritli, I', 'Rosenkvist, J', 'Koizumi, M', 'Okaji, Y', 'Yamamoto, R', 'Yagita, H', 'Okumura, K', 'Nishikori, M', 'Wanaka, K', 'Tsuda, Y', 'Okada, Y', 'Nakauchi, H', 'Heissig, B', 'Hattori, K']","['Ishihara M', 'Nishida C', 'Tashiro Y', 'Gritli I', 'Rosenkvist J', 'Koizumi M', 'Okaji Y', 'Yamamoto R', 'Yagita H', 'Okumura K', 'Nishikori M', 'Wanaka K', 'Tsuda Y', 'Okada Y', 'Nakauchi H', 'Heissig B', 'Hattori K']","['Laboratory of Stem Cell Regulation, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110920,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antifibrinolytic Agents)', '0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '9001-91-6 (Plasminogen)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antifibrinolytic Agents/*pharmacology', 'CD11b Antigen/*immunology', 'DNA Primers', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/enzymology/immunology/*pathology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Plasminogen/genetics/physiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2011/09/21 06:00,2012/03/31 06:00,['2011/09/21 06:00'],"['2011/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011203 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.203 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Feb;26(2):332-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.203.

Therefore, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) have emerged as promising anticancer agents. Herein, we report the characterization of apoptosis in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) induced by two HDACi, Kendine 92 and SAHA. Both inhibitors induce dose-, time- and caspase-dependent apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. Interestingly, Kendine 92 and SAHA show a selective cytotoxicity for B lymphocytes and induce apoptosis in CLL cells with mutated or deleted TP53 as effectively as in tumor cells harboring wild-type TP53. The pattern of apoptosis-related gene and protein expression profile has been characterized. It has shown to be irrespective of TP53 status and highly similar between SAHA and Kendine 92 exposure. The balance between the increased BAD, BNIP3L, BNIP3, BIM, PUMA and AIF mRNA expression levels, and decreased expression of BCL-W, BCL-2, BFL-1, XIAP and FLIP indicates global changes in the apoptosis mRNA expression profile consistent with the apoptotic outcome. Protein expression analysis shows increased levels of NOXA, BIM and PUMA proteins upon Kendine 92 and SAHA treatment. Our results highlight the capability of these molecules to induce apoptosis not only in a selective manner but also in those cells frequently resistant to standard treatments. Thus, Kendine 92 is a novel HDACi with anticancer efficacy for non-proliferating CLL cells.","['Perez-Perarnau, Alba', 'Coll-Mulet, Llorenc', 'Rubio-Patino, Camila', 'Iglesias-Serret, Daniel', 'Cosialls, Ana M', 'Gonzalez-Girones, Diana M', 'de Frias, Merce', 'de Sevilla, Alberto Fernandez', 'de la Banda, Esmeralda', 'Pons, Gabriel', 'Gil, Joan']","['Perez-Perarnau A', 'Coll-Mulet L', 'Rubio-Patino C', 'Iglesias-Serret D', 'Cosialls AM', 'Gonzalez-Girones DM', 'de Frias M', 'de Sevilla AF', 'de la Banda E', 'Pons G', 'Gil J']","[""Departament de Ciencies Fisiologiques II, Institut d'Investigacio Biomedica de Bellvitge, Universitat de Barcelona, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111001,United States,Epigenetics,Epigenetics,101265293,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (kendine 92)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vorinostat']",,2011/09/21 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2011/09/21 06:00'],"['2011/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['17200 [pii]', '10.4161/epi.6.10.17200 [doi]']",ppublish,Epigenetics. 2011 Oct 1;6(10):1228-35. doi: 10.4161/epi.6.10.17200.

Understanding the factors controlling these processes may have important therapeutic potential for BM failure and cancers. Here, we show that Skp2, a component of the Skp2 SCF complex, is an important regulator for HSC quiescence, frequency, and self-renewal capability. Skp2 deficiency displays a marked enhancement of HSC populations through promoting cell cycle entry independently of its role on apoptosis. Surprisingly, Skp2 deficiency in HSCs reduces quiescence and displays increased HSC cycling and proliferation. Importantly, loss of Skp2 not only increases HSC populations and long-term reconstitution ability but also rescues the defect in long-term reconstitution ability of HSCs on PTEN inactivation. Mechanistically, we show that Skp2 deficiency induces Cyclin D1 gene expression, which contributes to an increase in HSC cycling. Finally, we demonstrate that Skp2 deficiency enhances sensitivity of Lin(-) Sca-1(+) c-kit(+) cells and leukemia cells to chemotherapy agents. Our findings show that Skp2 is a novel regulator for HSC quiescence and self-renewal and that targeting Skp2 may have therapeutic implications for BM transplantation and leukemia stem cell treatment.","['Wang, Jing', 'Han, Fei', 'Wu, Juan', 'Lee, Szu-Wei', 'Chan, Chia-Hsin', 'Wu, Ching-Yuan', 'Yang, Wei-Lei', 'Gao, Yuan', 'Zhang, Xian', 'Jeong, Yun Seong', 'Moten, Asad', 'Samaniego, Felipe', 'Huang, Peng', 'Liu, Quentin', 'Zeng, Yi-Xin', 'Lin, Hui-Kuan']","['Wang J', 'Han F', 'Wu J', 'Lee SW', 'Chan CH', 'Wu CY', 'Yang WL', 'Gao Y', 'Zhang X', 'Jeong YS', 'Moten A', 'Samaniego F', 'Huang P', 'Liu Q', 'Zeng YX', 'Lin HK']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Oncology, M.

However, patients remain at risk for relapse on discontinuing treatment. We have previously shown that residual BCR-ABL(+) progenitors can be detected in CML patients within the first 2 years of imatinib treatment. However, reduced rates of relapse and continued decline of BCR-ABL levels with prolonged treatment, together with the ability of selected patients to maintain remission after discontinuing treatment, led us to investigate whether prolonged imatinib exposure resulted in reduction or elimination of BCR-ABL(+) stem cells. We evaluated BCR-ABL expression in CD34(+)CD38(+) (38(+)) committed progenitors and CD34(+)CD38(-) (38(-)) stem/primitive progenitor cells in samples from CML patients on imatinib treatment for at least 4 years with cytogenetic and molecular response. High levels of BCR-ABL expression were maintained over time in the 38(-) stem cell fraction. The absolute frequency of BCR-ABL(+) cells as determined by limiting dilution analysis was consistently higher in 38(-) compared with 38(+) cells. Transplantation into NOD/SCID-IL2Rgamma-chain knockout mice demonstrated that BCR-ABL(+) cells had long-term in vivo repopulating capacity. These results directly demonstrate that BCR-ABL(+) stem cells persist in CML patients despite prolonged treatment with imatinib, and support ongoing efforts to target this population.","['Chu, Su', 'McDonald, Tinisha', 'Lin, Allen', 'Chakraborty, Sujata', 'Huang, Qin', 'Snyder, David S', 'Bhatia, Ravi']","['Chu S', 'McDonald T', 'Lin A', 'Chakraborty S', 'Huang Q', 'Snyder DS', 'Bhatia R']","['Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110919,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Remission Induction', 'Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/pathology', 'Time Factors', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC3217358,2011/09/21 06:00,2012/01/17 06:00,['2011/09/21 06:00'],"['2011/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40334-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-12-327437 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Nov 17;118(20):5565-72. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-12-327437.

Postremission therapy was free. Fifty-three patients were evaluable (median age, 53.6 years). All patients achieved a complete hematologic remission (CHR), 49 (92.5%) at day 22. At this time point, 10 patients achieved a BCR-ABL reduction to < 10(-3). At 20 months, the overall survival was 69.2% and disease-free survival was 51.1%. A significant difference in DFS was observed between patients who showed at day 22 a decrease in BCR-ABL levels to < 10(-3) compared with patients who never reached these levels during induction. In multivariate analysis, BCR-ABL levels of < 10(-3) at day 85 correlated with disease-free survival. No deaths or relapses occurred during induction. Twenty-three patients relapsed after completing induction. A T315I mutation was detected in 12 of 17 relapsed cases. Treatment was well tolerated; only 4 patients discontinued therapy during the last phase of the induction when already in CHR.

To identify current trends in AYA care, we examined patterns of clinical trial participation, time to treatment, and provider characteristics in a population-based sample of AYA patients with cancer. METHODS: Using the National Cancer Institute Patterns of Care Study, we used multivariate logistic regression to evaluate demographic and provider characteristics associated with clinical trial enrollment and time to treatment among 1,358 AYA patients with cancer (age 15 to 39 years) identified through the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. RESULTS: In our study, 14% of patients age 15 to 39 years had enrolled onto a clinical trial; participation varied by type of cancer, with the highest participation in those diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (37%) and sarcoma (32%). Multivariate analyses demonstrated that uninsured, older patients and those treated by nonpediatric oncologists were less likely to enroll onto clinical trials. Median time from pathologic confirmation to first treatment was 3 days, but this varied by race/ethnicity and cancer site. In multivariate analyses, advanced cancer stage and outpatient treatment alone were associated with longer time from pathologic confirmation to treatment. CONCLUSION: Our study identified factors associated with low clinical trial participation in AYA patients with cancer. These findings support the continued need to improve access to clinical trials and innovative treatments for this population, which may ultimately translate into improved survival.","['Parsons, Helen M', 'Harlan, Linda C', 'Seibel, Nita L', 'Stevens, Jennifer L', 'Keegan, Theresa H M']","['Parsons HM', 'Harlan LC', 'Seibel NL', 'Stevens JL', 'Keegan TH']","['Applied Research Program, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892-7344, USA. helen.parsons@nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20110919,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Patient Selection', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/therapy', '*Research Subjects', 'SEER Program', 'Sarcoma/epidemiology/therapy', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC3209697,2011/09/21 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/09/21 06:00'],"['2011/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.36.2954 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.36.2954 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Oct 20;29(30):4045-53. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.36.2954.

After the administration of one unit of red blood cells (RBC), the Hb rises with 1 g/dL, and the life span of transfused RBC is 100-110 days. Complications related to RBC transfusion are procedural problems, iron overload, viral and bacterial infections, and immune injury. RBC transfusions have been related to increased risk of the development of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and are related to a worse treatment outcome in selected cancers. In addition, the cost of a transfusion for the patient and society is around 300-500 euros per unit transfused.

It is not clear whether activating mutations of this phosphatase play a causal role in the pathogenesis of acute leukemias. If so, the cell origin of leukemia-initiating stem cells (LSCs) remains to be determined. Ptpn11(E76K) mutation is the most common and most active Ptpn11 mutation found in JMML and acute leukemias. However, the pathogenic effects of this mutation have not been well characterized. We have created Ptpn11(E76K) conditional knock-in mice. Global Ptpn11(E76K/+) mutation results in early embryonic lethality. Induced knock-in of this mutation in pan hematopoietic cells leads to MPD as a result of aberrant activation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and myeloid progenitors. These animals subsequently progress to acute leukemias. Intriguingly, in addition to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL) and B-ALL are evolved. Moreover, tissue-specific knock-in of Ptpn11(E76K/+) mutation in lineage-committed myeloid, T lymphoid, and B lymphoid progenitors also results in AML, T-ALL, and B-ALL, respectively. Further analyses have revealed that Shp2 (encoded by Ptpn11) is distributed to centrosomes and that Ptpn11(E76K/+) mutation promotes LSC development, partly by causing centrosome amplification and genomic instability. Thus, Ptpn11(E76K) mutation has non-lineage-specific effects on malignant transformation of hematopoietic cells and initiates acute leukemias at various stages of hematopoiesis.","['Xu, Dan', 'Liu, Xia', 'Yu, Wen-Mei', 'Meyerson, Howard J', 'Guo, Caiying', 'Gerson, Stanton L', 'Qu, Cheng-Kui']","['Xu D', 'Liu X', 'Yu WM', 'Meyerson HJ', 'Guo C', 'Gerson SL', 'Qu CK']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Center for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, and Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110919,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Lineage', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Centrosome/metabolism', 'Chromosomal Instability', 'Embryo, Mammalian/pathology/physiology', 'Gene Knock-In Techniques', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Mutation', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC3182060,2011/09/21 06:00,2011/11/15 06:00,['2011/09/21 06:00'],"['2011/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [medline]']","['jem.20110450 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20110450 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2011 Sep 26;208(10):1977-88. doi: 10.1084/jem.20110450.

The E. chaffeensis strain Wakulla induces diffuse hepatitis with neutrophil infiltration in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency, which is accompanied by strong CXCL2 (mouse functional homolog of interleukin-8 [IL-8]) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) expression in the liver. In this study, we found that expression of IL-1beta, CXCL2, and TNF-alpha was induced by strain Wakulla in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages; this expression was dependent on MyD88, but not on TRIF, TLR2/4, IL-1R1/IL-18R1, or endosome acidification. When the human leukemia cell line THP-1 was exposed to E. chaffeensis, significant upregulation of IL-8, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha mRNA and extracellular regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) activation were detected. U0126 (inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1/2 [MEK1/2] upstream of ERK), manumycin A (Ras inhibitor), BAY43-9006 (Raf-1 inhibitor), and NS-50 (inhibitor of NF-kappaB nuclear translocation) inhibited the cytokine gene expression. A luciferase reporter assay using HEK293 cells, which lack Toll-like receptors (TLRs), showed activation of both the IL-8 promoter and NF-kappaB by E. chaffeensis. Activation of the IL-8 promoter in transfected HEK293 cells was inhibited by manumycin A, BAY43-9006, U0126, and transfection with a dominant-negative Ras mutant.

Previously we have shown that liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) promote the survival, proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. In the present study we investigated whether LSEC might promote the survival and undifferentiated growth of muESC. For these purposes, muESC (CGR8 cell line) were cultured on LSEC monolayers (muESC/LSEC) or in the presence of conditioned medium from LSEC cultures (muESC/LSEC-CM), both in the absence of LIF. Microscopic observation showed the growth of undifferentiated ESC colonies in both muESC/LSEC or muESC/LSEC-CM cultures. A significant reduction in the growth of undifferentiated ESC colonies was observed when ESC were cultured in LSEC-CM previously incubated with anti-LIF. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis showed that LSEC constitutively express LIF at the mRNA and protein level. At different times of culture, muESC were harvested and analyzed for the expression of embryonic markers (SSEA-1 and Oct-4) and differentiation capacity. Flow cytometry analysis showed the presence of a higher percentage of muESC (>90%) expressing SSEA-1 in muESC/LSEC-CM, as compared with muESC/LSEC cocultures. muESC obtained from both types of cultures formed embryoid bodies in vitro, and form teratomas in testicles of mice. These results provide the first evidence that LSEC support the in vitro survival, self-renewal, undifferentiated growth and differentiation capacity of the muESC CGR8 cell line.","['Silva-Cote, Ingrid', 'Cardier, Jose E']","['Silva-Cote I', 'Cardier JE']","['Unidad de Terapia Celular-Laboratorio de Patologia Celular y Molecular, Centro de Medicina Experimental, Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Cientificas (IVIC), Apartado 21827, Caracas 1020-A, Venezuela.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110917,England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Antibodies, Blocking)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Blocking/pharmacology', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Embryoid Bodies/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Endothelial Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Liver/*cytology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Teratoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",,2011/09/21 06:00,2012/03/16 06:00,['2011/09/21 06:00'],"['2011/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/24 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S1043-4666(11)00715-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cyto.2011.08.035 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 2011 Dec;56(3):608-15. doi: 10.1016/j.cyto.2011.08.035.

In the latter field, induction of graft-versus-leukemia effects will receive greater attention, where HLA will play a central role.

To develop a resequencing platform that simultaneously captures point mutations, insertions-deletions (indels), and gene fusions in the cancer genome, we chose cDNA as the input for target capture and extensive resequencing, and we describe the versatility of such a cDNA-capture system. As a test case, we constructed a custom target-capture system for 913 cancer-related genes, and we purified cDNA fragments for the target gene set from five cell lines of CML. Our target gene set included Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (ABL1), but it did not include breakpoint cluster region (BCR); however, the sequence output faithfully detected reads spanning the fusion points of these two genes in all cell lines, confirming the ability of cDNA capture to detect gene fusions. Furthermore, computational analysis of the sequence dataset successfully identified non-synonymous mutations and indels, including those of tumor protein p53 (TP53).

Approximately 2% to 8% of all cancers are thought to be due to occupation. In addition, occupational and environmental cancers have their own characteristics, e.g., specific chemicals and cancers, multiple factors, multiple causation and interaction, or latency period. Concerning carcinogens, asbestos/silica/wood dust, soot/polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [benzo(a) pyrene], heavy metals (arsenic, chromium, nickel), aromatic amines (4-aminobiphenyl, benzidine), organic solvents (benzene or vinyl chloride), radiation/radon, or indoor pollutants (formaldehyde, tobacco smoking) are mentioned with their specific cancers, e.g., lung, skin, and bladder cancers, mesothelioma or leukemia, and exposure routes, rubber or pigment manufacturing, textile, painting, insulation, mining, and so on. In addition, nanoparticles, electromagnetic waves, and climate changes are suspected as future carcinogenic sources. Moreover, the aspects of environmental and occupational cancers are quite different between developing and developed countries. The recent follow-up of occupational cancers in Nordic countries shows a good example for developed countries. On the other hand, newly industrializing countries face an increased burden of occupational and environmental cancers. Developing countries are particularly suffering from preventable cancers in mining, agriculture, or industries without proper implication of safety regulations. Therefore, industrialized countries are expected to educate and provide support for developing countries. In addition, citizens can encounter new environmental and occupational carcinogen nominators such as nanomaterials, electromagnetic wave, and climate exchanges. As their carcinogenicity or involvement in carcinogenesis is not clearly unknown, proper consideration for them should be taken into account. For these purposes, new technologies with a balance of environment and gene are required. Currently, various approaches with advanced technologies--genomics, exposomics, etc.--have accelerated development of new biomarkers for biological monitoring of occupational and environmental carcinogens. These advanced approaches are promising to improve quality of life and to prevent occupational and environmental cancers.","['Yang, Mihi']",['Yang M'],"[""College of Pharmacy, Sookmyung Women's University, Chungpa-Dong, Yongsan-Gu, Seoul, Republic of Korea. myang@sm.ac.kr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Environ Sci Health C Environ Carcinog Ecotoxicol Rev,"Journal of environmental science and health.

Clinical application of gamma-secretase inhibitors to block Notch signaling in T-ALL revealed new challenges that involve improvement of the therapeutic benefit and reduction of intestinal toxicity.

In the German CLL Study Group (GCLLSG) CLL8 trial, treatment-naive, physically fit patients (aged 30-81 years) with CD20(+) CLL were randomly assigned in a one-to-one ratio to receive six courses of intravenous fludarabine (25 mg/m(2) per day) and cyclophosphamide (250 mg/m(2) per day) for the first 3 days of each 28-day treatment course with or without rituximab (375 mg/m(2) on day 0 of first course and 500 mg/m(2) on day 1 of second to sixth courses). The two groups were well balanced with respect to baseline characteristics. The study was stopped at the preplanned interim analysis owing to an advantage in the median progression-free survival in the chemoimmunotherapy arm (51.8 vs 32.8 months; hazard ratio: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.46-0.69; p < 0.0001).

In terms of toxicity, chemoimmunotherapy was more frequently associated with grade 3 and 4 neutropenia (p < 0.0001). There were eight (2%) treatment related-deaths in the chemoimmunotherapy arm compared with ten (3%) in the chemotherapy arm. The CLL8 trial has demonstrated that an association of rituximab, fludarabine and cyclophosphamide is effective in prolonging progression-free survival and overall survival of patients with symptomatic CLL, therefore establishing the new standard of treatment for physically fit patients.","['Molica, Stefano']",['Molica S'],"['Department of Hematology-Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, Viale Pio X, 88100 Catanzaro, Italy. smolica@libero.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,Expert review of anticancer therapy,101123358,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Rituximab', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives']",,2011/09/21 06:00,2012/02/16 06:00,['2011/09/21 06:00'],"['2011/09/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1586/era.11.118 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 2011 Sep;11(9):1333-40. doi: 10.1586/era.11.118.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In cases with both CLL/SLL and inflammatory infiltrates, it is unknown whether the CLL infiltrate represents a nonspecific ""passenger effect"" secondary to ongoing inflammation or pathologic leukemic pulmonary infiltration (LPI). We reviewed 49 lung biopsies taken from 38 patients with CLL/SLL. LPI was found in 2 of 21 cases (9.5%) with acute inflammation, 0 of 10 cases of chronic inflammation and in 7 of 18 cases (38.8%) without any pathologic findings of acute or chronic inflammation (p = 0.01). These results demonstrate that LPI identified in biopsies with concurrent inflammation is uncommon, and that most inflammatory infiltrates in patients with CLL do not cause ""passenger effect"" CLL infiltration. Therefore, LPI usually represents a specific pathologic process. We conclude that bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy is an effective tool for guiding treatment decisions for symptomatic patients with CLL with pulmonary infiltrates.

However, no data are available regarding the meaning of results when the 2 tests do not agree. METHODS: The authors of this report analyzed 1464 pairs of concurrent cytogenetics and flow results from 424 patients, before and after hematopoietic cell transplantation, and compared the prognostic impact of discordant and concordant results. RESULTS: Informative discordant results were observed in 22% of patients. Compared with patients who had double-negative test results, either positive result had a significant impact on overall survival and relapse-free survival. The hazard ratios with either positive cytogenetic results or positive MFC results pretransplantation were 3.1 (P = .009) and 2.5 (P = .0008), respectively, for reduced overall survival and 2.7 (P = .01) and 4.1 (P < .0001), respectively, for decreased recurrence-free survival. Similar findings were obtained post-transplantation. Molecular cytogenetics, ie, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), added value to the evaluation of discordant cases. CONCLUSIONS: The detection of residual AML by either cytogenetics or flow cytometry in patients who underwent hematopoietic cell transplantation predicted early relapse and shortened survival.","['Fang, Min', 'Storer, Barry', 'Wood, Brent', 'Gyurkocza, Boglarka', 'Sandmaier, Brenda M', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R']","['Fang M', 'Storer B', 'Wood B', 'Gyurkocza B', 'Sandmaier BM', 'Appelbaum FR']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109-1023, USA. mfang@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20110916,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cytogenetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC3536054,2011/09/20 06:00,2012/06/13 06:00,['2011/09/20 06:00'],"['2011/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/27 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.26539 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2012 May 1;118(9):2411-9. doi: 10.1002/cncr.26539.

Metabolic processes, which generate oxidants and antioxidants can be influenced by environmental factors such as electromagnetic fields (EMF). We analyzed the effects of EMF on the activity and expression of MMPs in THP-1 cells. Cells were exposed to a 50 Hz, 1 mT EMF for 24 h and incubated with or without LPS. Our data indicate that THP-1 cells exposed to EMF causes a reduction of anti-oxidant enzyme activity and an enhancement of nitrogen intermediates involving the iNOS pathway. We then analyzed the role of nitration of TIMP-1 in increasing the activity of MMPs in EMF exposed cells. Molecular modeling tools were employed to identify the most plausible sites in the active conformation of TIMP-1; at least two protein sites, Y120 and Y38 and/or Y72 were identified. Reactive nitrogen species (RNS) may affect protein targets, such as TIMP-1, which are crucial for the regulation of MMP activities by oxidation of sulfydryl groups, or by nitration of tyrosine residues. These results may suggest a pathway connecting an imbalance of MMPs and their cognate inhibitor TIMP-1.","['Patruno, Antonia', 'Pesce, Mirko', 'Marrone, Alessandro', 'Speranza, Lorenza', 'Grilli, Alfredo', 'De Lutiis, Maria Anna', 'Felaco, Mario', 'Reale, Marcella']","['Patruno A', 'Pesce M', 'Marrone A', 'Speranza L', 'Grilli A', 'De Lutiis MA', 'Felaco M', 'Reale M']","[""Department of Drug Sciences, University G. d'Annunzio, Chieti, Italy. antoniapatruno@unich.it""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Reactive Nitrogen Species)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (TIMP1 protein, human)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (NOS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (MMP2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Electromagnetic Fields', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/genetics/*metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reactive Nitrogen Species/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine']",,2011/09/20 06:00,2012/04/20 06:00,['2011/09/20 06:00'],"['2011/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.23024 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2012 Jun;227(6):2767-74. doi: 10.1002/jcp.23024.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Whether nonenzymatic glycation directly impaired the anti-inflammatory effects of HDL in innate immunity remained unclear. METHODS: Human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) cells, mouse RAW 264.7 macrophages and primary human monocytes derived macrophages were pre-incubated with native HDL, diabetic HDL isolated from T2DM patients or HDL glycated with different doses of d-glucose in vitro and then challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and IL-1beta was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Phosphorylation of Ikappa-Balpha in cytoplasm and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB were detected by western blot. Glycation levels of native HDL, glycated HDL and diabetic HDL were determined using LC-MS/MS. RESULTS: The potency of diabetic HDL to inhibit the release of TNF-alpha (p < 0.05) and IL-1beta (p < 0.001) was dramatically attenuated compared with that of native HDL. Similarly, glycation of HDL in vitro impaired its ability to inhibit TNF-alpha and IL-1beta release in a glucose dose-dependent manner. Moreover, apoHDL still effectively inhibited the release of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta induced by LPS, but glycated apoHDL partly lost such abilities. Nonenzymatic glycation levels of glycated HDL and diabetic HDL increased 28 fold (p < 0.001) and 4 fold (p < 0.001), respectively compared with that of native HDL. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed that diabetic HDL and HDL glycated in vitro both partly lose their protective effects to inhibit cytokines release induced by LPS in macrophages, and nonenzymatic glycation of the protein components of HDL plays key roles in these impairments.","['Liu, Donghui', 'Ji, Liang', 'Zhang, Dongmei', 'Tong, Xunliang', 'Pan, Bing', 'Liu, Pinli', 'Zhang, Youyi', 'Huang, Yining', 'Su, Jinzi', 'Willard, Belinda', 'Zheng, Lemin']","['Liu D', 'Ji L', 'Zhang D', 'Tong X', 'Pan B', 'Liu P', 'Zhang Y', 'Huang Y', 'Su J', 'Willard B', 'Zheng L']","['The Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Key Laboratory of Molecular Cardiovascular Sciences, Ministry of Education, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Diabetes Metab Res Rev,Diabetes/metabolism research and reviews,100883450,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Lipoproteins, HDL)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood/*metabolism', 'Glucose/chemistry', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Innate', 'Interleukin-1beta/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Lipoproteins, HDL/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",,2011/09/20 06:00,2012/06/23 06:00,['2011/09/20 06:00'],"['2011/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/dmrr.1297 [doi]'],ppublish,Diabetes Metab Res Rev. 2012 Feb;28(2):186-95. doi: 10.1002/dmrr.1297.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Previous data suggested that the presence of residual normal cells improved the prognosis in patients with monosomy 7. The Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) reported the impact of residual normal metaphases in AML patients with monosomal karyotype (MK) and found a similar relationship. We determined the influence of residual normal metaphases in patients with core binding factor (CBF) AML. METHODS: The presence and total number of normal and abnormal metaphases were tallied for patients with CBF AML treated in 10 consecutive SWOG trials and used as a variable to determine the effect on complete remission, refractory disease, and overall survival (OS) rates. RESULTS: Among 113 CBF AML patients, median age of diagnosis was 45 years (range, 18-77 years), and median OS was 4 years (CI-2 years-not reached). Patients with inv(16) and no normal metaphases had improved OS compared with those with 1+ normal metaphases (P = .00005), whereas no difference was noted for patients with t(8;21). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that having cells with a normal karyotype had a negative impact on survival (HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.09-4.08; P = .026). This shorter survival was a consequence of a higher rate of refractory disease in older patients (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.9998-1.06; P = .05) and in those with normal metaphases (HR, 1.26 95% CI, 1.04-1.51; P = .02).

Several autophagy-deficient or knockout studies indicate that autophagy is a tumor suppressor. Tetrahydrocurcumin (THC), a major metabolite of curcumin, has been demonstrated with anti-colon carcinogenesis and antioxidation in vivo. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the present study, we found that treatment with THC induced autophagic cell death in human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells by increasing autophage marker acidic vascular organelle (AVO) formation. Flow cytometry also confirmed that THC treatment did not increase sub-G1 cell population whereas curcumin did with strong apoptosis-inducing activity. At the molecular levels, the results from Western blot analysis showed that THC significantly down-regulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B and mitogen-activated protein kinase signalings including decreasing the phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin, glycogen synthase kinase 3beta and p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase. Further molecular analysis exhibited that the pretreatment of 3-methyladenine (an autophagy inhibitor) also significantly reduced acidic vascular organelle production in THC-treated cells. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results demonstrated the anticancer efficacy of THC by inducing autophagy as well as provided a potential application for the prevention of human leukemia.","['Wu, Jia-Ching', 'Lai, Ching-Shu', 'Badmaev, Vladimir', 'Nagabhushanam, Kalyanam', 'Ho, Chi-Tang', 'Pan, Min-Hsiung']","['Wu JC', 'Lai CS', 'Badmaev V', 'Nagabhushanam K', 'Ho CT', 'Pan MH']","['Department of Seafood Science, National Kaohsiung Marine University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110919,Germany,Mol Nutr Food Res,Molecular nutrition & food research,101231818,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BECN1 protein, human)', '0 (Beclin-1)', '0 (MAP1LC3A protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '00U0645U03 (tetrahydrocurcumin)', '5142-23-4 (3-methyladenine)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Beclin-1', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Curcumin/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism']",,2011/09/20 06:00,2012/03/13 06:00,['2011/09/20 06:00'],"['2011/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/29 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/mnfr.201100454 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Nutr Food Res. 2011 Nov;55(11):1646-54. doi: 10.1002/mnfr.201100454.

Patients' ability to adjust and cope with such challenges may depend on their ability to exert control over cognitive, emotional, and behavioral processes, that is, ability to self-regulate. Self-regulatory capacity is a limited resource that can be depleted or fatigued (i.e., ""self-regulatory fatigue""), particularly in the context of stressful life events such as cancer diagnosis and treatment. PURPOSE: This is one of the first studies to examine self-regulatory fatigue in a cancer population. The current study aimed to (1) extract items for a specific scale of self-regulatory capacity and (2) examine the impact of such capacity on adaptation in patients with hematologic malignancies preparing for HSCT. METHODS: Factor analysis of four existing scales gauging psychological adjustment and well-being in 314 patients preparing for HSCT (63% male and 89% Caucasian) identified 23 items (alpha = 0.85) related to self-regulatory control or fatigue. This measure was then examined using existing clinical data obtained from 178 patients (57% male and 91% Caucasian) undergoing treatment for hematologic malignancies in relationship to quality of life, coping, and self-reported adherence to physicians' recommendations. RESULTS: Controlling for pain severity, physical fatigue, and depression, self-regulatory fatigue scores were incrementally associated with decreased quality of life, use of avoidance coping strategies, and decreased adherence to physicians' recommendations. CONCLUSION: These results emphasize the potential role of self-regulatory capacity in coping with and adjusting to hematologic cancers and future research is warranted.","['Solberg Nes, Lise', 'Ehlers, Shawna L', 'Patten, Christi A', 'Gastineau, Dennis A']","['Solberg Nes L', 'Ehlers SL', 'Patten CA', 'Gastineau DA']","['Department of Psychiatry and Psychology, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. lsolbnes@umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Int J Behav Med,International journal of behavioral medicine,9421097,,IM,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amyloidosis/psychology', 'Depression/psychology', 'Factor Analysis, Statistical', 'Fatigue/*psychology', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/psychology', 'Lymphoma/psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/psychology', 'Patient Compliance/*psychology', '*Quality of Life', 'Social Control, Informal']",PMC4454389,2011/09/20 06:00,2014/05/14 06:00,['2011/09/20 06:00'],"['2011/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12529-011-9194-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Behav Med. 2013 Mar;20(1):13-21. doi: 10.1007/s12529-011-9194-1.,,,,['UL1 TR000135/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States'],,['NIHMS687221'],,,,,,,,,,

This paper is the first report on the partial characterisation of env and gag genetic fragments of BLVs from Turkey.","['Alkan, Feray', 'Oguzoglu, Tuba Cigdem', 'Timurkan, Mehmet Ozkan', 'Karapinar, Zeynep']","['Alkan F', 'Oguzoglu TC', 'Timurkan MO', 'Karapinar Z']","['Department of Virology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ankara University, 06110 Diskapi, Ankara, Turkey. falkan@ankara.edu.tr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110917,Austria,Arch Virol,Archives of virology,7506870,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*virology', 'Gene Products, env/chemistry/*genetics', 'Gene Products, gag/chemistry/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/classification/*genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Turkey', 'Turkeys']",,2011/09/20 06:00,2011/11/08 06:00,['2011/09/20 06:00'],"['2011/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00705-011-1060-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Virol. 2011 Oct;156(10):1891-6. doi: 10.1007/s00705-011-1060-6.

The third European Conference on Infections in Leukemia (ECIL-3) meeting aimed at establishing evidence-based recommendations for the use of biological tests in adult patients, based on the grading system of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. The following biomarkers were investigated as screening tests: galactomannan (GM) for invasive aspergillosis (IA); beta-glucan (BG) for invasive candidiasis (IC) and IA; Cryptococcus Ag for cryptococcosis; mannan (Mn) Ag/anti-mannan (A-Mn) Ab for IC, and PCR for IA. Testing for GM, Cryptococcus Ag and BG are included in the revised EORTC/MSG (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group) consensus definitions for IFD. Strong evidence supports the use of GM in serum (A II), and Cryptococcus Ag in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (A II). Evidence is moderate for BG detection in serum (B II), and the combined Mn/A-Mn testing in serum for hepatosplenic candidiasis (B III) and candidemia (C II). No recommendations were formulated for the use of PCR owing to a lack of standardization and clinical validation. Clinical utility of these markers for the early management of IFD should be further assessed in prospective randomized interventional studies.","['Marchetti, O', 'Lamoth, F', 'Mikulska, M', 'Viscoli, C', 'Verweij, P', 'Bretagne, S']","['Marchetti O', 'Lamoth F', 'Mikulska M', 'Viscoli C', 'Verweij P', 'Bretagne S']","['Infectious Diseases Service, Department of Medicine, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois and University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Practice Guideline', 'Review']",20110919,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antigens, Fungal)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Mannans)', '0 (beta-Glucans)', '11078-30-1 (galactomannan)', 'X2RN3Q8DNE (Galactose)']",IM,"['*Antigens, Fungal/blood/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Biomarkers/blood/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Congresses as Topic', 'European Union', 'Galactose/analogs & derivatives', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Leukemia/*blood/*cerebrospinal fluid/microbiology', '*Mannans/blood/cerebrospinal fluid', '*Mycoses/blood/cerebrospinal fluid/diagnosis/therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous', '*beta-Glucans/blood/cerebrospinal fluid']",,2011/09/20 06:00,2012/10/04 06:00,['2011/09/20 06:00'],"['2011/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/04 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt2011178 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2011.178 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2012 Jun;47(6):846-54. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2011.178.

The disease affects the lymph nodes, and 50% of patients present with bone marrow infiltration; however, the mechanisms involved in dissemination of the disease are not yet known. We previously reported that FL cells display an overexpression of Syk, a tyrosine kinase involved in many cellular processes including cell migration. Therefore, we sought to explore its role in the invasive process. Here, we show that FL patients display higher matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels than healthy donors. Moreover, using Syk small interfering RNA and the Syk inhibitor R406, we demonstrate that, in FL cells, Syk is involved in the regulation of MMP-9 and VEGF expression, and that invasion and angiogenesis is mediated through a phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)-mammalian target of rapamycin module. Finally, using a FL xenograft mouse model we observe that fostamatinib (R788), inhibits MMP-9 expression and angiogenesis in vivo. Altogether, this study provides strong evidence that Syk represents an encouraging therapeutic target in FL and suggests the potential use of fostamatinib as an anti-invasive and anti-angiogenic drug.","['Fruchon, S', 'Kheirallah, S', 'Al Saati, T', 'Ysebaert, L', 'Laurent, C', 'Leseux, L', 'Fournie, J J', 'Laurent, G', 'Bezombes, C']","['Fruchon S', 'Kheirallah S', 'Al Saati T', 'Ysebaert L', 'Laurent C', 'Leseux L', 'Fournie JJ', 'Laurent G', 'Bezombes C']","['CRCT INSERM UMR1037, CNRS ERL5294, Universite Toulouse, CHU Purpan, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110916,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*physiology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*pathology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/genetics', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*etiology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Syk Kinase', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*physiology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/physiology']",,2011/09/20 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2011/09/20 06:00'],"['2011/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011248 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.248 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Apr;26(4):795-805. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.248.

Several small molecule drugs targeting JAK2 are currently in clinical development for treatment in these diseases. We performed a high-throughput in vitro screen to identify point mutations in JAK2V617F that would be predicted to have potential clinical relevance and associated with drug resistance to the JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib (INCB018424). Seven libraries of mutagenized JAK2V617F cDNA were screened to specifically identify mutations in the predicted drug-binding region that would confer resistance to ruxolitinib, using a BaF3 cell-based assay. We identified five different non-synonymous point mutations that conferred drug resistance. Cells containing mutations had a 9- to 33-fold higher EC(50) for ruxolitinib compared with native JAK2V617F. Our results further indicated that these mutations also conferred cross-resistance to all JAK2 kinase inhibitors tested, including AZD1480, TG101348, lestaurtinib (CEP-701) and CYT-387. Surprisingly, introduction of the 'gatekeeper' mutation (M929I) in JAK2V617F affected only ruxolitinib sensitivity (fourfold increase in EC(50)).

In total, 192 pediatric patients transplanted for the treatment of malignant and non-malignant diseases after reduced-intensity or myeloablative conditioning were investigated. Surveillance of lineage-specific chimerism was initiated upon first appearance of leukocyte counts amenable to cell sorting. Graft rejection occurred in 23 patients between 24 and 492 days post-transplant (median 63 days). The first chimerism analysis of T and NK cells performed at a median of 20 days after SCT identified three different risk groups that were independent from the conditioning regimen: recipient chimerism (RC) levels in T cells below 50% indicated a very low risk of rejection (1.4%), whereas high levels of RC (>90%) both in T and NK cells heralded graft loss in the majority of patients (90%) despite therapeutic interventions. RC >50% in T cells and </=90% in NK cells defined an intermediate-risk group in which timely immunotherapy frequently prevented rejection. Early assessment of T- and NK-cell chimerism can therefore be instrumental in the risk assessment and therapeutic management of imminent graft rejection.","['Breuer, S', 'Preuner, S', 'Fritsch, G', 'Daxberger, H', 'Koenig, M', 'Poetschger, U', 'Lawitschka, A', 'Peters, C', 'Mann, G', 'Lion, T', 'Matthes-Martin, S']","['Breuer S', 'Preuner S', 'Fritsch G', 'Daxberger H', 'Koenig M', 'Poetschger U', 'Lawitschka A', 'Peters C', 'Mann G', 'Lion T', 'Matthes-Martin S']","[""St Anna Children's Hospital, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110916,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Cell Lineage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chimerism', 'Graft Rejection/*diagnosis/metabolism', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",,2011/09/20 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2011/09/20 06:00'],"['2011/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011244 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.244 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Mar;26(3):509-19. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.244.

The appearance of these multiple diseases in one animal model provides an opportunity to study the pathogenesis of multiple diseases simultaneously. To study whether Myc function is required for the development of these hematopoietic disorders in Pten(-/-) mice, we generated inducible Pten/Myc double-knockout mice (Pten(-/-)/Myc(-/-)). By comparing the hematopoietic phenotypes of these double-knockout mice with those of Pten(-/-) mice, we found that both sets of animals developed MPDs and LPDs. However, none of the compound-mutant mice developed acute leukemia or lymphoma. Interestingly, in contrast to the MPDs that developed in Pten(-/-) mice, which are dominated by granulocytes, megakaryocytes predominate in the MPDs of Pten(-/-)/Myc(-/-) mice. Our study suggests that the deregulation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signaling in Pten(-/-) hematopoietic cells protects these cells from apoptotic cell death, resulting in chronic proliferative disorders. However, owing to the differential requirement for Myc in granulocyte as compared to megakaryocyte proliferation, Myc deletion converts Pten(-/-) MPDs from granulocyte- to megakaryocyte-dominated conditions. Myc is absolutely required for the development of acute hematopoietic malignancies.","['Zhang, J', 'Xiao, Y', 'Guo, Y', 'Breslin, P', 'Zhang, S', 'Wei, W', 'Zhang, Z', 'Zhang, J']","['Zhang J', 'Xiao Y', 'Guo Y', 'Breslin P', 'Zhang S', 'Wei W', 'Zhang Z', 'Zhang J']","[""Department of Biology, College of Life and Environment Science, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China. jzhang@lumc.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110916,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Myc protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Cre recombinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (Pten protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*etiology/pathology', 'Integrases/metabolism', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*etiology/pathology', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",PMC3237817,2011/09/20 06:00,2012/02/01 06:00,['2011/09/20 06:00'],"['2011/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011220 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.220 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Dec;25(12):1857-68. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.220.

In 2005 the National Institutes of Health (NIH) established new criteria for chronic GVHD based on retrospective data and expert recommendations. We prospectively evaluated the incidence of NIH-defined chronic GVHD and its prognostic impact in 178 consecutive patients. The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD at 3 years was 64, 48 and 16% for chronic classic GVHD and overlap syndrome. Prior acute GVHD and myeloablative conditioning were significantly associated with increased risk of chronic GVHD. Three-year survival (overall survival (OS)) for late-acute GVHD, chronic classic and overlap chronic GVHD when assigned on day 100 were 69, 83 and 73%. OS was significantly worse for patients with platelet counts below 100 g/l at onset of chronic GVHD (35% versus 86%, P<0.0001) and progressive as compared with de novo and quiescent onset of chronic GVHD (54.5% versus 89.5% versus 84%, P = 0.022 and 0.001). Peak severity of chronic GVHD had no impact on non-relapse mortality (NRM) and OS. Recurrent acute GVHD, platelet counts below 100 g/l at diagnosis of chronic GVHD, progressive onset of chronic GVHD and advanced disease stage prior to HCT were significantly associated with increased NRM. This prospective analysis provides for the first-time data on the incidence rates of NIH-defined chronic GVHD categories and identified risk factors for the occurrence of chronic GVHD.

Major bleeding during follow-up occurred in 55 (6%) WHO-ET and 21 (12%) PMF patients (P = 0.009), at a rate of 0.79 and 1.39% patients per year, respectively, (P = 0.039). In a multivariable analysis, predictors of bleeding included diagnosis of PMF (P = 0.05; hazard ratio (HR) 1.74), leukocytosis (P = 0.04; HR 1.74), previous hemorrhage (P = 0.025; HR 2.35) and aspirin therapy (P=0.001; HR 3.16). The analysis restricted to patients with WHO-ET confirmed previous hemorrhage (P = 0.043; HR 1.92) and aspirin (P=0.027; HR 2.24) as independent risk factors. The current study reveals that major bleeding associated with thrombocytosis might be relatively specific to PMF, as opposed to WHO-defined ET. Furthermore, it shows that low-dose aspirin exacerbates these hemorrhagic events of PMF. In contrast, thrombocytosis per se was not a risk factor for bleeding; however, low-dose aspirin had a synergistic hemorrhagic effect unmasking the bleeding tendency of patients with extreme thrombocytosis. These observations carry significant therapeutic implications in these two WHO entities.","['Finazzi, G', 'Carobbio, A', 'Thiele, J', 'Passamonti, F', 'Rumi, E', 'Ruggeri, M', 'Rodeghiero, F', 'Randi, M L', 'Bertozzi, I', 'Vannucchi, A M', 'Antonioli, E', 'Gisslinger, H', 'Buxhofer-Ausch, V', 'Gangat, N', 'Rambaldi, A', 'Tefferi, A', 'Barbui, T']","['Finazzi G', 'Carobbio A', 'Thiele J', 'Passamonti F', 'Rumi E', 'Ruggeri M', 'Rodeghiero F', 'Randi ML', 'Bertozzi I', 'Vannucchi AM', 'Antonioli E', 'Gisslinger H', 'Buxhofer-Ausch V', 'Gangat N', 'Rambaldi A', 'Tefferi A', 'Barbui T']","['Division of Hematology, Research Foundation, Ospedali Riuniti di Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110916,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Platelet Count', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*complications/diagnosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*complications/diagnosis', 'World Health Organization']",,2011/09/20 06:00,2012/06/05 06:00,['2011/09/20 06:00'],"['2011/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011258 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.258 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Apr;26(4):716-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.258.

DESIGN: Retrospective 11-yr study (1998-2008). SETTING: Medical intensive care unit in a teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Four hundred twenty-eight intensive care unit patients with cancer, neutropenia, and severe sepsis or septic shock. The primary outcome was hospital mortality. RESULTS: The main underlying diseases were acute leukemia (35.7%), lymphoma (31.7%), and solid tumors (16.5%). Two hundred thirty-seven (55.5%) patients had microbiologically documented infections, 141 (32.9%) clinically documented infections, and 50 (11.9%) fever of unknown origin. Acute noninfectious conditions were diagnosed in 175 of 428 (41%) patients, including 26 of 50 (52%) patients with fever of unknown origin, 66 of 141 (47%) patients with clinically documented infections, and 83 of 237 (35%) patients with microbiologically documented infections. Early indwelling catheter removal was performed routinely in the 107 (25%) patients without clinical evidence of a septic focus at intensive care unit admission. Early beta-lactam plus aminoglycoside therapy was used in 391 (91.3%) patients. Hospital mortality was 49.8%. Hospital mortality decreased from 58.7% (108 of 184) in 1998-2003 to 43% in 2004-2008 (105 of 244, p = .006). Multivariate analysis identified nine independent predictors of hospital mortality, of which six were associated with higher mortality (older age; need for vasopressors; neurologic, respiratory, or hepatic dysfunction; and acute noninfectious condition) and three with lower mortality (intensive care unit admission after 2003, combination antibiotic therapy including an aminoglycoside, and early indwelling catheter removal). CONCLUSION: In neutropenic patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, survival improved over time. Aminoglycoside use and early catheter removal in patients with undocumented sepsis may improve survival. Acute noninfectious conditions are associated with increased mortality, underlining the need for thorough and repeated clinical assessments.","['Legrand, Matthieu', 'Max, Adeline', 'Peigne, Vincent', 'Mariotte, Eric', 'Canet, Emmanuel', 'Debrumetz, Alexandre', 'Lemiale, Virginie', 'Seguin, Amelie', 'Darmon, Michael', 'Schlemmer, Benoit', 'Azoulay, Elie']","['Legrand M', 'Max A', 'Peigne V', 'Mariotte E', 'Canet E', 'Debrumetz A', 'Lemiale V', 'Seguin A', 'Darmon M', 'Schlemmer B', 'Azoulay E']","['Medical Intensive Care Unit, AP-HP, Saint-Louis Hospital, Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris, and University of Paris, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Crit Care Med,Critical care medicine,0355501,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aminoglycosides/therapeutic use', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Catheters, Indwelling/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units/statistics & numerical data', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neutropenia/complications/immunology/*mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sepsis/complications/immunology/*mortality', 'Shock, Septic/complications/immunology/*mortality']",,2011/09/20 06:00,2012/02/16 06:00,['2011/09/20 06:00'],"['2011/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CCM.0b013e31822b50c2 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Care Med. 2012 Jan;40(1):43-9. doi: 10.1097/CCM.0b013e31822b50c2.,,,,,,,,,['Crit Care Med. 2012 Jan;40(1):305-6.

FA patients typically display high cancer susceptibility and hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents such as cross-linkers and ionizing radiation. A key step in the activation of the FA pathway is monoubiquitination of the FancD2 protein. Here we report that the FA pathway is downregulated by two distinct mechanisms upon differentiation of THP-1 and HL-60 leukaemia cells into macrophages. Firstly, qRT-PCR analysis revealed a transcriptional downregulation of most components of the FA complex, including FancD2. Secondly, DNA damage-induced monoubiquitination of the remaining FancD2 became deficient at various stages of differentiation depending on the type of damage. This was attributed to the differentiation-induced downregulation of Chk1, which phosphorylates FancD2 as a prelude to its ubiquitination. Although Western blotting revealed that levels of FancD2 were greatly reduced in terminally differentiated macrophages and that FancD2 ubiquitination was abolished, double-strand breaks were proficiently repaired, likely through an increase in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). It has been suggested that the FA pathway promotes repair of double-strand breaks via homologous recombination rather than NHEJ. Its downregulation in macrophages may thus be required to avoid promoting a repair mechanism that is inefficient in post-mitotic cells.","['Lu, Wei-Ting', 'Lemonidis, Kimon', 'Drayton, Ross M', 'Nouspikel, Thierry']","['Lu WT', 'Lemonidis K', 'Drayton RM', 'Nouspikel T']","['Institute for Cancer Studies, University of Sheffield Medical School, Leicester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111001,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group D2 Protein)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)']",IM,"['*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA End-Joining Repair', '*Down-Regulation', 'Fanconi Anemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group D2 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Homologous Recombination', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Ubiquitination']",,2011/09/20 06:00,2012/03/20 06:00,['2011/09/20 06:00'],"['2011/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['17178 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.10.19.17178 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2011 Oct 1;10(19):3300-10. doi: 10.4161/cc.10.19.17178.

In this study, we carried out a genome-wide microRNA (miRNA) microarray analysis to determine the miRNA expression profiles and relapse-associated miRNA patterns in a panel of matched diagnosis-relapse or diagnosis-complete remission (CR) childhood ALL samples. A set of miRNAs differentially expressed either in relapsed patients or at diagnosis compared with CR was further validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in an independent sample set. Analysis of the predicted functions of target genes based on gene ontology 'biological process' categories revealed that the abnormally expressed miRNAs are associated with oncogenesis, classical multidrug resistance pathways and leukemic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation pathways. Several targets of the miRNAs associated with ALL relapse were experimentally validated, including FOXO3, BMI1 and E2F1. We further investigated the association of these dysregulated miRNAs with clinical outcome and confirmed significant associations for miR-708, miR-223 and miR-27a with individual relapse-free survival. Notably, miR-708 was also found to be associated with the in vivo glucocorticoid therapy response and with disease risk stratification. These miRNAs and their targets might be used to optimize anti-leukemic therapy, and serve as novel targets for development of new countermeasures of leukemia. This fundamental study may also contribute to establish the mechanisms of relapse in other cancers.","['Han, Bo-Wei', 'Feng, Dan-Dan', 'Li, Zhi-Gang', 'Luo, Xue-Qun', 'Zhang, Hua', 'Li, Xiao-Juan', 'Zhang, Xing-Ju', 'Zheng, Ling-Ling', 'Zeng, Cheng-Wu', 'Lin, Kang-Yu', 'Zhang, Peng', 'Xu, Ling', 'Chen, Yue-Qin']","['Han BW', 'Feng DD', 'Li ZG', 'Luo XQ', 'Zhang H', 'Li XJ', 'Zhang XJ', 'Zheng LL', 'Zeng CW', 'Lin KY', 'Zhang P', 'Xu L', 'Chen YQ']","['Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110917,England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (MIRN708 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Gene Regulatory Networks/genetics', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Recurrence', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",PMC3221537,2011/09/20 06:00,2012/03/09 06:00,['2011/09/20 06:00'],"['2011/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/09 06:00 [medline]']","['ddr428 [pii]', '10.1093/hmg/ddr428 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 2011 Dec 15;20(24):4903-15. doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddr428.

We report the outcome of allogeneic stem cell transplantation in 64 patients with documented BCR-ABL(T315I) mutations. Median follow-up was 52 months from mutation detection and 26 months from transplantation. At transplantation, 51.5% of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia were in the chronic phase and 4.5% were in advanced phases. Median overall survival after transplantation was 10.3 months (range 5.7 months to not reached [ie, still alive]) for those with chronic myeloid leukemia in the blast phase and 7.4 months (range 1.4 months to not reached [ie, still alive]) for those with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia but has not yet been reached for those in the chronic and accelerated phases of chronic myeloid leukemia. The occurrence of chronic GVHD had a positive impact on overall survival (P = .047). Transplant-related mortality rates were low. Multivariate analysis identified only blast phase at transplantation (hazard ratio 3.68, P = .0011) and unrelated stem cell donor (hazard ratio 2.98, P = .011) as unfavorable factors. We conclude that allogeneic stem cell transplantation represents a valuable therapeutic tool for eligible patients with BCR-ABL(T315I) mutation, a tool that may or may not be replaced by third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","['Nicolini, Franck Emmanuel', 'Basak, Grzegorz W', 'Soverini, Simona', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Mauro, Michael J', 'Muller, Martin C', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Chuah, Charles', 'Dufva, Inge H', 'Rege-Cambrin, Giovanna', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Labussiere, Helene', 'Morisset, Stephane', 'Hayette, Sandrine', 'Etienne, Gabriel', 'Olavarria, Eduardo', 'Zhou, Wei', 'Peter, Senaka', 'Apperley, Jane F', 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Nicolini FE', 'Basak GW', 'Soverini S', 'Martinelli G', 'Mauro MJ', 'Muller MC', 'Hochhaus A', 'Chuah C', 'Dufva IH', 'Rege-Cambrin G', 'Saglio G', 'Michallet M', 'Labussiere H', 'Morisset S', 'Hayette S', 'Etienne G', 'Olavarria E', 'Zhou W', 'Peter S', 'Apperley JF', 'Cortes J']","[""Hematology Department, Hopital Edouard Herriot, 5 place d'Arsonval, Lyon, France. franck-emmanuel.nicolini@chu- lyon.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110916,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*mortality', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*mortality', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",PMC4916555,2011/09/20 06:00,2012/01/17 06:00,['2011/09/20 06:00'],"['2011/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40348-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-07-367326 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Nov 17;118(20):5697-700. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-07-367326.

Here we show, for the first time, that both drugs might act most efficiently if they are applied on different days. Proof-of-concept studies in 18 cell lines revealed that anthracyclines inhibited cell death by Vinca alkaloids in 83% of cell lines. Importantly, in a preclinical mouse model, doxorubicin reduced the anti-tumor effect of vincristine. Both drugs acted in a sequence-dependent manner and the strongest anti-tumor effect was obtained if both drugs were applied on different days. Most notably for clinical relevance, in 34% of 35 fresh primary childhood leukemia cells tested in vitro, doxorubicin reduced the anti-tumor effect of vincristine. As underlying mechanism, doxorubicin activated p53, p53 induced cell-cycle arrest, and cell-cycle arrest disabled inactivation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members by vincristine; therefore, vincristine was unable to activate downstream apoptosis signaling. As molecular proof, antagonism was rescued by knockdown of p53, whereas knockdown of cyclin A inhibited vincristine-induced apoptosis. Our data suggest evaluating anthracyclines and Vinca alkaloids on different days in future trials.

They are expressed abundantly in a variety of human carcinoma cells controlling survival, growth, and migration. These characteristics are the basis for recent interest in the channel as a target for cancer therapeutics. We screened a chemical library of marine organism-derived extracts and identified waixenicin A from the soft coral Sarcothelia edmondsoni as a strong inhibitor of overexpressed and native TRPM7. Waixenicin A activity was cytosolic and potentiated by intracellular free magnesium (Mg(2+)) concentration. Mutating a Mg(2+) binding site on the TRPM7 kinase domain reduced the potency of the compound, whereas kinase deletion enhanced its efficacy independent of Mg(2+). Waixenicin A failed to inhibit the closely homologous TRPM6 channel and did not significantly affect TRPM2, TRPM4, and Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) current channels. Therefore, waixenicin A represents the first potent and relatively specific inhibitor of TRPM7 ion channels. Consistent with TRPM7 inhibition, the compound blocked cell proliferation in human Jurkat T-cells and rat basophilic leukemia cells. Based on the ability of the compound to inhibit cell proliferation through Mg(2+)-dependent block of TRPM7, waixenicin A, or structural analogs may have cancer-specific therapeutic potential, particularly because certain cancers accumulate cytosolic Mg(2+).","['Zierler, Susanna', 'Yao, Guangmin', 'Zhang, Zheng', 'Kuo, W Cedric', 'Porzgen, Peter', 'Penner, Reinhold', 'Horgen, F David', 'Fleig, Andrea']","['Zierler S', 'Yao G', 'Zhang Z', 'Kuo WC', 'Porzgen P', 'Penner R', 'Horgen FD', 'Fleig A']","[""The Queen's Medical Center and John A.

The Mira gene is located in the spacer DNA region (SDR) separating Hoxa6 and Hoxa7, transcriptionally silent in mESCs, and activated by retinoic acid. Mira-mediated recruitment of MLL1 to the Mira gene triggers dynamic changes in chromosome conformation, culminating in activation of Hoxa6 and Hoxa7 transcription. Hoxa6 and Hoxa7 activate the expression of genes involved in germ layer specification during mESC differentiation in a cooperative and redundant fashion. Our results connect the lncRNA Mira with the recruitment of MLL1 to target genes and implicate lncRNAs in epigenetic activation of gene expression during vertebrate cell-fate determination.","['Bertani, Stephane', 'Sauer, Silvia', 'Bolotin, Eugene', 'Sauer, Frank']","['Bertani S', 'Sauer S', 'Bolotin E', 'Sauer F']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of California, Riverside, Riverside, CA 92521, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",,United States,Mol Cell,Molecular cell,9802571,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxa6 protein, mouse)', '0 (Hoxa7 protein, mouse)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Untranslated)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Untranslated/*physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation/genetics']",PMC3176448,2011/09/20 06:00,2011/11/08 06:00,['2011/09/20 06:00'],"['2011/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/20 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S1097-2765(11)00637-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.molcel.2011.08.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell. 2011 Sep 16;43(6):1040-6. doi: 10.1016/j.molcel.2011.08.019.,,,,"['R01 GM073776/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM073776-05/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM073776/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The key challenge is to improve immune recovery with allogeneic donor T cells without triggering GvHD. As T regulatory cells (Tregs) controlled GvHD in pre-clinical studies, the present study evaluated the impact of an infusion of donor CD4/CD25 + Tregs, followed by an inoculum of donor mature T cells (Tcons) and positively immunoselected CD34 + cells in the setting of haploidentical stem cell transplantation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight patients were enrolled in this study (22 AML; 5 ALL; 1 NHL). All received immunoselected Tregs (CliniMACS, Miltenyi Biotec) followed by positively immunoselected CD34 + cells together with Tcons 4 days later. No GvHD prophylaxis was administered. RESULTS: 26/28 patients engrafted. No acute GvHD developed in 24/26 patients; 2 developed >/= grade II acute GvHD. No patient has developed chronic GvHD. CD4 and CD8 counts rapidly increased after transplant. Episodes of CMV reactivation were significantly fewer than in controls. CONCLUSIONS: In the setting of haploidentical transplantation infusion of Tregs makes administration of a high dose of T cells feasible. This strategy provides a long-term protection from GvHD and robust immune reconstitution.","['Di Ianni, Mauro', 'Falzetti, Franca', 'Carotti, Alessandra', 'Terenzi, Adelmo', 'Del Papa, Beatrice', 'Perruccio, Katia', 'Ruggeri, Loredana', 'Sportoletti, Paolo', 'Rosati, Emanuela', 'Marconi, Pierfrancesco', 'Falini, Brunangelo', 'Reisner, Yair', 'Velardi, Andrea', 'Aversa, Franco', 'Martelli, Massimo F']","['Di Ianni M', 'Falzetti F', 'Carotti A', 'Terenzi A', 'Del Papa B', 'Perruccio K', 'Ruggeri L', 'Sportoletti P', 'Rosati E', 'Marconi P', 'Falini B', 'Reisner Y', 'Velardi A', 'Aversa F', 'Martelli MF']","['Hematology and Clinical Immunology Section, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Perugia, Italy. mauro.diianni@cc.univaq.it']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110629,Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

Toxicities from IL-2 were transient fever, fatigue and local inflammation. In one patient GvHD grade III with no clear association to IL-2 administration occurred. IL-2 administration was started at median day 57 (range 13-154) post-transplant for a mean duration of 28 days (range 15-250). IL-2 administration clearly increased NK cell activity. 3 of 11 patients (ALL, AML, multifocal Ewings sarcoma) survived with a follow-up of ten years. In conclusion, long-term low-dose IL-2 subcutaneous application is feasible in children due to a low side effect profile even after HLA mismatched transplantation and may be a strategy to prevent relapse in pediatric malignancies with extremely high risk of relapse.","['Schlegel, Patrick', 'Teltschik, Heiko-Manuel', 'Pfeiffer, Matthias', 'Handgretinger, Rupert', 'Schumm, Michael', 'Koscielniak, Ewa', 'Feuchtinger, Tobias', 'Klingebiel, Thomas', 'Bader, Peter', 'Schlegel, Paul-Gerhard', 'Greil, Johann', 'Lang, Peter']","['Schlegel P', 'Teltschik HM', 'Pfeiffer M', 'Handgretinger R', 'Schumm M', 'Koscielniak E', 'Feuchtinger T', 'Klingebiel T', 'Bader P', 'Schlegel PG', 'Greil J', 'Lang P']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital Tuebingen, University of Tuebingen, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110625,Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

The ability to direct polyclonal T cells to a single antigenic specificity is a powerful tool with which to probe anti-tumour immune responses, and in turn ask which tumour antigens represent the best targets for immune therapy. The intracellular components of TCR signalling pathways can also be manipulated to optimise anti-tumour responses. Such manipulated T cells may in the future represent an important adjunctive therapy alongside allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT), in order to specifically boost a graft versus leukaemia (GVL) effect. In addition, the ability to confer a suppressive phenotype to CD4 cells or to engineer a susceptibility gene into effector cells provides new therapeutic avenues for graft versus host disease (GVHD), the most challenging adverse effect arising post ASCT. Within this review, mechanisms of GVL and GVHD are discussed and we consider how they may be separated through T cell gene engineering.

Historically, more emphasis was given to the intensity of conditioning. Over the last decade the pendulum turned more towards induction of GvL as the primary goal. A plethora of non-myeloablative (NMA) and reduced-intensity conditioning regimens (RIC) were introduced trying to reduce transplant-related toxicities and allow SCT in elderly and medically infirm patients. In addition, reduced-toxicity myeloablative regimens (RTC) based on fludarabine and myeloablative alkylating-agent doses were designed to allow safer administration of dose-intensive therapy. Conditioning dose-intensity is highly correlated with outcome after SCT. Increased dose-intensity is associated with reduced relapse risk, but also with higher non-relapse mortality. Overall outcome is determined by the net effect of these opposing effects as may be predicted by patient age, comorbidities and disease status at transplantation. Retrospective comparative trials showed that while outcome may be similar with the various regimens in patients given SCT in remission, NMA/RIC are inferior when SCT is given in advanced disease, due to high relapse risk. RTC regimens may be more effective in this setting yet better tolerated by patients not eligible for myeloablative conditioning. Randomized studies are needed to define the role of different regimens. Future studies will also focus on the design of more accurate models to select the best regimen in each setting. A search for novel regimens or post-transplant approaches with more intensive anti-leukemic activity, but limited toxicity will also be of marked benefit.","['Shimoni, Avichai', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Shimoni A', 'Nagler A']","['Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel. ashimoni@sheba.health.gov.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20110624,Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

Worldwide, it is estimated there are 15-20 million HTLV-1-infected individuals; although the majority of HTLV-1-infected individuals remain asymptomatic carriers (AC) during their lifetime, 2-5% of AC develops either ATL or HAM/TSP, but never both. Regardless of asymptomatic status or clinical outcome, HTLV-1 carriers are at high risk of opportunistic infection. The progression to pathological HTLV-1 disease is in part attributed to the failure of the innate and adaptive immune system to control virus spread. The innate immune response against retroviral infection requires recognition of viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) through pattern-recognition receptors (PRR) dependent pathways, leading to the induction of host antiviral and inflammatory responses. Recent studies have begun to characterize the interplay between HTLV-1 infection and the innate immune response and have identified distinct gene expression profiles in patients with ATL or HAM/TSP--upregulation of growth regulatory pathways in ATL and constitutive activation of antiviral and inflammatory pathways in HAM/STP. In this review, we provide an overview of the replicative lifecycle of HTLV-1 and the distinct pathologies associated with HTLV-1 infection. We also explore the innate immune mechanisms that respond to HTLV-1 infection, the strategies used by HTLV-1 to subvert these defenses and their contribution to HTLV-1-associated diseases.","['Oliere, Stephanie', 'Douville, Renee', 'Sze, Alexandre', 'Belgnaoui, S Mehdi', 'Hiscott, John']","['Oliere S', 'Douville R', 'Sze A', 'Belgnaoui SM', 'Hiscott J']","['Molecular Oncology Group, Lady Davis Institute-Jewish General Hospital, and Department of Microbiology, McGill University, Montreal, Canada H3T 1E2.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20110915,England,Cytokine Growth Factor Rev,Cytokine & growth factor reviews,9612306,"['0 (Receptors, Pattern Recognition)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Innate', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/epidemiology/*immunology', 'Opportunistic Infections/epidemiology/immunology', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/epidemiology/*immunology', 'Receptors, Pattern Recognition/immunology']",,2011/09/20 06:00,2012/03/16 06:00,['2011/09/20 06:00'],"['2011/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S1359-6101(11)00042-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cytogfr.2011.08.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2011 Aug;22(4):197-210. doi: 10.1016/j.cytogfr.2011.08.002.

This unique animal model for meningeal leukemia should facilitate studies of engraftment and proliferation of leukemic cells in the BM and their invasion of the CNS as well as pre-clinical evaluation of experimental therapeutics for CNS-associated leukemias.","['Macpherson, Gordon R', 'Hanson, Charlotte A', 'Thompson, Delores M', 'Perella, Christine M', 'Cmarik, Joan L', 'Ruscetti, Sandra K']","['Macpherson GR', 'Hanson CA', 'Thompson DM', 'Perella CM', 'Cmarik JL', 'Ruscetti SK']","['Laboratory of Cancer Prevention, National Cancer Institute-Frederick, Frederick, MD 21702-1201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20110915,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrin alpha5beta1)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (vascular endothelial growth factor A, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/blood supply/etiology/*pathology', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Integrin alpha5beta1/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology/*pathology', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/blood supply/etiology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism']",PMC3264761,2011/09/20 06:00,2012/03/07 06:00,['2011/09/20 06:00'],"['2011/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/15 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(11)00419-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2011.08.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2012 Mar;36(3):369-76. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2011.08.019.

Cell-to-cell contact and Tax-induced clonal expansion of infected cells are the main modes of virus replication, making virus detection during the viremic stage difficult. Consequently, the proviral load is the current virologic marker for disease monitoring, but the mechanisms of progression have not been established yet. Thus, this study investigated the presence of virus in plasma from asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers and from HAM/TSP patients. Real-time PCR was performed on DNA from 150 plasma samples; 12 (8%) had detectable DNA amplification, including 6 (4%) asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers and 14 (26%) HAM/TSP patients (p<0.005). Of the 33 samples submitted for nested PCR, six (18%, p=0.02) were positive for HTLV-1 RNA in the plasma. Additionally, 26 plasma samples were treated with DNAse enzyme to eliminate any DNA contamination before RNA extraction. Two of them (8%) showed amplification for HTLV-1 (p=0.5). Therefore, this study described for the first time the detection of free HTLV-1 RNA in plasma from HTLV-1-infected subjects, regardless of their clinical status. Thus, HTLV-1 viral replication does occur in plasma, and other transmission pathways for HTLV-1 should be investigated further.","['Cabral, Fabio', 'Arruda, Lia Barbara', 'de Araujo, Marilia Ladeira', 'Montanheiro, Patricia', 'Smid, Jerusa', 'de Oliveira, Augusto Cesar Penalva', 'Duarte, Alberto J S', 'Casseb, Jorge']","['Cabral F', 'Arruda LB', 'de Araujo ML', 'Montanheiro P', 'Smid J', 'de Oliveira AC', 'Duarte AJ', 'Casseb J']","['Laboratory of Immunodeficiencies and Dermatology, Sao Paulo University Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil. fabioabcabral@yahoo.com.br']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110908,Netherlands,Virus Res,Virus research,8410979,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Carrier State/*virology', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Plasma/*virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Viral/*blood', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2011/09/20 06:00,2012/05/05 06:00,['2011/09/20 06:00'],"['2011/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/19 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0168-1702(11)00317-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virusres.2011.08.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Virus Res. 2012 Jan;163(1):87-90. doi: 10.1016/j.virusres.2011.08.014.

Whereas curcumin has both a Michael acceptor and a Michael donor units, its analogues dibenzoylmethane (DBM, a component of licorice) and dibenzoylpropane (DBP) have a Michael donor but not a Michael acceptor unit, and the analogue dibenzylideneacetone (DBA) has a Michael acceptor unit. In the current report, we investigated the potency of DBM, DBP, and DBA in relation to curcumin for their ability to suppress TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation, NF-kappaB-regulated gene products, and cell proliferation. We found that all four agents were active in suppressing NF-kappaB activation; curcumin was most active and DBM was least active. When examined for its ability to inhibit the direct DNA binding activity of p65, a subunit of NF-kappaB, only DBP inhibited the binding. For inhibition of TNF-induced IKK activation, DBA was most active. For suppression of TNF-induced expression of NF-kappaB-regulated gene products such as COX-2 (inflammation marker), cyclin D1 (proliferation marker), and VEGF (angiogenesis marker), DBA and curcumin were more active than DBM. Similarly for suppression of proliferation of leukemia (KBM-5), T cell leukemia (Jurkat), prostate (DU145), and breast (MDA-MB-231) cancer cells, curcumin and DBA were most active and DBP was least active. Overall, our results indicate that although curcumin and its analogues exhibit activities to suppress inflammatory pathways and cellular proliferation, a lack of Michael acceptor units in DBM and DBP can reduce their activities.","['Anand, Preetha', 'Sung, Bokyung', 'Kunnumakkara, Ajaikumar B', 'Rajasekharan, Kallikat N', 'Aggarwal, Bharat B']","['Anand P', 'Sung B', 'Kunnumakkara AB', 'Rajasekharan KN', 'Aggarwal BB']","['Cytokine Research Laboratory, Department of Experimental Therapeutics, Unit 1950, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",20110908,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Angiogenic Proteins)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Chalcones)', '0 (Pentanones)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (dibenzoylpropane)', '9QXO7BCY9L (dibenzylidene acetone)', 'ANS7ME8OKC (dibenzoylmethane)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP kinase kinase kinase 7)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Angiogenic Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chalcones/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Curcumin/analogs & derivatives/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Structure', 'Pentanones/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3216474,2011/09/20 06:00,2012/01/10 06:00,['2011/09/20 06:00'],"['2011/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/01 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(11)00681-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2011.09.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2011 Dec 15;82(12):1901-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2011.09.001.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains 1 of the best options to cure T-ALL. However, many patients cannot find an HLA-matched donor. Our institute established a new protocol for haplo-identical HSCT. Busulfan, cyclophosphamide, cytosine arabinoside, and methyl CCNU plus antithymocyte globulin was used for conditioning therapy. Seventy-two patients diagnosed with T-ALL underwent transplantation from haploidentical donor family members. The incidence rates of grades II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) and of grades III and IV aGVHD were 49% +/- 12% and 19% +/- 12%, respectively. The cumulative incidence rate for chronic GVHD (cGVHD) at 2 years after HSCT was 41% +/- 12%. After a median follow-up of 12 months, 15 patients had relapsed, 14 died from relapse, and 41 patients were still alive without disease recurrence. The probability of leukemia-free survival (LFS) was 44.2% +/- 7.4% at 3 years. Patients transplanted during their first complete remission (CR1) had a lower relapse rate (18.8% versus 37.5%, P = .049, with a relative risk [RR] = 0.247, P = .007), a lower nonrelapse mortality (NRM) rate (16.6% versus 50.0%, P = .046, with an RR = 0.279, P = .024), and better LFS (54.8% versus 12.5%, P = .001, with an RR = 0.315, P = .004) compared with patients transplanted beyond CR1.

METHODS: The clinical data of 174 children with pancytopenia between September 2003 and January 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Pale face was the most common clinical manifestation (147 cases, 84.5%), followed by bleeding (87 cases, 50.0%) and fever (41 cases, 23.6%). Mild to moderate anemia, severe thrombocytopenia and mild leucopenia were common in complete blood count. Of the 174 children, pancytopenia was attributed to hematopoietic system diseases in 155 cases (89.1%) and non-hematopoietic system diseases (virus infections, systemic lupus erythematosus, hypersplenism and neuroblastoma) in 6 cases (3.4%). Aplastic anemia (91 cases, 52.3%) was the most common cause of pancytopenia, followed by myelodysplastic syndrome (37 cases, 21.3%), acute leukemia and other hematological tumours (11 cases, 6.3%) and hemophagocytic syndrome (6 cases, 3.4%). The cause of pancytopenia was not identified in 13 cases (7.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Anemia, bleeding and fever are the main clinical manifestations of pancytopenia in children.

In Italy, the assistance to children suffering from cancer is assured by the current network of 54 centres members of the Italian Association of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology (AIEOP), which has kept records of all demographic and clinical data in the database of Mod.1.01 Registry since 1989. METHODS: We used the information stored in the already mentioned database to assess the impact of immigration of foreign children with cancer on centres' activity, with the scope of drawing a map of the assistance to these cases. RESULTS: Out of 14,738 cases recorded by all centres in the period from 1999 to 2008, 92.2% were born and resident in Italy, 4.1% (608) were born abroad and living abroad and 3.7% (538) were born abroad and living in Italy. Foreign children cases have increased over the years from 2.5% in 1999 to. 8.1% in 2008.Most immigrant children came from Europe (65.7%), whereas patients who came from America, Asia and Oceania amounted to 13.2%, 10.1%, 0.2%, respectively. The immigrant survival rate was lower compared to that of children who were born in Italy. This is especially true for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia patients entered an AIEOP protocol, who showed a 10-years survival rate of 71.0% vs. 80.7% (p < 0.001) for immigrants and patients born in Italy, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Children and adolescents are an increasingly important part of the immigration phenomenon, which occurs in many parts of the world. In Italy the vast majority of children affected by malignancies are treated in AIEOP centres. Since immigrant children are predominantly treated in northern Italy, these centres have developed a special expertise in treating immigrant patients, which is certainly very useful for the entire AIEOP network.","['Rondelli, Roberto', 'Dini, Giorgio', 'De Rosa, Marisa', 'Quarello, Paola', 'Bisogno, Gianni', 'Arico, Maurizio', 'Vasconcelos, Carivaldo', 'Tamaro, Paolo', 'Casazza, Gabriella', 'Zecca, Marco', 'De Laurentis, Clementina', 'Porta, Fulvio', 'Pession, Andrea']","['Rondelli R', 'Dini G', 'De Rosa M', 'Quarello P', 'Bisogno G', 'Arico M', 'Vasconcelos C', 'Tamaro P', 'Casazza G', 'Zecca M', 'De Laurentis C', 'Porta F', 'Pession A']","['Paediatric Oncology-Haematology Lalla Seragnoli, Policlinico S.Orsola-Malpighi, Bologna, Italy. roberto.rondelli@aosp.bo.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110918,England,Ital J Pediatr,Italian journal of pediatrics,101510759,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Africa/ethnology', 'Asia/ethnology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Databases, Factual', 'Emigrants and Immigrants/*statistics & numerical data', 'Ethnicity/statistics & numerical data', 'Europe, Eastern/ethnology', 'European Union/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*ethnology/mortality', 'North America/ethnology', 'Oceania/ethnology', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'South America/ethnology', 'Survival Rate']",PMC3189490,2011/09/20 06:00,2012/02/22 06:00,['2011/09/20 06:00'],"['2011/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1824-7288-37-44 [pii]', '10.1186/1824-7288-37-44 [doi]']",epublish,Ital J Pediatr. 2011 Sep 18;37:44. doi: 10.1186/1824-7288-37-44.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four yr later, he had a BM relapse and after induction and consolidation chemotherapy, he received a second HSCT from an unrelated donor using peripheral blood stem cells. His second post-transplant course was complicated by extensive chronic GVHD involving the skin, oral cavity, and lungs, which was treated with tacrolimus and corticosteroid.

METHODS: Within a 12-month study period, cats that were presented with focal anterior cortical or mature cataract and secondary uveitis underwent a complete ophthalmic examination, complete blood count, serum biochemistry, serologic tests for E. cuniculi and tests for feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii). PCR for DNA detection of E. cuniculi and T. gondii as well as cytologic examination of aqueous humor after paracentesis and phacoemulsified lens material were also performed. In addition histopathologic examination of the resected anterior lens capsule and attached lens epithelial cells was performed. Serologic testing for antibodies against E. cuniculi was also performed in 100 ophthalmologically healthy cats. RESULTS: Eleven (19 eyes) European shorthair cats with a median age of 3.5 years were included. Nine of 11 cats had bilateral cataracts, with 12/19 eyes having focal anterior cortical cataracts and 7/19 eyes having mature cataracts. In 14/19 eyes anterior uveitis was present. All cats had a positive antibody titer (1:80-1:10,000) for E. cuniculi. Encephalitozoon cuniculi DNA was detected by PCR and sequencing in 18/19 lenses and in 10/19 aqueous samples. Five tentative positive results were detected by cytologic examination. Spores were detected in 15/19 samples of lens material with histopathologic staining. Only 2/100 ophthalmologically healthy cats showed a positive antibody titer for E. cuniculi. CONCLUSION: Encephalitozoon cuniculi is a cause of focal anterior cortical cataract and anterior uveitis in cats.","['Benz, Petra', 'Maass, Gunter', 'Csokai, Jacqueline', 'Fuchs-Baumgartinger, Andrea', 'Schwendenwein, Ilse', 'Tichy, Alexander', 'Nell, Barbara']","['Benz P', 'Maass G', 'Csokai J', 'Fuchs-Baumgartinger A', 'Schwendenwein I', 'Tichy A', 'Nell B']","['Department for Companion Animals and Horses, Veterinary University, Vienna, Austria. petra.benz@vetmeduni.ac.at']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Vet Ophthalmol,Veterinary ophthalmology,100887377,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cat Diseases/diagnosis/*microbiology/pathology', 'Cataract/diagnosis/microbiology/*veterinary', 'Cats', '*Encephalitozoon cuniculi', 'Encephalitozoonosis/complications/diagnosis/pathology/*veterinary', 'Female', 'Lens, Crystalline/*microbiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Toxoplasma', 'Toxoplasmosis, Animal/diagnosis', 'Uveitis/diagnosis/microbiology/veterinary']",,2011/10/26 06:00,2012/01/14 06:00,['2011/09/20 06:00'],"['2011/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1463-5224.2011.00873.x [doi]'],ppublish,Vet Ophthalmol. 2011 Sep;14 Suppl 1:37-47. doi: 10.1111/j.1463-5224.2011.00873.x.,,,,,['(c) 2011 American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists.'],,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we showed that the Galphaq expressions at mRNA and protein levels in the peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were significantly decreased in comparison of which in healthy individuals. The expression levels of Galphaq mRNA in PBLs from patients with RA were correlated with RA disease activity (DAS28), anti-cyclic citrullinated protein antibodies, C-reactive protein and rheumatoid factor. We also demonstrated that Galphaq controlled the apoptosis of RA PBLs through regulating the activity of Mcl-1 and caspase-3.

The treatment of these malignancies is hampered by therapy-associated toxicity and infectious complications. This retrospective analysis evaluated the therapy outcome of 38 children with Ataxia teleangiectasia or Nijmegen-breakage syndrome with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL, n = 9), Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL, n = 28) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL, n = 1). All patients with NHL or ALL were treated in accordance to Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM)- or Co-operative study group for childhood ALL (CoALL)-oriented chemotherapy schedules. 22 patients received significantly reduced-intensity chemotherapy. After a median follow-up of 3.7 years the 10-year overall survival was 58%. Dosage-reduction of chemotherapeutic drugs seemed to have no disadvantages and reduced toxic side effects. On the other hand, reduced-intensity chemotherapy did not prevent second malignancies, which occurred in ten patients with a 10-year incidence of 25%. After individual treatment approaches three of these patients with second malignancies were in complete clinical remission for more than 5 years.

Expression of T/Natural Killer-cell antigens, however, has rarely been reported in B-ALL (TAg+ B-ALL), and the significance of this aberrant antigen expression is unclear. We thus analysed the frequency of TAg+ B-ALL at our institution and investigated its significance in the context of immunophenotypes, cytogenetic/molecular findings, and prognosis. We reviewed 134 consecutive cases of B-ALL and found 18 cases (13.4%) of TAg+ B-ALL. The most common aberrant T-cell antigens expressed were CD2, CD5, and CD7 at equivalent rates (each in six cases), CD4 (two cases), and CD56 (three cases). Adverse cytogenetic abnormalities were seen in a significantly larger proportion of the TAg+ cases (72.2%) than the TAg- cases (32.2%; P = 0.003). Multivariate Cox-regression analysis showed that the risk of relapse over time was higher in the TAg+ cases, independent of high risk status (based on age and white blood cell count) and the presence of adverse cytogenetic abnormalities (hazard ratio = 2.256, P = 0.065). These findings suggest that T-cell antigen expression in B-ALL may be an independent predictor of poor prognosis, and a useful marker to identify patients at increased risk for relapse and for harbouring adverse cytogenetic abnormalities.","['Hussein, Shafinaz', 'Gill, Kamraan Z', 'Sireci, Anthony N', 'Colovai, Adriana I', 'Small, Tania', 'Emmons, Foxwell N', 'Murty, Vundavalli V', 'Bhagat, Govind', 'Alobeid, Bachir']","['Hussein S', 'Gill KZ', 'Sireci AN', 'Colovai AI', 'Small T', 'Emmons FN', 'Murty VV', 'Bhagat G', 'Alobeid B']","['Department of Pathology, Columbia University Medical Center and New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110919,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Viral, Tumor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Antigens, Viral, Tumor/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Young Adult']",,2011/09/20 06:00,2012/03/02 06:00,['2011/09/20 06:00'],"['2011/09/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08870.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2011 Nov;155(4):449-56. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08870.x.

Acute renal impairment is reported with clofarabine; however, it is more likely to occur in patients with confounding factors that may underlie the adverse event. We describe a 65-year-old man treated with clofarabine for relapsed acute myeloid leukemia who experienced severe acute kidney injury and proteinuria temporally related to clofarabine administration. The morning after completion of clofarabine administration, his serum creatinine concentration increased to approximately 1.4-fold above his baseline value, and peaked at 2.8-3.6-fold over baseline within 72 hours. A 24-hour urine collection contained 4100 mg of protein. His serum creatinine concentration gradually returned to within 1.5 times his baseline value. Examination of the patient's clinical course, vital signs, and laboratory results did not yield any compelling evidence of alternative causes for acute kidney injury. The patient's comorbidities included a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35-40% and diabetes mellitus. His drug therapy with potential renal effects-lisinopril, furosemide, tobramycin, allopurinol, and valacyclovir-that preceded clofarabine administration was evaluated, and none was determined to be a major factor in the development of this adverse event. Bone marrow evaluations were negative for residual leukemia after clofarabine therapy. After approximately 11 weeks of hospitalization, the patient and his family made an informed decision to continue supportive care at home. Acute kidney injury in this patient was attributed to clofarabine administration due to the time course of events with respect to potential contributing factors. Use of the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicated a probable relationship (score of 7) between the patient's development of renal effects and clofarabine therapy.

The antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities of NAE against skin pathogens were examined to determine the protective properties against acne vulgaris. NAE exhibited moderate to strong antibacterial activity against drug-susceptible and -resistant Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis, which are known as acne-causing bacteria. In addition, NAE reduced the P. acnes-induced secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in THP-1 cells, highlighting its anti-inflammatory effects. The DPPH radical scavenging activities of NAE also revealed moderate antioxidant properties (IC50, 21.3 microL/mL).

Here we describe a novel role for the pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor one (PBX1) in adipocyte development using both mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and human multipotent adipose-derived stem (hMADS) cells. We show that Pbx1(-/-) mESCs are unable to generate adipocytes, despite normal expression of neuroectoderm and neural crest (NC) markers. Early adipocyte lineage markers are not induced in Pbx1(-/-) mESCs, suggesting that Pbx1 controls the generation and/or the maintenance of adipocyte progenitors (APs) from the NC. We further characterize the function of PBX1 in postnatal adipogenesis and show that silencing of PBX1 expression in hMADS cells reduces their proliferation by preventing their entry in the S phase of the cell cycle. Furthermore, it promotes differentiation of hMADS cells into adipocytes and partially substitutes for glucocorticoids and rosiglitazone, two key proadipogenic agents. These effects involve direct modulation of PPARgamma activity, most likely through regulation of the biosynthesis of PPARgamma natural endogenous ligand(s). Together, our data suggest that PBX1 regulates adipocyte development at multiple levels, promoting the generation of NC-derived APs during embryogenesis, while favoring APs proliferation and preventing their commitment to the adipocyte lineage in postnatal life.","['Monteiro, Miguel C', 'Sanyal, Mrinmoy', 'Cleary, Michael L', 'Sengenes, Coralie', 'Bouloumie, Anne', 'Dani, Christian', 'Billon, Nathalie']","['Monteiro MC', 'Sanyal M', 'Cleary ML', 'Sengenes C', 'Bouloumie A', 'Dani C', 'Billon N']","['CNRS, IBDC, Nice, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adipocytes/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",,2011/09/17 06:00,2012/05/30 06:00,['2011/09/17 06:00'],"['2011/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.737 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2011 Nov;29(11):1837-48. doi: 10.1002/stem.737.,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2011 AlphaMed Press.'],,,,,,,"['Stem Cells. 2012 Mar;30(3):585.

METHODS: Microarray analyses were performed in AML cell line HL-60 cells exposed to the demethylating agent 5-aza-2dC. The methylation status and expression of glioma pathogenesis-related protein 1 (GLIPR1), one of highly induced genes by demethylation, were further detected in six hematopoietic malignancy cell lines and 260 bone marrow samples from leukemia patients and nonmalignant diseases as control, as well as pre-treated and post-treated bone marrow samples from 24 complete remission AML patients received chemotherapy using MS-PCR, bisulfite DNA sequencing, RT-PCR, and Western blotting. RESULTS: One hundred and nine genes were significantly induced by demethylation in HL-60 cells, 12 genes of which were confirmed by RT-PCR. GLIPR1, a tumor suppressor gene, was frequently methylation-silenced in AML cell lines and AML patients, but not in the other hematopoietic malignancy cell lines and patients. The frequencies of methylation-silenced GLIPR1 in the pre-treatment were significantly higher than those in the post-treatment in complete remission AML patients. CONCLUSION: We identify 109 genes induced by demethylation in HL-60 cells, and demonstrate that GLIPR1 is a methylation-silenced gene in the AML patients, and may serve as a marker for monitoring disease activity during therapy in the AML patients. The data provide the important information for studying the pathogenesis of AML and discovering the target genes of methylating agents.","['Xiao, Yan-Hua', 'Li, Xin-Hui', 'Tan, Tan', 'Liang, Ting', 'Yi, Hong', 'Li, Mao-Yu', 'Zeng, Gu-Qing', 'Wan, Xun-Xun', 'Qu, Jia-Quan', 'He, Qiu-Yan', 'Li, Jian-Huang', 'Chen, Yu', 'Xiao, Zhi-Qiang']","['Xiao YH', 'Li XH', 'Tan T', 'Liang T', 'Yi H', 'Li MY', 'Zeng GQ', 'Wan XX', 'Qu JQ', 'He QY', 'Li JH', 'Chen Y', 'Xiao ZQ']","['Key Laboratory of Cancer Proteomics of Chinese Ministry of Health, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, 410008, Hunan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110916,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (GLIPR1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*DNA Methylation', 'Female', '*Gene Silencing', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2011/09/17 06:00,2011/12/16 06:00,['2011/09/17 06:00'],"['2011/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00432-011-1065-2 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2011 Dec;137(12):1831-40. doi: 10.1007/s00432-011-1065-2.

We compared FCR and PCR in previously-untreated or minimally-treated B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). TREATMENT: FCR (F 20 mg/m(2) Days 1-5, C 600 mg/m(2) Day 1, R 375 mg/m(2) Day 1) (28-day cycles) or PCR (P 4 mg/m(2) Day 1, C 600 mg/m(2) Day 1, R 375 mg/m(2) Day 1) (21-day cycles). Dose 1 of R: 100 mg/m(2) was given on Day 8 Cycle 1 and the remainder on Day 9; in subsequent cycles the entire dose was given on Day 1. RESULTS: Ninety-two patients were randomly assigned to each group (N = 184). Groups were balanced; ~20% had received prior chemotherapy. The infection rate (FCR/PCR) was 31%/36%, the infective event rate was 38%/45%; 30 (35%)/37 (44%) patients were hospitalized; total hospitalization days was 271/404. 12 (14%)/6 (7%) patients achieved complete remissions (CR); the overall response rate (ORR) including CR+nodular PR (nPR)+PR was 59%/49%. Grade 3-4 treatment related AEs: neutropenia (69%/57%), leukopenia (34%/17%), thrombocytopenia (13%/6%). Grade 3-4 infections: febrile neutropenia (8%/6%), fever (2%/6%), infection (1%/3%), urinary tract infection (1%/0%), pneumonia (3%/1%), and sepsis (1%/2%); 5 deaths (1 FCR/4 PCR) were treatment-related. CONCLUSIONS: PCR and FCR have significant activity in CLL and can be given safely in the community setting despite significant toxicity. ORRs were lower than expected; the CR rate was higher (NS) with FCR.

Histologically, MRTs are characterized by immunohistochemical evidence of primitive neuroectodermal, mesenchymal, and epithelial differentiation. The ability of MRTs to differentiate along multiple lines, as evidenced by both histologic features and polyphenotypic immunohistochemical staining, and the proliferative nature of MRT cells are characteristics shared with the self-renewal and plasticity of embryonic stem cells (ES). To test the hypothesis that MRTs share similarities with ES, we used immunohistochemistry to evaluate the expression of various stem cell markers in a tissue microarray containing 26 AT/RTs and 16 non-central nervous system MRTs (NCMRTs). Staining intensity was scored as negative (0), low (1+), moderate (2+), and strong (3+) and was multiplied by the percentage of positive tumor cells to establish a semiquantitative measure for each marker.

Similarly, in NCMRT, expression was noted with glypican-3 (12 of 16, 75%), Sall4 (13 of 16, 81%), T-cell leukemia/lymphoma 1 (16 of 16, 100%), undifferentiated embryonic cell transcription factor 1 (12 of 16, 75%), Sox2 (5 of 16, 31%), Nanog (8 of 16, 50%), Klf4 (8 of 16, 50%), Zfp206 (13 of 16, 81%), and musashi-1 (11 of 16, 75%). Placental alkaline phosphatase, Oct4, c-KIT, CD30, alpha-fetoprotein, and beta- -human chorionic gonadotrophin were not expressed in all cases. Markers that regulate the expression of stem cell transcription factors were also expressed in MRT. AT/RT cases showed expression of Id proteins: Id1 (17 of 26, 65%), Id2 (24 of 26, 92%), Id3 (22 of 26, 85%), and Id4 (22 of 26, 85%). Low expression was observed with EZH2 (15 of 26, 58%). Similarly, NCMRT cases showed expression of Id1 (15 of 16, 94%), Id2 (16 of 16, 100%), Id3 (16 of 16, 100%), Id4 (13 of 16, 81%), and EZH2 (13 of 16, 81%). Finally, regression analysis revealed a significant relationship between the expression of stem cell markers and EZH2 (P<0.0001), Id1 (P=0.0087), Id2 (P=0.0002), Id3 (P=0.0033), and Id4 (P<0.0001). These data suggest that MRTs express many stem cell-associated transcription factors, which may be regulated by the expression of EZH2 and the Id family of proteins. This study underscores similarities between MRTs and stem cells and may help elucidate common biologic pathways that could serve in advancing more effective therapeutic strategies to treat MRTs.","['Venneti, Sriram', 'Le, Paul', 'Martinez, Daniel', 'Xie, Sharon X', 'Sullivan, Lisa M', 'Rorke-Adams, Lucy B', 'Pawel, Bruce', 'Judkins, Alexander R']","['Venneti S', 'Le P', 'Martinez D', 'Xie SX', 'Sullivan LM', 'Rorke-Adams LB', 'Pawel B', 'Judkins AR']","['Division of Neuropathology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ID1 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1)', '0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Brain Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1/*metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Male', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2', 'Rhabdoid Tumor/metabolism/*pathology', 'Teratoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tissue Array Analysis', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Young Adult']",,2011/09/17 06:00,2011/11/11 06:00,['2011/09/17 06:00'],"['2011/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PAS.0b013e318224d2cd [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2011 Oct;35(10):1463-72. doi: 10.1097/PAS.0b013e318224d2cd.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Platelet enzymes glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), pyruvate kinase (PK) and hexokinase (HK) were studied in 47 patients of acute and chronic leukemia patients, 16 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)(13 relapse, three in remission), 12 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) (five in relapse, seven in remission), 19 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). RESULTS: The platelet G6PD activity was significantly low in cases of AML, ALL and also in CML. G6PD activity was normalized during AML remission. G6PD activity, although persistently low during ALL remission, increased significantly to near-normal during remission (P < 0.05) as compared with relapse (P < 0.01). Platelet PK activity was high during AML relapse (P < 0.05), which was normalized during remission. Platelet HK however was found to be decreased during all remission (P < 0.05). There was a significant positive correlation between G6PD and PK in cases of AML (P < 0.001) but not in ALL and CML. G6PD activity did not correlate with HK activity in any of the leukemic groups. A significant positive correlation was however seen between PK and HK activity in cases of ALL remission (P < 0.01) and CML (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Both red cell and platelet enzymes were studied in 36 leukemic patients and there was no statistically significant correlation between red cell and platelet enzymes. Platelet enzyme defect in leukemias suggests the inherent abnormality in megakaryopoiesis and would explain the functional platelet defects in leukemias.","['Sharma, S', 'Purohit, Ahl', 'Pati, H P', 'Kochupillai, V']","['Sharma S', 'Purohit A', 'Pati HP', 'Kochupillai V']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India. ssharmajd@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Indian J Cancer,Indian journal of cancer,0112040,"['EC 1.1.1.49 (Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (Hexokinase)', 'EC 2.7.1.40 (Pyruvate Kinase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Platelets/*enzymology', 'Erythrocytes/enzymology', 'Female', 'Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/*analysis', 'Hexokinase/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Regression, Spontaneous', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology', 'Pyruvate Kinase/*analysis', 'Recurrence']",,2011/09/17 06:00,2012/01/14 06:00,['2011/09/17 06:00'],"['2011/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJournalofCancer_2011_48_3_323_84943 [pii]', '10.4103/0019-509X.84943 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Cancer. 2011 Jul-Sep;48(3):323-7. doi: 10.4103/0019-509X.84943.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We reviewed the clinical course and treatment outcome of APL patients treated at our center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 1997 and December 2007, 33 patients with APL received induction therapy using ATRA + daunorubicin (n = 26), As = 26), As2O3 (n = 4) or daunorubicin + cytosar ( n = 3). RESULTS: Median age was 30 years with a male to female ratio of 1.68. Twenty seven patients (82%) achieved CR. Complications during induction therapy were febrile neutropenia (33%), ATRA syndrome (30%), bleeding (58%), and diarrhea in (6%) patients. During induction and follow up, 8 (24.24%) patients died, 6 (18.18%) during induction, 1 (3%) during maintenance, and 1 (3%) after relapse. Median OS is 128 months while median EFS is 61 months. Four patients relapsed at a median time of 61 months. At the time of censoring, 25 patients were alive at a median follow up of 13 months (range 0.6 -127 months); 21 in CR1, 3 in CR2, 1 in CR3. Comparisons among the risk groups (CR and relapse rate and survival statistics) were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: APL is a highly curable malignancy. Our results confirm the findings of the published literature from larger cooperative studies from the West. We may further improve outcome with quicker diagnosis and more efficient supportive care system.","['Bajpai, J', 'Sharma, A', 'Kumar, L', 'Dabkara, D', 'Raina, V', 'Kochupillai, V', 'Kumar, R']","['Bajpai J', 'Sharma A', 'Kumar L', 'Dabkara D', 'Raina V', 'Kochupillai V', 'Kumar R']","['Department of Medical Oncology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Indian J Cancer,Indian journal of cancer,0112040,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'India', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Oxides/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/adverse effects/therapeutic use']",,2011/09/17 06:00,2012/01/14 06:00,['2011/09/17 06:00'],"['2011/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJournalofCancer_2011_48_3_316_84938 [pii]', '10.4103/0019-509X.84938 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Cancer. 2011 Jul-Sep;48(3):316-22. doi: 10.4103/0019-509X.84938.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this analysis is to study the time trend in the immunophenotype of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases in our geographic setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 639 new pediatric ALL cases immunophenotyped during 1989-2009 forms the basis of this analysis. Representative bone marrow or peripheral blood of these patients was immunophenotyped flowcytometrically using an extensive panel of monoclonal antibodies. RESULTS: During early phase of our study we noticed a relative excess of T-ALL and a paucity of common acute lymphoblastic leukemia (C-ALL) in contrast to western data. Over a period of 20 years we witnessed a gradual reduction in pediatric T-ALL cases and a proportionate increase in C-ALL cases. CONCLUSION: We find that this change of pattern is synchronizing with the socioeconomic and industrial development prevailing in our geographic setting and suggest a possible link between the predominant immunophenotype of pediatric ALL cases and the environmental and socioeconomic factors prevailing in that locality.,"['Rajalekshmy, K R', 'Abitha, A R', 'Anuratha, N', 'Sagar, T G']","['Rajalekshmy KR', 'Abitha AR', 'Anuratha N', 'Sagar TG']","['Department of Haematology, Cancer Institute, Chennai, India. rajalekshmykraghavan@yahoo.in']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Indian J Cancer,Indian journal of cancer,0112040,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Incidence', 'India/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neprilysin/*blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/immunology']",,2011/09/17 06:00,2012/01/14 06:00,['2011/09/17 06:00'],"['2011/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJournalofCancer_2011_48_3_310_84932 [pii]', '10.4103/0019-509X.84932 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Cancer. 2011 Jul-Sep;48(3):310-5. doi: 10.4103/0019-509X.84932.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A large number of events that are affected by rituximab binding have been identified, including lipid raft modifications, kinase and caspase activation, and effects on transcription factors and apoptotic/antiapoptotic molecules. Studies on cell lines and isolated tumor cells have shown that by targeting these pathways, it may be possible to increase or decrease susceptibility to rituximab cell killing. An increased understanding of the direct effects of rituximab may therefore aid in the design of new, rational combinations to improve the outcome of CD20-based therapy for patients who currently have suboptimal outcome following standard treatments.","['Bezombes, Christine', 'Fournie, Jean-Jacques', 'Laurent, Guy']","['Bezombes C', 'Fournie JJ', 'Laurent G']","['Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, CHU Purpan, Place du Dr Baylac, Toulouse, 31024 France. christine.bezombes-cagnac@inserm.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20110915,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Rituximab']",,2011/09/17 06:00,2012/05/24 06:00,['2011/09/17 06:00'],"['2011/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/24 06:00 [medline]']","['1541-7786.MCR-11-0154 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-11-0154 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2011 Nov;9(11):1435-42. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-11-0154.

To understand the genetic events that contribute to relapse and chemoresistance and identify novel targets of therapy, 3 high-throughput assays were used to identify genetic and epigenetic changes at relapse. Using matched diagnosis/relapse bone marrow samples from children with relapsed B-precursor ALL, we evaluated gene expression, copy number abnormalities (CNAs), and DNA methylation. Gene expression analysis revealed a signature of differentially expressed genes from diagnosis to relapse that is different for early (< 36 months) and late (>/= 36 months) relapse. CNA analysis discovered CNAs that were shared at diagnosis and relapse and others that were new lesions acquired at relapse. DNA methylation analysis found increased promoter methylation at relapse. There were many genetic alterations that evolved from diagnosis to relapse, and in some cases these genes had previously been associated with chemoresistance. Integration of the results from all 3 platforms identified genes of potential interest, including CDKN2A, COL6A2, PTPRO, and CSMD1. Although our results indicate that a diversity of genetic changes are seen at relapse, integration of gene expression, CNA, and methylation data suggest a possible convergence on the WNT and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways.","['Hogan, Laura E', 'Meyer, Julia A', 'Yang, Jun', 'Wang, Jinhua', 'Wong, Nicholas', 'Yang, Wenjian', 'Condos, Gregory', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Raetz, Elizabeth', 'Saffery, Richard', 'Relling, Mary V', 'Bhojwani, Deepa', 'Morrison, Debra J', 'Carroll, William L']","['Hogan LE', 'Meyer JA', 'Yang J', 'Wang J', 'Wong N', 'Yang W', 'Condos G', 'Hunger SP', 'Raetz E', 'Saffery R', 'Relling MV', 'Bhojwani D', 'Morrison DJ', 'Carroll WL']","['New York University Cancer Institute, New York University Langone Medical Center, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20110914,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', 'DNA Methylation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Genomics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/therapy', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recurrence']",PMC3217405,2011/09/17 06:00,2012/01/04 06:00,['2011/09/17 06:00'],"['2011/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40372-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-04-345595 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Nov 10;118(19):5218-26. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-04-345595.

Mutational status at diagnosis was correlated with hematologic parameters, clinical manifestations, and outcome. A total of 25 different EZH2 mutations were detected in 5.9% of PMF, 1.2% of PPV-MF, and 9.4% of PET-MF patients; most were exonic heterozygous missense changes. EZH2 mutation coexisted with JAK2V617F or ASXL1 mutation in 12 of 29 (41.4%) and 6 of 27 (22.2%) evaluated patients; TET2 and CBL mutations were found in 2 and 1 patients, respectively. EZH2-mutated PMF patients had significantly higher leukocyte counts, blast-cell counts, and larger spleens at diagnosis, and most of them (52.6%) were in the high-risk International Prognostic Score System (IPSS) category. After a median follow-up of 39 months, 128 patients (25.9%) died, 81 (63.3%) because of leukemia. Leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS) were significantly reduced in EZH2-mutated PMF patients (P = .028 and P < .001, respectively); no such impact was seen for PPV/PET-MF patients, possibly due to the low number of mutated cases. In multivariate analysis, survival of PMF patients was predicted by IPSS high-risk category, a < 25% JAK2V617F allele burden, and EZH2 mutation status.

Arsenic treatment, which induces Pml degradation, caused Setdb1 signals to disappear. Setdb1 knockdown resulted in dismantlement of PML-NBs. Immunoprecipitation results demonstrated physical interactions between Setdb1 and Pml. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that, within the frame of PML-NBs, Setdb1 binds the promoter of Id2 and suppresses its expression through installing H3K9 methylation. Our findings suggest that Setdb1 performs dual, but inseparable, functions at PML-NBs to maintain the structural integrity of PML-NBs and to control PML-NB-associated genes transcriptionally.","['Cho, Sunwha', 'Park, Jung Sun', 'Kang, Yong-Kook']","['Cho S', 'Park JS', 'Kang YK']","['Development and Differentiation Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, University of Science and Technology, 113 Gwahangno, Yuseong-gu, 305-806 Daejeon, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110914,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Idb2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 2)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Protein Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (SETDB1 protein, mouse)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arsenic/pharmacology', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Embryo Implantation', 'Female', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Gene Silencing', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 2/deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Methyltransferases/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism']",PMC3220519,2011/09/17 06:00,2012/01/17 06:00,['2011/09/17 06:00'],"['2011/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)50460-2 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M111.248534 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 Nov 25;286(47):41115-24. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.248534.

The development and function of lymphoid cells is regulated at many levels one being the control of gene expression by transcription factors. The zinc finger transcriptional repressor Gfi1 has emerged as a factor that is critically implicated in the commitment of precursor cells for the lymphoid lineage. In addition, Gfi1 controls distinct stages of early T- or B-lymphoid development and is also critical for their maturation, activation and effector function. From many years of work, a picture emerges in which Gfi1 is part of a complicated, but well orchestrated network of interdependent regulators, most of which impinge on lymphoid development and activation by transcriptional regulation. Biochemical studies show that Gfi1 is part of a large DNA binding multi-protein complex that enables histone modifications, but may also control alternative pre mRNA splicing. Many insights into the biological role of Gfi1 have been gained through the study of gene deficient mice that have defects in B- and T-cell differentiation, in T-cell selection and polarization processes and in the response of mature B- and T-cells towards antigen. Most importantly, the defects seen in Gfi1 deficient mice also point to roles of Gfi1 in diseases of the immune system that involve auto-immune responses and acute lymphoid leukemia and lymphoma.","['Moroy, Tarik', 'Khandanpour, Cyrus']","['Moroy T', 'Khandanpour C']","['Institut de recherches cliniques de Montreal - IRCM, 110 Avenue des Pins Ouest, Montreal, QC, H2W 1R7, Canada.

Furthermore, the four selected compounds were tested for their interaction with the microtubular cytoskeletal system by docking analysis, tubulin polymerization assay and immunofluorescence staining, demonstrating that the compound 12d, unlike the other active derivatives, was able to significantly bind dimers of alpha- and beta-tubulin, probably causing a molecular distortion resulting in the disassembly of microtubules.","['Balbi, Alessandro', 'Anzaldi, Maria', 'Maccio, Chiara', 'Aiello, Cinzia', 'Mazzei, Mauro', 'Gangemi, Rosaria', 'Castagnola, Patrizio', 'Miele, Mariangela', 'Rosano, Camillo', 'Viale, Maurizio']","['Balbi A', 'Anzaldi M', 'Maccio C', 'Aiello C', 'Mazzei M', 'Gangemi R', 'Castagnola P', 'Miele M', 'Rosano C', 'Viale M']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Farmaceutiche, Universita degli Studi di Genova, V.le Benedetto XV 3, 16132 Genova, Italy. balbi@unige.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110831,France,Eur J Med Chem,European journal of medicinal chemistry,0420510,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Tubulin)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '47165-04-8 (DAPI)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chemistry Techniques, Synthetic', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/metabolism', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Humans', 'Indoles/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microtubules/drug effects/metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Protein Multimerization/drug effects', 'Protein Structure, Quaternary', 'Pyrazoles/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Tubulin/chemistry/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",,2011/09/17 06:00,2012/02/14 06:00,['2011/09/17 06:00'],"['2011/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/19 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0223-5234(11)00586-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejmech.2011.08.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Med Chem. 2011 Nov;46(11):5293-309. doi: 10.1016/j.ejmech.2011.08.014.

However, whereas such early neoplastic conditions have been defined in some detail in lymphoproliferative neoplasms, little is known about minimal lesions preceding the manifestation of an overt myeloid neoplasm, about underlying mechanisms, the clinical course and outcome, and the prognostic significance of such conditions. Members of several groups have recently described two 'premalignant' myeloid conditions, namely idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance (ICUS) and idiopathic bone marrow dysplasia of uncertain significance (IDUS). At least in some patients these are neoplastic conditions. Both conditions may progress to an overt myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), but may also progress to another myeloid neoplasm such as acute myeloid leukemia, a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), or a mast cell disorder (mastocytosis). In ICUS the dysplasia is mild and does not fulfill the WHO criteria for MDS but cytopenias can be severe. In IDUS the dysplasia is prominent but cytopenias, if detectable, are mild. In both conditions it is possible that a neoplastic clone has already replaced most or all of normal bone marrow cells when ICUS or IDUS is detected, but evidence to support this possibility is not necessarily available. For both groups of patients we recommend a thorough hematologic follow up because of the potential of disease-manifestation and the unpredictable form and time of progression. In the present review, we discuss current concepts relating to ICUS and IDUS as well as diagnostic approaches and available criteria.","['Valent, Peter', 'Bain, Barbara J', 'Bennett, John M', 'Wimazal, Friedrich', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Mufti, Ghulam', 'Horny, Hans-Peter']","['Valent P', 'Bain BJ', 'Bennett JM', 'Wimazal F', 'Sperr WR', 'Mufti G', 'Horny HP']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. peter.valent@meduniwien.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20110913,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Leukopenia', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Risk Factors']",,2011/09/17 06:00,2012/02/02 06:00,['2011/09/17 06:00'],"['2011/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/01 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(11)00416-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2011.08.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2012 Jan;36(1):1-5. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2011.08.016.

We sought to determine the emergence of CV risk factors in CCS while still children. STUDY DESIGN: CCS in remission >/=5 years from cancer diagnosis (n=319, age=14.5 years) and their siblings (control subjects, n=208, age=13.6 years) participated in this cross-sectional study of CV risk, which included physiologic assessment of insulin sensitivity/resistance (hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp). Adjusted comparisons between CCS major diagnoses (leukemia [n=110], central nervous system tumors [n=82], solid tumors [n=127]) and control subjects were performed with linear regression for CV risk factors and insulin sensitivity. RESULTS: Despite no significant differences in weight and body mass index, CCS had greater adiposity (waist [73.1 versus 71.1 cm, P=.02]; percent fat [28.1 versus 25.9%, P=.007]), lower lean body mass (38.4 versus 39.9 kg, P=.01) than control subjects. After adjustment for adiposity, CCS had higher total cholesterol level (154.7 versus 148.3 mg/dL, P=.004), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (89.4 versus 83.7 mg/dL, P=.002), and triglyceride level (91.8 versus 84 mg/dL, P=.03) and were less insulin sensitive (insulin stimulated glucose uptake, measure of insulin resistance, adjusted for lean body mass 12.1 versus 13.4 mg/kg/min, P=.002) than control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: CCS have greater CV risk than healthy children. Because CV risk factors track from childhood to adulthood, early development of altered body composition and decreased insulin sensitivity in CCS may contribute significantly to their risk of early CV morbidity and mortality.","['Steinberger, Julia', 'Sinaiko, Alan R', 'Kelly, Aaron S', 'Leisenring, Wendy M', 'Steffen, Lyn M', 'Goodman, Pamela', 'Mulrooney, Daniel A', 'Dietz, Andrew C', 'Moran, Antoinette', 'Perkins, Joanna L', 'Baker, K Scott']","['Steinberger J', 'Sinaiko AR', 'Kelly AS', 'Leisenring WM', 'Steffen LM', 'Goodman P', 'Mulrooney DA', 'Dietz AC', 'Moran A', 'Perkins JL', 'Baker KS']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota Medical Center, Minneapolis, MN 55454, USA. stein055@umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110913,United States,J Pediatr,The Journal of pediatrics,0375410,"['0 (Blood Glucose)', '0 (Lipids)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood Glucose/analysis', 'Body Composition', 'Body Mass Index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/*etiology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Glucose Clamp Technique', 'Humans', '*Insulin Resistance', 'Lipids/blood', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', '*Survivors', 'Young Adult']",PMC3246569,2011/09/17 06:00,2012/03/28 06:00,['2011/09/17 06:00'],"['2011/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/20 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-3476(11)00813-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jpeds.2011.08.018 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr. 2012 Mar;160(3):494-9. doi: 10.1016/j.jpeds.2011.08.018.

Lung surgery, either for diagnosis or treatment, is considered useful but hazardous in these patients. We performed a reappraisal study of this purpose; retrospective study in a university centre, located in the Paris area, France. We analysed the entire records of all the haematological patients admitted in the Thoracic Surgery department from October 2001 to January 2009, among 400 haematological patients with pulmonary complications admitted to the Respiratory Diseases department. Seventeen patients (male: n=13, mean age 47 +/- 15 years) underwent lung surgery. Underlying haematological disease was acute (n=7) or chronic (n=5) leukaemia, lymphoma (n=4), and eight have had stem cell transplantation. Thirteen patients had been exposed to a cytotoxic chemotherapy with known pulmonary toxicity. Respiratory diseases have been evolving for 112 days (10-663 days), and 14 patients received previously antibiotic and/or antifungal therapy. One patient was neutropenic and three had thrombopenia. Five patients underwent curative surgery for a residual pulmonary nodule after medical treatment of invasive aspergillosis, and 12 had a diagnostic procedure (open lung biopsy by video-assisted thoracoscopy [n=2]; thoracotomy [n=8]). Surgery permitted a final diagnosis in all 12 cases: non-specific infiltrative pneumonia (n=4), pulmonary graft versus host disease (n=3), granulomatous pneumocystosis (n=1), invasive aspergillosis (n=1), bronchial carcinoma (n=1), EBV-related lymphoproliferation (n=1), and tuberculosis (n=1). Therapeutic regimens were modified according to the surgical results in ten cases (84%). All patients were extubated at the end of surgery. Post-operative complications were: prolonged air leaks (n=3), pneumonia (n=1), parenchymal hematoma (n=1), acute coronary syndrome (n=1). Seven patients were admitted in the Intensive Care Unit, and five had non-invasive ventilation. Three patients died from respiratory failure: NSIP (n=2), pneumocystosis (n=1).

OBJECTIVES: To examine and compare platelet function in severely thrombocytopenic patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplasia (MDS) with that in patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). METHODS: Whole blood flow cytometric measurement of platelet activation and platelet reactivity to agonists was correlated with the immature platelet fraction (IPF) and bleeding symptoms. RESULTS: Patients with AML/MDS had smaller platelets, lower IPF and substantially lower platelet surface expression of activated glycoprotein (GP)IIb-IIIa and GPIb, both with and without addition of ex vivo ADP or thrombin receptor-activating peptide, than patients with ITP. In both ITP and AML/MDS patients, increased platelet surface GPIb on circulating platelets and expression of activated GPIIb-IIIa and GPIb on ex vivo activated platelets correlated with a higher IPF. Whereas platelet reactivity was higher for AML/MDS patients with bleeding than for those with no bleeding, platelet reactivity was lower for ITP patients with bleeding than for those with no bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: AML/MDS patients have lower in vivo platelet activation and ex vivo platelet reactivity than patients with ITP. The proportion of newly produced platelets correlates with the expression of platelet surface markers of activation. These differences might contribute to differences in bleeding tendency between AML/MDS and ITP patients. This study is the first to define differences in platelet function between AML/MDS patients and ITP patients with equivalent degrees of thrombocytopenia.","['Psaila, B', 'Bussel, J B', 'Frelinger, A L', 'Babula, B', 'Linden, M D', 'Li, Y', 'Barnard, M R', 'Tate, C', 'Feldman, E J', 'Michelson, A D']","['Psaila B', 'Bussel JB', 'Frelinger AL', 'Babula B', 'Linden MD', 'Li Y', 'Barnard MR', 'Tate C', 'Feldman EJ', 'Michelson AD']","['Platelet Disorders Center, Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Weill-Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Thromb Haemost,Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,101170508,['0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Blood Platelets/pathology/*physiology', 'Cell Shape', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hemorrhage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*blood', 'Platelet Activation', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic/*blood']",PMC3210015,2011/09/17 06:00,2012/03/14 06:00,['2011/09/17 06:00'],"['2011/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1538-7836.2011.04506.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Thromb Haemost. 2011 Nov;9(11):2302-10. doi: 10.1111/j.1538-7836.2011.04506.x.,,,,"['U01 HL072196/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 HL072196-05/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '1U01 HL72196-01-05/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['(c) 2011 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.'],['NIHMS325712'],,,"['J Thromb Haemost. 2013 May;11(5):1001-2.

To address this question, we analyzed the impact of HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRB3, HLA-DRB4, and HLA-DRB5 on the outcome of HLA-haploidentical transplantation. Four hundred and eighty-one donor-recipient pairs were fully typed before transplantation. In univariate analysis, HLA-B mismatch not only demonstrated significant adverse effects on acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and transplant-related mortality but also was associated with reduced overall survival and leukemia-free survival (LFS). In multivariate analysis, HLA-B mismatch remained the independent risk factor for acute GVHD and transplant-related mortality. The high risk of disease and the female donor were found to be significant factors for reduced overall survival and LFS. Furthermore, multiple mismatch of the HLA locus was found to have no synergistic adverse effect on outcomes. Our results suggest that prospective matching of patients and donors for HLA-B antigen in the unshared HLA haplotype is warranted for HLA-mismatched/haploidentical transplantation.","['Huo, Ming-Rui', 'Xu, Lan-Ping', 'Li, D', 'Liu, Dai-Hong', 'Liu, Kai-Yan', 'Chen, Huan', 'Han, Wei', 'Chen, Yu-Hong', 'Wang, Y', 'Wang, Jing-Zhi', 'Zhang, Xiao-Hui', 'Zhao, Xiang-Yu', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun']","['Huo MR', 'Xu LP', 'Li D', 'Liu DH', 'Liu KY', 'Chen H', 'Han W', 'Chen YH', 'Wang Y', 'Wang JZ', 'Zhang XH', 'Zhao XY', 'Huang XJ']","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110915,Denmark,Clin Transplant,Clinical transplantation,8710240,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Blood Transfusion', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/*immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'HLA Antigens/*analysis', '*Haplotypes', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/immunology/therapy', '*Histocompatibility', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",,2011/09/17 06:00,2012/08/10 06:00,['2011/09/17 06:00'],"['2011/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1399-0012.2011.01499.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Transplant. 2012 Mar-Apr;26(2):284-91. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-0012.2011.01499.x.

As genes are never regulated individually, observed behavior may be a consequence of changes in other genes. Existing approaches like co-expression analysis aim to resolve such patterns from a wide range of experiments. The knowledge of such a background set of experiments can be used to compute expected gene behavior based on known links. It is particularly interesting to detect previously unseen specific effects in other experiments. Here, a new method to spot genes deviating from expected behavior (PAttern DEviation SCOring--Padesco) is devised. It uses linear regression models learned from a background set to arrive at gene specific prediction accuracy distributions. For a given experiment, it is then decided whether each gene is predicted better or worse than expected. This provides a novel way to estimate the experiment specificity of each gene. We propose a validation procedure to estimate the detection of such specific candidates and show that these can be identified with an average accuracy of about 85%.","['Petri, Tobias', 'Kufner, Robert', 'Zimmer, Ralf']","['Petri T', 'Kufner R', 'Zimmer R']","['LMU Munich, Department of Informatics, Munich, Germany. petri@bio.ifi.lmu.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20110915,United States,J Comput Biol,Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology,9433358,,IM,"['*Computer Simulation', '*Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/genetics', 'Linear Models', 'Male', '*Models, Genetic', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Support Vector Machine']",,2011/09/17 06:00,2012/03/17 06:00,['2011/09/17 06:00'],"['2011/09/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/cmb.2011.0159 [doi]'],ppublish,J Comput Biol. 2011 Nov;18(11):1423-35. doi: 10.1089/cmb.2011.0159.

Among these transporters, ATP-binding cassette B1/multidrug resistance 1 (ABCB1/MDR1), ABCC2/multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) and ABCG2/breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) affect susceptibility to many hematopoietic malignancies. The maintenance of regulated expression of these transporters is governed through the activation of intracellular ""xenosensors"" like the nuclear receptor 1I2/pregnane X receptor (NR1I2/PXR). SNPs in genes encoding these regulators have also been implicated in the risk of several cancers. Using a tagging approach, we tested the hypothesis that common polymorphisms in the transporter genes ABCB1, ABCC2, ABCG2 and the regulator gene NR1I2 could be implicated in lymphoma risk. We selected 68 SNPs in the four genes, and we genotyped them in 1,481 lymphoma cases and 1,491 controls of the European case-control study (EpiLymph) using the Illumina GoldenGate assay technology.

To develop VSVG-MLV for functional genomics in schistosomes, the influence of the chicken beta-globin cHS4 element, a prototypic chromatin insulator, on transgene expression was examined. Plasmid pLNHX encoding the MLV 5'- and 3'-Long Terminal Repeats flanking the neomycin phosphotransferase gene (neo) was modified to include, within the U3 region of the 3'-LTR, active components of cHS4 insulator, the 250 bp core fused to the 400 bp 3'-region. Cultured larvae of Schistosoma mansoni were transduced with virions from producer cells transfected with control or cHS4-bearing plasmids. Schistosomules transduced with cHS4 virions expressed 2-20 times higher levels of neo than controls, while carrying comparable numbers of integrated proviral transgenes. The findings not only demonstrated that cHS4 was active in schistosomes but also they represent the first report of activity of cHS4 in any Lophotrochozoan species, which has significant implications for evolutionary conservation of heterochromatin regulation. The findings advance prospects for transgenesis in functional genomics of the schistosome genome to discover intervention targets because they provide the means to enhance and extend transgene activity including for vector based RNA interference.","['Suttiprapa, Sutas', 'Rinaldi, Gabriel', 'Brindley, Paul J']","['Suttiprapa S', 'Rinaldi G', 'Brindley PJ']","['Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Tropical Medicine, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, The George Washington University, Ross Hall, 2300 I Street NW, Washington, DC 20037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20110915,Netherlands,Transgenic Res,Transgenic research,9209120,"['0 (Beta-Globulins)', '0 (G protein, vesicular stomatitis virus)', '0 (Heterochromatin)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified/genetics/metabolism', 'Beta-Globulins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Biomphalaria/parasitology', 'Chickens', 'Chromosomes/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Silencing', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Heterochromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'Larva/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Schistosoma mansoni/*genetics/metabolism/virology', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Transfection', 'Transformation, Genetic', '*Transgenes', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus/genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics']",PMC3288229,2011/09/16 06:00,2012/09/07 06:00,['2011/09/16 06:00'],"['2011/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11248-011-9556-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Transgenic Res. 2012 Jun;21(3):555-66. doi: 10.1007/s11248-011-9556-0.

Whole genome expression profiling offers promise in this regard, but can be complicated by the challenge of identifying the genes affected by hundreds to thousands of genes that induce changes in expression. A proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, could be a potential therapeutic agent in treating adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) patients, however, the underlying mechanism by which bortezomib induces cell death in ATL cells via gene regulatory network has not been fully elucidated. Here we show that a Bayesian statistical framework by VoyaGene((R)) identified a secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) gene, a tumor-invasiveness related gene, as a possible modulator of bortezomib-induced cell death in ATL cells. Functional analysis using RNAi experiments revealed that inhibition of the expression SPARC by siRNA enhanced the apoptotic effect of bortezomib on ATL cells in accordance with an increase of cleaved caspase 3. Targeting SPARC may help to treat ATL patients in combination with bortezomib. This work shows that a network biology approach can be used advantageously to identify the genetic interaction related to anticancer effects.","['Ohyashiki, Junko H', 'Hamamura, Ryoko', 'Kobayashi, Chiaki', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Ohyashiki, Kazuma']","['Ohyashiki JH', 'Hamamura R', 'Kobayashi C', 'Zhang Y', 'Ohyashiki K']","['Intractable Immune System Disease Research Center, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20081030,New Zealand,Adv Appl Bioinform Chem,Advances and applications in bioinformatics and chemistry : AABC,101550215,,,,PMC3169936,2008/01/01 00:00,2008/01/01 00:01,['2011/09/16 06:00'],"['2011/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2008/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.2147/aabc.s4133 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Appl Bioinform Chem. 2008;1:85-98. doi: 10.2147/aabc.s4133.

RECENT FINDINGS: t-MN are an increasing matter in cancer survivors treated with chemoradiotherapy. One of the major concerns in hematologic malignancies is childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, in which the leukemogenic role of extended etoposide/teniposide treatment, concomitant intensive antimetabolite and asparaginase, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and prophylactic cranial radiotherapy use have been established. In high-risk Hodgkin lymphoma, 3% t-MN have been observed at 10-year follow-up with the escalated bleomycin/etoposide/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide/vincristine/procarbazine/prednis one (BEACOPP) schedule, versus 0.4% with doxorubicin/bleomycin/vinblastine/dacarbazine (ABVD). In lymphoproliferative diseases the new drugs fludarabine and lenalidomide may increase the risk of second tumors, when associated to other cytotoxic therapies. Among solid tumors, breast cancer is most frequently associated to t-MN. The risk is correlated to higher chemotherapy doses, radiotherapy, use of G-CSF, but also independent from treatment, suggesting a genetic predisposition to both diseases. Radiotherapy plays a role also in female pelvic tumors and in testicular cancer, when associated to cisplatin. SUMMARY: The risk of t-MN is not negligible, although below 2% in most series. This is particularly significant for younger cancer patients and during the first 5 years after the primary malignancies. Efforts should be maximized to identify susceptibility factors to identify patients at risk, in whom more leukemogenic drugs and schedules should be avoided.","['Leone, Giuseppe', 'Fianchi, Luana', 'Voso, Maria T']","['Leone G', 'Fianchi L', 'Voso MT']","[""Istituto di Ematologia, Universita' Cattolica S.

Human CD59, a key membrane complement regulator that inhibits CDC, is highly expressed in B-cell malignancies and its upregulation is an important determinant of the sensitivity of B-cell malignancies to rituximab treatment. Previously, we have shown that the potent CD59 inhibitor rILYd4 sensitizes rituximab-resistant lymphoma cells to rituximab-mediated CDC. Here, we further investigated whether rILYd4 can sensitize B-cell malignancies to ofatumumab-mediated CDC and whether either ofatumumab-mediated CDC or rILYd4-enhanced ofatumumab-mediated CDC correlates with CD20 or CD59 expression, known biomarkers involved in rituximab activity. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Rituximab-resistant cell lines and primary CLL cells were used to investigate the antitumor efficacy of the combination of rILYd4 with ofatumumab or rituximab. Propidium iodide staining or alamarBlue assay were used to evaluate the CDC effect. The levels of CD20 and CD59 on the cell membrane were analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: rILYd4 enhanced CDC effects mediated by ofatumumab or rituximab on rituximab-resistant lymphoma cells and primary CLL cells in vitro. The sensitivity to CDC effects mediated by ofatumumab positively correlated with the ratio of CD20/CD59 and negatively correlated with CD59 levels on CLL cells.

In these particles, the Gag proteins are arranged radially as elongated rods. We have previously characterized the properties of HIV-1 Gag in solution. In the absence of nucleic acid, HIV-1 Gag displays moderately weak interprotein interactions, existing in monomer-dimer equilibrium. Neutron scattering and hydrodynamic studies suggest that the protein is compact, and biochemical studies indicate that the two ends can approach close in three-dimensional space, implying the need for a significant conformational change during assembly. We now describe the properties of the Gag protein of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV), a gammaretrovirus. We found that this protein is very different from HIV-1 Gag: it has much weaker protein-protein interaction and is predominantly monomeric in solution. This has allowed us to study the protein by small-angle X-ray scattering and to build a low-resolution molecular envelope for the protein. We found that MLV Gag is extended in solution, with an axial ratio of approximately 7, comparable to its dimensions in immature particles. Mutational analysis suggests that runs of prolines in its matrix and p12 domains and the highly charged stretch at the C terminus of its capsid domain all contribute to this extended conformation. These differences between MLV Gag and HIV-1 Gag and their implications for retroviral assembly are discussed.","['Datta, Siddhartha A K', 'Zuo, Xiaobing', 'Clark, Patrick K', 'Campbell, Stephen J', 'Wang, Yun-Xing', 'Rein, Alan']","['Datta SA', 'Zuo X', 'Clark PK', 'Campbell SJ', 'Wang YX', 'Rein A']","['HIV Drug Resistance Program, National Cancer Institute-Frederick, P.O.

This incompatibility is modulated by the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu. Because the GaLV Env CTD does not resemble tetherin or CD4, the well-studied targets of Vpu, we sought to characterize the modular sequence in the GaLV Env CTD required for this restriction in the presence of Vpu. Using a systematic mutagenesis scan, we determined that the motif that makes GaLV Env sensitive to Vpu is INxxIxxVKxxVxRxK. This region in the CTD of GaLV Env is predicted to form a helix. Mutations in the CTD that would break this helix abolish sensitivity to Vpu. Although many of these positions can be replaced with amino acids with similar biophysical properties without disrupting the Vpu sensitivity, the final lysine residue is required. This Vpu sensitivity sequence appears to be modular, as the unrelated Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) Env can be made Vpu sensitive by replacing its CTD with the GaLV Env CTD. In addition, F-MLV Env can be made Vpu sensitive by mutating two amino acids in its cytoplasmic tail to make it resemble more closely the Vpu sensitivity motif. Surprisingly, the core components of this Vpu sensitivity sequence are also present in the host surface protein CD4, which is also targeted by Vpu through its CTD.","['Janaka, Sanath Kumar', 'Lucas, Tiffany M', 'Johnson, Marc C']","['Janaka SK', 'Lucas TM', 'Johnson MC']","['Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri 65201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20110914,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Human Immunodeficiency Virus Proteins)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins)', '0 (vpu protein, Human immunodeficiency virus 1)']",IM,"['DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics/growth & development', 'HIV-1/*growth & development', 'Human Immunodeficiency Virus Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/genetics/*growth & development', 'Mutant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins/*metabolism']",PMC3209308,2011/09/16 06:00,2011/12/17 06:00,['2011/09/16 06:00'],"['2011/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.05171-11 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.05171-11 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2011 Nov;85(22):11945-54. doi: 10.1128/JVI.05171-11.

Here, we show that murine NIH 3T3 and baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells overexpressing receptors for subgroup A, B, and C feline leukemia viruses (FeLVs) are weakly susceptible (10(1) to 10(2) CFU/ml) to FeLV pseudotype viruses containing murine leukemia virus (MLV) core (Gag-Pol) proteins, whereas FeLV receptor-expressing murine Mus dunni tail fibroblast (MDTF) cells are highly susceptible (10(4) to 10(6) CFU/ml). However, NIH 3T3 cells expressing the FeLV subgroup B receptor PiT1 are highly susceptible to gibbon ape leukemia virus pseudotype virus, which differs from the FeLV pseudotype viruses only in the envelope protein. FeLV resistance is not caused by a defect in envelope binding, low receptor expression levels, or N-linked glycosylation. Resistance is not alleviated by substitution of the MLV core in the FeLV pseudotype virus with FeLV core proteins. Interestingly, FeLV resistance is alleviated by fusion of receptor-expressing NIH 3T3 and BHK cells with MDTF or human TE671 cells, suggesting the absence of an additional cellular component in NIH 3T3 and BHK cells that is required for FeLV infection. The putative FeLV-specific cellular component is not a secreted factor, as MDTF conditioned medium does not alleviate the block to FeLV infection. Together, our findings suggest that FeLV infection requires an additional envelope-dependent cellular component that is absent in NIH 3T3 and BHK cells but that is present in MDTF and TE671 cells.","['Hussain, Naveen', 'Thickett, Kelly R', 'Na, Hong', 'Leung, Cherry', 'Tailor, Chetankumar S']","['Hussain N', 'Thickett KR', 'Na H', 'Leung C', 'Tailor CS']","['The Hospital for Sick Children, Cell Biology Program, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110914,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (FLVCR1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (POU1F1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Slc19a2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factor Pit-1)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (feline leukemia virus receptor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cats', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cricetinae', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glycosylation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kidney/cytology/metabolism/virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*pathogenicity', 'Leukemia, Feline/*metabolism/pathology/*virology', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factor Pit-1/metabolism', 'Viral Core Proteins/*metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*metabolism', 'Virion/physiology', 'Virus Attachment']",PMC3209382,2011/09/16 06:00,2012/01/20 06:00,['2011/09/16 06:00'],"['2011/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/20 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00822-11 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00822-11 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2011 Dec;85(23):12529-36. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00822-11.

Alloreactive donor T cells attack leukemia cells, mediating the GVL effect. Donor T cells, including the memory T cells (T(M)) that are generated after infection, also promote immune reconstitution. Nonetheless, leukemia relapse and infection are major sources of treatment failure. Efforts to augment GVL and immune reconstitution have been limited by GVHD, the attack by donor T cells on host tissues. One approach to augmenting GVL has been to infuse ex vivo-generated T cells with defined specificities; however, this requires expertise that is not widely available. In the present study, we tested an alternative approach, adoptive immunotherapy with CD8+ T(M) from donors vaccinated against a single minor histocompatibility antigen (miHA) expressed by leukemia cells. Vaccination against the miHA H60 greatly augmented T(M)-mediated GVL against mouse chronic-phase (CP-CML) and blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia (BC-CML). T(M)-mediated GVL was antigen specific and was optimal when H60 expression was hematopoietically restricted. Even when H60 was ubiquitous, donor H60 vaccination had a minimal impact on GVHD. T(M) from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)-immune and H60-vaccinated donors augmented GVL and protected recipients from LCMV.

Although much attention has focused on microRNAs as regulators of mRNA stability/translation, recent data have highlighted the role of several diverse classes of AU-rich RNA-binding protein in the regulation of mRNA decay/stabilization. AU-rich elements are found in the 3'-untranslated region of many mRNAs that encode regulators of cell growth and survival, such as cytokines and onco/tumor-suppressor proteins. These are targeted by a burgeoning number of different RNA-binding proteins. Three distinct types of AU-rich RNA binding protein (ARE poly-U-binding degradation factor-1/AUF1, Hu antigen/HuR/HuA/ELAVL1, and the tristetraprolin/ZFP36 family of proteins) are essential for normal hematopoiesis. Together with 2 further AU-rich RNA-binding proteins, nucleolin and KHSRP/KSRP, the functions of these proteins are intimately associated with pathways that are dysregulated in various hematopoietic malignancies. Significantly, all of these AU-rich RNA-binding proteins function via an interconnected network that is integrated with microRNA functions. Studies of these diverse types of RNA binding protein are providing novel insight into gene-regulatory mechanisms in hematopoiesis in addition to offering new opportunities for developing mechanism-based targeted therapeutics in leukemia and lymphoma.","['Baou, Maria', 'Norton, John D', 'Murphy, John J']","['Baou M', 'Norton JD', 'Murphy JJ']","['Department of Biological Sciences, University of Essex, Colchester, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110913,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ELAV Proteins)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein D)', '0 (KHSRP protein, human)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['ELAV Proteins/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Gene Regulatory Networks/physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein D/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism/physiology']",,2011/09/16 06:00,2012/01/28 06:00,['2011/09/16 06:00'],"['2011/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40565-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-07-347237 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Nov 24;118(22):5732-40. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-07-347237.

CD123 expression is more widespread in BC-LPDs but is useful in conjunction with CD25 to differentiate HCLv from HCL. These findings support the usefulness of CD123 and CD103 to aid in the differential diagnosis of BC-LPDs.","['Venkataraman, Girish', 'Aguhar, Christine', 'Kreitman, Robert J', 'Yuan, Constance M', 'Stetler-Stevenson, Maryalice']","['Venkataraman G', 'Aguhar C', 'Kreitman RJ', 'Yuan CM', 'Stetler-Stevenson M']","['National Cancer Institute, 10 Center Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (IL3RA protein, human)', '0 (Integrin alpha Chains)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (alpha E integrins)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*analysis/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Cell Separation', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Integrin alpha Chains/*analysis/metabolism', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit/*analysis/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*diagnosis/metabolism', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/metabolism']",PMC7371092,2011/09/16 06:00,2011/11/09 06:00,['2011/09/16 06:00'],"['2011/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/09 06:00 [medline]']","['136/4/625 [pii]', '10.1309/AJCPKUM9J4IXCWEU [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2011 Oct;136(4):625-30. doi: 10.1309/AJCPKUM9J4IXCWEU.,,,,['Z01 BC010301/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,['NIHMS1600218'],,,,,,,,,,

This study firstly compared dynamic change of Fas/Fas ligand (FasL) system in plasma and also in the surface of endothelial cell microparticles (EMPs) in aGVHD patients, pre-aGVHD patients (7, 14, 21 and 28 days after transplantation), non-aGVHD patients and normal controls. Plasma soluble FasL (sFasL) was detected by ELISA. Fas, FasL and EMPs were evaluated by Confocal microscopy and flow cytometric analysis respectively. Significantly higher levels of sFasL and EMPs were detected in the patients at the time of aGVHD attack. In addition, sFasL exhibited significant elevation but EMPs exhibited simultaneously decrease within the early phase (+21d) after allo-HSCT in pre-aGVHD group compared with non-aGVHD group. At +21d, there was a significant difference of sFasL and EMPs between pre-aGVHD group and non-aGVHD group. Moreover our present study firstly reported that EMPs expressed higher Fas antigen (Fas(+)-EMPs) in the patients with aGVHD. Therefore it can be inferred that EMPs may play protective roles through Fas in endothelial cell damage of aGVHD after allo-HSCT. This suggested monitoring EMPs and sFasL in the early phase after HSCT may be useful for the early diagnosis and forecast of aGVHD and it also provided new clues in understanding the pathogenesis of endothelial cell injury during aGVHD after allo-HSCT and meanwhile help identifying new drugs to circumvent it in clinic.","['Wu, Qiuling', 'Chen, Huixin', 'Fang, Jun', 'Xie, Wei', 'Hong, Mei', 'Xia, Linghui']","['Wu Q', 'Chen H', 'Fang J', 'Xie W', 'Hong M', 'Xia L']","['Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110913,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (FAS protein, human)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell-Derived Microparticles/metabolism/*pathology', 'Endothelial Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Fas Ligand Protein/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications/therapy', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']",,2011/09/16 06:00,2012/03/07 06:00,['2011/09/16 06:00'],"['2011/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/08 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(11)00405-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2011.08.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2012 Mar;36(3):275-80. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2011.08.005.

With its advancement along with the increase of popularity, the technology affords the luxury that gene expressions can be measured in any of its multiple platforms. However, the generated results from the microarray platforms remain incomparable. In this direction, we earlier developed and tested an approach to address the incomparability of the expression measures of Affymetrix(R)- and cDNA-platforms. The method was an exploit involving transformation of Affymetrix data, which brought the gene expressions of both cDNA and Affymetrix platforms to a common and comparable level. The encouraging outcome of that investigation has subsequently acted as a motivator to focus attention on examining further in the direction of defining the association between the two platforms. Accordingly, this paper takes on a novel exploration towards determining a precise association using a wide range of statistical and machine learning approaches, specifically the various models are elaborately trailed using-regression (linear, cubic-polynomial, LOESS, bootstrap aggregating) and artificial neural networks (self-organizing maps and feedforward networks). After careful comparison, the existing relationship between the data from the two platforms is found to be non-linear where feedforward neural network captures the best delineation of the association.","['Sarmah, Chintanu Kumar', 'Samarasinghe, Sandhya']","['Sarmah CK', 'Samarasinghe S']","['Centre for Advanced Computational Solutions (C-fACS), Lincoln University, Christchurch, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20110913,United States,Comput Biol Med,Computers in biology and medicine,1250250,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Child', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Models, Genetic', '*Neural Networks, Computer', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Regression Analysis']",,2011/09/16 06:00,2012/03/16 06:00,['2011/09/16 06:00'],"['2011/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/12 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0010-4825(11)00173-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.compbiomed.2011.08.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Comput Biol Med. 2011 Oct;41(10):980-6. doi: 10.1016/j.compbiomed.2011.08.007.

With activity being reported in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) resistant to currently available tyrosine kinase inhibitors, renewed interest has recently been generated. AREAS COVERED: The development of omacetaxine mepesuccinate, with emphasis on synthesis and mode of administration, is addressed. An overview on current clinical results as a single agent or within combination regimens in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and CML is given. EXPERT OPINION: Omacetaxine mepesuccinate has a unique mode of action and appreciable activity in AML and CML with generally mild nonhematologic toxicity. In patients with AML, results indicate a role within combination regimens in selected, possibly elderly patient populations. In CML, patients with resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, especially due to the T315I mutation, are the most intensively studied. Despite successful results in some patients, single-agent therapy with omacetaxine mepesuccinate has resulted in modest results. However, upfront combination with tyrosine kinase inhibitor represents an attractive option due their differing mechanisms of action.","['Kim, Theo Daniel', 'Frick, Mareike', 'le Coutre, Philipp']","['Kim TD', 'Frick M', 'le Coutre P']","['Medizinische Klinik m.S.

Cross-linking of alemtuzumab also induced capping and caspase-dependent apoptosis of the tumor lines. When using primary cells from B-CLL patients, alemtuzumab alone was capable of inducing protein phosphorylation and apoptosis through the cross-linking of alemtuzumab by FcgammaRIIb receptors on B-CLL cells. Apoptosis was prevented by blocking of FcgammaRIIb receptors with anti-CD32 antibody.

Peripheral blood is a particularly attractive body fluid for the detection of rare cells as its collection is minimally invasive and can be repeated throughout the course of the disease. Because the number of rare cells in mononuclear cells can be very low (1 in 10 million), a large number of cells must be quickly screened, which places demanding requirements on the screening technology. While enrichment technology has shown promise in managing metastatic disease, enrichment can cause distortions of cell morphology that limit pathological identification, and the enrichment targeting adds additional constraints that can affect sensitivity. Here, we describe a new approach for detecting rare leukemia cells that does not require prior enrichment. We have developed an immunocytochemical assay for identification of leukemia cells spiked in peripheral blood samples, and a high-speed scanning instrument with high numerical aperture and wide field of view to efficiently locate these cells in large sample sizes. A multiplex immunoassay with four biomarkers was used to uniquely identify the rare cells from leukocytes and labeling artifacts. The cytometer preserves the cell morphology and accurately locates labeled rare cells for subsequent high resolution imaging. The sensitivity and specificity of the approach show promise for detection of a low number of leukemia cells in blood (1 in 10 million nucleated cells). The method enables rapid location of rare circulating cells (25 M cells/min), no specific enrichment step, and excellent imaging of cellular morphology with multiple immunofluorescent markers. The cell imaging is comparable to other imaging approaches such as laser scan cytometry and image flow cytometry, but the cell analysis rate is many orders of magnitude faster making this approach practical for detection of rare cells.","['Liu, Xiaohe', 'Hsieh, H Ben', 'Campana, Dario', 'Bruce, Richard H']","['Liu X', 'Hsieh HB', 'Campana D', 'Bruce RH']","['Biomedical Engineering, Palo Alto Research Center, Palo Alto, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110913,United States,Cytometry A,Cytometry.

HVS strain C488 is also capable of transforming human T-lymphocytes to stable growth in culture. The most susceptible species for oncogenesis are New World primates, in particular the cottontop tamarin (Saguinus oedipus). However, Old World monkeys such as macaques are the most used animal model for the close-to-human situation. The limited data on HVS infection in Old World monkeys prompted us to investigate susceptibility to infection and disease induction by HVS in macaques. After having established that rhesus macaques can be infected productively, and that rhesus T-cells can be transformed in vivo by HVS, we observed induction of lymphoma in all inoculated animals. Pre-existing humoral immunity in part of the rhesus colony capable of blocking HVS infection could be overcome by preselecting rhesus macaques for lack of this immunity of unknown origin. HVS infection of rhesus macaques as compared to that of New World monkeys has the advantages that disease progression is more prolonged, and larger blood volumes can be collected, which allows more extended analyses. Also, rhesus monkeys are the best immunologically and immunogenetically characterized primate species next to humans. This model could be useful for the evaluation of candidate tumor vaccines and to test novel approaches for cancer immunotherapy. In addition, HVS infection of macaques could eventually be useful as a surrogate model to address certain questions in rhadinovirus-induced human cancer such as effusion lymphoma or Kaposi's sarcoma.","['Rosenwirth, Brigitte', 'Kondova, Ivanela', 'Niphuis, Henk', 'Greenwood, Edward J D', 'Schmidt, Fabian', 'Verschoor, Ernst J', 'Wittmann, Sabine', 'Heeney, Jonathan L', 'Bogers, Willy M J M', 'Fickenscher, Helmut', 'Koopman, Gerrit']","['Rosenwirth B', 'Kondova I', 'Niphuis H', 'Greenwood EJ', 'Schmidt F', 'Verschoor EJ', 'Wittmann S', 'Heeney JL', 'Bogers WM', 'Fickenscher H', 'Koopman G']","['Biomedical Primate Research Center, Rijswijk, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Med Virol,Journal of medical virology,7705876,,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Herpesviridae Infections/*pathology', 'Herpesvirus 2, Saimiriine/*pathogenicity', 'Lymphoma/*pathology/virology', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Male', 'Rhadinovirus/pathogenicity', 'T-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*pathology']",,2011/09/15 06:00,2012/01/11 06:00,['2011/09/15 06:00'],"['2011/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jmv.22197 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Virol. 2011 Nov;83(11):1938-50. doi: 10.1002/jmv.22197.,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

The inactivation of FA genes, in particular FANCF, has also been documented in sporadic tumours in non-FA patients. To study whether there is a causal relationship between FA pathway defects and tumour development, we have generated a mouse model with a targeted disruption of the FA core complex gene Fancf. Fancf-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts displayed a phenotype typical for FA cells: they showed an aberrant response to DNA cross-linking agents as manifested by G(2) arrest, chromosomal aberrations, reduced survival, and an inability to monoubiquitinate FANCD2. Fancf homozygous mice were viable, born following a normal Mendelian distribution, and showed no growth retardation or developmental abnormalities. The gonads of Fancf mutant mice functioned abnormally, showing compromised follicle development and spermatogenesis as has been observed in other FA mouse models and in FA patients. In a cohort of Fancf-deficient mice, we observed decreased overall survival and increased tumour incidence. Notably, in seven female mice, six ovarian tumours developed: five granulosa cell tumours and one luteoma. One mouse had developed tumours in both ovaries. High-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) on these tumours suggests that the increased incidence of ovarian tumours correlates with the infertility in Fancf-deficient mice and the genomic instability characteristic of FA pathway deficiency.","['Bakker, Sietske T', 'van de Vrugt, Henri J', 'Visser, Jenny A', 'Delzenne-Goette, Elly', 'van der Wal, Anja', 'Berns, Mariska A D', 'van de Ven, Marieke', 'Oostra, Anneke B', 'de Vries, Sandra', 'Kramer, Piet', 'Arwert, Fre', 'van der Valk, Martin', 'de Winter, Johan P', 'te Riele, Hein']","['Bakker ST', 'van de Vrugt HJ', 'Visser JA', 'Delzenne-Goette E', 'van der Wal A', 'Berns MA', 'van de Ven M', 'Oostra AB', 'de Vries S', 'Kramer P', 'Arwert F', 'van der Valk M', 'de Winter JP', 'te Riele H']","['Division of Molecular Biology, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066 CX Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111114,England,J Pathol,The Journal of pathology,0204634,['0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group F Protein)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group F Protein/deficiency/*genetics', 'Female', 'Granulosa Cell Tumor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Luteoma/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*genetics']",,2011/09/15 06:00,2012/01/20 06:00,['2011/09/15 06:00'],"['2011/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/23 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/path.2992 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pathol. 2012 Jan;226(1):28-39. doi: 10.1002/path.2992.

Myeloid leukemia cell lines were screened for idarubicin-induced apoptosis, cell-cycle progression, cell-cycle-dependent MAP kinase kinase (MEK-1/2) activation, and Top2 expression. Cell-cycle-dependent activation of MEK/ERK signaling was blocked using farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI) BMS-214,662 and dual prenyltransferase inhibitor (DPI) L-778,123 to disrupt Ras signaling. Idarubicin caused a G2/M cell-cycle arrest characterized by elevated diphosphorylated MEK-1/2 and Top2alpha expression levels. The FTI/DPIs elicited distinct effects on Ras signaling, protein prenylation, cell cycling and apoptosis. Combining these FTI/DPIs with idarubicin synergistically inhibited proliferation of leukemia cell lines, but the L-778,123+idarubicin combination exhibited synergistic growth inhibition over a greater range of drug concentrations. Interestingly, combined FTI/DPI treatment synergistically inhibited cell proliferation, induced apoptosis and nearly completely blocked protein prenylation. Inhibition of K-Ras expression by RNA interference or blockade of its post-translational prenylation led to increased BMS-214,662-induced apoptosis. Our results suggest that nearly complete inhibition of protein prenylation using an FTI + DPI combination is the most effective method to induce apoptosis and to block anthracycline-induced activation of ERK signaling.","['Morgan, Michael A', 'Onono, Fredrick O', 'Spielmann, H Peter', 'Subramanian, Thangaiah', 'Scherr, Michaela', 'Venturini, Letizia', 'Dallmann, Iris', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Reuter, Christoph W M']","['Morgan MA', 'Onono FO', 'Spielmann HP', 'Subramanian T', 'Scherr M', 'Venturini L', 'Dallmann I', 'Ganser A', 'Reuter CW']","['Department of Hematology, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, D-30625, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110914,Germany,J Mol Med (Berl),"Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)",9504370,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)', '12794-10-4 (Benzodiazepines)', '2A2059P49U (L 778,123)', 'EC 2.5.1.1 (Dimethylallyltranstransferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.29 (Farnesyltranstransferase)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (TOP2A protein, human)', 'L2U9GFD244', '(7-cyano-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1-(1H-imidazol-4-ylmethyl)-3-(phenylmethyl)-4-(2-thie', 'nylsulfonyl)-1H-1,4-benzodiazepine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Anthracyclines', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzodiazepines/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Dimethylallyltranstransferase/antagonists & inhibitors', '*Drug Synergism', 'Farnesyltranstransferase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/pharmacology', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins', 'Protein Prenylation/*drug effects']",,2011/09/15 06:00,2012/07/31 06:00,['2011/09/15 06:00'],"['2011/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/08/14 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00109-011-0814-7 [doi]'],ppublish,J Mol Med (Berl). 2012 Feb;90(2):149-61. doi: 10.1007/s00109-011-0814-7.

METHODS: We retrospectively compared the results of 31 elderly acute myeloid leukemia patients (median age of 74 years) who were treated according to the new algorithm. RESULTS: Fifteen patients with a good performance status and no unfavorable karyotypes were treated with either intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy (<70 years, nine cases) or adapted etoposide, 6-thioguanine and idarubicine (>70 years, six cases); 16 cases with a poor performance status or unfavorable cytogenetics received supportive care only. Six patients achieved a complete remission and two achieved a partial remission after chemotherapy. There were three toxic deaths during induction, two in the adapted etoposide, 6-thioguanine and idarubicine group and one in the intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy group. The overall median survival time was 2.96 months, 1.3 months in the supportive care group, and 4.6 months in the treatment group.

The optimal treatment schedule and optimal timing of GO administration relative to other agents remains unknown. Conventional pharmacokinetic analysis has been of limited insight for the schedule optimization. We developed a mechanism-based mathematical model and employed it to analyze the time-course of free and GO-bound CD33 molecules on the lekemic blasts in individual AML patients treated with GO. We calculated expected intravascular drug exposure (I-AUC) as a surrogate marker for the response to the drug. A high CD33 production rate and low drug efflux were the most important determinants of high I-AUC, characterizing patients with favorable pharmacokinetic profile and, hence, improved response. I-AUC was insensitive to other studied parameters within biologically relevant ranges, including internalization rate and dissociation constant. Our computations suggested that even moderate blast burden reduction prior to drug administration enables lowering of GO doses without significantly compromising intracellular drug exposure. These findings indicate that GO may optimally be used after cyto-reductive chemotherapy, rather than before, or concomitantly with it, and that GO efficacy can be maintained by dose reduction to 6 mg/m(2) and a dosing interval of 7 days. Model predictions are validated by comparison with the results of EORTC-GIMEMA AML19 clinical trial, where two different GO schedules were administered.

Other studies examining parental occupational exposure to ELF and ALL have reported mixed results. METHODS: In an Australian case-control study of ALL in children aged < 15 years, parents were asked about tasks they undertook in each job. Exposure variables were created for any occupational exposure before the birth of the child, in jobs 2 years before birth, in jobs 1 year before birth and up to 1 year after birth. RESULTS: In all, 379 case and 854 control mothers and 328 case and 748 control fathers completed an occupational history. Exposure to ELF in all time periods was similar in case and control mothers. There was no difference in exposure between case and control fathers. There was no association between maternal (odds ratio (OR)=0.96; 95% CI=0.74-1.25) or paternal (OR=0.78; 95% CI=0.56-1.09) exposure to ELF any time before the birth and risk of childhood ALL.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression and function of HSPB8 in hematopoietic malignancies. Expression and induced expression of HSPB8 was evaluated in hematopoietic tumor cell lines and bone marrow samples from patients with leukemia. Methylation status was investigated by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. The role of HSPB8 in hematopoietic malignancies was addressed by reintroducing HSPB8 expression into the K562 (leukemia) and Namalwa (lymphoma) cell lines. Expression of HSPB8 was absent in hematopoietic tumor cell lines and primary patient and normal volunteer samples. Promoter DNA methylation of HSPB8 was observed in these cells. HSPB8 expression could be restored after demethylation treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Overexpression of HSPB8 reduced colony formation of both K562 and Namalwa cell lines, inhibited the cell growth of Namalwa in vitro, and suppressed tumor formation of K562 cells in vivo. The present study demonstrates that HSPB8 is silenced by DNA methylation in hematopoietic malignant and normal cells and its expression can be induced by treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Overexpression of HSPB8 may have an antitumor activity in chronic myelogenous leukemia and lymphoma.","['Cui, Xue-Ying', 'Wang, Nan', 'Yang, Bin-Xia', 'Gao, Wei-Feng', 'Lin, Yong-Min', 'Yao, Xing-Rong', 'Ma, Xiao-Tong']","['Cui XY', 'Wang N', 'Yang BX', 'Gao WF', 'Lin YM', 'Yao XR', 'Ma XT']","['State Key Laboratory for Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110910,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (HSPB8 protein, human)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', '*DNA Methylation/genetics', 'Decitabine', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/biosynthesis/deficiency/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/biosynthesis/deficiency/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2011/09/15 06:00,2012/02/02 06:00,['2011/09/15 06:00'],"['2011/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/29 00:00 [revised]', '2011/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(11)00451-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2011.09.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2012 Jan;40(1):14-21. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2011.09.004.

In the present study, the objective was to investigate the biological and clinical significance of telomere length and promoter methylation of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A cohort of 169 childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemias was investigated for telomere length, human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene promoter methylation status, genomic aberrations, immunophenotype, and clinical outcomes. Methylation of the core promoter of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene was demonstrated in 24% of diagnostic samples, with a significant difference between B-cell precursor (n = 130) and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n = 17) cases (18% and 72%, respectively; p < 0.001). No remission sample demonstrated hTERT promoter methylation (n = 40). Within the B-cell precursor group, t(12;21)(p13;q22) [ETV6/RUNX1] cases (n = 19) showed a much higher frequency of hTERT methylation than high-hyperdiploid (51-61 chromosomes) ALL (n = 44) (63% and 7%, respectively; p < 0.001). hTERT messenger RNA levels were negatively associated with methylation status and, in the t(12;21) group, methylated cases had shorter telomeres (p = 0.017). In low-risk B-cell precursor patients (n = 101), long telomeres indicated a worse prognosis. The collected data from the present study indicate that the telomere biology in childhood ALL has clinical implications and reflects molecular differences between diverse ALL subgroups.","['Borssen, Magnus', 'Cullman, Inger', 'Noren-Nystrom, Ulrika', 'Sundstrom, Christer', 'Porwit, Anna', 'Forestier, Erik', 'Roos, Goran']","['Borssen M', 'Cullman I', 'Noren-Nystrom U', 'Sundstrom C', 'Porwit A', 'Forestier E', 'Roos G']","['Department of Medical Biosciences, Umea University, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110910,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow Cells/ultrastructure', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cohort Studies', '*DNA Methylation', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*genetics/pathology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Telomerase/*genetics', 'Telomere/*ultrastructure']",,2011/09/15 06:00,2012/01/06 06:00,['2011/09/15 06:00'],"['2011/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/17 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(11)00450-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2011.08.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2011 Dec;39(12):1144-51. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2011.08.014.

Teratology has been extensively studied in animals exposed to ELF MFs but experiments have not established adverse developmental effects. Childhood leukaemia has been the only cancer consistently reported in epidemiological studies as associated with exposure to ELF MFs. This association has been the basis for the classification as ""possibly carcinogenic to humans"" by the International Agency for Research on Cancer in 2002. Animal experiments have provided only limited support for these epidemiological findings. However, none but one study used an animal model for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), the main form of childhood leukaemia, and exposures to ELF MFs were not carried out over the whole pregnancy period, when the first hit of ALL is assumed to occur. Moreover, there are no generally accepted biophysical mechanisms that could explain carcinogenic effects of low-level MFs. The radical pair mechanism and related cryptochromes (CRY) molecules have recently been identified in birds and other non-mammalian species, as a sensor of the geomagnetic field, involved in navigation. The hypothesis has to be tested in mammalian models. CRY, which is part of the molecular circadian clock machinery, is a ubiquitous protein likely to be involved in cancer cell growth and DNA repair. In summary, we now have some clues to test for a better characterization of the interaction between ALL and ELF MFs exposure.","['Lagroye, Isabelle', 'Percherancier, Yann', 'Juutilainen, Jukka', 'De Gannes, Florence Poulletier', 'Veyret, Bernard']","['Lagroye I', 'Percherancier Y', 'Juutilainen J', 'De Gannes FP', 'Veyret B']","['Bioelectromagnetics Laboratory, Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, ENSCBP, Pessac, France. isabelle.lagroye@ims-bordeaux.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20110908,England,Prog Biophys Mol Biol,Progress in biophysics and molecular biology,0401233,['0 (Free Radicals)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Assay', 'Free Radicals/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Fields/*adverse effects', '*Models, Animal', 'Neoplasms/etiology', 'Teratology']",,2011/09/15 06:00,2012/03/23 06:00,['2011/09/15 06:00'],"['2011/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0079-6107(11)00102-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2011.09.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Prog Biophys Mol Biol. 2011 Dec;107(3):369-73. doi: 10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2011.09.003.

Malignant blood diseases are the most frequently occurring childhood cancers. Although their mortality rate has been tending to decrease, they often seem to develop after ""opportunistic"" latent infections persist, undetected, in un-eradicated sites that may be of dental origin. This infectious risk, frequently undiagnosed in hospitals, should be of concern to both general dentists and orthodontists. OBJECTIVES: General dentists and orthodontists each have specific roles to play in teaching children about oral health at an early age and in detecting and eradicating infection as well as in seeing at risk children in regular follow-up visits. DISCUSSION: Dentists should examine children on regularly scheduled preventive appointments and treat dental caries when they discover it. Orthodontists, who see the children they are treating on frequently scheduled appointments, should always be on the alert for incipient caries in their patients and be careful to make the appliances they wear as well fitting and non-irritating as possible to minimize the risk of inflammation and development of sore spots. Both dentists and orthodontists should teach their patients how to maintain healthy diets and good oral hygiene.

Leukemia in the esophagus and stomach includes hemorrhagic lesions from petechiae to ulcers, leukemic infiltrates, pseudomembranous esophagitis, and fungal esophagitis. Lesions in the small and large bowel are usually hemorrhagic or infiltrative. Infiltration of lymphoreticular organs, mainly spleen, liver, and lymph nodes, is more prominent in chronic than acute leukemia. Neutropenic enterocolitis, a necrotizing process involving the cecum, ascending colon, and terminal ileum, is increasing in incidence due to greater intensity of chemotherapy. Distension of bowel leads to mucosal breaches, permitting entry of organisms that grow profusely in the absence of neutrophils. Ischemic necrosis follows, leading to perforation and/or peritonitis. Patients present with fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension and tenderness. Ultrasound and computed tomography scans show thickening of the bowel wall.

Remarkably, nuclear phosphoinositide metabolism operates independently from that present elsewhere in the cell. Although nuclear phosphoinositides generate second messengers such as diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate, it is becoming increasingly clear that they may act by themselves to influence chromatin structure, gene expression, DNA repair, and mRNA export. The understanding of the biological roles played by phosphoinositides is supported by the recent acquisitions demonstrating the presence in the nuclear compartment of several proteins harboring phosphoinositide-binding domains. Some of these proteins have functional roles in RNA splicing/processing and chromatin assembly. Moreover, recent evidence shows that nuclear phospholipase Cbeta1 (a key phosphoinositide metabolizing enzyme) could somehow be involved in the myelodysplastic syndrome, i.e. a hematopoietic disorder that frequently evolves into an acute leukemia. This review aims to highlight the most significant and updated findings about phosphoinositide metabolism in the nucleus under both physiological and pathological conditions.","['Martelli, Alberto M', 'Ognibene, Andrea', 'Buontempo, Francesca', 'Fini, Milena', 'Bressanin, Daniela', 'Goto, Kaoru', 'McCubrey, James A', 'Cocco, Lucio', 'Evangelisti, Camilla']","['Martelli AM', 'Ognibene A', 'Buontempo F', 'Fini M', 'Bressanin D', 'Goto K', 'McCubrey JA', 'Cocco L', 'Evangelisti C']","['Department of Human Anatomy, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy. alberto.martelli@unibo.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110914,England,Crit Rev Biochem Mol Biol,Critical reviews in biochemistry and molecular biology,8903774,"['0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)']",IM,"['Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositols/chemistry/classification/*metabolism', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/chemistry/metabolism', 'Phosphotransferases/chemistry/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Type C Phospholipases/chemistry/metabolism']",,2011/09/15 06:00,2012/01/24 06:00,['2011/09/15 06:00'],"['2011/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10409238.2011.609530 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Rev Biochem Mol Biol. 2011 Oct;46(5):436-57. doi: 10.3109/10409238.2011.609530.

We studied antigen-expression profiles of blasts/dendritic cells (DCs) generated from 137 acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/49 myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients with six different DC-generating media by flow-cytometry combining expression of blast/maturation and DC antigens (DCA:CD1a,b,c, CD25, CD40, CD80, CD83, CD86, CD137-L and CD206). RESULTS: First, DCA are regularly and variably expressed on uncultured blasts/mononuclear cells (MNCs). Individual patients' DCA profiles must be evaluated before DC-culture to find suitable DCA to estimate quality/quantity of DC after culture. Second, after culture in every patient, at least one marker fulfilled these criteria. Third, different DC-generating methods showed varying efficiency to generate DC: not every method was always successful. Fourth, individual FACS-DCA profiles showed a successful DC/DC(leu) generation with at least one of three previously tested methods in every given AML/MDS case. Fifth, pooling results of all selected best methods in every given case, 28/30% DC were generated from AML/MDS samples: >60% viable DC, on average 49/56% mature DC and on average 36% of blasts were convertible to DC(leu) resulting in on average 49% DC(leu) of AML-DC. CONCLUSIONS: Individual DCA-expression profiles should be evaluated before culture to evaluate DC counts/subtypes (mature/viableDC, DC(leu)) in individual patients.","['Dreyssig, Julia', 'Kremser, Andreas', 'Liepert, Anja', 'Grabrucker, Christine', 'Freudenreich, Markus', 'Schmid, Christoph', 'Kroell, Tanja', 'Scholl, Nina', 'Tischer, Johanna', 'Kufner, Stephany', 'Salih, Helmut', 'Kolb, Hans-Jochem', 'Schmetzer, Helga Maria']","['Dreyssig J', 'Kremser A', 'Liepert A', 'Grabrucker C', 'Freudenreich M', 'Schmid C', 'Kroell T', 'Scholl N', 'Tischer J', 'Kufner S', 'Salih H', 'Kolb HJ', 'Schmetzer HM']","['Medical Department III, University Hospital Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Immunotherapy,Immunotherapy,101485158,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Mannose Receptor)', '0 (Mannose-Binding Lectins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens/*immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Lectins, C-Type/analysis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Mannose Receptor', 'Mannose-Binding Lectins/analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*immunology/therapy', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",,2011/09/15 06:00,2011/12/30 06:00,['2011/09/15 06:00'],"['2011/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2217/imt.11.108 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunotherapy. 2011 Sep;3(9):1113-24. doi: 10.2217/imt.11.108.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, other than a lower incidence of T-cell ALL and a greater likelihood of unfavourable chromosomal abnormalities, the clinical and biological characteristics of Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) ALL in the elderly at diagnosis are no different from those observed in younger adults, and do not account, per se, for its poor prognosis. Rather, the latter is explained to a large extent by a high rate of treatment-induced mortality and/or by the use of less toxic but comparatively less effective drug regimens. Ph- ALL patients are offered treatments ranging from palliative care to intensive chemotherapy, but the survival of patients given palliative or minimally active chemotherapy is extremely poor. However, a valid comparison with patients given more intensive chemotherapy is lacking, as, in most cases, minimally active chemotherapy is used in patients with poor performance status at diagnosis. When more intensive chemotherapy is used, unacceptably high early mortality rates (up to 50%) have been reported, with complete-response rates ranging from 40% to 80% and 5-year survival consistently below 20%. Clearly, the results of therapy are unsatisfactory in Ph- ALL patients, which should encourage the development of innovative approaches, such as the use of new monoclonal antibodies. On the other hand, the availability of imatinib and second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has improved the prognosis of Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) ALL in older patients. Impressive response rates have been reported, even in patients given imatinib and corticosteroids without additional chemotherapy, at the cost of manageable toxicity. Paradoxically, in the imatinib era, elderly patients with Ph+ leukaemia (which is clearly associated with an adverse prognosis in younger adults) seem to survive longer than Ph- elderly patients, although long-term survivors still remain relatively few. Whether new TKIs, such as dasatinib or nilotinib, will improve the prognosis of Ph+ ALL in the elderly is being prospectively assessed in several countries.","['Rousselot, Philippe', 'Delannoy, Andre']","['Rousselot P', 'Delannoy A']","['Department of Haematology, Hpital Andr Mignot, Versailles, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,New Zealand,Drugs Aging,Drugs & aging,9102074,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Humans', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy/metabolism/prevention & control', 'Prognosis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr/metabolism']",,2011/09/15 06:00,2012/05/05 06:00,['2011/09/15 06:00'],"['2011/09/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/05 06:00 [medline]']","['6 [pii]', '10.2165/11592850-000000000-00000 [doi]']",ppublish,Drugs Aging. 2011 Sep 1;28(9):749-64. doi: 10.2165/11592850-000000000-00000.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutated IDH1 or IDH2 protein leads to the generation of excessive amounts of the metabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) in tumor cells. Here, we evaluated whether 2HG levels in preoperative serum samples from patients with gliomas correlate with the IDH1/2 mutation status and whether there is an association between 2HG levels and glioma size. In contrast to the strong accumulation of 2HG in the serum of patients with IDH1/2 mutated acute myeloid leukaemia, no accumulation was observed in this series of IDH1/2 mutated gliomas. Furthermore, we found no association between glioma size measured by magnetic resonance imaging and 2HG levels. We conclude that 2HG levels in preoperative sera from patients with diffusely infiltrating gliomas of the WHO grades II and III cannot be used as a marker to differentiate between tumors with versus without IDH1/2 mutation. Furthermore, the observation that there is no correlation between 2HG levels and tumor volume may indicate that 2HG cannot be utilized as marker to monitor tumor growth in gliomas.","['Capper, David', 'Simon, Matthias', 'Langhans, Claus-Dieter', 'Okun, Jurgen G', 'Tonn, Jorg C', 'Weller, Michael', 'von Deimling, Andreas', 'Hartmann, Christian']","['Capper D', 'Simon M', 'Langhans CD', 'Okun JG', 'Tonn JC', 'Weller M', 'von Deimling A', 'Hartmann C']","['Department of Neuropathology, Institute of Pathology, Ruprecht-Karls-University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111102,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Glutarates)', '2889-31-8 (alpha-hydroxyglutarate)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

To investigate the role of the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) in erythropoiesis, we studied the protein's expression on mouse erythroid precursors in vivo and utilized an in vitro model of the erythroid differentiation of murine erythroleukemia cells (MEL) to evaluate the effect of silencing PrP(C) through RNA interference.The expression of PrP(C) and selected differentiation markers was analyzed by quantitative multicolor flow cytometry, western blot analysis and quantitative RT-PCR. The silencing of PrP(C) expression in MEL cells was achieved by expression of shRNAmir from an integrated retroviral vector genome. The initial upregulation of PrP(C) expression in differentiating erythroid precursors was detected both in vivo and in vitro, suggesting PrP(C)'s importance to the early stages of differentiation. The upregulation was highest on early erythroblasts (16200+/-3700 PrP(C) / cell) and was followed by the gradual decrease of PrP(C) level with the precursor's maturation reaching 470+/-230 PrP(C) / cell on most mature CD71(-)Ter119(+) small precursors. Interestingly, the downregulation of PrP(C) protein with maturation of MEL cells was not accompanied by the decrease of PrP mRNA. The stable expression of anti-Prnp shRNAmir in MEL cells led to the efficient (>80%) silencing of PrP(C) levels. Cell growth, viability, hemoglobin production and the transcription of selected differentiation markers were not affected by the downregulation of PrP(C).In conclusion, the regulation of PrP(C) expression in differentiating MEL cells mimics the pattern detected on mouse erythroid precursors in vivo. Decrease of PrP(C) protein expression during MEL cell maturation is not regulated on transcriptional level. The efficient silencing of PrP(C) levels, despite not affecting MEL cell differentiation, enables created MEL lines to be used for studies of PrP(C) cellular function.","['Panigaj, Martin', 'Glier, Hana', 'Wildova, Marcela', 'Holada, Karel']","['Panigaj M', 'Glier H', 'Wildova M', 'Holada K']","['Institute of Immunology and Microbiology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110902,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Prions)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Prions/*genetics', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Spleen/cytology']",PMC3166331,2011/09/14 06:00,2011/12/30 06:00,['2011/09/14 06:00'],"['2011/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0024599 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-07472 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(9):e24599. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0024599.

Here, we report the first generation of bovine iPSC-like cells following transfection with a novel virus-free poly-promoter vector. This vector contains the bovine cDNAs for OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC, each controlled by its own independent promoter. Bovine fibroblasts were cultured without feeders in a chemically defined medium containing leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and inhibitors of MEK1/2 and glycogen synthase kinase-3 signaling ('2i'). Non-invasive real-time kinetic profiling revealed a different response of bovine vs human and mouse cells to culture in 2i/LIF. In bovine, 2i was necessary and sufficient to induce the appearance of tightly packed alkaline phosphatase-positive iPSC-like colonies. These colonies formed in the absence of DNA synthesis and did not expand after passaging. Following transfection, non-proliferative primary colonies expressed discriminatory markers of pluripotency, including endogenous iPSC factors, CDH1, DPPA3, NANOG, SOCS3, ZFP42, telomerase activity, Tra-1-60/81 and SSEA-3/4, but not SSEA-1. This indicates that they had initiated a self-sustaining pluripotency programme. Bovine iPSC-like cells maintained a normal karyotype and differentiated into derivatives of all three germ layers in vitro and in teratomas. Our study demonstrates that conversion into induced pluripotency can occur in quiescent cells, following a previously undescribed route of direct cell reprogramming.

To date, there are no known gene targets of Bcl11b in the nervous system. Here, we define targets for Bcl11b in striatal cells by performing chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) in combination with genome-wide expression profiling. Transcriptome-wide analysis revealed that 694 genes were significantly altered in striatal cells over-expressing Bcl11b, including genes showing striatal-enriched expression similar to Bcl11b. ChIP-seq analysis demonstrated that Bcl11b bound a mixture of coding and non-coding sequences that were within 10 kb of the transcription start site of an annotated gene. Integrating all ChIP-seq hits with the microarray expression data, 248 direct targets of Bcl11b were identified. Functional analysis on the integrated gene target list identified several zinc-finger encoding genes as Bcl11b targets, and further revealed a significant association of Bcl11b to brain-derived neurotrophic factor/neurotrophin signaling.

Therefore, we determined the expression and localization of CNTF receptors and the physiological consequence of their activation in primary cultures of human fetal RPE (hfRPE). Cultured hfRPE express CNTF, CT1, and OsM and their receptors, including CNTFRalpha, LIFRbeta, gp130, and OsMRbeta, all localized mainly at the apical membrane. Exogenous CNTF, CT1, or OsM induces STAT3 phosphorylation, and OsM also induces the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (p44/42 MAP kinase). CNTF increases RPE survivability, but not rates of phagocytosis. CNTF increases secretion of NT3 to the apical bath and decreases that of VEGF, IL8, and TGFbeta2. It also significantly increases fluid absorption (J(V)) across intact monolayers of hfRPE by activating CFTR chloride channels at the basolateral membrane. CNTF induces profound changes in RPE cell biology, biochemistry, and physiology, including the increase in cell survival, polarized secretion of cytokines/neurotrophic factors, and the increase in steady-state fluid absorption mediated by JAK/STAT3 signaling. In vivo, these changes, taken together, could serve to regulate the microenvironment around the distal retinal/RPE/Bruch's membrane complex and provide protection against neurodegenerative disease.","['Li, Rong', 'Wen, Rong', 'Banzon, Tina', 'Maminishkis, Arvydas', 'Miller, Sheldon S']","['Li R', 'Wen R', 'Banzon T', 'Maminishkis A', 'Miller SS']","['National Eye Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20110902,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Organic Cation Transporter 1)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Absorption', 'Body Fluids/*metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Polarity', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/*metabolism', 'Fetus/cytology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Oncostatin M/genetics/metabolism', 'Organic Cation Transporter 1/genetics', 'Phagocytosis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Subunits/metabolism', 'Protein Transport', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism', 'Retinal Pigment Epithelium/cytology/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism']",PMC3166283,2011/09/14 06:00,2011/12/30 06:00,['2011/09/14 06:00'],"['2011/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0023148 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-05273 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(9):e23148. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0023148.

To examine the possibility of a similar phenomenon in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), we used multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure 30 plasma cytokines in 78 patients with primary MDS. Compared with normal controls (n = 35), the levels of 19 cytokines were significantly altered. Multivariable analysis identified increased levels of CXCL10 (P<0.01), IL-7 (P = 0.02) and IL-6 (P = 0.07) as predictors of shortened survival; the survival association remained significant when the Cox model was adjusted for the International Prognostic Scoring System, age, transfusion-need or thrombocytopenia. MDS patients with normal plasma levels of CXCL10, IL-7 and IL-6 lived significantly longer (median survival 76 months) than those with elevated levels of at least one of the three cytokines (median survival 25 months) (P<0.01). Increased levels of IL-6 were associated with inferior leukemia-free survival, independent of other prognostic factors (P = 0.01).

We examined this possibility in 301 consecutive patients with chronic-phase primary myelofibrosis (PMF). The mutant IDH was detected in 12 patients (4%): 7 IDH2 (5 R140Q, 1 R140W and 1 R172G) and 5 IDH1 (3 R132S and 2 R132C). In all, 6 (50%) of the 12 IDH-mutated patients also expressed JAK2V617F.

Multivariable analysis that accounted for conventional risk factors disclosed inferior overall survival (OS; P=0.03) and leukemia-free survival (LFS; P=0.003) in IDH-mutated patients: OS hazard ratio (HR) was 0.39 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.2-0.75), 0.50 (95% CI 0.27-0.95) and 0.53 (95% CI 0.23-1.2) for patients with no, JAK2 or MPL mutations, respectively.

Little is known about the relationships between effects and concentrations of either unbound imatinib (f-IM) or imatinib's major metabolite, N-desmethyl imatinib (NDI). In part, this is because of the lack of a single, validated, well-described clinically useful assay for these measurements. The authors report the development and application of such an assay. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single liquid-chromatography tandem-mass-spectrometry assay was used to monitor t-IM, f-IM, and t-NDI concentrations in CML and GIST patients treated at a tertiary German teaching hospital. The assay was also validated for measuring other kinase inhibitors, including t-nilotinib, sunitinib, and erlotinib. Ultrafiltration assays were validated and used to measure f-IM and to compare free fractions to plasma alpha1-acid glycoprotein concentrations (AGP). RESULTS: The assays were linear over a working range (in micrograms per liter) of 8.4-8370, 8.3-4165, and 1.0-250 and had within- and between-run coefficient of variance of <7%, <12%, and <9% for t-IM, t-NDI, and f-IM, respectively. The f-IM assay was reproducible despite high (25.2%-31.6%) but concentration-independent binding to ultrafiltration devices. Clinically relevant results, such as nondetectable (ND) t-IM (<8.4 mug/L) in non-responders and >1500 mug/L in patients with major toxicity, were found. Of 156 total samples from 68 adult CML patients and 127 total samples from 42 adult GIST, only 48 samples from 22 CML patients and 40 samples from 20 GIST patients were trough samples with adequate dosing and collection information. More than half (27 of 48 CML and 24 of 40 GIST) had t-IM concentrations >/=10% below recommended target concentrations (1002 mug/L for CML and 1100 mug/L for GIST). Concentrations >50% over targets were also found in 6 of 48 CML and 4 of 40 GIST samples. Wide variations in concentrations of t-IM (range, ND to 2973 mug/L), t-NDI (range, ND to 659 mug/L), f-IM (range, 8.3-262 mug/L), and t-IM:f-IM ratios (range, 2.6%-14%) were found both between and within patients. A statistically significant association (Spearman correlation coefficient and P value for all samples, r = 0.290 and P = 0.023; for trough only, r = -0.585 and P = 0.028) was found between AGP and f-IM concentrations but wide interpatient and intrapatient variations made individual predictions unreliable. CONCLUSIONS: The liquid-chromatography tandem-mass-spectrometry methods developed provided information useful to understand individual responses to therapy even though necessary sampling and dosing information was often not available. Wide unpredictable variations in t-IM, t-NDI, and f-IM were found. Clinical outcome trials are needed to examine whether f-IM or NDI monitoring can improve the ability to predict individual responses.","['Streit, Frank', 'Binder, Lutz', 'Hafke, Angelika', 'Brandhorst, Gunnar', 'Braulke, Friederike', 'Haase, Detlef', 'Armbrust, Thomas', 'Cameron, Silke', 'Ramadori, Giuliano', 'Oellerich, Michael', 'Walson, Philip']","['Streit F', 'Binder L', 'Hafke A', 'Brandhorst G', 'Braulke F', 'Haase D', 'Armbrust T', 'Cameron S', 'Ramadori G', 'Oellerich M', 'Walson P']","['Central Laboratory, Department of Clinical Chemistry, University Medical Center, George-August-University, Goettingen, Germany. fstreit@med.uni-goettingen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Ther Drug Monit,Therapeutic drug monitoring,7909660,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Chromatography, Liquid/*methods', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/blood/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry/*methods', 'Young Adult']",,2011/09/14 06:00,2012/01/27 06:00,['2011/09/14 06:00'],"['2011/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/FTD.0b013e3182263ac4 [doi]'],ppublish,Ther Drug Monit. 2011 Oct;33(5):632-43. doi: 10.1097/FTD.0b013e3182263ac4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review summarizes the recent developments in the clinical research and therapeutic applications defining the role of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT) in CR1. RECENT FINDINGS: Molecular markers in combinations with cytogenetics have improved the risk stratification and informed decision-making in patients with AML in CR1. In parallel, several important advances in the transplant field, such as better supportive care, improved transplant technology, increased availability of alternative donors, and reduced-intensity conditioning, have improved the safety as well as access of allo-HCT for a larger number of patients. SUMMARY: The progress in risk stratification and in transplant technology dictate that early donor identification search should be initiated for all eligible AML patients in CR1.","['Oran, Betul', 'Weisdorf, Daniel J']","['Oran B', 'Weisdorf DJ']","['Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. oranx002@umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,IM,"['Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/genetics/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Assessment']",PMC4909488,2011/09/14 06:00,2012/01/05 06:00,['2011/09/14 06:00'],"['2011/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e32834ba94c [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2011 Nov;18(6):395-400. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e32834ba94c.,,,,"['P01 CA065493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA111412/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA077598/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['NIHMS348482'],,,,,,,,,,

Currently, little is known about HO-1 and its role in human acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) to regulate apoptosis in response to chemotherapy. Recently, we showed that HO-1 protects AML samples from tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF)-induced apoptosis - it being regulated by transcription factors Nrf2, NF-kB and AP-1. This study aims to analyse the role of HO-1 in regulating apoptosis in AML cells in response to two front-line chemotherapeutic agents used for AML, cytarabine and daunorubicin. Here we show that HO-1 expression in AML samples was increased in response to both cytarabine and daunorubicin treatment, and micro RNA (miRNA) silenced HO-1 expression in combination with either daunorubicin or cytarabine induced a greater apoptotic responses in AML cells. Moreover, we showed that both daunorubicin and cytarabine induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation to induce apoptosis in AML. However, ROS-dependent induction of HO-1 was limiting the apoptotic response that is seen in AML towards cytarabine and daunorubicin treatment. These findings suggest concurrent inhibition of HO-1 expression in conjunction with chemotherapeutic treatment would improve the number of cases who reach complete remission.","['Heasman, Sally-Anne', 'Zaitseva, Lyubov', 'Bowles, Kristian M', 'Rushworth, Stuart A', 'Macewan, David J']","['Heasman SA', 'Zaitseva L', 'Bowles KM', 'Rushworth SA', 'Macewan DJ']","['School of Pharmacy, University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",PMC3248221,2011/09/14 06:00,2012/05/02 06:00,['2011/09/14 06:00'],"['2011/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/02 06:00 [medline]']","['321 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.321 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2011 Sep;2(9):658-68. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.321.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Serum levels of 23 cytokines were measured in 84 patients and 49 age-matched controls; 17 levels were significantly elevated in patients. Unsupervised hierarchical bicluster analysis identified 3 clusters (CLs) of highly correlated but differentially expressed cytokines: CL1 (CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, CCL3, CCL4, CCL19, IL-5, IL-12, and IFNgamma), CL2 (TNFalpha, IL-6, IL-8, and GM-CSF), and CL3 (IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-15, IL-17, and IFNalpha). Combination scores integrating expression of CL1/CL2 or CL1/CL3 strongly correlated (P < .005) with time-to-first-treatment and overall survival (OS), respectively. Patients with the worst course had high CL1 and low CL2 or CL3 levels. Multivariate analysis revealed that CL1/CL2 combination score and immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region mutation status were independent prognostic indicators for time-to-first-treatment, whereas CL1/CL3 combination score and immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region mutation status were independent markers for OS. Thus, we identified groups of cytokines differentially expressed in CLL that are independent prognostic indicators of aggressive disease and OS. These findings indicate the value of multicytokine analyses for prognosis and suggest therapeutic strategies in CLL aimed at reducing CL1 and increasing CL2/CL3 cytokines.","['Yan, Xiao-Jie', 'Dozmorov, Igor', 'Li, Wentian', 'Yancopoulos, Sophia', 'Sison, Cristina', 'Centola, Michael', 'Jain, Preetesh', 'Allen, Steven L', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Rai, Kanti R', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas', 'Sherry, Barbara']","['Yan XJ', 'Dozmorov I', 'Li W', 'Yancopoulos S', 'Sison C', 'Centola M', 'Jain P', 'Allen SL', 'Kolitz JE', 'Rai KR', 'Chiorazzi N', 'Sherry B']","['The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, Manhasset, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110912,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CCL17 protein, human)', '0 (CXCL11 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL17)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL11)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (IL5 protein, human)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Interleukin-17)', '0 (Interleukin-5)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chemokine CCL17/blood', 'Chemokine CXCL11/blood', 'Chemokines/blood/classification', 'Cytokines/*blood/*classification', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Interleukin-17/blood', 'Interleukin-5/blood', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/genetics/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis']",PMC3217404,2011/09/14 06:00,2012/01/04 06:00,['2011/09/14 06:00'],"['2011/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40370-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-03-342436 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Nov 10;118(19):5201-10. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-03-342436.

We report final analyses from the French Polycythemia Study Group (FPSG) study, which randomly assigned HU versus pipobroman as first-line therapy in 285 patients younger than age 65 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The full methodology has been described previously. FPSG results were updated with a median follow-up of 16.3 years. Statistical analysis was performed by using competing risks on the intention-to-treat population and according to main treatment received. RESULTS: Median survival was 17 years for the whole cohort, 20.3 years for the HU arm, and 15.4 years for the pipobroman arm (P = .008) and differed significantly from that in the general population. At 10, 15, and 20 years, cumulative incidence of acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS) was 6.6%, 16.5%, and 24% in the HU arm and 13%, 34%, and 52% in the pipobroman arm (P = .004). Cumulative myelofibrosis incidence at 10, 15, and 20 years according to main treatment received was 15%, 24%, and 32% with HU versus 5%, 10%, and 21% with pipobroman (P = .02). CONCLUSION: Data from this unique randomized trial comparing HU with another cytoreductive drug in PV showed that (1) survival of patients with PV treated with conventional agents differed from survival in the general population, (2) evolution to AML/MDS is the first cause of death, (3) pipobroman is leukemogenic and is unsuitable for first-line therapy, and (4) incidence of evolution to AML/MDS with HU is higher than previously reported, although consideration should be given to the natural evolution of PV.","['Kiladjian, Jean-Jacques', 'Chevret, Sylvie', 'Dosquet, Christine', 'Chomienne, Christine', 'Rain, Jean-Didier']","['Kiladjian JJ', 'Chevret S', 'Dosquet C', 'Chomienne C', 'Rain JD']","['Hopital Saint-Louis, AP-HP, 1 avenue Claude Vellefaux, Paris, France. jean-jacques.kiladjian@sls.aphp.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20110912,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['6Q99RDT97R (Pipobroman)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pipobroman/*therapeutic use', 'Polycythemia Vera/*drug therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",,2011/09/14 06:00,2012/02/15 06:00,['2011/09/14 06:00'],"['2011/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.36.0792 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.36.0792 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Oct 10;29(29):3907-13. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.36.0792.

Here, we report that the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) can efficiently promote cell death in alveolar, but not embryonal, rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines. Notably, 2-DG also induced cell differentiation accompanied by downregulation of PAX3/FOXO1a, the chromosome translocation-encoded fusion protein that is a central oncogenic driver in this disease. Cell death triggered by 2-DG was associated with its ability to activate Bax and Bak. Overexpression of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 homologues Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1 prevented apoptosis, indicating that cell death proceeds through the mitochondrial pathway. Mechanistic investigations indicated that Mcl-1 downregulation and Noxa upregulation were critical for 2-DG-induced apoptosis. In addition, 2-DG promoted eIF2alpha phosphorylation and inactivation of the mTOR pathway. Mcl-1 loss and cell death were prevented by downregulation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced protein ATF4 and by incubating cells in the presence of mannose, which reverted 2-DG-induced ER stress but not ATP depletion. Thus, energetic stresses created by 2-DG were not the primary cause of cell death. Together, our findings suggest that glycolysis inhibitors such as 2-DG may be highly effective in treating alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma and that Noxa could offer a prognostic marker to monitor the efficacy of such agents.","['Ramirez-Peinado, Silvia', 'Alcazar-Limones, Fermin', 'Lagares-Tena, Laura', 'El Mjiyad, Nadia', 'Caro-Maldonado, Alfredo', 'Tirado, Oscar M', 'Munoz-Pinedo, Cristina']","['Ramirez-Peinado S', 'Alcazar-Limones F', 'Lagares-Tena L', 'El Mjiyad N', 'Caro-Maldonado A', 'Tirado OM', 'Munoz-Pinedo C']","[""Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), L'Hospitalet, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110912,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '9G2MP84A8W (Deoxyglucose)', 'PHA4727WTP (Mannose)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Deoxyglucose/*pharmacology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/physiology', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Glycolysis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Mannose/pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma, Alveolar/metabolism/*pathology', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma, Embryonal/metabolism/pathology']",,2011/09/14 06:00,2012/01/10 06:00,['2011/09/14 06:00'],"['2011/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-11-0759 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-0759 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2011 Nov 1;71(21):6796-806. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-0759.

However, unless CML patients receive life-long TKI treatment, leukemia will eventually recur; this is attributed to the failure of TKI treatment to eradicate leukemia-initiating cells (LICs). Recent work demonstrated that FoxO factors are critical for maintenance of CML-initiating cells; however, the mechanism of FoxO-dependent leukemia initiation remained elusive. Here, we identified the BCL6 protooncogene as a critical effector downstream of FoxO in self-renewal signaling of CML-initiating cells. BCL6 represses Arf and p53 in CML cells and is required for colony formation and initiation of leukemia. Importantly, peptide inhibition of BCL6 in human CML cells compromises colony formation and leukemia initiation in transplant recipients and selectively eradicates CD34(+) CD38(-) LICs in patient-derived CML samples. These findings suggest that pharmacological inhibition of BCL6 may represent a novel strategy to eradicate LICs in CML. Clinical validation of this concept could limit the duration of TKI treatment in CML patients, which is currently life-long, and substantially decrease the risk of blast crisis transformation.","['Hurtz, Christian', 'Hatzi, Katerina', 'Cerchietti, Leandro', 'Braig, Melanie', 'Park, Eugene', 'Kim, Yong-mi', 'Herzog, Sebastian', 'Ramezani-Rad, Parham', 'Jumaa, Hassan', 'Muller, Martin C', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Ye, B Hilda', 'Agarwal, Anupriya', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Shah, Neil P', 'Melnick, Ari M', 'Muschen, Markus']","['Hurtz C', 'Hatzi K', 'Cerchietti L', 'Braig M', 'Park E', 'Kim YM', 'Herzog S', 'Ramezani-Rad P', 'Jumaa H', 'Muller MC', 'Hofmann WK', 'Hochhaus A', 'Ye BH', 'Agarwal A', 'Druker BJ', 'Shah NP', 'Melnick AM', 'Muschen M']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California-San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110912,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (BCL6 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl6 protein, mouse)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Benzamides', '*Cell Survival', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*pathology/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3201200,2011/09/14 06:00,2012/01/04 06:00,['2011/09/14 06:00'],"['2011/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [medline]']","['jem.20110304 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20110304 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2011 Oct 24;208(11):2163-74. doi: 10.1084/jem.20110304.

Hematopoietic differentiation is regulated by RARalpha, and several types of leukemia show aberrant RARalpha activity. Through microarray expression analysis, we identified transcripts differentially expressed between F9 wild-type (Wt) and RARalpha knockout cells cultured in the absence or presence of the RAR-specific ligand all trans retinoic acid (RA). We validated the decreased Mest, Tex13, Gab1, Bcl11a, Tcfap2a and HMGcs1 transcript levels, and increased Slc38a4, Stmn2, RpL39l, Ref2L, Mobp and Rlf1 transcript levels in the RARa knockout cells. The decreased Mest and Tex13 transcript levels were associated with increased promoter CpG-island methylation and increased repressive histone modifications (H3K9me3) in RARalpha knockout cells. Increased Slc38a4 and Stmn2 transcript levels were associated with decreased promoter CpG-island methylation and increased permissive histone modifications (H3K9/K14ac, H3K4me3) in RARalpha knockout cells.

We performed this study to determine the effect of primary cultured leukemic BMSCs on the cell cycle distribution of Jurkat cells. Normal and leukemic BMSCs were isolated for culture to create a hematopoietic microenvironment simulating bone marrow in vitro. The normal and leukemic BMSCs induced cell cycle arrest of Jurkat cells in the G0/G1 phase. Suppression subtractive hybridization revealed differential gene expression after the co-culture of cells with normal and leukemic BMSCs. Jurkat cells showed upregulated expression of genes involved in cell cycle control CR6 interacting factor 1 (CRIF1).

However, a causal relationship between CSF3R mutations and leukemic transformation has not been established. Herein, we show that truncated G-CSFR cooperates with the PML-RARalpha oncogene to induce AML in mice. Expression of truncated G-CSFR significantly shortens the latency of AML in a G-CSF-dependent fashion and it is associated with a distinct AML presentation characterized by higher blast counts and more severe myelosuppression. Basal and G-CSF-induced signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 5, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation were highly variable but similar in leukemic blasts expressing wild-type and truncated G-CSFR.

Inhibiting CD45 function by blocking antibodies or a CD45 inhibitor impaired the motility of both normal and leukemic human cells. Blocking CD45 inhibited homing and repopulation by immature human CD34(+) cells as well as homing of primary patient leukemic cells. In addition, CD45 inhibition negatively affected development of hematopoietic progenitors in vitro and their recovery in transplanted recipients in vivo, revealing the central role of CD45 in the regulation of hematopoiesis. Moreover, CD45 blockage induced a hyperadhesive phenotype in immature human progenitor cells as well as in murine leukocytes, leading to their defective adhesion interactions with endothelial cells. This phenotype was further manifested by the ability of CD45 blockage to prevent breakdown of adhesion interactions in the BM, which inhibited murine progenitor mobilization. The substantial effects of a direct CD45 inhibition point at its essential roles in cell trafficking, including murine progenitor cell mobilization and both normal immature and leukemic human hematopoietic cells as well as regulation of hematopoiesis and engraftment potential.","['Shivtiel, Shoham', 'Lapid, Kfir', 'Kalchenko, Vyacheslav', 'Avigdor, Abraham', 'Goichberg, Polina', 'Kalinkovich, Alexander', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Kollet, Orit', 'Lapidot, Tsvee']","['Shivtiel S', 'Lapid K', 'Kalchenko V', 'Avigdor A', 'Goichberg P', 'Kalinkovich A', 'Nagler A', 'Kollet O', 'Lapidot T']","['Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110910,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptprc protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/*physiology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Graft Survival', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/transplantation']",,2011/09/14 06:00,2012/01/06 06:00,['2011/09/14 06:00'],"['2011/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/08/21 00:00 [revised]', '2011/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(11)00445-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2011.08.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2011 Dec;39(12):1161-1170.e1. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2011.08.012.

Here we present for the first time a GMP-compliant 3-day protocol for generation of monocyte-derived DCs using different synthetic Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists in intensively pretreated patients with AML. METHODS: Four different maturation cocktails were compared for their impact on cell recovery, phenotype, cytokine secretion, migration, and lymphocyte activation in 20 AML patients and 25 healthy controls. RESULTS: Maturation cocktails containing the TLR7/8 agonists R848 or CL075, with and without the addition of the TLR3 agonist poly(I:C), induced DCs that had a positive costimulatory profile, secreted high levels of IL-12(p70), showed chemotaxis to CCR7 ligands, had the ability to activate NK cells, and efficiently stimulated antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that this approach translates into biologically improved DCs, not only in healthy controls but also in AML patients. This data supports the clinical application of TLR-matured DCs in patients with AML for activation of innate and adaptive immune responses.","['Beck, Barbara', 'Dorfel, Daniela', 'Lichtenegger, Felix S', 'Geiger, Christiane', 'Lindner, Lysann', 'Merk, Martina', 'Schendel, Dolores J', 'Subklewe, Marion']","['Beck B', 'Dorfel D', 'Lichtenegger FS', 'Geiger C', 'Lindner L', 'Merk M', 'Schendel DJ', 'Subklewe M']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Munich, Campus Grosshadern, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20110913,England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Chemokine CCL19)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)', '0 (cytomegalovirus matrix protein 65kDa)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CCL19/pharmacology', 'Chemotaxis/drug effects', 'Dendritic Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/metabolism', 'Interleukin-12/metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphoproteins/immunology', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors', 'Toll-Like Receptors/*agonists/immunology', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/immunology', 'Young Adult']",PMC3182913,2011/09/14 06:00,2012/01/18 06:00,['2011/09/14 06:00'],"['2011/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1479-5876-9-151 [pii]', '10.1186/1479-5876-9-151 [doi]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2011 Sep 13;9:151. doi: 10.1186/1479-5876-9-151.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cutaneous reactions are the most common nonhematologic side effect of these drugs, and their management is challenging especially in the absence of alternative anticancer agents. The present review focuses on the clinical characteristics and the hypothesized molecular pathogenesis of these first- and second-generation TKIs' cutaneous side effects, and approaches to their treatment.

METHODS: K562/A02 cells were divided into six groups. An equal volume of calf serum, rabbit serum, high, middle, and low dose Jiedu Huayu Recipe containing serum, and interferon was respectively added. K562 sensitive cell strain was set up as the control. The expressions of survivin in K562/A02 cells after treated with Jiedu Huayu Recipe containing serum were detected using semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction method. The expressions of NF-kappaB/P65, NF-kappaB/P50, and IKBa were detected using Westem blot method. RESULTS: The survivin resistant gene was highly expressed in K562/A02 cells. After treated by Jiedu Huayu Recipe containing serum, the expressions of survivin could be obviously lowered in the high and middle dose Jiedu Huayu Recipe containing serum groups as well as the interferon control group. NF-kappaB was also highly expressed in K562/A02 resistant cells. After treated by Jiedu Huayu Recipe containing serum, the expressions of P65, P50, and IkappaBalpha decreased to some degrees. The decrement was the most obvious in the middle and high dose Jiedu Huayu Recipe containing serum groups. The decreased expressions of P65 and P50 in the high dose Jiedu Huayu Recipe containing serum group were higher than that in the interferon control group (P<0.05). The decrement of IkappaBalpha was equivalent to that of the interferon control group (P>0.05).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received age-adjusted IT topotecan (0.4 mg/dose for patients >3 years of age) administered twice weekly (every 3-4 days) for 6 weeks during induction, weekly for 4 weeks during consolidation, and twice monthly for 4 months and then monthly thereafter during maintenance. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients enrolled in the study, of whom 20 were eligible and assessable for toxicity and 16 were assessable for response. Of 16 patients, 6 (38%) had a complete response, 8 (50%) had stable disease, and 2 (13%) had progressive disease. The median event-free survival time (95% CI) was 3.1 (1.6-10.3) months and the median overall survival time (95% CI) was 18.0 (7.3-38.3) months. Eight patients (40%) experienced grade 3 or 4 adverse events. There were no grade 4 neurological events (Table III). Four patients experienced a total of 6 grade 3 neurological events including an olfactory seizure, a headache, transient grade 3 speech impairment, muscle weakness, motor neuropathy, and ataxia. Headache was the most common grade </=2 neurologic event and two patients developed grade </=2 arachnoiditis. CONCLUSION: IT administration of topotecan was tolerable on this dose and schedule. The majority of adverse events were mild to moderate, reversible side effects. Complete central nervous system remissions were achieved in a subset of children with recurrent or refractory central nervous system leukemia.","['Potter, Samara L Poplack', 'Berg, Stacey', 'Ingle, Ashish Mark', 'Krailo, Mark', 'Adamson, Peter C', 'Blaney, Susan M']","['Potter SL', 'Berg S', 'Ingle AM', 'Krailo M', 'Adamson PC', 'Blaney SM']","['Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20110909,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/drug therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Topoisomerase I Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Topotecan/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Young Adult']",PMC3242923,2011/09/13 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/09/13 06:00'],"['2010/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.23317 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Mar;58(3):362-5. doi: 10.1002/pbc.23317.

Septins have been associated with leukemia and solid tumor malignancies, including breast, ovarian, and prostate. We previously reported that high SEPT9_i1 expression in human mammary epithelial cell lines (HMECs) led to malignant cellular phenotypes such as increased cell proliferation, invasiveness, motility, and genomic instability. Our goal here was to better understand how SEPT9_i1 expression might contribute to genomic instability and malignant progression. First, we confirmed that even transient expression of SEPT9_i1 was sufficient to increase aneuploidy in HMECs. We then analyzed SEPT9_i1 by immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies and found that SEPT9_i1 interacts with both alpha and gamma tubulin. SEPT9_i1 expressing cells demonstrated dramatic chromosome segregation defects, centrosome amplification and cytokinesis defects, suggesting two possible molecular mechanisms contributing to the development of genomic instability. This suggests that SEPT9_i1 may promote genomic instability through both cytokinesis and mitotic spindle defects which lead to chromosome missegregation.","['Peterson, Esther A', 'Stanbery, Laura', 'Li, Christina', 'Kocak, Hande', 'Makarova, Olga', 'Petty, Elizabeth M']","['Peterson EA', 'Stanbery L', 'Li C', 'Kocak H', 'Makarova O', 'Petty EM']","['Department of Human Genetics, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20110824,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Tubulin)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (SEPTIN9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Septins)']",IM,"['Aneuploidy', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cytokinesis/genetics', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism', '*Genomic Instability', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mitosis', 'Septins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Spindle Apparatus/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tubulin/metabolism']",PMC3172617,2011/09/13 06:00,2012/03/16 06:00,['2011/09/13 06:00'],"['2011/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/09/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.20916 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2011 Nov;50(11):940-9. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20916.
