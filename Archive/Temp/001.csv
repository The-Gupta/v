We assessed axicabtagene ciloleucel autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy in relapsed or refractory indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma. METHODS: ZUMA-5 is a single-arm, multicentre, phase 2 trial being conducted at 15 medical cancer centres in the USA and two medical cancer centres in France. Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, with histologically confirmed indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (follicular lymphoma or marginal zone lymphoma), had relapsed or refractory disease, previously had two or more lines of therapy (including an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody with an alkylating agent), and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 0 or 1. Patients underwent leukapheresis and received conditioning chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide at 500 mg/m(2) per day and fludarabine at 30 mg/m(2) per day on days -5, -4, and -3) followed by a single infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel (2 x 10(6) CAR T cells per kg) on day 0. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (complete response and partial response) assessed by an independent review committee per Lugano classification. The primary activity analysis was done after at least 80 treated patients with follicular lymphoma had been followed up for at least 12 months after the first response assessment at week 4 after infusion. The primary analyses were done in the per-protocol population (ie, eligible patients with follicular lymphoma who had 12 months of follow-up after the first response assessment and eligible patients with marginal zone lymphoma who had at least 4 weeks of follow-up after infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel). Safety analyses were done in patients who received an infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03105336, and is closed to accrual. FINDINGS: Between June 20, 2017, and July 16, 2020, 153 patients were enrolled and underwent leukapheresis, and axicabtagene ciloleucel was successfully manufactured for all enrolled patients. As of data cutoff (Sept 14, 2020), 148 patients had received an infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel (124 [84%] who had follicular lymphoma and 24 [16%] who had marginal zone lymphoma). The median follow-up for the primary analysis was 17.5 months (IQR 14.1-22.6). Among patients who were eligible for the primary analysis (n=104, of whom 84 had follicular lymphoma and 20 had marginal zone lymphoma), 96 (92%; 95% CI 85-97) had an overall response and 77 (74%) had a complete response. The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were cytopenias (104 [70%] of 148 patients) and infections (26 [18%]). Grade 3 or worse cytokine release syndrome occurred in ten (7%) patients and grade 3 or 4 neurological events occurred in 28 (19%) patients. Serious adverse events (any grade) occurred in 74 (50%) patients. Deaths due to adverse events occurred in four (3%) patients, one of which was deemed to be treatment-related (multisystem organ failure). INTERPRETATION: Axicabtagene ciloleucel showed high rates of durable responses and had a manageable safety profile in patients with relapsed or refractory indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

However, non-canonical regulatory roles of HKs are still incompletely understood. Here, we hypothesized that HKs comprise one of the missing links between high-dose metformin and the inhibition of the respiratory chain in cancer. METHODS: We tested the isoenzyme-specific regulatory roles of HKs in ovarian cancer cells by examining the effects of the deletions of HK1 and HK2 in TOV-112D ovarian adenocarcinoma cells. We reverted these effects by re-introducing wild-type HK1 and HK2, and we compared the HK1 revertant with the knock-in of catalytically dead HK1 p.D656A. We subjected these cells to a battery of metabolic and proliferation assays and targeted GCxGC-MS metabolomics. RESULTS: We found that the HK1 depletion (but not the HK2 depletion) sensitized ovarian cancer cells to high-dose metformin during glucose starvation. We confirmed that this newly uncovered role of HK1 is glycolysis-independent by the introduction of the catalytically dead HK1. The expression of catalytically dead HK1 stimulated similar changes in levels of TCA intermediates, aspartate and cysteine, and in glutamate as were induced by the HK2 deletion. In contrast, HK1 deletion increased the levels of branched amino acids; this effect was completely eliminated by the expression of catalytically dead HK1. Furthermore, HK1 revertants but not HK2 revertants caused a strong increase of NADPH/NADP ratios independently on the presence of glucose or metformin. The HK1 deletion (but not HK2 deletion) suppressed the growth of xenotransplanted ovarian cancer cells and nearly abolished the tumor growth when the mice were fed the glucose-free diet. CONCLUSIONS: We provided the evidence that HK1 is involved in the so far unknown glycolysis-independent HK1-metformin axis and influences metabolism even in glucose-free conditions.",['(c) 2021.

The research for the impact of gene polymorphism on HDMTX induced toxicities and delayed elimination is an important ongoing objective in many studies, variable and conflicting results produced in the past years to clarify that impact. This study aimed to investigate the role of ABCB1 3435 C > T rs1045642 and MTHFR 677 C > T rs1801133 polymorphisms on HDMTX induced toxicity outcomes and delayed elimination in Egyptian adult patients with hematological malignancies. A prospective, observational cohort study was conducted on a total of 62 Egyptian adult patients with hematological malignancies age >/= 18-years-old. All demographic, medical, and laboratory data were continuously collected from the patients' medical files in an up-to-date follow-up in selected clinics during the period from April 2018 to March 2020. Venous blood samples were collected for the purpose of genotyping, DNA extraction, and measurement of MTX levels. All the relevant data were statistically analyzed. The studied patients' median age was 25 years old with a range of (18-62) years. Forty-six patients were males with about 74%, and 16 were females with about 26%. Eighty-nine percent of the patients diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia 'ALL', 5% of the patients had B cell non-hodgkin lymphoma 'B-NHL' and 3% diagnosed with primary central nervous system lymphoma 'PCNSL' and Burkitt's lymphoma 'BL' Hematological, hepatic, renal and gastrointestinal toxicities observed post-HDMTX were recorded with the hematological toxicities toping on all the others, also patients with delayed elimination at 72 hours post the HDMTX dose were determined. Statistical analysis revealed a significant association between ABCB1 3435 C > T rs1045642 and HDMTX delayed elimination with about 10 times higher risk among the minor allele 'T' carriers (p-value = 0.006) (odds ratio [OR]: 10.470; 95% CI: 1.961-55.904). No significant association observed between the studied gene polymorphisms: MTHFR 677 C > T rs1801133, ABCB1 3435 C > T rs1045642, and different toxicity outcomes. According to our best knowledge, this study is the first to conclude a significant association between ABCB1 3435 C > T rs1045642 gene polymorphism and HDMTX delayed elimination at 72 hours post HDMTX infusion; also, it is the first study to analyze the association between ABCB1 3435 C > T rs1045642 polymorphism with HDMTX toxicity and delayed elimination in adult Egyptian patients with hematological malignancies.",,"['Ebid, Abdel-Hameed I M', 'Hossam, Ahmed', 'El Gammal, Mosaad M', 'Soror, Sameh', 'Mangoud, Nadia O M', 'Mahmoud, Mohamed Adel']","['Ebid AIM', 'Hossam A', 'El Gammal MM', 'Soror S', 'Mangoud NOM', 'Mahmoud MA']","['Department of Pharmacy Practice, Faculty of Pharmacy, Helwan University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Pharmacy Practice, Faculty of Pharmacy, Helwan University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Medical Oncology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Helwan University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Helwan University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Pharmacy Practice, Faculty of Pharmacy, Helwan University, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211213,England,J Chemother,"Journal of chemotherapy (Florence, Italy)",8907348,IM,,2021/12/14 06:00,2021/12/14 06:00,['2021/12/13 11:35'],"['2021/12/13 11:35 [entrez]', '2021/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/1120009X.2021.2009723 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Chemother. 2021 Dec 13:1-10. doi: 10.1080/1120009X.2021.2009723.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-3456-9695'],,,['NOTNLM'],"['High dose methotrexate', 'gene polymorphism', 'hematological malignancies']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, the anti-leukemia effect of statins has been reported, but the mechanism remains unclear.This study aimed to explore the bioregulation of simvastatin and its mechanism in acute leukemia cell lines. Cell viability was detected by CCK-8 analysis. Apoptosis was detected through flow cytometry. Cell invasion and migration both were observed by transwell and wound healing separately. RT-qPCR and Western blot were used for determination of genes and proteins. We found that that simvastatin could regulate the biological functions of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, including its proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis, which may be carried out by down-regulating miR-19a-3p. Overexpression of miR-19a-3p had the opposite effect in AML cells, suggesting simvastatin-inhibited AML by reducing miR-19a-3p expression. Following researches showed that HIF-1alpha was directly regulated by the target of miR-19a-3p. Simvastatin could reverse the adverse effects caused by miR-19a-3p mimics. Conversely, the increased expression of Mcl-1, the inhibition of caspase-3 could promote the growth of AML cells.

The 'treatment-free remission' (TFR) has become a real long-term endpoint for 30-40% of chronic phase patients. AREAS COVERED: In this review, we focus our attention on possible prognostic features who can predict the success of tyrosine kinase inhibitors discontinuation and how we can assess the minimal residual disease (MRD) during the TFR phase. Broad research was made on Medline, Embase and archives from EHA and ASH congresses. EXPERT OPINION: Median duration of TKI therapy and of deep molecular response are the main prognostic factors identified in most trials and real-life experiences on discontinuation. Immunological pathways have been proposed as possible control on successful TFR as also early molecular response dynamics. Appropriate molecular monitoring by RQ-PCR in the TFR phase has been proposed by several international recommendations and digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) seems to have a possible role in the future for a better identification of candidate to this possible therapeutic strategy.",,"['Breccia, Massimo', 'Scalzulli, Emilia', 'Pepe, Sara', 'Colafigli, Gioia', 'Bisegna, Maria Laura', 'Capriata, Marcello', 'Martelli, Maurizio']","['Breccia M', 'Scalzulli E', 'Pepe S', 'Colafigli G', 'Bisegna ML', 'Capriata M', 'Martelli M']","['Department of Translational and precision medicine-Az., Policlinico Umberto I-Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Translational and precision medicine-Az., Policlinico Umberto I-Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Translational and precision medicine-Az., Policlinico Umberto I-Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Translational and precision medicine-Az., Policlinico Umberto I-Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Translational and precision medicine-Az., Policlinico Umberto I-Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Translational and precision medicine-Az., Policlinico Umberto I-Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Translational and precision medicine-Az., Policlinico Umberto I-Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211227,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,IM,,2021/12/14 06:00,2021/12/14 06:00,['2021/12/13 11:27'],"['2021/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/14 06:00 [medline]', '2021/12/13 11:27 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2022.2018296 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Expert Rev Hematol. 2021 Dec 27:1-8. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2022.2018296.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-1163-6162'],,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'monitoring', 'prognostic factors', 'treatment-free remission']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the prognostic value of VAV expression in AML was evaluated by a single-center study in combination with bioinformatics analyses. Methods: The expression and prognostic value of VAVs in patients with AML were investigated using various databases, including GEPIA, CCLE, EMBL-EBI, UALCAN, cBioPortal, STRING, and DAVID. Blood samples from 35 patients with AML (non-M3 subtype) and 13 benigh individuals were collected at our center. VAV expression levels were detected by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blotting. Clinical data were derived from medical records. Results: Based on data from multiple databases, the expression levels of VAV1, VAV2, and VAV3 were significantly higher in AML than in control tissues (P < 0.05). RT-qPCR and western blotting results showed that VAV expression in mRNA and protein levels were higher in patients with AML that in the control group (P < 0.05). Complete remission rates were lower and risks were higher in patients with AML with high VAV1 expression than with low VAV1 expression (P < 0.05). High levels of VAV2, VAV3, and VAV1 were related to a poor overall survival, and this relationship was significant for VAV1 (P < 0.05). High expression levels of genes correlated with VAV1, such as SIPA1, SH2D3C, and HMHA1 were also related to a poor prognosis in AML. Functional and pathways enrichment analyses indicated that the contribution of the VAV family to AML may be mediated by the NF-kappaB, cAMP, and other pathways. Conclusion: VAVs were highly expressed in AML. In particular, VAV1 has prognostic value and is a promising therapeutic target for AML.",,"['Mu, Dan', 'Long, Sili', 'Guo, Ling', 'Liu, Wenjun']","['Mu D', 'Long S', 'Guo L', 'Liu W']","['556508Department of Pediatrics Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, Sichuan, 646000, China.', '556508Children Hematological Oncology and Birth Defects Laboratory, The Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, Sichuan, 646000, China.', '556508Department of Pediatrics Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, Sichuan, 646000, China.', '556508Children Hematological Oncology and Birth Defects Laboratory, The Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, Sichuan, 646000, China.', 'Sichuan Clinical Research Center for Birth Defects, Luzhou, Sichuan, 646000, China.', '556508Department of Pediatrics Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, Sichuan, 646000, China.', '556508Children Hematological Oncology and Birth Defects Laboratory, The Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, Sichuan, 646000, China.', 'Sichuan Clinical Research Center for Birth Defects, Luzhou, Sichuan, 646000, China.', '556508Department of Pediatrics Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, Sichuan, 646000, China.', '556508Children Hematological Oncology and Birth Defects Laboratory, The Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, Sichuan, 646000, China.', 'Sichuan Clinical Research Center for Birth Defects, Luzhou, Sichuan, 646000, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Technol Cancer Res Treat,Technology in cancer research & treatment,101140941,IM,,2021/12/14 06:00,2021/12/14 06:00,['2021/12/13 11:21'],"['2021/12/13 11:21 [entrez]', '2021/12/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/15330338211065877 [doi]'],ppublish,Technol Cancer Res Treat. 2021 Jan-Dec;20:15330338211065877. doi: 10.1177/15330338211065877.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-0954-2995'],,PMC8679409,['NOTNLM'],"['*VAV family', '*VAV1', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*complete remission', '*prognostic marker']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It usually affects the ageing population and those suffering from end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, and heart failure. Its incidence varies from 4.5 to 44 cases per 100,000 annually. CASE PRESENTATION: We have reported a case of gangrenous colitis in a 62-year-old man suffering from acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) and myelofibrosis. He had hypertension and ESRD due to obstructive uropathy from seven years ago in his past medical history. His recurrent constitutional symptoms and persistent leukocytosis of more than 20,000 in muL was always treated as catheter-related infection or sepsis until acute abdomen emerged. The surgical team encountered a vast gangrenous right hemicolon. The leukocytosis did not resolve. Thus, the haematological investigations proved APL with myelofibrosis. The affected colon was free of leukemic infiltration. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Hypoperfusion due to ESRD and hemodialysis accompanied with malignancy induced hypercoagulative state provided a context in which small vessels of the bowel were obstructed. CONCLUSION: Malignancies are associated with thrombophilia, and colonic involvement is not always related to lymphatic infiltration in leukaemia patients.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors.

Traditional cancer treatments, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery, have a poor therapeutic effect, emphasizing the significance of employing innovative treatments like activated cell therapy. Chimeric antigen receptor T cell is one of the most prevalent types of activated cell therapy have been developed to direct T lymphocytes toward cancers (CAR-T cells). CAR-T cells therapy has illustrated poor impact versus solid tumors despite the remarkable success in patients suffering from hematological malignancies. CAR-T cells must overcome various hurdles to obtain full responses to solid tumors, including growth, stability, trafficking, and destiny inside tumors. As a result, novel treatment methods will entail overcoming the challenges that CAR-T cells face in solid tumors. The use of CAR-T cells in combination with other therapeutic approaches such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immuno-checkpoint inhibitors, and oncolytic viruses can promote the effectiveness of CAR-T cell therapy for the treatment of solid tumors. However, more research is needed to determine the safety and effectiveness of these therapies. CAR-T cell treatment success rates vary by type of disease, but are predicted to reach up to 90% in patients with leukemia. However, since this kind of immunotherapy is still in its infancy, there is much to learn about its efficacy. This review provided an in-depth examination of CAR-T cell therapy and its success and failure as a cancer treatment approach. We also discuss combination therapies with CAR-T Cell.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..

This meta-analysis aimed to summarize the impact of imatinib use on renal function in CML patients. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted on MEDLINE and Embase to identify articles assessing the impact of imatinib exposure on renal function in CML patients. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS). Two authors independently performed literature-screening, risk of bias and data extraction. The risk of renal dysfunction (chronic kidney disease or acute kidney injury) among imatinib users was computed as the primary outcome of interest. The certainty of findings was assessed using the grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) criteria. RESULTS: A total of nine articles qualified for inclusion in the systematic review, of which four articles were eligible for meta-analysis. Based on the scoring on NOS, majority of the included studies were found to be of moderate risk of bias. Majority of the studies (n = 6) reported significantly (p < .05) decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) after imatinib treatment. The risk of developing renal dysfunction (chronic kidney disease or acute kidney injury) was found to be significantly higher in imatinib users as compared to other tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) users with a pooled relative risk of 2.70 (95% CI: 1.49-4.91). Sensitivity analysis also revealed a consistently high risk of renal dysfunction with imatinib use. GRADE criteria revealed low certainty of evidence. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis found an increased risk of renal dysfunction in imatinib users compared to other TKI users.",['(c) 2021 Asian Pacific Society of Nephrology.'],"['Singh, Avinash Kumar', 'Hussain, Salman', 'Ahmed, Rayaz', 'Agrawal, Narendra', 'Bhurani, Dinesh', 'Klugar, Miloslav', 'Sharma, Manju']","['Singh AK', 'Hussain S', 'Ahmed R', 'Agrawal N', 'Bhurani D', 'Klugar M', 'Sharma M']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Medicine (Division of Pharmacology), School of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology and BMT Unit, Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre, New Delhi, India.', 'Czech National Centre for Evidence-Based Healthcare and Knowledge Translation (Cochrane Czech Republic, Czech EBHC: JBI Centre of Excellence, Masaryk University GRADE Centre), Institute of Biostatistics and Analyses, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology and BMT Unit, Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology and BMT Unit, Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology and BMT Unit, Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre, New Delhi, India.', 'Czech National Centre for Evidence-Based Healthcare and Knowledge Translation (Cochrane Czech Republic, Czech EBHC: JBI Centre of Excellence, Masaryk University GRADE Centre), Institute of Biostatistics and Analyses, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Medicine (Division of Pharmacology), School of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211211,Australia,Nephrology (Carlton),"Nephrology (Carlton, Vic.)",9615568,IM,,2021/12/12 06:00,2021/12/12 06:00,['2021/12/11 12:14'],"['2021/11/12 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/22 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2021/12/11 12:14 [entrez]']",['10.1111/nep.14014 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Nephrology (Carlton). 2021 Dec 11. doi: 10.1111/nep.14014.,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1010-6496', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1691-8428']","['LTC20031/INTER-EXCELLENCE Grant', 'CZ.02.2.69/0.0/0.0/18_053/0016952/Masarykova Univerzita', 'JH/RO/OO/2020/12/Sun Pharma']",,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'chronic kidney disease', 'chronic myeloid leukaemia', 'imatinib', 'meta-analysis', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we report a case of a 7 year old boy with newly diagnosed AML and a cryptic KMT2A/AFDN gene fusion resulting from a 5'KMT2A insertional event. The results of conventional chromosome studies revealed trisomy 8 in all 20 metaphases, with normal-appearing chromosomes 6 and 11. A KMT2A break-apart FISH probe identified 2 intact copies of the KMT2A gene region and an extra 5'KMT2A signal in 85% of interphase nuclei. Subsequent FISH studies using a KMT2A/AFDN dual-color dual-fusion FISH probe revealed positive results for a single fusion in 82% of interphase nuclei, indicating a KMT2A/AFDN gene fusion. Subsequently, metaphase FISH confirmed the location of the KMT2A/AFDN fusion at 6q27.

Several proteasome inhibitors, such as bortezomib, are currently used in cancer treatment, but associated toxicity limits their widespread application. Recently metal complex-based drugs have attracted great attention in tumor therapy; however, their application is hindered by low water-solubility and poor absorbency. Herein, we synthesized a new type of gold (I) complex named Na-AuPT, and further characterized its anticancer activity. Na-AuPT is highly water-soluble (6 mg/mL), and it was able to potently inhibit growth of a panel of 11 cancer cell lines (A549, SMMC7721, H460, HepG2, BEL7402, LNCap, PC3, MGC-803, SGC-7901, U266, and K562). In A549 and SMMC7721 cells, Na-AuPT (in a range of 2.5-20 muM) inhibited the UPS function in a dose-dependent fashion by targeting and inhibiting both 20 S proteasomal proteolytic peptidases and 19 S proteasomal deubiquitinases. Furthermore, Na-AuPT induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in A549 and SMMC7721 cells, which was prevented by the metal chelator EDTA. Administration of Na-AuPT (40 mg . kg(-1) . d(-)(1), ip) in nude mice bearing A549 or SMMC7721 xenografts significantly inhibited the tumor growth in vivo, accompanied by increased levels of total ubiquitinated proteins, cleaved caspase 3 and Bax protein in tumor tissue. Moreover, Na-AuPT induced cell death of primary mononuclear cells from 5 patients with acute myeloid leukemia ex vivo with an average IC50 value of 2.46 muM. We conclude that Na-AuPT is a novel metal-based proteasome inhibitor that may hold great potential for cancer therapy.","['(c) 2021.

Weeks after an often mild or asymptomatic initial infection with SARS-CoV-2 children may present with a severe shock-like picture and marked inflammation. Children with MIS-C present with varying degrees of cardiovascular and hyperinflammatory symptoms. Here we perform a comprehensive analysis of the plasma proteome of more than 1400 proteins in children with SARS-CoV-2. We hypothesize that the proteome would reflect heterogeneity in hyperinflammation and vascular injury, and further identify pathogenic mediators of disease. We show that protein signatures demonstrate overlap between MIS-C, and the inflammatory syndromes macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). We demonstrate that PLA2G2A is an important marker of MIS-C that associates with TMA.

Place-of-care manufacturing may improve performance and accessibility by obviating the need to cryopreserve and transport cells to centralized facilities. Here we develop an anti-CD19 CAR (CAR19) comprised of the 4-1BB co-stimulatory and TNFRSF19 transmembrane domains, showing anti-tumor efficacy in an in vivo xenograft lymphoma model. CAR19 T cells are manufactured under current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) at two disparate clinical sites, Moscow (Russia) and Cleveland (USA). The CAR19 T-cells is used to treat patients with relapsed/refractory pediatric B-cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL; n = 31) or adult B-cell Lymphoma (NHL; n = 23) in two independently conducted phase I clinical trials with safety as the primary outcome (NCT03467256 and NCT03434769, respectively). Probability of measurable residual disease-negative remission was also a primary outcome in the ALL study. Secondary outcomes include complete remission (CR) rates, overall survival and median duration of response. CR rates are 89% (ALL) and 73% (NHL). After a median follow-up of 17 months, one-year survival rate of ALL complete responders is 79.2% (95%CI 64.597.2%) and median duration of response is 10.2 months. For NHL complete responders one-year survival is 92.9%, and median duration of response has not been reached.

METHODS: The clinical data of platelet antibody positive patients tested by Capture-P in the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from July 1, 2014 to July 1, 2019 were retrospectively analyzed, including sex, age, disease, platelet transfusion assessments, CD34(+) cells, transplant prognosis, and so on. RESULTS: In 5 years, 913 (7.28%) hematologic patients with platelet antibody positive were identified, the detection rate of females (513 cases) were higher than males (400 cases). Among the 913 patients, the antibody positive rates of 520 patients with malignant hematological diseases (acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome) showed significantly statistical different (10.27%, 8.01%, and 7.20%) (P<0.01), and the positive rate of the acute myeloid leukemia of those patients was higher than myelodysplastic syndrome patients(alpha<0.0125). There were 35 cases diagnosed as immunized PTR before allo-HSCT, the platelet increments, 14 h correct count increment, progression-free survival rate and overall survival rate of those patients were significantly lower than those in negative transfusion effective patients (P<0.01), while the percentage of ABO matching was significantly higher (alpha<0.0125). CONCLUSION: The positive rate of platelet antibody identification is high in females and acute myeloid leukemia patients, and immunized PTR caused by antibody is a risk factor for poor prognosis of allo-HSCT in malignant hematological disease patients.",,"['Zuo, Yuan-Ling', 'Zhai, Ju-Ping', 'Li, Yong', 'Jiang, Min', 'Cui, Qing-Ya', 'Tang, Xiao-Wen', 'Zhao, Yi-Ming', 'Zhang, Jian-Ming']","['Zuo YL', 'Zhai JP', 'Li Y', 'Jiang M', 'Cui QY', 'Tang XW', 'Zhao YM', 'Zhang JM']","['Department of Blood Transfusion, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou 215000, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou 215000, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou 215000, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou 215000, Jiangsu Province, China,E-mail: jiangmin_111@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou 215000, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou 215000, Jiangsu Province, China,E-mail: xwtang1020@163.com.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou 215000, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Suzhou Municipal Hospital, Suzhou 215002, Jiangsu Province, China.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,IM,,2021/12/12 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/12/11 05:26'],"['2021/12/11 05:26 [entrez]', '2021/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2021)06-1923-06 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2021.06.040 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2021 Dec;29(6):1923-1928. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2021.06.040.,,,,,,20211214,,,"['Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Male', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: DNMT1 siRNAi plasmid was constructed and DNMT1 siRNAi was transfected into CML K562 cells. RT-PCR and Western blot were used to detect the expression of DNMT1 gene and related protein, and methylation PCR was used to detect WIF-1 gene promoter methylation level. The trypan blue exclusion and MTT assay were used to detect the cell proliferation, flow cytometry were used to detect the cell apoptosis rate, colony formation assay was used to detect cell colony formation ability. Expression of Wnt/beta- catenin and its downstream signaling pathway proteins were detected by Western blot after DNMT1 gene was silenced. RESULTS: The expression level of DNMT1 mRNA and its related protein in the experimental group were significantly lower than those in the control group and negative control group (P<0.05). After 72 hours of successful transfection, the WIF-1 gene in the control group and negative control group were completely methylated, while in the experimental group, the methylation level significantly decreased. The results of MSP showed that the PCR product amplified by the unmethylated WIF-1 primer in the experimental group increased significantly,while by the methylated WIF-1 primer decreased significantly. After 48 h of transfection, the OD value, viable cell number and colony formation of the cells in experimental group were significantly lower than those in the negative control group and the control group (P<0.05).

METHODS: From March 2018 to March 2019, 95 confirmed AML patients including 43 sepsis infected cases and 52 uninfected cases were selected for treatment in the Department of Oncology and Hematology, The First People's Hospital of Longquanyi District. Their peripheral blood samples were taken as study samples, and the blood samples from 50 healthy people were used as control. RT-qPCR was used to detect lncRNA-MALAT1 expression level in samples from healthy group, uninfected group, and sepsis group. The correlation between lncRNA-MALAT1 expression level and clinical characteristics and prognosis of AML patients with sepsis were analyzed. RESULTS: The expression level of lncRNA-MALAT1 in the sepsis group was significantly up-regulated compared with the healthy group and uninfected group (P<0.05), while there was no significant difference between the healthy group and uninfected group (P>0.05).

METHODS: The clinical data of 229 newly diagnosed AML patients treated in our hospital from April 2016 to October 2019 were analyzed retrospectively. The next-generation sequencing technology was used to detect gene mutations in all the patients, the clinical characteristics of the patients with ASXL1 mutation were analyzed. RESULTS: ASXL1 gene mutation was detected out in 45 patients(19.6%). Among these patients, the frameshift mutation (n=22,48.9%) was most common, followed by missense mutation (n=15, 33.3%) and nonsense mutation (n=8,17.8%), respectively, all of them were located at exon 12. The median mutation rate was 32.47%(range, 2.74%-53.50%). The median age of the patients with ASXL1 mutation was 54(range, 14-74) years old, and most of the patients were male, and most of them with the history of MDS or MPN, and low white blood cell count at the initial diagnosed (P<0.05). Patients with ASXL1 mutation showed a lower CR rate than that of without ASXL1 mutation. Patients with or without ASXL1 mutation showed a statistically significant difference in survival at 20 months (P=0.042), while there was no significant difference between the patients in the two groups over 20 months (P=0.505). All the 6 patients with ASXL1 mutation in low-risk group were survived, while the median OS time was 16 months in the high-risk group(P=0.034). Multivariate analysis showed that the history of MDS or MPN and CR rate from induction therapy were the independent risk factors affecting survival of the patients. CONCLUSION: Frameshift mutation is commonly in AML patients with ASXL1 gene mutation, and ASXL1 mutation were more often in men, the history of MDS or MPN, and low white blood cell count. The CR rate of the patients with ASXL1 mutation was lower than that of the AML patients without ASXL1 mutations, AML patients with ASXL1 mutation showed poor short-term efficacy, but there was no significant difference between the two groups in long-term survival over 20 months.",,"['Zhou, Nai-Cen', 'Li, Guo-Hui', 'Qin, Wei-Wei', 'Wang, Wen-Qing', 'Guo, Huai-Peng', 'Liu, Cong', 'Liu, Li']","['Zhou NC', 'Li GH', 'Qin WW', 'Wang WQ', 'Guo HP', 'Liu C', 'Liu L']","[""Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital (Tangdu Hospital) of Air Force Medical University, Xi'an 710038, Shaanxi province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital (Tangdu Hospital) of Air Force Medical University, Xi'an 710038, Shaanxi province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital (Tangdu Hospital) of Air Force Medical University, Xi'an 710038, Shaanxi province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital (Tangdu Hospital) of Air Force Medical University, Xi'an 710038, Shaanxi province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital (Tangdu Hospital) of Air Force Medical University, Xi'an 710038, Shaanxi province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital (Tangdu Hospital) of Air Force Medical University, Xi'an 710038, Shaanxi province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital (Tangdu Hospital) of Air Force Medical University, Xi'an 710038, Shaanxi province, China,E-mail: liuli1@medmail.com.cn.""]",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,IM,,2021/12/12 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/12/11 05:26'],"['2021/12/11 05:26 [entrez]', '2021/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2021)06-1741-05 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2021.06.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2021 Dec;29(6):1741-1745. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2021.06.008.,,,,,,20211214,"['0 (ASXL1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', '*Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The NGS data based on 112 genes related to blood disease in 238 newly diagnosed patients with NPM1(mut) were collected. The chi2 test and non-parametric test were used to analyze the distribution correlation between the genes in the mutational spectrum. RESULTS: Among all the patients, at least one co-mutation was detected out. The median number per case of the mutated genes, including NPM1(mut) was 4.5 (range 214), among them, there were 5.0 (range 210) for NPM1(mut)/FLT3-ITD(+) and 4.0 (range 214) for NPM1(mut)/FLT3-ITD(-) cases, but it was no significant difference between the two groups (P=0.378). A total of 240 NPM1 mutational events were detected out in entire 238 NPM1(mut) patients, of which 10 (4.2%) were missense mutations, and were all found in NPM1(mut)/FLT3-ITD(-) patients. Most (9/10, 90%) of these NPM1 missense mutations were accompanied by AML subtype-defining cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities, of which 7 patients were in low risk or 2 in high risk. The most common NPM1(mut) coexisting mutations were DNMT3A (104, 43.7%), followed were FLT3-ITD (95, 39.9%) and FAT1 (57, 23.9%), FLT3-ITD and DNMT3A showed significant coexistence (P=0.005). FLT3-ITD showed significantly reciprocal exclusivity with FLT3-nonITD (P<0.001), NRAS (P<0.001), PTPN11 (P=0.017) and IDH1 (P=0.005), and showed an exclusivity inclination with KRAS (P=0.073). In addition, FLT3-nonITD along with KRAS (P=0.035), NRAS along with KRAS (P=0.008) and PTPN11 (P=0.039) coexisted significantly.

METHODS: CCK-8 method was used to detect the effect of RA on the sensitivity of K562 cells and K562/ADM cells to anti-tumor drug. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot were used to detect the expression level of mRNA and the protein in K562 and K562/ADM cells, and the effect of RA on the expression of MDR1 mRNA and P-gp in K562/ADM cells was also detected; Western blot was used to detect the expression of p-JNK, p-p38 and p-ERK1/2 in K562/ADM cells. RESULTS: RA could increased the sensitivity of K562/ADM cells to adriamycin(the reversal factor was 1.61 times), the difference showed statistically significantly (P<0.05); the resistance factor of K562/ADM to ADM was 41.76 times. The expression of MDR1 mRNA in K562 cells was extremely low, and the protein product P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was almost not expressed; MDR1 mRNA and P-gp in K562/ADM cells were highly expressed; RA could down-regulate the expression levels of MDR1 and P-gp in K562/ADM cells. In addition, RA could upregulate the phosphorylation levels of p38 and ERK1/2 in K562/ADM cells, but it has no effect on the expression of p-JNK. CONCLUSION: RA may participate in the regulation of MAPK signaling pathway by upregulating the expression levels of p-p38 and p-ERK1/2 in K562/ADM cells, and thus inhibit the transcription and translation levels of MDR1, and finally reverse the multidrug resistance of leukemia cells.",,"['Zhong, Si-Si', 'Yuan, Yong-Ping', 'Xin, Liu-Yan', 'Chen, Yi-Jian', 'Zhang, Li-Qun']","['Zhong SS', 'Yuan YP', 'Xin LY', 'Chen YJ', 'Zhang LQ']","['Department of Quality and Safety Management, The First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou 341000, Jiangxi Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou 341000, Jiangxi Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou 341000, Jiangxi Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou 341000, Jiangxi Province, China,E-mail: chenyj2005@163.com.', 'Department of Quality and Safety Management, The First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou 341000, Jiangxi Province, China,E-mail: 176784620@qq.com.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,IM,,2021/12/12 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/12/11 05:26'],"['2021/12/11 05:26 [entrez]', '2021/12/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2021)06-1704-06 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2021.06.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2021 Dec;29(6):1704-1709. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2021.06.002.,,,,,,20211214,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)']",,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', '*ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells']",,,,,,,,,,

And to verify the targeting relationship between miR-143 and long non-coding RNA MALAT-1. So as to explore the possible regulatory mechanism of miR-143 in the pathogenesis of AML. METHODS: The expression of miR-143 in bone marrow cells of AML patients was detected by RT-qPCR. After miR-143 was over-expressed in U-937 cell lines, the proliferation of U-937 cell lines was detected by CCK-8, clone formation assay, and flow cytometry. In addition, cell apoptosis was detected by Hoechst 33258 fluorescence staining and flow cytometry. At the same time, bioinformatics, RT-qPCR and dual luciferase reporter gene assay were used to predicted and verified the targeting relationship between miR-143 and MALAT-1. RESULTS: Expression of miR-143 in AML patients was significantly lower than those in normal controls. Over-expressed miR-143 could inhibit the proliferation of U-937 cells and promote the apoptosis of the cell. The miR-143 binding site was located on the MALAT-1 RNA sequence, and MALAT-1 was down-regulated in U-937 cells after over-expressed miR-143. However, the expression of miR-143 showed no significantly changed after MALAT-1 silencing. CONCLUSION: Expression of miR-143 in AML patients is lower than that in normal controls. Over-expression of miR-143 can inhibit the proliferation of U-937 cells and promote its apoptosis.

METHODS: In this international, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, patients with large B-cell lymphoma that was refractory to or had relapsed no more than 12 months after first-line chemoimmunotherapy to receive axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel, an autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy) or standard care (two or three cycles of investigator-selected, protocol-defined chemoimmunotherapy, followed by high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem-cell transplantation in patients with a response to the chemoimmunotherapy). The primary end point was event-free survival according to blinded central review. Key secondary end points were response and overall survival. Safety was also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 180 patients were randomly assigned to receive axi-cel and 179 to receive standard care. The primary end-point analysis of event-free survival showed that axi-cel therapy was superior to standard care. At a median follow-up of 24.9 months, the median event-free survival was 8.3 months in the axi-cel group and 2.0 months in the standard-care group, and the 24-month event-free survival was 41% and 16%, respectively (hazard ratio for event or death, 0.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.31 to 0.51; P<0.001). A response occurred in 83% of the patients in the axi-cel group and in 50% of those in the standard-care group (with a complete response in 65% and 32%, respectively). In an interim analysis, the estimated overall survival at 2 years was 61% in the axi-cel group and 52% in the standard-care group. Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 91% of the patients who received axi-cel and in 83% of those who received standard care. Among patients who received axi-cel, grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome occurred in 6% and grade 3 or higher neurologic events in 21%. No deaths related to cytokine release syndrome or neurologic events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Axi-cel therapy led to significant improvements, as compared with standard care, in event-free survival and response, with the expected level of high-grade toxic effects.

However, cytopenia in patients with psychiatric disorders can also be due to other conditions such as leukemia. In this report, we discuss two cases of cytopenia that occurred during the adjustment of psychotropic medications in patients with severe psychiatric illness. The initial diagnosis in each case was drug-induced cytopenia; however, later, the cause of cytopenia was found to be acute promyelocytic leukemia. When cytopenia is observed while increasing the dosage of psychotropic drugs, suspicious drugs should be discontinued, though the possibility that cytopenia could be due to other reasons should be considered. If there are no signs of recovering blood cells or if cytopenia is severe, psychiatrists should consult hematologists promptly.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

In recent years, with the continuous development of immunotherapy, such as chimeric antigen receptor T cells, blinatumomab, and inotuzumab ozogamicin, a series of vital clinical studies have confirmed its high response rate and favorable outcomes for ALL. Although the emergence of immunotherapy has expanded relapsed or refractory (r/r) ALL patients' opportunities to receive allo-HSCT, allo-HSCT is associated with potential challenges. In this review, the role of allo-HSCT in the treatment of adult ALL in the era of immunotherapy will be discussed.","['Copyright (c) 2021 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.']","['Sun, Wei', 'Huang, Xiaojun']","['Sun W', 'Huang X']","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211210,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,IM,,2021/12/11 06:00,2021/12/11 06:00,['2021/12/10 17:13'],"['2021/12/10 17:13 [entrez]', '2021/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/CM9.0000000000001898 [doi]', '00029330-900000000-98275 [pii]']",aheadofprint,Chin Med J (Engl). 2021 Dec 10. pii: 00029330-900000000-98275. doi: 10.1097/CM9.0000000000001898.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We identified data from eight randomized, active-controlled trials of intensive chemotherapy submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of newly diagnosed AML (N = 4,482). Associations between trial-level odds ratios (ORs) for CR and CR + CRi or CRp, and hazard ratios (HRs) for EFS and OS were analyzed using weighted linear regression models. We performed patient-level responder analyses to compare OS by response using pooled data from all studies. RESULTS: In trial-level analyses, association between HR for OS and OR for CR was moderate (R(2) = 0.49; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.86), as was the association with OR for CR + CRi or CRp (R(2) = 0.48; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.99). For OS versus EFS, a strong association was observed (R(2) = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.98) when EFS definitions were harmonized across trials using raw data. In the patient-level responder analyses, patients who achieved CR had better OS compared with CRi or CRp responders (0.73; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.84) and nonresponders (HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.37). CONCLUSION: On a trial level, there is a moderate association between OS and CR rate. A strong association between EFS and OS was observed. However, CIs were wide, and results became moderate using alternative definitions for EFS. Patient-level analyses showed CR responders have better OS compared with CRi or CRp responders and nonresponders. A therapy in newly diagnosed AML with benefit in EFS or substantial benefit in CR rate would be likely to have an OS effect.",,"['Norsworthy, Kelly J', 'Gao, Xin', 'Ko, Chia-Wen', 'Pulte, E Dianne', 'Zhou, Jiaxi', 'Gong, Yutao', 'Shen, Yuan Li', 'Vallejo, Jonathon', 'Gwise, Thomas E', 'Sridhara, Rajeshwari', 'Deisseroth, Albert B', 'Farrell, Ann T', 'de Claro, R Angelo', 'Blumenthal, Gideon M', 'Pazdur, Richard']","['Norsworthy KJ', 'Gao X', 'Ko CW', 'Pulte ED', 'Zhou J', 'Gong Y', 'Shen YL', 'Vallejo J', 'Gwise TE', 'Sridhara R', 'Deisseroth AB', 'Farrell AT', 'de Claro RA', 'Blumenthal GM', 'Pazdur R']","['Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, US Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD.', 'Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, US Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD.', 'Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, US Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD.', 'Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, US Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD.', 'Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, US Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD.', 'Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, US Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD.', 'Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, US Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD.', 'Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, US Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD.', 'Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, US Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD.', 'Oncology Center of Excellence, US Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD.', 'Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, US Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD.', 'Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, US Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD.', 'Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, US Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD.', 'Oncology Center of Excellence, US Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD.', 'Oncology Center of Excellence, US Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211210,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Yutao GongEmployment: BeiGeneStock and Other Ownership Interests: BeiGene', 'Jonathon VallejoEmployment: AstraZeneca (I) Gideon M.

Although fatigue and sleep disturbances are frequent complications of ALL therapy and associated with cognitive functions, the impact of fatigue and sleep profiles during active ALL treatment on posttreatment neurocognitive performance has received limited attention. METHODS: Pediatric patients (n = 120) with ALL (diagnosed 2011-2016) who completed fatigue and sleep questionnaires at four time points during active treatment were enrolled in a study of neurocognitive performance. Latent class growth analysis identified subgroups of patients with similar sleep and fatigue profiles during treatment. Neurocognitive performance collected >6 months post treatment on 40 participants was compared between latent classes using multivariable linear regression models. RESULTS: Participants (57.5% male and 79.1% Hispanic or non-Hispanic White) were classified into one of two fatigue and sleep profiles: Class 1 characterized by mild fatigue and sleep disturbances during treatment (50.8%), and Class 2 characterized by higher levels of fatigue and sleep disturbances (49.2%). Posttreatment cognitive performance was in the normal range for most measures, but significantly below normative means for executive function, verbal short-term memory, attention, and distractability measures. Compared to Class 1, Class 2 demonstrated significantly (p < .05) poorer posttreatment neurocognitive performance, particularly in measures of attention. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that fatigue and sleep disturbances during the first year of pediatric ALL therapy may impact long-term neurocognitive performance. Sleep and fatigue may be targets for intervention to preserve cognitive functioning in survivors.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Vasquez, Priscilla', 'Escalante, Johanna', 'Raghubar, Kimberly P', 'Kahalley, Lisa S', 'Taylor, Olga A', 'Moore, Ida Ki', 'Hockenberry, Marilyn J', 'Scheurer, Michael E', 'Brown, Austin L']","['Vasquez P', 'Escalante J', 'Raghubar KP', 'Kahalley LS', 'Taylor OA', 'Moore IK', 'Hockenberry MJ', 'Scheurer ME', 'Brown AL']","['Department of Pediatrics, Section of Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Psychology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Psychology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Psychology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'College of Nursing, University of Arizona, Tuscan, Arizona, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211210,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,,2021/12/11 06:00,2021/12/11 06:00,['2021/12/10 08:52'],"['2021/11/16 00:00 [revised]', '2021/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/10 08:52 [entrez]', '2021/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.29507 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2021 Dec 10:e29507. doi: 10.1002/pbc.29507.,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9332-181X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5802-5073']","['K07CA218362/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA1693398/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RP190132/Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas']",,['NOTNLM'],"['attention', 'executive function', 'fatigue', 'memory', 'neurocognitive', 'pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'sleep']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Initially, the bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax (VEN) was used as a single agent and then was rapidly combined in VEN-based regimens associated with either anti-CD20 or with BTKi. These regimens yielded a high rate of complete remission, leading to their use as a fixed duration treatment. The decision between continuous treatment with BTKi and VEN-based combinations relies mostly on comorbidities, comedications, and patient/physician preferences. Notably, with BTKi, cardiovascular comorbidities, hypertension, and potential pharmacological interactions should be carefully evaluated. On the other hand, the risk of tumor lysis syndrome with VEN should be monitored at treatment initiation. TP53 alteration and IGHV mutational status should also be assessed, as they remain important for therapeutic decisions. Fit patients with a TP53 wild type and IGHV-mutated CLL may still benefit from fludarabine-cyclophosphamide-rituximab chemoimmunotherapy (CIT), as it may result in a very long remission duration. VEN-based treatments are well tolerated, and no additional toxicity has been observed when combined with anti-CD20 or BTKi. The 1-year fixed-duration association of VEN plus obinutuzumab was evaluated in frontline for older adult patients. Nonetheless, considering the favorable outcome, an extension of indication for fit younger patients is expected. The association of VEN and BTKi is promising, even if the follow-up is still short. It is currently being tested against CIT, BTKi continuous treatment, and VEN plus anti-CD20.",['Copyright (c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Levy, Vincent', 'Delmer, Alain', 'Cymbalista, Florence']","['Levy V', 'Delmer A', 'Cymbalista F']","['Departement de Recherche Clinique, Hopital Avicenne AP-HP, Universite Sorbonne Paris Nord, Bobigny, France, and INSERM CRESS-UMR 1153, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.', 'Hematology Department, Reims University Hospital and Reims Champagne Ardenne University, Reims, France.', 'Hematology Biology, Hopital Avicenne, AP-HP, Universite Sorbonne Paris Nord, Bobigny, France, and INSERM UMR 978, Bobigny, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

However, the novel targeted agents such as Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKis) and venetoclax have now mostly replaced chemotherapy in frontline treatment of CLL. Several clinical trials have been conducted to examine the role of anti-CD20 mAbs in combination with BTK inhibitors and venetoclax. Addition of rituximab to ibrutinib does not improve progression-free survival (PFS) of treatment-naive patients with CLL, possibly related to ibrutinib's antagonistic effect on anti-CD20 antibodies. Alternatively, addition of a glycoengineered anti-CD20 mAb obinutuzumab to a more selective BTKi acalabrutinib may improve PFS but does not improve overall survival of patients with CLL in the frontline setting, pending long-term follow-up. Thus, we suggest that the addition of an anti-CD20 mAb to a BTKi is of most benefit to patients with autoimmune cytopenia or rapidly progressive disease. In contrast to BTKis, combination of fixed-duration venetoclax and anti-CD20 mAb can induce deep remission with high rates of undetectable minimal residual disease, correlating with improved survival of patients with CLL in both frontline and relapsed/refractory settings. In this review, we discuss clinical trials of BTKis and venetoclax that have investigated the role of anti-CD20 mAbs in frontline and relapsed settings of CLL treatment. We also provide an algorithm suggesting how anti-CD20 mAbs may be incorporated in the treatment of patients with CLL, including specific scenarios.",['Copyright (c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Shah, Harsh R', 'Stephens, Deborah M']","['Shah HR', 'Stephens DM']","['University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

Despite this, TKIs have improved outcomes in advanced phase CML, particularly in de novo AP patients, but are often inadequate for lasting remissions. The goal of initial therapy in advanced CML is a return to a chronic phase followed by consideration for bone marrow transplantation. The addition of induction chemotherapy with TKI is often necessary for achievement of a second chronic phase.

In the current era of novel treatment options, genetic and molecular testing at the time of diagnosis and relapse becomes increasingly relevant. Midostaurin in combination with intensive chemotherapy is the standard of care as upfront therapy in younger AML patients with mutated fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3).

Unfortunately, high-dose anthracyclines are associated with a significant risk of cardiotoxicity, which may result in early and/or long-term left ventricular systolic dysfunction and heart failure. Moreover, the development of cardiotoxicity during pediatric AML therapy is associated with lower event-free and overall survival, which may be partially attributable to incomplete anthracycline delivery. A combined strategy of primary cardioprotection and close cardiac monitoring can maximize chemotherapy delivery while reducing the toxicity of intensive AML therapy. Primary cardioprotection using dexrazoxane reduces short-term cardiotoxicity without compromising cancer survival. Liposomal anthracycline formulations, which are under active investigation, have the potential to mitigate cardiotoxicity while also improving antitumor efficacy. Primary cardioprotective strategies may reduce but not eliminate the risk of cardiotoxicity; therefore, close cardiac monitoring is also needed. Standard cardiac monitoring consists of serial echocardiographic assessments for left ventricular ejection fraction decline. Global longitudinal strain has prognostic utility in cancer therapy-related cardiotoxicity and may be used as an adjunct assessment. Additional cardioprotective measures should be considered in response to significant cardiotoxicity; these include cardiac remodeling medications to support cardiac recovery and anthracycline dose interruption and/or regimen modifications. However, the withholding of anthracyclines should be limited to avoid compromising cancer survival.

Despite advancements in therapeutic regimens, the prognosis remains very poor, especially in the elderly population. Selinexor is a first-in-class, oral, small molecule Exportin-1 inhibitor that is being developed for the treatment of a variety of cancers, including AML. The efficacy and safety issues of selinexor in the treatment of AML are still the focus of attention. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of selinexor in the treatment of AML. METHODS: According to the search strategy, regardless of publication date or language, randomized controlled trials of selinexor for AML will be retrieved from 8 databases. First of all, the literature was screened according to the eligibility criteria, and use the Cochrane Collaboration's tool to assess the quality of the included literature. Then, using Rev Man 5.3 and STATA 14.2 software for traditional meta-analysis. Finally, the evaluation of the quality of the evidence and the strength of the recommendations will adopt the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation method.

In the present work, we utilized acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines, selected to be refractory to various chemotherapeutics, to explore the interplay between SL metabolism and mitochondrial biology supportive of multidrug resistance (MDR). In agreement with previous findings in cytarabine or daunorubicin resistant AML cells, relative to chemosensitive wildtype controls, HL-60 cells refractory to vincristine (HL60/VCR) presented with alterations in SL enzyme expression and lipidome composition. Such changes were typified by upregulated expression of various ceramide detoxifying enzymes, as well as corresponding shifts in ceramide, glucosylceramide, and sphingomyelin (SM) molecular species. With respect to mitochondria, despite consistent increases in both basal respiration and maximal respiratory capacity, direct interrogation of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system revealed intrinsic deficiencies in HL60/VCR, as well as across multiple MDR model systems. Based on the apparent requirement for augmented SL and mitochondrial flux to support the MDR phenotype, we explored a combinatorial therapeutic paradigm designed to target each pathway. Remarkably, despite minimal cytotoxicity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), co-targeting SL metabolism, and respiratory complex I (CI) induced synergistic cytotoxicity consistently across multiple MDR leukemia models. Together, these data underscore the intimate connection between cellular sphingolipids and mitochondrial metabolism and suggest that pharmacological intervention across both pathways may represent a novel treatment strategy against MDR.",['(c) 2021 Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.'],"['Fisher-Wellman, Kelsey H', 'Hagen, James T', 'Kassai, Miki', 'Kao, Li-Pin', 'Nelson, Margaret A M', 'McLaughlin, Kelsey L', 'Coalson, Hannah S', 'Fox, Todd E', 'Tan, Su-Fern', 'Feith, David J', 'Kester, Mark', 'Loughran, Thomas P Jr', 'Claxton, David F', 'Cabot, Myles C']","['Fisher-Wellman KH', 'Hagen JT', 'Kassai M', 'Kao LP', 'Nelson MAM', 'McLaughlin KL', 'Coalson HS', 'Fox TE', 'Tan SF', 'Feith DJ', 'Kester M', 'Loughran TP Jr', 'Claxton DF', 'Cabot MC']","['Department of Physiology, Brody School of Medicine, and the East Carolina Diabetes and Obesity Institute, East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Physiology, Brody School of Medicine, and the East Carolina Diabetes and Obesity Institute, East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Brody School of Medicine, and the East Carolina Diabetes and Obesity Institute, East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Brody School of Medicine, and the East Carolina Diabetes and Obesity Institute, East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Physiology, Brody School of Medicine, and the East Carolina Diabetes and Obesity Institute, East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Physiology, Brody School of Medicine, and the East Carolina Diabetes and Obesity Institute, East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Physiology, Brody School of Medicine, and the East Carolina Diabetes and Obesity Institute, East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Penn state Cancer Institute, Hershey, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Brody School of Medicine, and the East Carolina Diabetes and Obesity Institute, East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,IM,,2021/12/11 06:00,2021/12/24 06:00,['2021/12/10 07:07'],"['2021/11/11 00:00 [revised]', '2021/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/10 07:07 [entrez]', '2021/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1096/fj.202101194RRR [doi]'],ppublish,FASEB J. 2022 Jan;36(1):e22094. doi: 10.1096/fj.202101194RRR.,,['P01 CA171983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['NOTNLM'],"['*HL-60 cells', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*chemotherapy resistance', '*mitochondrial bioenergetics', '*sphingolipids', '*vincristine']",20211222,"['0 (Sphingolipids)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,"['Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism/pathology', '*Oxidative Phosphorylation', 'Sphingolipids/*metabolism', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",,,,,,,,,,

PML and PML-NBs are involved in the regulation of various cellular functions, including the antiviral immune response. The human PML gene can generate several different isoforms through alternative splicing. However, little is known about the porcine PML alternative splicing isoforms and their expression profiles during Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection. In the present study, we cloned seven mature transcripts of porcine PML, all of which contained the same N-terminal sequence but differed in the C-terminal sequences due to alternative splicing. These seven transcripts encoded five proteins all of which had the RBCC motif and sumoylation sites. Amino acid sequence homology analysis showed that porcine PML-1 had relatively high levels of identity with human, cattle, and goat homologs (76.21, 77.17, and 77.05%, respectively), and low identity with the mouse homolog (61.78%). Immunofluorescence analysis showed that the typical PML-NBs could be observed after overexpression of the five PML isoforms in PK15 cells. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis showed significant upregulation of PML isoforms and PML-NB-associated genes (Daxx and SP100) at 36 and 48 h post-infection (hpi). Western blotting analysis indicated that the PML isoforms were upregulated during the late stage of infection. Moreover, the number of PML-NBs was increased after JEV infection. These results suggest that porcine PML isoforms may play essential roles in JEV infection.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Zhu, Chen, Dai, Zhou, Wang, Li, Zhao and Yang.']","['Zhu, Jingjing', 'Chen, Zhenyu', 'Dai, Zhenglie', 'Zhou, Xiaolong', 'Wang, Han', 'Li, Xiangchen', 'Zhao, Ayong', 'Yang, Songbai']","['Zhu J', 'Chen Z', 'Dai Z', 'Zhou X', 'Wang H', 'Li X', 'Zhao A', 'Yang S']","['Key Laboratory of Applied Technology on Green-Eco-Healthy Animal Husbandry of Zhejiang Province, College of Animal Science and Technology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Zhejiang A&F University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Applied Technology on Green-Eco-Healthy Animal Husbandry of Zhejiang Province, College of Animal Science and Technology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Zhejiang A&F University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Applied Technology on Green-Eco-Healthy Animal Husbandry of Zhejiang Province, College of Animal Science and Technology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Zhejiang A&F University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Applied Technology on Green-Eco-Healthy Animal Husbandry of Zhejiang Province, College of Animal Science and Technology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Zhejiang A&F University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Applied Technology on Green-Eco-Healthy Animal Husbandry of Zhejiang Province, College of Animal Science and Technology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Zhejiang A&F University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Applied Technology on Green-Eco-Healthy Animal Husbandry of Zhejiang Province, College of Animal Science and Technology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Zhejiang A&F University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Applied Technology on Green-Eco-Healthy Animal Husbandry of Zhejiang Province, College of Animal Science and Technology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Zhejiang A&F University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Applied Technology on Green-Eco-Healthy Animal Husbandry of Zhejiang Province, College of Animal Science and Technology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Zhejiang A&F University, Hangzhou, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211123,Switzerland,Front Vet Sci,Frontiers in veterinary science,101666658,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",2021/12/11 06:00,2021/12/11 06:01,['2021/12/10 06:47'],"['2021/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/10 06:47 [entrez]', '2021/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fvets.2021.757978 [doi]'],epublish,Front Vet Sci. 2021 Nov 23;8:757978. doi: 10.3389/fvets.2021.757978. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8649775,['NOTNLM'],"['JEV', 'PML gene', 'alternative splicing', 'clone', 'porcine']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we evaluate the impact of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at the time of TCVC placement on development of central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) in children with lymphoblastic (ALL) or myeloid leukemia (AML). Materials and Methods: A retrospective observational study of children undergoing TCVC placement at a tertiary referral hospital between January 2000 and December 2019 was performed. Traditional and competing-risks regression models were used to estimate the effect of perioperative ANC on development of CLABSI. Results: A total of 350 children (median age 6.4 [IQR: 3.1-10.9] years) underwent 498 consecutive TCVC implantations in neutropenic (n = 172, 34.5%) and non-neutropenic conditions (n = 326, 65.5%). The median length of observation per TCVC was 217.1 (IQR: 116.1-260.5) days with a total of 99,681 catheter days (CD). There were no differences in early (within first 30 days after TCVC placement) and overall CLABSI rates between neutropenic and non-neutropenic patients (HR 1.250, p = 0.502; HR 1.633, p = 0.143). We identified female sex (HR 2.640, p = 0.006) and the use of TCVC for treatment of relapsed leukemia (HR 4.347, p < 0.0001) as risk factors for early CLABSI and the use of double-lumen catheters (HR 2.607, p = 0.003) and use of TCVCs during leukemia relapse (HR 2.004, p = 0.005) for overall study period. Conclusion: The placement of TCVC in children with neutropenia undergoing anticancer therapy for acute leukemia is safe and not associated with an elevated rate of CLABSI.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Martynov and Schoenberger.'],"['Martynov, Illya', 'Schoenberger, Joachim']","['Martynov I', 'Schoenberger J']","['Department of Pediatric Surgery, University Hospital of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Surgery, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Surgery, University Hospital of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Surgery, Helios Kliniken Schwerin, Schwerin, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211123,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",2021/12/11 06:00,2021/12/11 06:01,['2021/12/10 06:45'],"['2021/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/10 06:45 [entrez]', '2021/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.770698 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Nov 23;11:770698. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.770698. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8649799,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL-acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'AML-acute myeloid leukemia', 'CLABSI', 'absolute neutrophil count (ANC)', 'children', 'neutropenia', 'tunneled central venous catheters']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current experiment is aimed to assess the differentiation capacity of human cumulus GCs toward the oocyte-like phenotype in vitro. Methods: GCs were isolated from healthy female volunteers subjected to in vitro fertilization or intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF-ICSI). The effect of different media supplemented with leukemia inhibitory factors (LIFs), 5 ng/mL estradiol, and 0.005 IU/mL follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were investigated to the differentiation of GCs toward oocyte-like phenotype via monitoring the expression of Oct3/4 and GATA-4 using flow cytometry analysis. The expression of genes such as FIGLA, NOBOX, and SYCP3 was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. We also assess morphological adaptation by using bright-field microscopic imaging. Results: Exposure of GCs to LIFs increased the number of cells expressing stemness factor Oct3/4 coincided with the suppression of GATA-4 after 7 days (P < 0.05). We found that the transcript level of all genes FIGLA, Nobox, and SYCP-3 decreased in cells after treatment with a FSH (P < 0.05). According to our data, the incubation of GCs with estradiol increased the expression of genes related to the oocyte-like phenotype. Conclusion: Our finding revealed that the combination of LIFs and estradiol could induce the GCs' oogenesis capacity and thereby is possibly suggested as a therapeutic strategy during the occurrence of gynecological disorders.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.'],"['Yousefi, Soudabe', 'Akbarzadeh, Maryam', 'Soleimanirad, Jafar', 'Hamdi, Kobra', 'Farzadi, Laya', 'Ghasemzadeh, Aalie', 'Mahdipour, Mahdi', 'Rahbarghazi, Reza', 'Nouri, Mohammad']","['Yousefi S', 'Akbarzadeh M', 'Soleimanirad J', 'Hamdi K', 'Farzadi L', 'Ghasemzadeh A', 'Mahdipour M', 'Rahbarghazi R', 'Nouri M']","['Stem Cell Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Clinical Laboratories, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Student Research Committee, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Institute, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Stem Cell Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Applied Cell Sciences, Faculty of Advanced Medical Sciences, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Applied Cell Sciences, Faculty of Advanced Medical Sciences, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Applied Cell Sciences, Faculty of Advanced Medical Sciences, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Stem Cell Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Stem Cell Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Applied Cell Sciences, Faculty of Advanced Medical Sciences, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Stem Cell Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Applied Cell Sciences, Faculty of Advanced Medical Sciences, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20200726,Iran,Adv Pharm Bull,Advanced pharmaceutical bulletin,101578021,,,2021/12/11 06:00,2021/12/11 06:01,['2021/12/10 06:45'],"['2020/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/10 06:45 [entrez]', '2021/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.34172/apb.2021.080 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Pharm Bull. 2021 Sep;11(4):712-718. doi: 10.34172/apb.2021.080.

Nevertheless, the underlying effect of RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications on tumor microenvironment cell infiltration remains elusive. In this study, we thoroughly assessed m6A modification patterns of 255 myeloid leukemia specimens based on 23 m6A regulators. Consensus clustering of the 23 m6A regulators was performed to determine three distinct m6A modification patterns that were remarkably consistent with three immunophenotypes of tumors: immunorejection, immune activation, and immune inertness. Further evaluation and prognostic analysis of the m6A modification patterns of individual tumors revealed that low m6A score was characterized by increased mutational burden, immune activation, and survival rates, whereas high m6A score was characterized by poorer survival rates and the absence of effective immune infiltration. In addition, this study investigated the association between m6A regulators and antitumor immune responses and discovered higher expression of the immune regulators PD-L1, PD-L2, MRP1, and MRP2 in low m6A scores. Generally, the expression pattern of m6A regulators was remarkably associated with prognostic results and antitumor immune responses in acute myeloid leukemia and may be an underlying target and biological marker for immune therapies.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Du, Wu, Gao, Jiang, Wang, Zhang and Zhao.']","['Du, Ashuai', 'Wu, Xin', 'Gao, Yunmei', 'Jiang, Baili', 'Wang, Jianlong', 'Zhang, Pan', 'Zhao, Qiangqiang']","['Du A', 'Wu X', 'Gao Y', 'Jiang B', 'Wang J', 'Zhang P', 'Zhao Q']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', ""Department of Infectious Diseases, Guizhou Provincial People's Hospital, Guizhou, China."", 'Department of Orthopedics, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', ""Department of Hematology, The Qinghai Provincial People's Hospital, Xining, China."", 'Department of Medical Oncology, The Xiayi County Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, Shangqiu, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', ""Department of Hematology, The Qinghai Provincial People's Hospital, Xining, China."", 'Department of Blood Transfusion, The Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211123,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",2021/12/11 06:00,2021/12/11 06:00,['2021/12/10 06:41'],"['2021/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/10 06:41 [entrez]', '2021/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2021.789914 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2021 Nov 23;12:789914. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.789914. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8650218,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'immunotherapy', 'm6A', 'mutation burden', 'tumor microenvironment']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compartmental regulation of NAD(+) consumption, especially between the nucleus and the mitochondria, is required for energy homeostasis. However, how compartmental regulation evolved remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the evolution of the macrodomain-containing histone variant macroH2A1.1, an integral chromatin component that limits nuclear NAD(+) consumption by inhibiting poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 in vertebrate cells. We found that macroH2A originated in premetazoan protists. The crystal structure of the macroH2A macrodomain from the protist Capsaspora owczarzaki allowed us to identify highly conserved principles of ligand binding and pinpoint key residue substitutions, selected for during the evolution of the vertebrate stem lineage. Metabolic characterization of the Capsaspora lifecycle suggested that the metabolic function of macroH2A was associated with nonproliferative stages. Taken together, we provide insight into the evolution of a chromatin element involved in compartmental NAD regulation, relevant for understanding its metabolism and potential therapeutic applications.","['(c) 2021.

Recently, targeted drugs have improved survival both in the elderly and in fit patients. However, as monthly costs of targeted agents are high, regulatory bodies often impose restrictions on their use. AREAS COVERED: The authors review the value-for-cost of targeted drugs such as gemtuzumab ozogamycin, CPX-351, midostaurin, gilteritinib, glasdegib, venetoclax, oral azacytidine and enasidenib used to treat adult AML. EMBASE and TRIP databases, together with authority websites were searched for technology assessments. Add-on drugs, namely midostaurin and gemtuzumab ozogamycin, have been reported to have the best pharmacoeconomic profile for newly diagnosed fit patients with FLT3 mutation or favorable/intermediate cytogenetics, since allogeneic transplant rates were stable or reduced. Most of the other drugs, on the other hand, did not achieve highly favorable cost-for-benefit, due to a poor absolute survival gain and/or increased transplant rates. EXPERT OPINION: The cost of most targeted therapies for AML in unfit patients seems unfair in comparison to the absolute survival advantage provided in fit patients. Point of cure and transplant outcomes should be standardized to allow comparability among the models.",,"['Marchetti, Monia', 'Albertin, Luca', 'Limberti, Giulia', 'Canicatti, Manuela']","['Marchetti M', 'Albertin L', 'Limberti G', 'Canicatti M']","['Hematology Unit & Transplant Center, Azienza Ospedaliera Ss Antonio E Biagio E Cesare Arrigo, Alessandria, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit & Transplant Center, Azienza Ospedaliera Ss Antonio E Biagio E Cesare Arrigo, Alessandria, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit & Transplant Center, Azienza Ospedaliera Ss Antonio E Biagio E Cesare Arrigo, Alessandria, Italy.', 'Oncology Unit, Hospital Cardial Massaia, ASLAT, Asti, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211214,England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,IM,,2021/12/11 06:00,2021/12/11 06:00,['2021/12/10 05:34'],"['2021/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/11 06:00 [medline]', '2021/12/10 05:34 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14656566.2021.2014453 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2021 Dec 14:1-10. doi: 10.1080/14656566.2021.2014453.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'CPX-351', 'azacitidine', 'cost-effectiveness', 'enasidenib', 'gemtuzumab ozogamycin', 'gilteritinib', 'glasdegib', 'venetoclax']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pancratium trianthum is an Amaryllidaceae species widely used in African folk medicine to treat several diseases such as central nervous system disorders, tumors, and microbial infections, and it is used to heal wounds. The current investigation explored the biological properties of alkaloid extracts from bulbs of P. trianthum collected in the Senegalese flora. Alkaloid extracts were analyzed and identified by chromatography and mass spectrometry. Alkaloid extracts from P. trianthum displayed pleiotropic biological properties. Cytotoxic activity of the extracts was determined on hepatocarcinoma Huh7 cells and on acute monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells, while agar diffusion and microdilution assays were used to evaluate antibacterial activity. Antiviral activity was measured by infection of extract-treated cells with dengue virus (DENVGFP) and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1GFP) reporter vectors. Cytotoxicity and viral inhibition were the most striking of P. trianthum's extract activities. Importantly, non-cytotoxic concentrations were highly effective in completely preventing DENVGFP replication and in reducing pseudotyped HIV-1GFP infection levels. Our results show that P. trianthum is a rich source of molecules for the potential discovery of new treatments against various diseases.

To apply FCM-MRD in large, collaborative trials, dedicated laboratory staff must be educated to concordantly high levels of expertise and their performance quality should be continuously monitored. We sought to install a unique and comprehensive training and quality control (QC) program involving a large number of reference laboratories within the international Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (I-BFM) consortium, in order to complement the standardization of the methodology with an educational component and persistent quality control measures. Our QC and quality assurance (QA) program is based on four major cornerstones: (i) a twinning maturation program, (ii) obligatory participation in external QA programs (spiked sample send around, United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Service (UK NEQAS)), (iii) regular participation in list-mode-data (LMD) file ring trials (FCM data file send arounds), and (iv) surveys of independent data derived from trial results. We demonstrate that the training of laboratories using experienced twinning partners, along with continuous educational feedback significantly improves the performance of laboratories in detecting and quantifying MRD in pediatric ALL patients. Overall, our extensive education and quality control program improved inter-laboratory concordance rates of FCM-MRD assessments and ultimately led to a very high conformity of risk estimates in independent patient cohorts.",,"['Maurer-Granofszky, Margarita', 'Schumich, Angela', 'Buldini, Barbara', 'Gaipa, Giuseppe', 'Kappelmayer, Janos', 'Mejstrikova, Ester', 'Karawajew, Leonid', 'Rossi, Jorge', 'Suzan, Adin Cinar', 'Agriello, Evangelina', 'Anastasiou-Grenzelia, Theodora', 'Barcala, Virna', 'Barna, Gabor', 'Batinic, Drago', 'Bourquin, Jean-Pierre', 'Bruggemann, Monika', 'Bukowska-Strakova, Karolina', 'Burnusuzov, Hasan', 'Carelli, Daniela', 'Deniz, Gunnur', 'Dubravcic, Klara', 'Feuerstein, Tamar', 'Gaillard, Marie Isabel', 'Galeano, Adriana', 'Giordano, Hugo', 'Gonzalez, Alejandro', 'Groeneveld-Krentz, Stefanie', 'Hevessy, Zsuzsanna', 'Hrusak, Ondrej', 'Iarossi, Maria Belen', 'Jakso, Pal', 'Kloboves Prevodnik, Veronika', 'Kohlscheen, Saskia', 'Kreminska, Elena', 'Maglia, Oscar', 'Malusardi, Cecilia', 'Marinov, Neda', 'Martin, Bibiana Maria', 'Moller, Claudia', 'Nikulshin, Sergey', 'Palazzi, Jorge', 'Paterakis, Georgios', 'Popov, Alexander', 'Ratei, Richard', 'Rodriguez, Cecilia', 'Sajaroff, Elisa Olga', 'Sala, Simona', 'Samardzija, Gordana', 'Sartor, Mary', 'Scarparo, Pamela', 'Sedek, Lukasz', 'Slavkovic, Bojana', 'Solari, Liliana', 'Svec, Peter', 'Szczepanski, Tomasz', 'Taparkou, Anna', 'Torrebadell, Montserrat', 'Tzanoudaki, Marianna', 'Varotto, Elena', 'Vernitsky, Helly', 'Attarbaschi, Andishe', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Conter, Valentino', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Felice, Marisa', 'Campbell, Myriam', 'Kiss, Csongor', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Dworzak, Michael N', 'On Behalf Of I-Bfm-Flow-Network']","['Maurer-Granofszky M', 'Schumich A', 'Buldini B', 'Gaipa G', 'Kappelmayer J', 'Mejstrikova E', 'Karawajew L', 'Rossi J', 'Suzan AC', 'Agriello E', 'Anastasiou-Grenzelia T', 'Barcala V', 'Barna G', 'Batinic D', 'Bourquin JP', 'Bruggemann M', 'Bukowska-Strakova K', 'Burnusuzov H', 'Carelli D', 'Deniz G', 'Dubravcic K', 'Feuerstein T', 'Gaillard MI', 'Galeano A', 'Giordano H', 'Gonzalez A', 'Groeneveld-Krentz S', 'Hevessy Z', 'Hrusak O', 'Iarossi MB', 'Jakso P', 'Kloboves Prevodnik V', 'Kohlscheen S', 'Kreminska E', 'Maglia O', 'Malusardi C', 'Marinov N', 'Martin BM', 'Moller C', 'Nikulshin S', 'Palazzi J', 'Paterakis G', 'Popov A', 'Ratei R', 'Rodriguez C', 'Sajaroff EO', 'Sala S', 'Samardzija G', 'Sartor M', 'Scarparo P', 'Sedek L', 'Slavkovic B', 'Solari L', 'Svec P', 'Szczepanski T', 'Taparkou A', 'Torrebadell M', 'Tzanoudaki M', 'Varotto E', 'Vernitsky H', 'Attarbaschi A', 'Schrappe M', 'Conter V', 'Biondi A', 'Felice M', 'Campbell M', 'Kiss C', 'Basso G', 'Dworzak MN', 'On Behalf Of I-Bfm-Flow-Network']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria."", ""Children's Cancer Research Institute, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria."", 'Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplant Division, Maternal and Child Health Department, University of Padova, 35122 Padova, Italy.', 'M.

However, little is known about the mechanism by which autophagy- dependent AML cells can overcome dysfunctional autophagy. In our study we identified autophagy related protein 3 (ATG3) as a crucial autophagy gene for AML cell proliferation by conducting a CRISPR/Cas9 dropout screen with a library targeting around 200 autophagy-related genes. shRNA-mediated loss of ATG3 impaired autophagy function in AML cells and increased their mitochondrial activity and energy metabolism, as shown by elevated mitochondrial ROS generation and mitochondrial respiration. Using tracer-based NMR metabolomics analysis we further demonstrate that the loss of ATG3 resulted in an upregulation of glycolysis, lactate production, and oxidative phosphorylation. Additionally, loss of ATG3 strongly sensitized AML cells to the inhibition of mitochondrial metabolism. These findings highlight the metabolic vulnerabilities that AML cells acquire from autophagy inhibition and support further exploration of combination therapies targeting autophagy and mitochondrial metabolism in AML.",,"['Baker, Fatima', 'Polat, Ibrahim H', 'Abou-El-Ardat, Khalil', 'Alshamleh, Islam', 'Thoelken, Marlyn', 'Hymon, Daniel', 'Gubas, Andrea', 'Koschade, Sebastian E', 'Vischedyk, Jonas B', 'Kaulich, Manuel', 'Schwalbe, Harald', 'Shaid, Shabnam', 'Brandts, Christian H']","['Baker F', 'Polat IH', 'Abou-El-Ardat K', 'Alshamleh I', 'Thoelken M', 'Hymon D', 'Gubas A', 'Koschade SE', 'Vischedyk JB', 'Kaulich M', 'Schwalbe H', 'Shaid S', 'Brandts CH']","['Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Frankfurt Cancer Institute, 60596 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Center for Biomolecular Magnetic Resonance (BMRZ), Institute of Organic Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Goethe-University, 60438 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Center for Biomolecular Magnetic Resonance (BMRZ), Institute of Organic Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Goethe-University, 60438 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Institute of Biochemistry II, Faculty of Medicine, Goethe University, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Frankfurt Cancer Institute, 60596 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Institute of Biochemistry II, Faculty of Medicine, Goethe University, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Frankfurt Cancer Institute, 60596 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Frankfurt Cancer Institute, 60596 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Institute of Biochemistry II, Faculty of Medicine, Goethe University, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Cardio-Pulmonary Institute, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Center for Biomolecular Magnetic Resonance (BMRZ), Institute of Organic Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Goethe-University, 60438 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'University Cancer Center Frankfurt (UCT), University Hospital, Goethe University, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Frankfurt Cancer Institute, 60596 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'University Cancer Center Frankfurt (UCT), University Hospital, Goethe University, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211206,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,2021/12/11 06:00,2021/12/11 06:01,['2021/12/10 01:06'],"['2021/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/25 00:00 [revised]', '2021/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/10 01:06 [entrez]', '2021/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/11 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13236142 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13236142 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Dec 6;13(23). pii: cancers13236142. doi: 10.3390/cancers13236142.,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-2196-6667', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6714-3602', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9528-8822', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1732-2535']","['259130777 - SFB 1177/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft', 'III L 5 - 519/03/03.001 - (0015)/LOEWE Center Frankfurt Cancer Institute (FCI)', 'funded by the Hessen State Ministry for Higher Education, Research and the Arts', 'Work at BMRZ is supported by the state of Hesse']",PMC8657081,['NOTNLM'],"['ATG3', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'autophagy', 'autophagy inhibition', 'metabolic rewiring']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Better understanding of the molecular mechanisms influencing and predicting treatment efficacy may improve disease control and outcome. Here we studied the expression, prognostic relevance and functional role of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family member Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor (NF)-kappaB (RANK) in AML. We conducted an experimental ex vivo study using leukemic cells of 54 AML patients. Substantial surface expression of RANK was detected on primary AML cells in 35% of the analyzed patients. We further found that RANK signaling induced the release of cytokines acting as growth and survival factors for the leukemic cells and mediated resistance of AML cells to treatment with doxorubicin and cytarabine, the most commonly used cytostatic compounds in AML treatment. In line, RANK expression correlated with a dismal disease course as revealed by reduced overall survival. Together, our results show that RANK plays a yet unrecognized role in AML pathophysiology and resistance to treatment, and identify RANK as ""functional"" prognostic marker in AML.

Neonatal screening/surveillance (NSS) for this variant resulted in early ACT detection and improved outcomes. The medical records of children with ACT who did not participate in newborn screening (non-NSS) were reviewed (2012-2018). We compared known prognostic factors between the NSS and non-NSS cohorts and estimated surveillance and treatment costs. Of the 16 non-NSS children with ACT carrying the R337H variant, the disease stages I, II, III, and IV were observed in five, five, one, and five children, respectively. The tumor weight ranged from 22 to 608 g. The 11 NSS children with ACT all had disease stage I and were alive.

The estimated surveillance/screening cost per year of life saved is US$623/patient. NSS is critical for improving the outcome of pediatric ACT in this region.

GAS5 lncRNA acts as a potent riborepressor of GR transcriptional activity, and thus targeting GAS5 in GC-treated chALL could provide further insights into GC resistance and support personalized treatment decisions. Herein, to study the clinical utility of GAS5 in chALL prognosis and chemotherapy response, GAS5 expression was quantified by RT-qPCR in bone marrow samples of chB-ALL patients at diagnosis (n = 164) and at end-of-induction (n = 109), treated with ALL-BFM protocol. Patients' relapse and death were used as clinical end-points for survival analysis. Bootstrap analysis was performed for internal validation, and decision curve analysis assessed the clinical net benefit for chALL prognosis. Our findings demonstrated the elevated GAS5 levels in blasts of chALL patients compared to controls and the significantly higher risk for short-term relapse and poor treatment outcome of patients overexpressing GAS5, independently of their clinicopathological data. The unfavorable prognostic value of GAS5 overexpression was strongly validated in the high-risk/stem-cell transplantation subgroup. Finally, multivariate models incorporating GAS5 levels resulted in superior risk stratification and clinical benefit for chALL prognostication, supporting personalized prognosis and precision medicine decisions in chALL.",,"['Xagorari, Marieta', 'Marmarinos, Antonios', 'Kossiva, Lydia', 'Baka, Margarita', 'Doganis, Dimitrios', 'Servitzoglou, Marina', 'Tsolia, Maria', 'Scorilas, Andreas', 'Avgeris, Margaritis', 'Gourgiotis, Dimitrios']","['Xagorari M', 'Marmarinos A', 'Kossiva L', 'Baka M', 'Doganis D', 'Servitzoglou M', 'Tsolia M', 'Scorilas A', 'Avgeris M', 'Gourgiotis D']","['Laboratory of Clinical Biochemistry-Molecular Diagnostics, Second Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, ""P. & A.

Solid tumours pose many additional challenges for CAR T cells that have severely blunted their potency, including homing to the sites of disease, survival and persistence within the adverse conditions of the tumour microenvironment, and above all, the highly immunosuppressive nature of the tumour milieu. Gene engineering approaches for generating immune cells capable of overcoming these hurdles remain an unmet therapeutic need and ongoing area of research. Recent advances have involved gene constructs for membrane-bound and/or secretable proteins that provide added effector cell function over and above the benefits of classical CAR-mediated cytotoxicity, rendering immune cells not only as direct cytotoxic effectors against tumours, but also as vessels for payload delivery capable of both modulating the tumour microenvironment and orchestrating innate and adaptive anti-tumour immunity. We discuss here the novel concept of engineered immune cells as vessels for payload delivery into the tumour microenvironment, how these cells are better adapted to overcome the challenges faced in a solid tumour, and importantly, the novel gene engineering approaches required to deliver these more complex polycistronic gene constructs.",,"['Fowler, Daniel', 'Nattress, Callum', 'Navarrete, Alba Southern', 'Barisa, Marta', 'Fisher, Jonathan']","['Fowler D', 'Nattress C', 'Navarrete AS', 'Barisa M', 'Fisher J']","['UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, 20 Guilford St, London WC1N 1DZ, UK.', 'UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, 20 Guilford St, London WC1N 1DZ, UK.', 'UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, 20 Guilford St, London WC1N 1DZ, UK.', 'UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, 20 Guilford St, London WC1N 1DZ, UK.', 'UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, 20 Guilford St, London WC1N 1DZ, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211129,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,2021/12/11 06:00,2021/12/11 06:01,['2021/12/10 01:05'],"['2021/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/19 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/10 01:05 [entrez]', '2021/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/11 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13236000 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13236000 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Nov 29;13(23). pii: cancers13236000. doi: 10.3390/cancers13236000.,['ORCID: 0000-0001-9326-3632'],"[""VS0119/Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity"", 'Academic Clinical Lectureship/National Institute for Health Research', 'SGL024\\1022/AMS_/Academy of Medical Sciences/United Kingdom', '214046/Z/18/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'UTF- 20-006/Fisher/UCL Technology Fund']",PMC8657158,['NOTNLM'],"['CAR T cell', 'armoured CAR T cell', 'cancer', 'cell therapy', 'engineered immune cells', 'immunosuppression', 'immunotherapy', 'payload delivery', 'solid tumours', 'tumour microenvironment']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bcl-2 inhibition initiate mitochondrial apoptosis, but also respiration and cellular ATP production in AML. AMP-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) is a central energy sensor activated by increased AMP:ATP ratio to restore the cellular energy balance. Unexpectedly, we observed that venetoclax inhibited AMPK activity through caspase-dependent degradation of AMPK subunits in AML cells. On the other hand, genetic models of AMPK invalidation and re-expression suggested that AMPK participated to the early stages of apoptotic response through a negative regulation of multi-domain anti-apoptotic effectors such as Mcl-1 or Bcl-xL.

Despite maximally intensive therapy, approximately 40% of patients will relapse. Novel targeted therapies are needed to improve outcomes. We identified mesothelin (MSLN), a well-validated target overexpressed in some adult malignancies, to be highly expressed on the leukemic cell surface in a subset of pediatric AML patients. The lack of expression on normal bone marrow cells makes MSLN a viable target for immunotherapies such as T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) that combine two distinct antibody-variable regions into a single molecule targeting a cancer-specific antigen and the T-cell co-receptor CD3. Using antibody single-chain variable region (scFv) sequences derived from amatuximab-recognizing MSLN, and from either blinatumomab or AMG330 targeting CD3, we engineered and expressed two MSLN/CD3-targeting BsAbs: MSLN(AMA)-CD3(L2K) and MSLN(AMA)-CD3(AMG), respectively.

However, the mechanism of continuous TFR is still unclear, as there are ""fluctuate"" patients who have BCR-ABL-positive leukemia cells but do not observe obvious relapse. We focused on the immune response and conducted an immune analysis using clinical samples from the imatinib discontinuation study, JALSG-STIM213. The results showed that, in the group that maintained TFR for 3 years, changes in regulatory T (Treg) cells were observed early after stopping imatinib treatment. The effector Treg (eTreg) cells increased transiently at 1 month after stopping imatinib and then returned to baseline at 3 months after stopping imatinib treatment. There was no difference in the Treg phenotype, and CD8(+) T cells in the TFR group were relatively activated. High concentrations of imatinib before stopping were negatively correlated with eTreg cells after stopping imatinib. These data suggest immunological involvement in the maintenance of the TFR, and that Treg cells after stopping imatinib might be a biomarker for TFR.

While advances in understanding the pathophysiology of the disease have been made, integrated systematic analyses of the spectrum of immunophenotypic and molecular alterations in real-world clinical cases remain limited. We performed mutation profiling of 50 BPDCN cases and assessed our findings in the context of disease immunophenotype, cytogenetics, and clinical characteristics. Patients included 42 men and 8 women, with a median age of 68 years (range, 14-84) at diagnosis. Forty-two (84%) patients had at least one mutation, and 23 (46%) patients had >/=3 mutations. The most common mutations involved TET2 and ASXL1, detected in 28 (56%) and 23 (46%) patients, respectively. Co-existing TET2 and ASXL1 mutations were present in 17 (34%) patients. Other recurrent mutations included ZRSR2 (16%), ETV6 (13%), DNMT3A (10%), NRAS (10%), IKZF1 (9%), SRSF2 (9%), IDH2 (8%), JAK2 (6%), KRAS (4%), NOTCH1 (4%), and TP53 (4%). We also identified mutations that have not been reported previously, including ETNK1, HNRNPK, HRAS, KDM6A, RAD21, SF3A1, and SH2B3. All patients received chemotherapy, and 20 patients additionally received stem cell transplantation. With a median follow-up of 10.5 months (range, 1-71), 21 patients achieved complete remission, 4 had persistent disease, and 24 died. Patients younger than 65 years had longer overall survival compared to those who were >/=65 years (p = 0.0022). Patients who had >/=3 mutations or mutations in the DNA methylation pathway genes had shorter overall survival (p = 0.0119 and p = 0.0126, respectively). Stem cell transplantation significantly prolonged overall survival regardless of mutation status. In conclusion, the majority of patients with BPDCN have somatic mutations involving epigenetic regulators and RNA splicing factors, in addition to ETV6 and IKZF1, which are also frequently mutated.

Follicular lymphoma (FL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most frequent types of indolent B-cell tumors, are exposed to AID activity during lymphomagenesis. We designed a workflow integrating de novo mutational signatures extraction and fitting of COSMIC (Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer) signatures, with tridimensional chromatin conformation data (Hi-C). We applied the workflow to exome sequencing data from lymphoma samples. In 33 FL and 30 CLL samples, 42% and 34% of the contextual mutations could be traced to a known AID motif. We demonstrate that both CLL and FL share mutational processes dominated by spontaneous deamination, failures in DNA repair, and AID activity. The processes had equiproportional distribution across active and nonactive chromatin compartments in CLL. In contrast, canonical AID activity and failures in DNA repair pathways in FL were significantly higher within the active chromatin compartment. Analysis of DNA repair genes revealed a higher prevalence of base excision repair gene mutations (p = 0.02) in FL than CLL. These data indicate that AID activity drives the genetic landscapes of FL and CLL.

Our data show that CD56(dim)CD16(-) and CD56(bright)CD16(-) NK cells represent the predominant NK cell subpopulations in AML, while the CD56(dim)CD16(+) NK cells are significantly reduced compared to HDs. Moreover, TIGIT(+) and PVRIG(+) cells cluster on the CD56(dim)CD16(+) subset whereas CD39(+) and CD38(+) cells do so on CD56(bright)CD16(-) NK cells in AML. Furthermore, functional effects of (co-)blockade of TIGIT and CD39 or A2AR on NK cell functionality were analyzed. These experiments revealed that the single blockade of the TIGIT receptor results in an increased NK-92 cell-mediated killing of AML cells in vitro. Combined targeting of CD39 or A2AR significantly augments the anti-TIGIT-mediated lysis of AML cells. Our data indicate that distinct NK cell subsets in AML exhibit different immunosuppressive patterns (via the TIGIT/PVRIG receptors and the purinergic pathway).

Epiregulin (EREG) is one of the EGFR ligands and is low expressed in most normal tissues. Elevated EREG in various cancers mainly activates EGFR signaling pathways and promotes cancer progression. Notably, a higher EREG expression level in CRC with wild-type Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) is related to better efficacy of therapeutic treatment. By contrast, the resistance of anti-EGFR therapy in CRC was driven by low EREG expression, aberrant genetic mutation and signal pathway alterations. Additionally, EREG overexpression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is anticipated to be a therapeutic target for EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI). However, recent findings indicate that EREG derived from macrophages promotes NSCLC cell resistance to EGFR-TKI treatment. The emerging events of EREG-mediated tumor promotion signals are generated by autocrine and paracrine loops that arise from tumor epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages in the tumor microenvironment (TME). The TME is a crucial element for the development of various cancer types and drug resistance. The regulation of EREG/EGFR pathways depends on distinct oncogenic driver mutations and cell contexts that allows specific pharmacological targeting alone or combinational treatment for tailored therapy. Novel strategies targeting EREG/EGFR, tumor-associated macrophages, and alternative activation oncoproteins are under development or undergoing clinical trials. In this review, we summarize the clinical outcomes of EREG expression and the interaction of this ligand in the TME. The EREG/EGFR pathway may be a potential target and may be combined with other driver mutation targets to combat specific cancers.",,"['Cheng, Wan-Li', 'Feng, Po-Hao', 'Lee, Kang-Yun', 'Chen, Kuan-Yuan', 'Sun, Wei-Lun', 'Van Hiep, Nguyen', 'Luo, Ching-Shan', 'Wu, Sheng-Ming']","['Cheng WL', 'Feng PH', 'Lee KY', 'Chen KY', 'Sun WL', 'Van Hiep N', 'Luo CS', 'Wu SM']","['Division of Cardiovascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11696, Taiwan.', 'Division of Cardiovascular Surgery, Department of Surgery, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11031, Taiwan.', 'Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Shuang Ho Hospital, Taipei Medical University, New Taipei City 23561, Taiwan.', 'Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11031, Taiwan.', 'Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Shuang Ho Hospital, Taipei Medical University, New Taipei City 23561, Taiwan.', 'Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11031, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11031, Taiwan.', 'Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Shuang Ho Hospital, Taipei Medical University, New Taipei City 23561, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11031, Taiwan.', 'Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Shuang Ho Hospital, Taipei Medical University, New Taipei City 23561, Taiwan.', 'Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11031, Taiwan.', 'Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Shuang Ho Hospital, Taipei Medical University, New Taipei City 23561, Taiwan.', 'International PhD Program in Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11031, Taiwan.', 'Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Shuang Ho Hospital, Taipei Medical University, New Taipei City 23561, Taiwan.', 'Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Shuang Ho Hospital, Taipei Medical University, New Taipei City 23561, Taiwan.', 'Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11031, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211127,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,,2021/12/11 06:00,2021/12/11 06:00,['2021/12/10 01:04'],"['2021/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/22 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/10 01:04 [entrez]', '2021/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/11 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms222312828 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms222312828 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Nov 27;22(23). pii: ijms222312828. doi: 10.3390/ijms222312828.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-7086-4873', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3390-7923', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1746-5771']","['108-2314-B-038-063-MY3/Ministry of Science and Technology of the Republic of', 'China', '110TMU-SHH-19/Taipei Medical University and Shuang Ho Hospital']",PMC8657471,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer therapy', 'epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)', 'epiregulin (EREG)', 'tumor microenvironment']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously defined the 27kD isoform (C/EBPepsilon(27)) as an antagonist of GATA-1 transactivation of the eosinophil's major basic protein-1 (MBP1) P2-promoter, showing C/EBPepsilon(27) and GATA-1 physically interact. In the current study, we used a Tat-C/EBPepsilon(27) fusion protein for cell/nuclear transduction of an eosinophil myelocyte cell line to demonstrate that C/EBPepsilon(27) is a potent repressor of MBP1 transcription. We performed structure-function analyses of C/EBPepsilon(27) mapping its repressor domains, comparing it to C/EBPepsilon(32) and C/EBPepsilon(14), using GATA-1 co-transactivation of the MBP1-P2 promoter. Results show C/EBPepsilon(27) repression of GATA-1 is mediated by its unique 68aa N-terminus combined with previously identified RDI domain. This repressor activity does not require, but is enhanced by, DNA binding via the basic region of C/EBPepsilon(27) but independent of sumoylation of the RDI core ""VKEEP"" sumoylation site. These findings identify the N-terminus of C/EBPepsilon(27) as the minimum repressor domain required for antagonism of GATA-1 in the eosinophil. C/EBPepsilon(27) repression of GATA-1 occurs via a combination of both C/EBPepsilon(27)-GATA-1 protein-protein interaction and C/EBPepsilon(27) binding to a C/EBP site in the MBP1 promoter. The C/EBPepsilon(27) isoform may serve to titrate and/or turn off eosinophil granule protein genes like MBP1 during eosinophil differentiation, as these genes are ultimately silenced in the mature cell. Understanding the functionality of C/EBPepsilon(27) in eosinophil development may prove promising in developing therapeutics that reduce eosinophil proliferation in allergic diseases.",,"['Stankiewicz, Monika J', 'Du, Jian', 'Martinico, Dominick', 'Ackerman, Steven J']","['Stankiewicz MJ', 'Du J', 'Martinico D', 'Ackerman SJ']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, College of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL 60607, USA.', 'UW Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI 53705, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, College of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL 60607, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, College of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL 60607, USA.', 'College of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL 60607, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, College of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL 60607, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211124,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,,2021/12/11 06:00,2021/12/18 06:00,['2021/12/10 01:03'],"['2021/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/18 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/10 01:03 [entrez]', '2021/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms222312689 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms222312689 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Nov 24;22(23). pii: ijms222312689. doi: 10.3390/ijms222312689.,,"['T32 DK07739/National Institute of Health', 'R01 AI33043/National Institute of Health', 'Craig Fellowship/University of Illinois at Chicago']",PMC8657826,['NOTNLM'],"['CCAAT/enhancer binding protein', 'HIV-tat', 'eosinophil', 'granulocyte', 'repressor domain', 'sumoylation', 'terminal differentiation', 'transcription factor']",20211217,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Myelin Basic Protein)', '142805-41-2 (CEBPE protein, human)']",,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Eosinophils/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Myelin Basic Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', '*Sumoylation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we comparatively evaluated the single and combined application of the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib and the selective PI3Kgamma inhibitor AS-605240 in the canine DLBCL cell line CLBL-1. For further comparison, key findings were additionally analyzed in canine B-cell leukemia GL-1 and human DLBCL cell line SU-DHL-4. While ibrutinib alone induced significant anti-proliferative effects on all cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, AS-605240 only induced anti-proliferative effects at high concentrations. Interestingly, ibrutinib and AS-605240 acted synergistically, reducing cell proliferation and increasing apoptosis/necrosis in all cell lines and inducing morphological changes in CLBL-1. Moreover, the combined application of ibrutinib and AS-605240 reduced relative phosphorylation and, in some instances, the levels of the BTK, AKT, GSK3beta, and ERK proteins. Comparative variant analysis of RNA-seq data among canine B- and T-lymphoid cell lines and primary B-cell lymphoma samples revealed potentially high-impact somatic variants in the genes that encode PI3K, which may explain why AS-605240 does not singly inhibit the proliferation of cell lines.

In this study, NAC itself was found to induce extensive ROS production in human leukemia HL-60 and U937 cells. The cytotoxicity depends on ROS-modulating enzyme expression. In HL-60 cells, NAC activated NOX2 to produce superoxide (O2*(-)). Its subsequent conversion into H2O2 by superoxide dismutase 1 and 3 (SOD1, SOD3) and production of ClO(-) from H2O2 by myeloperoxidase (MPO) was necessary for cell death induction. While the addition of extracellular SOD potentiated NAC-induced cell death, extracellular catalase (CAT) prevented cell death in HL-60 cells. The MPO inhibitor partially reduced the number of dying HL-60 cells. In U937 cells, the weak cytotoxicity of NAC is probably caused by lower expression of NOX2, SOD1, SOD3, and by the absence of MOP expression. However, even here, the addition of extracellular SOD induced cell death in U937 cells, and this effect could be reversed by extracellular CAT. NAC-induced cell death exhibited predominantly apoptotic features in both cell lines. Conclusions: NAC itself can induce extensive production of O2*(-) in HL-60 and U937 cell lines. The fate of the cells then depends on the expression of enzymes that control the formation and conversion of ROS: NOX, SOD, and MPO. The mode of cell death in response to NAC treatment bears apoptotic and apoptotic-like features in both cell lines.",,"['Mlejnek, Petr', 'Dolezel, Petr', 'Kriegova, Eva', 'Pastvova, Nikola']","['Mlejnek P', 'Dolezel P', 'Kriegova E', 'Pastvova N']","['Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc, Hnevotinska 3, 77715 Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc, Hnevotinska 3, 77715 Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc, Hnevotinska 3, 77715 Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc, Hnevotinska 3, 77715 Olomouc, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211123,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,,2021/12/11 06:00,2021/12/24 06:00,['2021/12/10 01:03'],"['2021/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/18 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/10 01:03 [entrez]', '2021/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/24 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms222312635 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms222312635 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Nov 23;22(23). pii: ijms222312635. doi: 10.3390/ijms222312635.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-8253-1248', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8969-4197']","['IGA_LF 2021_006/Palacky University, Olomouc']",PMC8657769,['NOTNLM'],"['HL-60 cells', 'MPO', 'N-acetylcysteine', 'NOX', 'SOD', 'U937 cells', 'oxidative stress']",20211222,"['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (MPO protein, human)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (CYBB protein, human)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidase 2)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",,"['Acetylcysteine/*pharmacology', 'Catalase/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'NADPH Oxidase 2/*genetics', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Peroxidase/*genetics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Superoxide Dismutase/*genetics', 'U937 Cells']",,,,,,,,,,

However, these drugs do not induce leukemic stem cells death and their persistence may generate a disease relapse. Published reports indicated that Venetoclax, a selective BCL2 inhibitor, could be effective in Ph+ diseases, as BCL2 anti-apoptotic activity is modulated by BCR-ABL1 kinase. We, therefore, investigated if BCL2 inhibition, alone or combined with Nilotinib, a BCR-ABL1 inhibitor, affects the primitive and committed Ph+ cells survival. METHODS: We used Ph+ cells isolated from leukemic patients at diagnosis. To estimate the therapeutic efficacy of BCL2 and BCR-ABL1 inhibition we employed long-term culture, proliferation and apoptosis assay. Immunoblot was used to evaluate the ability of treatment to interfere with the down-stream targets of BCR-ABL1. RESULTS: Blocking BCL2, we observed reduced proliferation and clonogenic potential of CML CD34-positive cells and this cytotoxicity was improved by combination with BCR-ABL1 inhibitor. However, BCL2 inhibition, alone or in combination regiment with BCR-ABL1 inhibitor, did not reduce the self-renewal of primitive leukemic cells, while strongly induced cell death on primary Ph+ Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that primitive CML leukemic cells are not dependent on BCL2 for their persistence and support that committed CML and Ph + ALL cells are dependent by BCL2 and BCR-ABL1 cooperation for their survival. The antileukemic activity of BCL2 and BCR-ABL1 dual targeting may be a useful therapeutic strategy for Ph+ ALL patients.",,"['Massimino, Michele', 'Vigneri, Paolo', 'Stella, Stefania', 'Tirro, Elena', 'Pennisi, Maria Stella', 'Parrinello, Laura Nunziatina', 'Vetro, Calogero', 'Manzella, Livia', 'Stagno, Fabio', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco']","['Massimino M', 'Vigneri P', 'Stella S', 'Tirro E', 'Pennisi MS', 'Parrinello LN', 'Vetro C', 'Manzella L', 'Stagno F', 'Di Raimondo F']","['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catania, 95124 Catania, Italy.', 'Center of Experimental Oncology and Hematology, A.O.U.

The newly described VEXAS, associated with somatic UBA1 mutations, exhibits an overlap of clinical and/or biological pictures with auto inflammatory signs and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). OBJECTIVES: To describe a cohort of patients with signs of undifferentiated systemic autoinflammatory disorder (USAID) concordant with AOSD and MDS/chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and the prevalence of VEXAS proposed management and outcome. METHODS: A French multicenter retrospective study from the MINHEMON study group also used for other published works with the support of multidisciplinary and complementary networks of physicians and a control group of 104 MDS/CMML. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were included with a median age at first signs of USAID of 70.5 years with male predominance (4:1). Five patients met the criteria for confirmed AOSD. The most frequent subtypes were MDS with a blast excess (31%) and MDS with multilineage dysplasia (18%). Seven patients presented with acute myeloid leukemia and twelve died during a median follow-up of 2.5 years. Six out of 18 tested patients displayed a somatic UBA1 mutation concordant with VEXAS, including one woman. High-dose corticosteroids led to a response in 13/16 cases and targeted biological therapy alone or in association in 10/12 patients (anakinra, tocilizumab, and infliximab). Azacytidine resulted in complete or partial response in systemic symptoms for 10/12 (83%) patients including 3 VEXAS. CONCLUSIONS: Systemic form of VEXAS syndrome can mimic AOSD. The suspicion of USAID or AOSD in older males with atypia should prompt an evaluation of underlying MDS and assessment of somatic UBA1 mutation.",,"['Delplanque, Marion', 'Aouba, Achille', 'Hirsch, Pierre', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Graveleau, Julie', 'Malard, Florent', 'Roos-Weil, Damien', 'Belfeki, Nabil', 'Drevon, Louis', 'Oganesyan, Artem', 'Groh, Matthieu', 'Mahevas, Matthieu', 'Razanamahery, Jerome', 'Maigne, Gwenola', 'Decamp, Matthieu', 'Miranda, Sebastien', 'Quemeneur, Thomas', 'Rossignol, Julien', 'Sailler, Laurent', 'Sebert, Marie', 'Terriou, Louis', 'Sevoyan, Anna', 'Hakobyan, Yervand', 'Georgin-Lavialle, Sophie', 'Mekinian, Arsene']","['Delplanque M', 'Aouba A', 'Hirsch P', 'Fenaux P', 'Graveleau J', 'Malard F', 'Roos-Weil D', 'Belfeki N', 'Drevon L', 'Oganesyan A', 'Groh M', 'Mahevas M', 'Razanamahery J', 'Maigne G', 'Decamp M', 'Miranda S', 'Quemeneur T', 'Rossignol J', 'Sailler L', 'Sebert M', 'Terriou L', 'Sevoyan A', 'Hakobyan Y', 'Georgin-Lavialle S', 'Mekinian A']","['Service de Medecine Interne, Centre de Reference des Maladies Autoinflammatoires et des Amyloses (CEREMAIA), AP-HP, Hopital Tenon, Sorbonne Universite, 75020 Paris, France.', 'Service de Medecine Interne, CHU de Caen, Hopital de la Cote de Nacre, 14033 Caen, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Biologique, INSERM, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine, AP-HP, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Sorbonne Universite, 75012 Paris, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Seniors, AP-HP, Hopital Saint-Louis, 75010 Paris, France."", 'Service de Medecine Interne, Centre Hospitalier Georges Charpak, 44600 Saint Nazaire, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Biologique, INSERM, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine, AP-HP, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Sorbonne Universite, 75012 Paris, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie, AP-HP, Hopital Pitie Salpetriere, 75013 Paris, France."", 'Service de Medecine Interne, Centre Hospitalier Marc Jacquet, 77000 Melun, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Biologique, INSERM, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine, AP-HP, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Sorbonne Universite, 75012 Paris, France."", 'Department of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, National Institute of Health, Yerevan 0051, Armenia.', 'Service de Medecine Interne, Hopital Foch, 92150 Suresnes, France.', 'Service de Medecine Interne, CHU Hopital Henri Mondor, 94000 Creteil, France.', 'Service de Medecine Interne, CHRU Jean Minjoz, 25000 Besancon, France.', 'Service de Medecine Interne, CHU de Caen, Hopital de la Cote de Nacre, 14033 Caen, France.', 'Laboratoire de Genetique CHU de Caen, Hopital de la Cote de Nacre, 14000 Care, France.', 'Service de Medecine Interne, CHU Hopital Charles Nicolle, 76000 Rouen, France.', 'Service de Medecine Interne, CH de Valenciennes, 59300 Valenciennes, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Adultes, AP-HP, Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, 75015 Paris, France."", 'Service de Medecine Interne, CHU Hopital Purpan, 31059 Toulouse, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Seniors, AP-HP, Hopital Saint-Louis, 75010 Paris, France."", 'Service de Medecine Interne, CHR Lille, Sorbonne Universite, 75005 Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, National Institute of Health, Yerevan 0051, Armenia.', 'Department of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, National Institute of Health, Yerevan 0051, Armenia.', 'Service de Medecine Interne, Centre de Reference des Maladies Autoinflammatoires et des Amyloses (CEREMAIA), AP-HP, Hopital Tenon, Sorbonne Universite, 75020 Paris, France.', 'Service de Medecine Interne, AP-HP, Hopital Saint Antoine, Sorbonne Universite, 75012 Paris, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211127,Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,,,2021/12/11 06:00,2021/12/11 06:01,['2021/12/10 01:02'],"['2021/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/17 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/10 01:02 [entrez]', '2021/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/11 06:01 [medline]']","['jcm10235586 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm10235586 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Med. 2021 Nov 27;10(23). pii: jcm10235586. doi: 10.3390/jcm10235586.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-1039-4835'],,PMC8658409,['NOTNLM'],"['SAID', 'USAID', 'VEXAS', ""adult-onset Still's disease"", 'azacytidine', 'myelodysplastic syndrome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Instead, since the association between PJP and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is not clearly defined, the role of prophylaxis in patients with AML is not yet established. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 251 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed non-M3-AML, admitted at the Hematology Unit of University Tor Vergata in Rome, during the period 2010-2020. The aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence of PJP among AML patients during their first hospital admission, and to identify subjects at a high risk to develop PJP. RESULTS: Among 251 consecutive patients with non-M3-AML, 67 bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) were performed. PJP was proven in 11/67 (16.7%) subjects undergoing BAL (11 males, median age 71 years), with an incidence of 4.3%. The most common reason for BAL execution were radiological findings such as ground-glass opacities (6/11, 55%) and atypical patterns like consolidations and nodules (5/11, 45%). One patient died because of PJP after 11 days of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole therapy. In multivariate analysis older age and smoking habit were independent factors significantly associated with PJP (p = .021 and 0.017 respectively). CONCLUSION: We conclude that PJP infection is not uncommon among patients with AML. If intensive chemotherapy is planned, physicians should be aware of this risk and prophylaxis should be considered, particularly in older patients.",['(c) 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.'],"['Paterno, Giovangiacinto', 'Guarnera, Luca', 'Palmieri, Raffaele', 'Del Prete, Valentina', 'Bonanni, Fabrizio', 'Buzzatti, Elisa', 'Moretti, Federico', 'Casciani, Paola', 'Savi, Arianna', 'Di Cave, David', 'Maurillo, Luca', 'Buccisano, Francesco', 'Venditti, Adriano', 'Del Principe, Maria Ilaria']","['Paterno G', 'Guarnera L', 'Palmieri R', 'Del Prete V', 'Bonanni F', 'Buzzatti E', 'Moretti F', 'Casciani P', 'Savi A', 'Di Cave D', 'Maurillo L', 'Buccisano F', 'Venditti A', 'Del Principe MI']","['Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Onco-Hematology, Policlinico Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Onco-Hematology, Policlinico Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences and Translational Medicine, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Onco-Hematology, Policlinico Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Onco-Hematology, Policlinico Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Onco-Hematology, Policlinico Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Onco-Hematology, Policlinico Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences and Translational Medicine, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Onco-Hematology, Policlinico Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Onco-Hematology, Policlinico Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Onco-Hematology, Policlinico Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Onco-Hematology, Policlinico Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211209,Germany,Mycoses,Mycoses,8805008,IM,,2021/12/10 06:00,2021/12/10 06:00,['2021/12/09 20:31'],"['2021/11/25 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/10 06:00 [medline]', '2021/12/09 20:31 [entrez]']",['10.1111/myc.13411 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Mycoses. 2021 Dec 9. doi: 10.1111/myc.13411.,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8944-0795'],,,['NOTNLM'],"['Pnemocystis jirovecii', 'Pnemocystis jirovecii pneumonia', 'acute myeloid leukaemia', 'bronchoalveolar lavage', 'high-resolution computed tomography']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This randomized phase III study aimed to evaluate whether CLO added to induction and consolidation would improve outcome in adults with newly diagnosed ALL. Treatment for younger (18-40 years) patients consisted of a pediatric inspired protocol and for older patients (41-70 years) of a semi-intensive protocol was used. 340 patients were randomized. After a median follow up of 70 months, 5-year EFS was 50% and 53% for arm A and B (CLO arm). For patients </=40 years, EFS was 58% vs 65% in arm A vs B, while in patients >40 years EFS was 43% in both arms. CR rate was 89% in both arms and similar in younger and older patients. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was assessed in 200 patients (60%). Fifty-four of 76 evaluable patients (71%) were MRD negative after consolidation 1 in arm A vs 75/81 (93%) in arm B (p=0.001). Seventy (42%) patients proceeded to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in both arms. Five years OS was similar in both arms, 60% vs 61%. Among patients achieving CR, relapse rates were 28% and 24%, and non-relapse mortality was 16% vs 17% after CR. CLO treated patients experienced more serious adverse events, more infections, and more often went off-protocol. This was most pronounced in older patients.

It has affected more than 20 million people so far, and since there are no registered treatments against it yet, urgent treatment solutions are needed. One of the most promising drug targets to fight this virus is the protease enzyme of the virus's protein machinery. In this study, by utilizing a computational method called Unaggregated Unbiased Molecular Dynamics (UUMD), we reconstructed the binding pathway of a HTLV-1 protease inhibitor, Indinavir, to find the details of the binding pathway, the influential residues, and also the stable states of the binding pathway. We achieved the native conformation of the inhibitor in 6 rounds, 360 replicas by performing over 4 micro-seconds of UMD simulations. We found 3 Intermediate states between the solvated state and the native conformation state in the binding pathway. We also discovered that aromatic residues such as Trp98 and Trp98', catalytic residues Asp32 and Asp32', and the flap region's residues have the most influential roles in the binding pathway and also have the most contribution to the total interaction energies. We believe that the details found in this study would be a great guide for developing new treatment solutions against the HTLV-1 virus by inhibiting the HTLV-1 protease.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, effective vaccines or drugs have not been developed to prevent and control the transmission of ALV-J so far. CD81, a member of the tetraspanins superfamily, plays important roles in regulating membrane proteins, facilitating cells adhesion or fusion, and also participates in viral infection. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether antibodies against certain tetraspanins affect infection of ALV-J. Here, we showed that anti-CD81 antibody could inhibit viral RNA and protein level. We also found that anti-CD81 antibody interacts with viral protein p27, p32 and gp37.

Mel1/Prdm16 is not only a causative gene of leukemia, but also has multiple regulatory functions, such as the regulation of fat metabolism. To investigate the function of Mel1/Prdm16, we generated Mel1/Prdm16-deficient mice, but homozygous deficiency (Mel1/Prdm16(-/-)) was embryonic lethal at E 11.5. Heterozygous mice showed abnormal cartilage and bone formation in the postnatal skull and long bones, suggesting that Mel1/Prdm16 expression plays an important role in bone development. In osteoblast and chondrocyte cell lines, Mel1/Prdm16 promotes the differentiation of chondrocytes and regulates the differentiation of osteoblasts. Transient repression of the master regulator Runx2 is required for chondrocyte differentiation at an early stage of differentiation. However, in Mel1/Prdm16-suppressed ATDC5 cells, the initial suppression of Runx2 was lacking and its expression was upregulated at the beginning of differentiation, suggesting that chondrogenic differentiation is suppressed in Mel1/Prdm16(+/-) mesenchymal progenitor cells because Runx2 expression is upregulated during the early stage of differentiation. Thus, the Mel1/Prdm16 gene may be involved in the early repression of Runx2 expression during osteochondral differentiation and promote chondrogenic differentiation.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The US Food and Drug Administration registration for tisagenlecleucel was based on a complete response (CR) rate of 81%, 12-month overall survival (OS) of 76%, and event-free survival (EFS) of 50%. We report clinical outcomes and analyze covariates of outcomes after commercial tisagenlecleucel. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, multi-institutional study of CAYA with RR B-ALL across 15 US institutions, who underwent leukapheresis shipment to Novartis for commercial tisagenlecleucel. A total of 200 patients were included in an intent-to-treat response analysis, and 185 infused patients were analyzed for survival and toxicity. RESULTS: Intent-to-treat analysis demonstrates a 79% morphologic CR rate (95% CI, 72 to 84). The infused cohort had an 85% CR (95% CI, 79 to 89) and 12-month OS of 72% and EFS of 50%, with 335 days of median follow-up. Notably, 48% of patients had low-disease burden (< 5% bone marrow lymphoblasts, no CNS3, or other extramedullary disease), or undetectable disease, pretisagenlecleucel. Univariate and multivariate analyses associate high-disease burden (HB, >/= 5% bone marrow lymphoblasts, CNS3, or non-CNS extramedullary) with inferior outcomes, with a 12-month OS of 58% and EFS of 31% compared with low-disease burden (OS; 85%, EFS; 70%) and undetectable disease (OS; 95%, EFS; 72%; P < .0001 for OS and EFS). Grade >/= 3 cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity rates were 21% and 7% overall and 35% and 9% in patients with HB, respectively.

This study explored the prevalence of medical complications (aligned with OP-35 measure specifications from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services [CMS] Hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting Program) and the potential impact of psychosocial factors on unplanned acute care utilization. METHODS: This study included 933 unique patients admitted to three acute care inpatient facilities within a nonprofit community-based health care system in southern California from 2012 to 2017. Integrated comprehensive data elements from electronic medical records and facility oncology registries were leveraged for univariate statistics, predictive models constructed using multivariable logistic regression, and further exploratory data mining, with predictive accuracy of the models measured with c-statistics. RESULTS: The mean age of study participants was 65 years, and 55.1% were male. Specific diagnoses were lymphoma (48.7%), leukemia (35.2%), myeloma (14.0%), and mixed types (2.1%). Approximately one fifth of patients received unplanned acute care services within 30 days postdischarge, and over half of these patients presented with one or more symptoms associated with the CMS medical complication measure. The predictive models, with c-statistics ranging from 0.7 and above for each type of hematologic malignancy, indicated good predictive qualities with the impact of psychosocial functioning on the use of acute care services (P values < .05), including lack of consult for social work during initial admission (lymphoma or myeloma), history of counseling or use of psychotropic medications (lymphoma), and past substance use (myeloma). CONCLUSION: This study provides insights into patient-related factors that may inform a proactive approach to improve health outcomes, such as enhanced care transition, monitoring, and support interventions.",,"['Zu, Kai', 'Greenwood, Kristina L', 'LaMori, Joyce C', 'Smith, Besa', 'Smith, Tyler', 'Lee, Alaina']","['Zu K', 'Greenwood KL', 'LaMori JC', 'Smith B', 'Smith T', 'Lee A']","['Sharp HealthCare, San Diego, CA.', 'Sharp HealthCare, San Diego, CA.', 'Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC, Titusville, NJ.', 'Analydata, San Diego, CA.', 'Analydata, San Diego, CA.', 'Sharp HealthCare, San Diego, CA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,JCO Clin Cancer Inform,JCO clinical cancer informatics,101708809,IM,"['Joyce C.

Through physical interaction or modification of diverse protein clients, PML-NBs regulate a multitude of - often antithetical- biological processes such as antiviral and stress response, inhibition of cell proliferation and autophagy, and promotion of apoptosis or senescence. Although PML was originally recognized as a tumor-suppressive factor, more recent studies revealed a ""double faced"" agent role for PML. Indeed PML displayed tumor cell pro-survival and pro-migratory functions via inhibition of migration suppressing molecules or promotion of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) mediated Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) that may promote cancer cell dissemination. In this line, PML was found to correlate with poor patient prognosis in distinct tumor contexts. Furthermore in the last decade, a number of publications have implicated PML in the physiology of normal or cancer stem cells (CSCs). Promyelocytic leukemia protein is activating fatty acid oxidation (FAO), a metabolic mechanism required for the asymmetric divisions and maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). In embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), PML is required for maintenance of the naive and acquisition of the induced pluripotency state respectively. Correspondingly, PML ablation causes significant morphological, gene expression and lineage choice changes. In this review, we focus on the mechanisms orchestrated by PML and PML-NBs in cancer and healthy stem cells from cell physiology to the regulation of chromatin dynamics.",,"['Vogiatzoglou, Amalia P', 'Moretto, Fabien', 'Makkou, Maria', 'Papamatheakis, Joseph', 'Kretsovali, Androniki']","['Vogiatzoglou AP', 'Moretto F', 'Makkou M', 'Papamatheakis J', 'Kretsovali A']","['Department of Biology, University of Crete, Heraklion Crete, Greece.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (IMBB), Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas (FORTH), Heraklion Crete, Greece', 'Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (IMBB), Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas (FORTH), Heraklion Crete, Greece', 'Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (IMBB), Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas (FORTH), Heraklion Crete, Greece', 'Department of Biology, University of Crete, Heraklion Crete, Greece.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (IMBB), Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas (FORTH), Heraklion Crete, Greece', 'Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (IMBB), Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas (FORTH), Heraklion Crete, Greece']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211026,Spain,Int J Dev Biol,The International journal of developmental biology,8917470,IM,,2021/12/10 06:00,2021/12/10 06:00,['2021/12/09 08:41'],"['2021/12/09 08:41 [entrez]', '2021/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['210154av [pii]', '10.1387/ijdb.210154av [doi]']",aheadofprint,Int J Dev Biol. 2021 Oct 26. pii: 210154av. doi: 10.1387/ijdb.210154av.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study explored the anti-AML activity of matrine (a natural-derived alkaloid), as well as the internal molecular mechanism. In vitro, cell viability, apoptosis, and productions of inflammatory cytokines including IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha were tested by MTT, Annexin V-FITC/PI staining, and ELISA, respectively. The expression levels of LINC01116 and miR-592 were measured by qRT-PCR. Bcl-2 and PCNA expression, and JAK/STAT3 pathway activity were evaluated by western blotting. Besides, an AML mouse xenograft model was established to further analyze the anti-AML activity of matrine. We found that matrine suppressed cell proliferation and levels of inflammatory factors, induced cell apoptosis, reduced LINC01116 expression, and raised miR-592 expression in AML cells. LINC01116 directly bound to miR-592 and downregulated its expression. Both LINC01116 overexpression and miR-592 knockdown attenuated the effects of matrine on AML cells. Moreover, miR-592 overexpression reversed the influences of LINC01116 overexpression on matrine-treated AML cells. Matrine inactivated the JAK/STAT3 pathway in AML cells via modulating LINC01116/miR-592. Additionally, matrine inhibited tumor growth via modulating LINC01116/miR-592 in vivo. To sum up, matrine exhibited the anti-AML activity through regulating the LINC01116/miR-592 axis, thereby inactivating the JAK/STAT3 pathway.",,"['Zhang, Ping-Ping', 'Zhang, Feng', 'Zhu, Kai', 'Zhu, Jun-Feng', 'Yuan, Yuan', 'Yang, Yan-Li', 'Liu, Lin', 'Wang, Meng', 'Li, Jia-Jia']","['Zhang PP', 'Zhang F', 'Zhu K', 'Zhu JF', 'Yuan Y', 'Yang YL', 'Liu L', 'Wang M', 'Li JJ']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211206,Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,IM,,2021/12/10 06:00,2021/12/10 06:00,['2021/12/09 08:35'],"['2021/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/09 08:35 [entrez]', '2021/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.4149/neo_210802N1083 [doi]', '210802N1083 [pii]']",aheadofprint,Neoplasma. 2021 Dec 6. pii: 210802N1083. doi: 10.4149/neo_210802N1083.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While they are considered as disease in elder ages, a remarkable increasing incidence is also observed in German children and juveniles. The higher rates are interpreted by the changes in classification because diseases such as chronic lymphocytic leukaemia were also identified as NHL. Considerable rates of NHL were found in nuclear workers and liquidators of Chernobyl, i.e. in cases of low-dose chronical exposures. In Germany, we noticed three workers who developed NHL after decontamination of nuclear facilities. The bone marrow is generally considered as target organ for ionizing radiation, but NHL is obviously induced in the whole pool of lymphocytes. Therefore, the dosimetry in cases of typical occupational external and internal exposure must be revised. A high radiation sensitivity for NHL is a possible suspect and likely reason which may partly explain the continuous rise of the diseases in populations underlying the current increases of medical diagnostic exposure. NHL is also induced in children and juveniles with a history of diagnostic X-rays.",['(c) 2021.

In this work, we analyzed differences in the immune bone marrow (BM) microenvironment in SMM to better understand the role of immune surveillance in disease progression and to identify immune biomarkers associated to higher risk of progression. Methods: Gene expression analysis of BM cells from 28 patients with SMM, 22 patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and 22 patients with symptomatic MM was performed by using Nanostring Technology. Results: BM cells in SMM compared to both MGUS and symptomatic MM showed upregulation of genes encoding for key molecules in cytotoxicity. However, some of these cytotoxic molecules positively correlated with inhibitory immune checkpoints, which may impair the effector function of BM cytotoxic cells. Analysis of 28 patients with SMM revealed 4 distinct clusters based on immune composition and activation markers. Patients in cluster 2 showed a significant increase in expression of cytotoxic molecules but also inhibitory immune checkpoints compared to cluster 3, suggesting the presence of cytotoxic cells with an exhausted phenotype. Accordingly, patients in cluster 3 had a significantly longer progression free survival. Finally, individual gene expression analysis showed that higher expression of TNF superfamily members (TNF, TNFAIP3, TNFRSF14) was associated with shorter progression free survival. Conclusions: Our results suggest that exhausted cytotoxic cells are associated to high-risk patients with SMM. Biomarkers overexpressed in patients with this immune gene profile in combination with clinical parameters and PC characterization may be useful to identify SMM patients with higher risk of progression.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Isola, Braso-Maristany, Moreno, Mena, Oliver-Calders, Pare,', 'Rodriguez-Lobato, Martin-Antonio, Cibeira, Blade, Rosinol, Prat, Lozano and', 'Fernandez de Larrea.']","['Isola, Ignacio', 'Braso-Maristany, Fara', 'Moreno, David F', 'Mena, Mari-Pau', 'Oliver-Calders, Aina', 'Pare, Laia', 'Rodriguez-Lobato, Luis Gerardo', 'Martin-Antonio, Beatriz', 'Cibeira, Maria Teresa', 'Blade, Joan', 'Rosinol, Laura', 'Prat, Aleix', 'Lozano, Ester', 'Fernandez de Larrea, Carlos']","['Isola I', 'Braso-Maristany F', 'Moreno DF', 'Mena MP', 'Oliver-Calders A', 'Pare L', 'Rodriguez-Lobato LG', 'Martin-Antonio B', 'Cibeira MT', 'Blade J', 'Rosinol L', 'Prat A', 'Lozano E', 'Fernandez de Larrea C']","[""Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Department of Medical Oncology, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", ""Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Department of Medical Oncology, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", ""Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Department of Medical Oncology, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain."", ""Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Department of Cell Biology, Physiology and Immunology, Faculty of Biology, University of Barcelona, and Institute of Biomedicine of the University of Barcelona (IBUB), Barcelona, Spain.', ""Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Experimental and Clinical Hematology Program (PHEC), Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211122,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",2021/12/10 06:00,2021/12/10 06:00,['2021/12/09 07:00'],"['2021/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/09 07:00 [entrez]', '2021/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2021.792609 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2021 Nov 22;12:792609. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.792609. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8646031,['NOTNLM'],"['TIGIT', 'bone marrow microenvironment', 'immune checkpoints', 'immunotherapy', 'pronostic factors', 'smoldering multiple myeloma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the evolutionary principles imparted by genetic intratumour heterogeneity are becoming increasingly clear(1), little is known about the non-genetic mechanisms that contribute to intratumour heterogeneity and malignant clonal fitness(2). Here, using single-cell profiling and lineage tracing (SPLINTR)-an expressed barcoding strategy-we trace isogenic clones in three clinically relevant mouse models of acute myeloid leukaemia. We find that malignant clonal dominance is a cell-intrinsic and heritable property that is facilitated by the repression of antigen presentation and increased expression of the secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor gene (Slpi), which we genetically validate as a regulator of acute myeloid leukaemia. Increased transcriptional heterogeneity is a feature that enables clonal fitness in diverse tissues and immune microenvironments and in the context of clonal competition between genetically distinct clones. Similar to haematopoietic stem cells(3), leukaemia stem cells (LSCs) display heritable clone-intrinsic properties of high, and low clonal output that contribute to the overall tumour mass. We demonstrate that LSC clonal output dictates sensitivity to chemotherapy and, although high- and low-output clones adapt differently to therapeutic pressure, they coordinately emerge from minimal residual disease with increased expression of the LSC program. Together, these data provide fundamental insights into the non-genetic transcriptional processes that underpin malignant clonal fitness and may inform future therapeutic strategies.","['(c) 2021.

To characterize the incidence and risk factors of death from peptic ulcer among cancer patients, we extracted the data of cancer patients registered in the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program from 1975 to 2016. Out of the 8,471,051 patients extracted from SEER, 4,698 died from peptic ulcer, with a mortality rate of 9.08/100,000 person-years. Meanwhile, the mortality rate in the general population was 5.09/100,000 person-years, giving a standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of 1.78 (95% confidence interval, 1.73-1.84). Patients who are female, of other race, unmarried, and with distant tumor stage have greater SMRs. A higher SMR was associated with a younger age at diagnosis. Among those aged < 40 years at diagnosis, the plurality of fatal peptic ulcers occurred in patients with leukemia and lymphoma, while in patients aged > 40 years, the majority occurred in those with prostate, breast, colorectum, and lung cancer. Patients with upper digestive system malignancies had the highest SMRs and hazard ratios (HRs), which could be ascribed to radiotherapy-induced damage to the gastroduodenum. The risk declined rapidly one year after diagnosis. However, the SMRs in the upper digestive system cancer survivors increased significantly over ten years after diagnosis. Upper digestive system cancers adjacent to the gastroduodenum were associated with higher SMRs and HRs compared with other types of cancer, possibly contributing partially to the damage caused by radiotherapy on the radiosensitive gastroduodenum.",['(c) 2021.

Methods: We obtained data on the incidence of hematologic malignancies using the Korean Statistical Information Service (KOSIS). For each hematologic malignancy, the number of cases, crude incidence rate, and age-standardized incidence rate were calculated, and the statistical trends were confirmed by Poisson regression and Joinpoint regression analysis. Results: All the investigated hematologic malignancies showed a statistically significant increase in incidence over 20 years. The 20-year trend of the age-standardized incidence rate was as follows: non-Hodgkin lymphoma [average annual percent change (AAPC)=2.26%, P-trend <0.05], leukemia (AAPC=0.94%, P-trend <0.05), myeloid leukemia (AAPC=1.44%, P-trend <0.05), multiple myeloma (AAPC=3.05%, P-trend <0.05), myeloproliferative disorders (AAPC=9.87%, P-trend <0.05), myelodysplastic syndrome (AAPC=7.59%, P-trend <0.05), malignant immunoproliferative diseases (AAPC=11.82%, P-trend <0.05), lymphoid leukemia (AAPC=2.21%, P-trend <0.05), and Hodgkin lymphoma (AAPC=4.04%, P<0.05). Conclusion: It was confirmed that the incidence of hematologic malignancies has increased significantly in the ROK over the past 20 years.

We report our experience with the Cancer and Leukemia Group B1002 (CALGB 1002) protocol. Methods: The files of adult patients diagnosed with Burkitt lymphoma and treated with the CALGB 1002 protocol at King Hussein Cancer Center between 2008 and 2017 were reviewed. Baseline demographics, clinical laboratory features, treatment details, and responses were collected. The correlations between clinical and laboratory variables with event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were determined by univariate and multivariate analyses using backward stepwise Cox regression models. EFS and OS were plotted using KaplanMeier curves. Results: This study included 19 patients with a median age of 33 years (range, 1965). Eleven (58%) and two (10.5%) patients had advanced-stage and central nervous system disease, respectively. Among 106 administered cycles, the median interval between cycles was 23 days (range, 1984 days). Sixteen patients (84%) achieved a complete response. After a median follow-up of 40.8 months, the 3-year EFS and OS rates were 78.95%. Patients with a low-risk International Prognostic Index (IPI) had better survival than those with intermediate-or high-risk IPI. Grade IIIIV hematological toxicities occurred in 88% of patients, while 73% had grade IIIIV mucositis. Conclusion: In adult Burkitt lymphoma, the CALGB 1002 protocol provides high cure rates and can be administered promptly, but is associated with significant toxicity.

We have previously shown that cAMP-activating factors present in the bone marrow render ALL cells less sensitive to DNA damage-induced apoptosis, by enhancing autophagy and suppressing p53. To sensitize ALL cells to DNA-damaging therapy, we have searched for novel targets that may counteract the effects induced by cAMP signaling. In the current study, we have identified PARP1 as a potential target. We show that the PARP1 inhibitors olaparib or PJ34 inhibit cAMP-mediated autophagy and thereby potentiate the DNA-damaging treatment. Furthermore, we reveal that cAMP-mediated PARP1 activation is preceded by induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and results in depletion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), both of which are autophagy-promoting events. Accordingly, we demonstrate that scavenging ROS by N-acetylcysteine and repleting NAD independently reduce DNA damage-induced autophagy. In addition, olaparib augmented the effect of DNA-damaging treatment in a human xenograft model of ALL in NOD-scidIL2Rgamma(null) mice. On the basis of the current findings, we suggest that PARP1 inhibitors may enhance the efficiency of conventional genotoxic therapies and thereby provide a novel treatment strategy for pediatric patients with ALL.

The majority of screen panels of FC still rely on finding monoclonal B-cells, e.g., B-cells with immunoglobin (Ig) light-chain restriction, which has many limitations. Therefore, exploring new markers is warranted. METHODS: A total of 52 cases of B-NHL with BM involvement were collected. The median age was 60 years. Out of these 52 cases, 34 were male, and 18 were female. A 10-color FC panel was used to detect the expression of CD54 on lymphoma cells. The expression of CD54 was calculated as the mean fluorescence index ratio (MFIR) and was described as the mean +/- standard error of the mean (SEM). RESULTS: Up to 18/52 (34.62%) of BM specimens abnormally expressed an increased level of CD54, including 1/10 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), 9/13 cases of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), 2/14 cases of follicular lymphoma (FL), 5/9 cases of marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), and 1/3 cases of high-grade B-NHL (HG B-NHL). The expression level of CD54 was significantly increased in MCL cases (53.41 +/- 11.04) compared with CLL/SLL cases (11.66 +/- 2.79) and FL cases (13.49 +/- 2.81). The lowest percentage of CD54-positive B-cells attained 0.13%. In 5/9 cases of MZL and 1/3 cases of HG B-NHL, increased expression of CD54 was the only abnormal immunophenotype detected besides Ig light-chain restriction. No aberrant CD54 expression was identified by FC in lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) (0/2) and Burkitt lymphoma (BL) (0/1) cases. Aberrant expression of CD54 was not related to plasma cell differentiation. CONCLUSION: Lymphoma cells, especially in MCL and MZL cases, frequently show increased expression of CD54. Such aberrant expression is not related to plasma cell differentiation. We highly recommend adding CD54 to the FC screening panel to detect BM involvement in patients with B-NHL.",['(c) 2021.

Treatment consists of induction and consolidation chemotherapy to remit the cancer followed by potentially curative haematopoietic cell transplantation. These intense treatments are debilitating and increase the risk of mortality. Patient stratification is used to mitigate this risk and considers a variety of factors, including body mass, to determine whether a patient is suitable for any or all treatment options. Skeletal muscle mass, the primary constituent of the body lean mass, may be a better predictor of patient suitability for, and outcomes of, AML treatment. Yet skeletal muscle is compromised by a variety of factors associated with AML and its clinical treatment consistent with cachexia, a life-threatening body wasting syndrome. Cachectic muscle wasting is associated with both cancer and anticancer chemotherapy. Although not traditionally associated with haematological cancers, cachexia is observed in AML and can have dire consequences. In this review, we discuss the importance of addressing skeletal muscle mass and cachexia within the AML clinical landscape in view of improving survivability of this disease.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Nowadays, limbs can be salvaged for most patients using modular endoprostheses. Such patients are typically adolescents and young adults who have high activity levels and thereby high demands for multimodal cancer treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the activity levels and sporting proficiencies that can be attained after modular endoprosthetic treatment of bone sarcomas as well as the extent to which physiotherapeutic and sports interventions influence functional outcome and activity levels. METHODS: This non-systematic review of the literature focused on the return to activity and sports after modular endoprosthetic treatment of lower extremities bone sarcomas in adolescents and young adults. The electronic database PubMed was screened for relevant publications on this issue. A treatment algorithm for return to activity and sports in tumor orthopaedics is proposed. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The objective activity level (gait cycles per day and gait intensities) in patients treated for bone sarcomas is reduced in short- and long-term follow-ups compared with healthy controls and patients with other cancers (leukaemia). Although a negative impact is observed in terms of motor performance, it shows improvement over time. Functional assessment at 12 postoperative months is sensible as neoadjuvant chemotherapy is completed by then. In long-term follow-up, patients with bone sarcomas can achieve high sports activity levels, i.e., type of sport, frequency/week and UCLA score, after modular endoprosthetic reconstruction. The maximum level is attained at 5 years postoperatively. Nevertheless, there is a shift from high- and intermediate- to low-impact sports. Only 20% of the patients participate in school sports regularly without limitations. The localisation of bone sarcoma, but not the rate of postoperative complications, influences the postoperative activity level. Individualised sports-related interventions during and after multimodal treatment can improve the short-term activity levels; moreover, ""serious games"" can improve motor performance and postural control. There is no evidence that intense activity levels leads to early loosening of the endoprosthesis. There is insufficient valid data on activity and sports after modular endoprosthetic treatment of bone sarcomas of the upper extremities. CONCLUSION: High preoperative activity levels of young patients with bone sarcomas must be considered in tumour orthopaedics. Limitations on sports activities have a significant negative impact on the quality of life and mental health of such patients. Therefore, tumour orthopaedic treatment has to focus on preserving an improvement in these factors. The overall existing evidence concerning this issue is weak. Additional studies to evaluate the ability to return to specific sports activities are desirable, as well as prospective interventional studies.",['Thieme.

Our previous study showed 1 altered circRNA named circ-anaphase promoting complex subunit 7 (ANAPC7) that was upregulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To further clear the expression and clinical significance of circ-ANAPC7, we enlarged the sample size and illuminated the diagnostic and monitoring value of circ-ANAPC7 in AML. METHODS: Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was supposed to confirm the expression of circ-ANAPC7 of AML patients. We assessed the correlation of circ-ANAPC7 and clinical variables using the Spearman correlation test. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was carried out to evaluate the diagnostic value. RESULTS: Circ-ANAPC7 was first found to be upregulated in AML, and its expression was correlated to white blood cell counts in peripheral blood and blast percentage in bone marrow. ROC curve analysis revealed that circ-ANAPC7 has a significant value of auxiliary AML diagnosis (area under the curve = 0.915, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the expression level of circ-ANAPC7 was changed accompanied with disease condition transformation. CONCLUSION: Circ-ANAPC7 was upregulated in newly diagnosed and relapsed AML. It may serve as potential biomarkers for AML patient's diagnosis and monitoring.","['(c) 2021 S.

Here, we explored the microenvironmental signals regulating T cell exhaustion using a model of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Single-cell analyses identified a subset of PD-1(hi), functionally impaired CD8(+) T cells that accumulated in secondary lymphoid organs during disease progression and a functionally competent PD-1(int) subset. Frequencies of PD-1(int) TCF-1(+) CD8(+) T cells decreased upon Il10rb or Stat3 deletion, leading to accumulation of PD-1(hi) cells and accelerated tumor progression. Mechanistically, inhibition of IL-10R signaling altered chromatin accessibility and disrupted cooperativity between the transcription factors NFAT and AP-1, promoting a distinct NFAT-associated program. Low IL10 expression or loss of IL-10R-STAT3 signaling correlated with increased frequencies of exhausted CD8(+) T cells and poor survival in CLL and in breast cancer patients.

Population pharmacokinetics (popPK) allow for an in-depth investigation of the influence of anti-PEG antibodies on PEG-ASNase pharmacokinetics. METHODS: PEG-ASNase activity (6261 samples) and anti-PEG antibodies (2082/6412 samples prior to/post administration) in 1444 children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treated in the AIEOP-BFM ALL 2009 trial were evaluated. Patients received two doses of PEG-ASNase during induction (2500 U/m(2), intravenous, biweekly) and a third dose during reinduction treatment. Anti-PEG IgG and IgM measured prior to and post administration were explored for their influence on the initial clearance of PEG-ASNase using a previously established popPK model. Categorical and continuous antibody data, including each isotype individually as well as in combination, were assessed. RESULTS: High pre-existing levels of anti-PEG antibodies increase the initial drug clearance. Analysed separately, both anti-PEG IgGprior and IgMprior were significant covariates; the stronger effect was observed for anti-PEG IgMprior. Hockey stick models best described the data. For anti-PEG IgMprior, each additional log unit above the estimated cut point was related to a 41.4% increase in initial clearance after the first dose in induction. Antibody levels below the cut point were not associated with an effect on clearance. The combination of both isotypes did not provide additional information compared to anti-PEG IgMprior alone. Antibody levels post administration were not associated with an effect on clearance. CONCLUSION: Pre-existing antibodies against PEG-ASNase significantly increased the initial clearance in a subgroup of patients showing high antibody levels.

Brazil is considered the country with the highest absolute number of cases, with an estimated 800,000 infected individuals. This article aimed to investigate and analyze the process of inclusion of HTLV on the government agenda in the states of Bahia and Minas Gerais, and which impacted health sector actions and policies. Interviews were held with key actors, and a document search was performed for analysis, using as the main reference the Multiple Streams framework proposed by John Kingdon. Various factors contributed to the theme's inclusion on the health sector agenda in Bahia, the state of Brazil with the widest range of policies on HTLV, involving high prevalence of the infection, a favorable political context, and activism by infected individuals. In Minas Gerais, we observed difficulties in the implementation of this health sector policy; due to the lack of organized advocacy groups, the problem was not a priority in the state's Health Departments.

Their clinical efficacy is negligible, however, for other subtypes of AML. Here, we showed that strobilurin derivatives, a well-established class of inhibitors of mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) complex III, possessed differentiation-inducing activity in AML cells. Impairment of mitochondrial ETC activity was involved in the differentiation effects of strobilurin derivatives, where reactive oxygen species generation appeared unnecessary. Conversely, strobilurin derivative-mediated differentiation was triggered by pyrimidine deficiency, which resulted from the inhibition of the mitochondrial-coupled dihydroorotate dehydrogenase enzyme. Moreover, strobilurin derivative-mediated pyrimidine depletion led to the activation of the Akt/mTOR cascade, which was required for the differentiation.

BACKGROUND: Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is the most common childhood cancer, but there is not enough research on the readiness for hospital discharge. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was performed by convenience sampling and questionnaire survey. METHODS: A self-developed questionnaire of general and clinical characteristics of patients, self-developed questionnaire of general status of family and primary caregivers, questionnaire of readiness of hospital discharge scale and social support rating scale for primary caregivers were delivered to 264 primary caregivers of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia patients. Data collection was carried out 24 h before discharge at bedside. In this study, the STROBE checklist was followed. RESULTS: In total, 253 patients aged 0-16 years, including their primary caregivers in the hospital, were included from November 2016 to August 2017. Based on the readiness scale, the total mean score of readiness was 157.36. Based on the social support scale, the total mean score was 42.17. According to multivariate analysis, periods of chemotherapy (p < .001), complications (p = .019), family economic situation (p = .023), understanding of leukaemia (p < .001), objective support (p = .004), subjective support (p < .001) and availability of support (p = .045) were the main influencers of readiness. CONCLUSIONS: The readiness for hospital discharge in primary caregivers for childhood lymphoblastic leukaemia patients is not satisfactory in China.

In the current study, we demonstrate that deletion of NF-kappaB non-canonical RelB prevents the inhibitory effect of NIK stabilization in MLL-AF9 AML. Mechanistically, RelB suppresses its direct target, TIFAB, which is upregulated in human AML and correlates negatively with the survival of AML patients. Forced expression of TIFAB reverses NIK-induced impaired AML development through downregulation of RelB and upregulation of HOXA9. Consistent with upregulation of HOXA9, gene set enrichment analysis shows that forced expression of TIFAB blocks myeloid cell development, upregulates leukemia stem cell signature and induces similar gene expression patterns to those of HOXA9-MEIS1 and HOXA9-NUP98, and upregulates oxidative phosphorylation. Accordingly, forced expression of HOXA9 also largely releases the inhibitory impact of NIK stabilization via downregulation of RelB and upregulation of RelA. Our data suggest that NIK/RelB suppresses MLL-AF9-induced AML mainly through downregulation of TIFAB/HOXA9.",['(c) 2021 The Author(s).'],"['Zhao, Jinming', 'Xiu, Yan', 'Fu, Lin', 'Dong, Qianze', 'Borcherding, Nicholas', 'Wang, Yang', 'Li, Qingchang', 'De Silva, Nilushi S', 'Klein, Ulf', 'Boyce, Brendan F', 'Zhao, Chen']","['Zhao J', 'Xiu Y', 'Fu L', 'Dong Q', 'Borcherding N', 'Wang Y', 'Li Q', 'De Silva NS', 'Klein U', 'Boyce BF', 'Zhao C']","['Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Wolstein Research Building, Room 6503 2103 Cornell Road, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, China Medical University, 77 Puhe Road, Shenbei Xinqu, Shenyang, Liaoning Province, 110122, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Wolstein Research Building, Room 6503 2103 Cornell Road, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Louis Stokes Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, China Medical University, 77 Puhe Road, Shenbei Xinqu, Shenyang, Liaoning Province, 110122, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Wolstein Research Building, Room 6503 2103 Cornell Road, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Louis Stokes Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology, Barnes-Jewish Hospital, Washington University in St Louis, MO 63110, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Wolstein Research Building, Room 6503 2103 Cornell Road, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, China Medical University, 77 Puhe Road, Shenbei Xinqu, Shenyang, Liaoning Province, 110122, China.', 'Institut Curie, PSL Research University, INSERM U932, Paris, France.', 'Division of Haematology & Immunology, Leeds Institute of Medical Research at St. James, Leeds LS9 7TF, UK.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY 14642, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Louis Stokes Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University Hospitals Case Medical Center, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Wolstein Research Building, Room 6523 2103 Cornell Road, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211112,United States,iScience,iScience,101724038,,['The authors have no financial interests to declare.'],2021/12/09 06:00,2021/12/09 06:01,['2021/12/08 06:35'],"['2021/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/15 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/08 06:35 [entrez]', '2021/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/09 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.isci.2021.103425 [doi]', 'S2589-0042(21)01396-1 [pii]']",epublish,iScience. 2021 Nov 12;24(12):103425. doi: 10.1016/j.isci.2021.103425. eCollection 2021 Dec 17.,,,PMC8633042,['NOTNLM'],"['Biological sciences', 'Cancer', 'Molecular biology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, to overcome the challenges of the treatment, the development of additional therapies is of great importance. Small, non-protein-coding RNAs, namely, microRNAs (miRNAs), are critical epigenetic regulators with physiological and pathological importance. This study is aimed at determining the effects of miR-146a, miR-155, and miR-181a inhibition with their corresponding anti-miRs on both leukemic and healthy cells, individually and with prednisolone. Leukemic (SUP-B15) and healthy B-lymphocyte (NCI-BL 2171) cell lines were used in this study. A total of 12 experimental groups included individual and combinational silenced ALL-associated miRNAs (hsa-miR-155, hsa-miR-146a, and hsa-miR-181a) and their combination with prednisolone. Cytotoxicity, proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis analyses were performed by using WST-1, trypan blue, APC-BrdU, Annexin V, and JC-1 methods in each study group, respectively. To control the effectiveness of anti-miR transfection and prednisolone application, miRNA expression analysis was performed from all groups. Anti-miR application was effective on the viability, proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis of leukemia cells, and this effect was increased with prednisolone administration. In addition, this activity was found to be very low on healthy cells. In conclusion, anti-miR applications may have the potential for clinical use of adjuvant to or as an alternative to conventional therapies for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Burak Durmaz et al.'],"['Durmaz, Burak', 'Bagca, Bakiye Goker', 'Cogulu, Ozgur', 'Susluer, Sunde Yilmaz', 'Alpay, Araz', 'Aksoylar, Serap', 'Gunduz, Cumhur']","['Durmaz B', 'Bagca BG', 'Cogulu O', 'Susluer SY', 'Alpay A', 'Aksoylar S', 'Gunduz C']","['Ege University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Genetics, 35100, Bornova, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Aydin Adnan Menderes University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Biology, 09100 Aydin, Turkey.', 'Ege University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, 35100, Bornova, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Ege University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Biology, 35100, Bornova, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Ege University, Institute of Health Sciences, 35100, Bornova, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Ege University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, 35100, Bornova, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Ege University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Biology, 35100, Bornova, Izmir, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211128,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,IM,"['The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the', 'publication of this paper.']",2021/12/09 06:00,2021/12/09 06:00,['2021/12/08 06:32'],"['2021/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/08 06:32 [entrez]', '2021/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2021/3207328 [doi]'],epublish,Biomed Res Int. 2021 Nov 28;2021:3207328. doi: 10.1155/2021/3207328. eCollection 2021.,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6971-7996', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5714-7455', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9037-5599', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0535-150X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5680-5455', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8446-0834', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6593-3237']",,PMC8645370,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In general, patients with T-LBL have a poor prognosis and often have high-risk clinical features, such as mediastinal masses, central nervous system infiltration, or other indications of high tumor burden; however, extensive thrombi are not common. CASE SUMMARY: A 27-year-old woman presented to the Department of General Surgery with cervical lymph node enlargement accompanied by cough, wheezing, and palpitation for 3 mo. A complete blood count showed a white blood cell count of 1.6 x 10(9)/L, a hemoglobin concentration of 135 g/L, and a platelet count of 175 x 10(9)/L. A biopsy sample of the lymph node mass indicated T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma, and the bone marrow immunophenotype indicated early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ETP-ALL). Abdominal and chest enhanced computed tomography showed thrombi in the superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, right hepatic vein, azygos vein, and right atrium. The ultrasonic cardiogram showed a thrombus in the right atrium of 5.23 cm x 4.21 cm. The patient was first treated with low-dose dexamethasone and low-molecular-weight heparin followed by 2 cycles of chemotherapy. Then, the ultrasonic cardiogram showed that thrombus in the right atrium had disappeared and the patient had achieved complete cytological remission. The maintenance therapy of the patient included chidamide 30 mg/wk, and she survived for 6 mo. CONCLUSION: The incidence of venous thromboembolism is high in lymphoma; however, extensive thrombi with heart thrombosis is rare. Chemotherapy is the major method of treatment for lymphoma with thrombosis. We successfully treated a patient with T-LBL complicated by extensive thrombi, including a large right atrial thrombus, with combined chemotherapy containing liposomal doxorubicin, and the patient achieved complete remission. Maintenance therapy with chidamide was also effective.","['(c)The Author(s) 2021. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

Thirty days post-transplant, the infectious disease team was consulted because blood cultures grew Janibacter hoylei, from one of two blood cultures It took nine days to identify the species. She was treated with linezolid and imipenem. Janibacter are rarely implicated in human pathology, and therein, usually identified in the context of malignancy and relative immunosuppression. J. hoylei was only previously reported from the bloodstream of a previously healthy 8-week-old infant without underlying medical conditions.

However, the underlying mechanisms are only partially understood. Here we implicate the histone H3.3 chaperone Daxx, a retrotransposable element repressor inactivated in myeloid leukaemia and other neoplasms, in protection from inflammatory disease. Loss of Daxx alters the chromatin landscape, H3.3 distribution and histone marks of haematopoietic progenitors, leading to engagement of a Pu.1-dependent transcriptional programme for myelopoiesis at the expense of B-cell differentiation. This causes neutrophilia and inflammation, predisposing mice to develop an autoinflammatory skin disease.

Several FLT3-targeted agents have been developed, but determinants of variable responses to these agents remain understudied. Here, we investigated the role FLT3-ITD allelic ratio (ITD-AR), ITD length, and associated gene expression signatures on FLT3 inhibitor response in adult AML. We performed fragment analysis, ex vivo drug testing, and next generation sequencing (RNA, exome) to 119 samples from 87 AML patients and 13 healthy bone marrow controls. We found that ex vivo response to FLT3 inhibitors is significantly associated with ITD-AR, but not with ITD length. Interestingly, we found that the HLF gene is overexpressed in FLT3-ITD(+) AML and associated with ITD-AR. The retrospective analysis of AML patients treated with FLT3 inhibitor sorafenib showed that patients with high HLF expression and ITD-AR had better clinical response to therapy compared to those with low ITD-AR and HLF expression. Thus, our findings suggest that FLT3 ITD-AR together with increased HLF expression play a role in variable FLT3 inhibitor responses observed in FLT3-ITD(+) AML patients.",['(c) 2021.

To evaluate this hypothesis, we performed a tumor induction study in MYC-transgenic mice infected as neonates with the Moloney-derived murine leukemia virus, MOL4070LTR. Next-generation DNA sequencing of proviral genomic integration sites yielded rank-ordered candidate tumor progression genes that accelerated plasma cell neoplasia in mice. Rigorous clinical and biological validation of these genes led to the discovery of two novel myeloma genes: WDR26 (WD repeat-containing protein 26) and MTF2 (metal response element binding transcription factor 2). WDR26, a core component of the carboxy-terminal to LisH (CTLH) complex, is overexpressed or mutated in solid cancers. MTF2, an ancillary subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), is a close functional relative of PHD finger protein 19 (PHF19) which is currently emerging as an important driver of myeloma. These findings underline the utility of genetic forward screens in mice for uncovering novel blood cancer genes and suggest that WDR26-CTLH and MTF2-PRC2 are promising molecular targets for new approaches to myeloma treatment and prevention.",['(c) 2021.

Patients must manage multiple medications; care for their catheter; minimize exposure to sources of potential infection; follow diet, exercise, and self-care guidelines; and attend frequent follow-up medical appointments. Their caregivers are tasked with helping them manage the regimen. Despite the importance of this management in preventing adverse clinical outcomes, there has been little study of regimen nonadherence and its predictors. We sought to prospectively determine rates and predictors of nonadherence to components of the post-HCT medical regimen during the first 8 weeks after hospital discharge. Patients (n=92) and their caregivers (n=91) (total n=183) completed interview assessments pre-HCT, and at 4 weeks and 8 weeks after hospital discharge post-HCT. Sociodemographic factors (eg, age, sex), patient clinical status (eg, disease type, donor type), patient and caregiver self-reported health-related factors (eg, medical comorbidities), and patient and caregiver psychosocial factors (eg, anxiety, depression, HCT task-specific and general self-efficacy, relationship quality) were assessed pre-HCT. Nonadherence to each of 17 regimen tasks was assessed at 4 and 8 weeks after hospital discharge via self and caregiver collateral reports. Nonadherence rates varied among tasks, with 11.2% to 15.7% of the sample reporting nonadherence to immunosuppressant medication, 34.8% to 38.6% to other types of medications, 14.6% to 67.4% to required infection precautions, and 27.0% to 68.5% to lifestyle-related behaviors (eg, diet/exercise). Nonadherence rates were generally stable but worsened over time for lifestyle-related behaviors. The most consistent nonadherence predictors were patient and caregiver pre-HCT perceptions of lower HCT task efficacy. Higher caregiver depression, caregiver perceptions of poorer relationship with the patient, having a nonspousal caregiver, and having diseases other than acute myelogenous leukemia also predicted greater nonadherence in 1 or more areas. Rates of nonadherence varied across tasks, and both patient and caregiver factors, particularly self-efficacy, predicted nonadherence. The findings highlight the importance of considering not only patient factors, but also caregiver factors, in post-HCT regimen nonadherence.

However, post-treatment relapse remains an issue. Optimal management of B-ALL after tisagenlecleucel treatment remains elusive, and continued tracking of outcomes is necessary to establish a standard of care for this population. We sought to evaluate outcomes on the real-world use of tisagenlecleucel in a contemporary pediatric patient population and to identify risk factors influencing event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). Additionally, we aimed to describe post-tisagenlecleucel management strategies, including use of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (AlloHCT) or repeat CAR T-cell infusions. We report on 31 pediatric and adolescent and young adult patients (AYA) with B-ALL, treated with lymphodepleting chemotherapy followed by tisagenlecleucel. Patients were treated at Johns Hopkins Hospital and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital between March 2018 and November 2020. Data on patient, disease, and treatment characteristics were collected retrospectively from medical records and described. EFS and OS were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log-rank test. Single-factor and multiple-factor analysis of EFS and OS were performed by fitting Cox regression models. Of the 30 evaluable patients, 25 (83.3%) experienced a complete response, with 21 having negative minimal residual disease. Treatment was well tolerated, with expected rates of cytokine release syndrome (61.3%) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity (29%). After initial complete response, 12 patients (48%) had subsequent disease recurrence, with CD19-negative relapse (n = 6) occurring sooner than CD19-positive relapse (P = .0125). With a median follow-up time of 386 days (range 11-1187 days), the EFS for the entire cohort (n = 31) at 6 and 12 months after infusion was 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 28.4%-63.4%) and 35.2% (95% CI, 18.4%-52.5%), respectively. In multivariate analysis, high pretreatment leukemic burden (>/=5% bone marrow blasts) was an independent risk factor for inferior EFS (HR 5.98 [95% CI, 1.1-32.4], P = .0380) and OS (HR 4.2 [95% CI, 1.33-13.39], P = .0148). Tisagenlecleucel induced high initial response rates in a contemporary cohort of pediatric and AYA patients with B-ALL. However, 48% of patients experienced subsequent disease relapse, including 6 with antigen-escape variants. This highlights a considerable limitation of single-agent autologous CD19-CAR T-cell therapy. Pretreatment leukemic disease burden of >/=5% blasts was significantly associated with worse outcomes in this study, including lower EFS and OS. Our findings suggest that reducing preinfusion leukemic burden is a viable treatment strategy to improve outcomes of CAR T-cell therapy.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

The most promising alternative donor is thought to be an HLA-matched unrelated donor (MUD) in patients who do not have an HLA-matched related donor. Cord blood transplantation (CBT) is an alternative option. Higher rates of engraftment failure and nonrelapse mortality are significant problems, but the ready availability of cord blood can be an advantage, because patients can immediately undergo transplantation before progression. This study was conducted to identify an appropriate alternative donor in patients with Ph-negative ALL in CR1 who do not have an HLA-matched related donor (MRD). Decision analyses using a Markov model were performed to compare immediate CBT, in which CBT was performed at 1 month after the achievement of CR1, with elective unrelated bone marrow transplantation (uBMT) from an 8/8 HLA-matched unrelated donor (MUD) (8/8 uBMT) or uBMT from 7/8 MUD (7/8 uBMT), in which uBMT was performed at 4 months, in patients age 16 to 55 years with Ph-negative ALL in CR1 who did not have an MRD. We constructed a decision tree. The cycle length was set at 3 months, and analyses were performed for 19 cycles for uBMT and 20 cycles for CBT, resulting in evaluation of the 5-year life expectancy after both decisions. Transition probabilities (TPs) and utilities were estimated from prospective and retrospective Japanese studies and the registry database of Japan. Subgroup analyses were performed according to risk stratification based on WBC count and cytogenetics at diagnosis and according to age stratification, with a cutoff of 25 years. One-way sensitivity analyses for TPs and utilities were performed as well. The baseline analyses showed that 8/8 uBMT or 7/8 uBMT had superior results to CBT, with quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of 2.86 in 8/8 uBMT, 2.84 in 7/8 uBMT, and 2.75 in CBT. One-way sensitivity analyses showed that the results of the baseline analyses were reversed if the probability of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) in CBT improved. Subgroup analyses showed similar results in younger, older, and high-risk patients. However, QALY was worse in 8/8 uBMT compared with CBT in standard-risk patients. In one-way sensitivity analyses, the probabilities of NRM in uBMT and CBT affected the baseline results in all analyses except for comparisons between 8/8 uBMT and CBT in younger and high-risk patients. In these 2 populations, the superiority of 8/8 uBMT was consistently demonstrated throughout the one-way sensitivity analyses. For patients with Ph-negative ALL in CR1 who decide to undergo transplantation from an alternative donor, elective uBMT from either an 8/8 MUD or a 7/8 MUD is expected to yield a better outcome than immediate CBT. Nonetheless, CBT is a viable option, and improvements to reduce the risk of NRM in CBT may change these results.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

Furthermore, residual leukemic stem cells (LSCs) are involved in the molecular relapse after TKIs discontinuation. Aberrant DNA hypermethylation contributes to low TKIs sensitivity and the persistence of LSCs in CML. DNMT1 is a key regulator of hematopoietic stem cells, suggesting that aberrant DNA hypermethylation targeting DNMT1 represents a potential therapeutic target for CML. We investigated the efficacy of OR-2100 (OR21), the first orally available single-compound prodrug of decitabine. OR21 exhibited anti-tumor effects as a monotherapy, and in combination therapy it increased TKI-induced apoptosis and induction of tumor suppressor genes including PTPN6 encoding SHP-1 in CML cells. OR21 in combination with imatinib significantly suppressed tumor growth in a xenotransplant model. OR21 and combination therapy decreased the abundance of LSCs and inhibited engraftment in a BCR-ABL1-transduced mouse model. These results demonstrate that targeting DNMT1 using OR21 exerts anti-tumor effects and impairs LSCs in CML. Therefore, combination treatment of TKIs and OR21 represents a promising treatment strategy in CML.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

These are two enzymes that are normally expressed for purposes of the two site-specific DNA recombination processes: V(D)J recombination and class switch recombination (CSR). First, though it is rare, a low level of expression of AID can introduce long-lived T:G mismatch lesions at 20-600 bp fragile zones. Second, the V(D)J recombination process can occasionally fail to rejoin coding ends, and this failure may permit an opportunity for Artemis:DNA-dependent kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) to convert the T:G mismatch sites at the fragile zones into double-strand breaks. The 20-600 bp fragile zones must be, at least transiently, in a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) state for the first step to occur, because AID only acts on ssDNA. Here we discuss the key DNA sequence features that lead to AID action at a fragile zone, which are (a) the proximity and density of strings of cytosine nucleotides (C-strings) that cause a B/A-intermediate DNA conformation; (b) overlapping AID hotspots that contain a methyl CpG (WRCG), which AID converts to a long-lived T:G mismatch; and (c) transcription, which, though not essential, favors increased ssDNA in the fragile zone. We also summarize chromosomal features of the focal fragile zones in lymphoid malignancies and discuss the clinical relevance of understanding the translocation mechanisms. Many of the key principles covered here are also relevant to chromosomal translocations in non-lymphoid somatic cells as well.",,"['Liu, Di', 'Lieber, Michael R']","['Liu D', 'Lieber MR']","['Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, and Section of Computational Biology in the Department of Biological Sciences, USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, and Section of Computational Biology in the Department of Biological Sciences, USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211207,England,Crit Rev Biochem Mol Biol,Critical reviews in biochemistry and molecular biology,8903774,IM,,2021/12/08 06:00,2021/12/08 06:00,['2021/12/07 20:10'],"['2021/12/07 20:10 [entrez]', '2021/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/10409238.2021.2004576 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Crit Rev Biochem Mol Biol. 2021 Dec 7:1-17. doi: 10.1080/10409238.2021.2004576.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['B/A-intermediate DNA', 'Chromosomal translocations', 'activation-induced deaminase (AID)', 'double-strand breaks', 'lymphoid leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'non-B DNA structure', 'single-stranded DNA']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rarely do clinicians encounter cases that do not respond to traditional antibiotics or surgical management. The goal of this study was to systematically review the literature to characterize diseases masquerading as acute infectious mastoiditis. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, and Scopus. REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review was performed to identify all publications that reported on diseases with presentations mimicking acute mastoiditis, defined as postauricular redness, swelling, and tenderness. We included clinical prospective studies, retrospective studies, and case series/reports. Exclusion criteria included non-English articles, letters/commentaries, abstracts, and review articles. RESULTS: Out of 3339 results, 35 studies met final inclusion criteria. In children, 11 diseases were reported to mimic mastoiditis, including solid tumors, hematologic diseases, and autoimmune/inflammatory diseases. The most common disease in children was Langerhans cell histiocytosis, followed by rhabdomyosarcoma and acute myelogenous leukemia. In adults, 8 additional diseases were reported. The most common disease in adults was squamous cell carcinoma, followed by nasopharyngeal carcinoma and Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Presenting symptoms are reviewed, as well as characteristic radiographic, laboratory, and intraoperative features that may assist with diagnosis. A diagnostic algorithm for atypical cases of acute mastoiditis is proposed. CONCLUSION: A small but significant group of diseases in children and adults can mimic acute mastoiditis. In such cases, history and examination alone may be insufficient to reach a diagnosis, and further investigation may be necessary. Otolaryngologists should always be mindful of the possibility that noninfectious pathologies may present with a constellation of symptoms similar to mastoiditis.",,"['Wong, Kevin', 'Arrighi-Allisan, Annie E', 'Fan, Caleb J', 'Wanna, George B', 'Cosetti, Maura K', 'Perez, Enrique R']","['Wong K', 'Arrighi-Allisan AE', 'Fan CJ', 'Wanna GB', 'Cosetti MK', 'Perez ER']","['Department of Otolaryngology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Otolaryngology, New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Otolaryngology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Otolaryngology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Otolaryngology, New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Otolaryngology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Otolaryngology, New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Otolaryngology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Otolaryngology, New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Otolaryngology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Otolaryngology, New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211207,England,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,8508176,IM,,2021/12/08 06:00,2021/12/08 06:00,['2021/12/07 17:15'],"['2021/12/07 17:15 [entrez]', '2021/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/01945998211064190 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2021 Dec 7:1945998211064190. doi: 10.1177/01945998211064190.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['abscess', 'mastoiditis', 'mimicker', 'otomastoiditis', 'systematic review']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, studies on the prevalence of cytogenetic abnormalities and their correlation to clinical features in Chinese pediatric patients are limited, especially large-scale studies. METHODS: We collected the cytogenetics and clinical data of 1541 children newly diagnosed with ALL between 2001 and 2014 in four Chinese hospitals, and retrospectively analyzed their clinical features, prognosis and risk factors associated with pediatric ALL. RESULTS: All of these patients had karyotyping results, and some of them were tested for fusion genes by fluorescence in situ hybridization or reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Overall, 930 cases (60.4%) had abnormal cytogenetics in this study, mainly including high hyperdiploidy (HHD, n=276, 17.9%), hypodiploidy (n=74, 4.8%), t(12;21)/TEL-AML1 (n=260, 16.9%), t(1;19)/E2A-PBX1 (n=72, 4.7%), t(9;22)/BCR-ABL (n=64, 4.2%), and t(v;11q23)/MLL rearrangements (n=40, 2.6%). The distribution of each cytogenetic abnormality was correlated with gender, age, white blood cell count at diagnosis, and immunophenotype. In addition, multivariate analysis suggested that t(v;11q23)/MLL rearrangements (OR: 2.317, 95%CI: 1.219-3.748, P=0.008) and t(9;22)/BCR-ABL (OR: 2.519, 95%CI: 1.59-3.992, P<0.001) were independent risk factors for a lower event-free survival (EFS) rate in children with ALL, while HHD (OR: 0.638, 95%CI: 0.455-0.894, P=0.009) and t(12;21)/TEL-AML1 (OR: 0.486, 95%CI: 0.333-0.707, P<0.001) were independent factors of a favorable EFS. CONCLUSION: The cytogenetic characteristics presented in our study resembled other research groups, emphasizing the important role of cytogenetic and molecular genetic classification in ALL, especially in B-ALL.",['(c) 2021.

These are classified into several different phenotypes and typically arise following a multistep genetic process, whereby genetic mutations alter the DNA damage and cellular stress responses, impacting transcription, RNA splicing, epigenetics, and cytokine signaling. However, despite the advances made regarding molecular pathophysiology and prognostic criteria and the influx of new treatment modalities, management is primarily based on prognostic scores, such as the Revised International Prognostic Scoring System. This poses a significant challenge to current healthcare professionals due to poor comprehension of the underlying pathophysiology. Hence, this review integrates the latest research and treatment modalities for MDS and discusses the different genetic mutations outlined in the revised World Health Organization 2016 MDS classification system and the associated treatment modalities. Additionally, future directions of research and clinical management of MDS are discussed.","['Copyright (c) 2021, Zamora et al.']","['Zamora, Diana I', 'Patel, Gautami S', 'Grossmann, Idan', 'Rodriguez, Kevin', 'Soni, Mridul', 'Joshi, Pranay K', 'Patel, Saawan C', 'Shreya, Devarashetty', 'Sange, Ibrahim']","['Zamora DI', 'Patel GS', 'Grossmann I', 'Rodriguez K', 'Soni M', 'Joshi PK', 'Patel SC', 'Shreya D', 'Sange I']","['General Medicine, Universidad de Ciencias Medicas, San Jose, CRI.', 'Internal Medicine, Pramukhswami Medical College, Karamsad, IND.', 'Research, Medical University of Silesia, Faculty of Medical Sciences in Katowice, Katowice, POL.', 'Research, Universidad Americana Facultad de Medicina, Managua, NIC.', 'Research, Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri Government Medical College, Mandi, IND.', 'Department of Medicine, B.J.

Lactate has been implicated in more biological processes than previously understood and drives tumor progression. Here, we demonstrated that the bone marrow lactate concentrations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients were substantially higher than those in their healthy control counterparts. Moreover, AML blasts from bone marrow expressed significantly higher lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDHA) levels. Further studies revealed that LDHA expression was regulated through the HIF1alpha pathway. Elevated lactate levels were indicative of alterations in CD8(+) T cell cytolytic phenotype and activity. An in vitro study showed that the lactate treatment group had significantly higher percentages of CD8(+) TEM and CD8(+) TEMRA cells as well as higher PD-1 expression in these cells than the control group. Lactate induced the loss of the effector function of CD8(+) T cells by altering lytic granule exocytosis. T cell dysfunction is characterized by an increase in terminally differentiated phenotypes, sustained expression of PD-1, and accelerated decline of cytolytic competence. Moreover, the TOX gene was found to be correlated with lactate production and implicated in CD8(+) T cell dysfunction. AML patients in complete remission after chemotherapy had markedly lower lactate concentrations, reduced CD8(+) TEM and CD8(+) TEMRA cells and PD-1 expression, and increased perforin and granzyme B. However, no difference was found in the relapsed patients. The study presented here has established lactate as a predictive biomarker for patient response to antitumor therapies and demonstrated that targeting this gene in AML patients could be a meaningful precision therapeutic strategy.",['AJCR Copyright (c) 2021.'],"['Chen, Ying', 'Feng, Zhongxin', 'Kuang, Xingyi', 'Zhao, Peng', 'Chen, Bingqing', 'Fang, Qin', 'Cheng, Weiwei', 'Wang, Jishi']","['Chen Y', 'Feng Z', 'Kuang X', 'Zhao P', 'Chen B', 'Fang Q', 'Cheng W', 'Wang J']","['The Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University 1005 Sanxiang Road, Gusu District, Suzhou 215004, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, China.', 'Guizhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic & Treat Centre of Guizhou Province Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, China.', 'Guizhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic & Treat Centre of Guizhou Province Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, China.', 'Guizhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic & Treat Centre of Guizhou Province Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, China.', 'The Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University 1005 Sanxiang Road, Gusu District, Suzhou 215004, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, China.', 'Guizhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic & Treat Centre of Guizhou Province Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, China.', 'Guizhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic & Treat Centre of Guizhou Province Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, China.', 'Guizhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic & Treat Centre of Guizhou Province Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, China.', 'Guizhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic & Treat Centre of Guizhou Province Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211115,United States,Am J Cancer Res,American journal of cancer research,101549944,,['None.'],2021/12/08 06:00,2021/12/08 06:01,['2021/12/07 06:44'],"['2021/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/07 06:44 [entrez]', '2021/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/08 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Cancer Res. 2021 Nov 15;11(11):5726-5742. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8640829,['NOTNLM'],"['CD8+ T cell', 'TOX', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'lactate', 'programmed death-1']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we demonstrate that T cells expressing TCRs specific for peptides from the intracellular lymphoid-specific enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), presented in the context of HLA-A*02:01, specifically eliminate primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells of T- and B-cell origin in vitro and in three mouse models of disseminated B-ALL. By contrast, the treatment spares normal peripheral T- and B-cell repertoires and normal myeloid cells in vitro, and in vivo in humanized mice. TdT is an attractive cancer target as it is highly and homogeneously expressed in 80-94% of B- and T-ALLs, but only transiently expressed during normal lymphoid differentiation, limiting on-target toxicity of TdT-specific T cells. TCR-modified T cells targeting TdT may be a promising immunotherapy for B-ALL and T-ALL that preserves normal lymphocytes.",['(c) 2021.

Notably, in 40% of patients, constitutive STAT3 activation is due to STAT3 activating mutations, whereas in 60% this is unknown. As miRNAs are amongst the most potent regulators in health and disease, we hypothesized that aberrant miRNA expression could contribute to dysregulation of these pathways. miRNA sequencing in T-LGL leukemia cases and aged-matched healthy control TEMRA cells revealed overexpression of miR-181a. Furthermore, geneset enrichment analysis (GSEA) of downregulated targets of miR-181a implicated involvement in regulating STAT3 and ERK1/2 pathways. Flow cytometric analyses showed increased SOCS3+ and DUSP6+ T-LGL cells upon miR-181a inhibition. In addition, miR-181a-transfected human CD8+ T cells showed increased basal STAT3 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. By using TL1, a human T-LGL cell line, we could show that miR-181a is an actor in T-LGL leukemia, driving STAT3 activation by SOCS3 inhibition and ERK1/2 phosphorylation by DUSP6 inhibition and verified this mechanism in an independent cell line. In addition, miR-181a inhibition resulted in a higher sensitivity to FAS-mediated apoptosis. Collectively, our data show that miR-181a could be the missing link to explain why STAT3-unmutated patients show hyperactive STAT3.",['(c) 2021.

We analyzed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data from 15 primary AML samples with IDH1 or IDH2 mutations, which identified ~4000 focal regions that were uniquely hypermethylated in IDH(mut) samples vs. normal CD34+ cells and other AMLs. These regions had modest hypermethylation in AMLs with biallelic TET2 mutations, and levels of 5-hydroxymethylation that were diminished in IDH and TET-mutant samples, indicating that this hypermethylation results from inhibition of TET-mediated demethylation. Focal hypermethylation in IDH(mut) AMLs occurred at regions with low methylation in CD34+ cells, implying that DNA methylation and demethylation are active at these loci. AML samples containing IDH and DNMT3A(R882) mutations were significantly less hypermethylated, suggesting that IDH(mut)-associated hypermethylation is mediated by DNMT3A. IDH(mut)-specific hypermethylation was highly enriched for enhancers that form direct interactions with genes involved in normal hematopoiesis and AML, including MYC and ETV6. These results suggest that focal hypermethylation in IDH-mutant AML occurs by altering the balance between DNA methylation and demethylation, and that disruption of these pathways at enhancers may contribute to AML pathogenesis.",['(c) 2021.

Here, we show that reversible phase separation of the LC1 domain is critical for both interaction with different kinds of RNA-binding proteins and control of the alternative-splicing activity of hnRNPH1. Interestingly, although not required for phase separation, the LC2 domain contributes to the robust transcriptional activation of hnRNPH1 when fused to the DNA-binding domain, as found recently in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Our data suggest that the ability of the LC1 domain to phase-separate into reversible polymers or liquid-like droplets is essential for function of hnRNPH1 as an alternative RNA-splicing regulator, whereas the LC2 domain may contribute to the aberrant transcriptional activity responsible for cancer transformation.",['Copyright (c) 2021 the Author(s).

Few data are available on teniposide in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for high-risk or refractory recurrent hematopoietic malignant diseases, particularly for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: A retrospective single arm study was conducted to confirm the feasibility of teniposide (300 mg/m2) -intensified HSCT in the treatment of high-risk or refractory recurrent hematopoietic malignant disease by analysing the outcomes of 32 patients, who received transplantation between January 2016 and December 2018. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate prognostic factors of the endpoints. Statistically significant factors (P<0.05) in multivariate analyses were regarded to be predictive. RESULTS: All patients achieved myeloid engraftment at a median of 13 days (range, 9-28 days), platelet engraftment at 15.5 days (range, 6-142 days), with a cumulative incidence (CI) of platelet engraftment of 93.75%+/-0.26%. The CI of grade II-IV acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) was 43.75%+/-0.80% and that of grade III-IV aGVHD 12.50%+/-0.35%. The CI of chronic (c)GVHD was 74.07%+/-0.82% and that of extensive cGVHD 33.33%+/-0.87%. The CI of relapse was 35.03%+/-0.76%. The one-year probability of overall survival (OS) was 62.50%+/-0.09%, while 2-year OS was 46.90%+/-0.09%, and those of 1- and 2-year leukemia-free-survival (LFS) were 56.30%+/-0.09% and 46.90%+/-0.09%, respectively. Generally, the OS and LFS until the end of our follow up were 43.50%+/-0.09% and 34.80%+/-0.11%, respectively. The probability of GVHD-free and relapse-free survival (GRFS) was 24.60%+/-0.08%. Multivariate analysis indicated that the probability of OS was significantly lower in patients with a disease duration of more than 280 days before receiving HSCT and in those with fewer mononuclear cells. For LFS, other than the above two factors, failure to achieve complete response (CR) before HSCT was another independent risk factor. Similarly, the probability of GRFS was significantly lower in patients with longer disease duration (>/=280 days) and those receiving stem cells from female donors. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with high-risk or refractory recurrent hematopoietic malignant disease, teniposide-based conditioning regimens followed by allo-HSCT can be considered as an alternative therapy with encouraging prognoses.",,"['Wang, Wen-Jing', 'Cheng, Hao-Yu', 'Yang, Fan', 'Li, Ting-Ting', 'Yang, Yi-Xin', 'Zhang, Yue-Fan', 'Wang, Jing-Bo']","['Wang WJ', 'Cheng HY', 'Yang F', 'Li TT', 'Yang YX', 'Zhang YF', 'Wang JB']","['Department of Hematology, Aerospace Center Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Aerospace Center Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Aerospace Center Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Aerospace Center Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Aerospace Center Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Aerospace Center Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Aerospace Center Hospital, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Ann Palliat Med,Annals of palliative medicine,101585484,IM,,2021/12/08 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/12/07 05:29'],"['2021/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/07 05:29 [entrez]', '2021/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.21037/apm-21-3122 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Palliat Med. 2021 Nov;10(11):11798-11807. doi: 10.21037/apm-21-3122.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Teniposide', 'hematopoietic malignant diseases', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)']",20211208,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)']",,"['Antilymphocyte Serum/therapeutic use', 'Female', '*Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Teniposide']",,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, vaccination results in significantly lower response rates in haematological malignancies and lower antibody levels in patients with solid cancer. We investigated efficacy and safety of a heterologous booster vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S DNA vector vaccine in haemato-oncological patients without antibody response after double-dose BNT162b2 messenger (m-)RNA COVID-19 vaccine. A total of 32 haemato-oncological non-responders to double-dose BNT162b2 received a heterologous booster vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S. Blood samples were assessed directly before the vaccination (T0) and four weeks after (T1). Safety assessment was performed using a standardised questionnaire. The overall response rate was 31%, with a mean (SD) antibody titre of 693.79 (1 096.99) binding activity units (BAU)/ml. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or lymphoma showed a significantly lower response rate (P = 0.048). Adverse events were reported in 29.6% of patients, of which 7.1% were graded as severe, including grade III and IV events following the Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events (CTCAE). The heterologous booster vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S led to a serological response in nine out of 29 patients without response after double-dose BNT162b2. Furthermore, the vaccination was safe in our cohort, leading to mainly mild local and systemic reactions.

TCRalphabeta/CD19 depletion may reduce this risk, while maintaining graft-versus-leukemia. Outcome data with TCRalphabeta/CD19 depletion generally describes haploidentical donors, with relatively few URDs. We hypothesized that TCRalphabeta/CD19-depletion would attenuate the risks of GVHD and relapse for URD HSCT. Sixty pediatric and young adult (YA) patients with hematologic malignancies who lacked a matched-related donor were enrolled at two large pediatric transplantation centers between 10/2014 and 09/2019. All patients with acute leukemia had minimal residual disease testing and DP typing was available for 77%. All patients received myeloablative TBI- or busulfan-based conditioning with no post-transplant immune suppression. Engraftment occurred in 98%. Four-year overall survival was 69% (95%CI 52-81%) and leukemia-free survival was 64% (95%CI 48-76%), with no difference between lymphoid and myeloid malignancies (p=0.6297 and p=0.5441, respectively). One patient (1.7%) experienced primary graft failure. Relapse occurred in 11 patients (3-year cumulative incidence 21%, 95%CI 11-34), and 8 patients (cumulative incidence 15%, 95%CI 6.7-26) experienced non-relapse mortality.

The LSC17 gene expression score robustly captures LSC stemness properties in AML and can be used to predict survival outcomes and response to therapy, enabling risk-adapted upfront treatment approaches. The LSC17 score was developed and validated in a research setting. To enable wide use of the LSC17 score in clinical decision-making, we established a Laboratory Developed Test (LDT) for the LSC17 score that can be deployed broadly in clinical molecular diagnostic laboratories. We extensively validated the LSC17 LDT in a College of American Pathologists/Clinical Laboratory Improvements Act (CAP/CLIA)-certified laboratory, determining specimen requirements, a synthetic control, and performance parameters for the assay. Importantly, we correlated values from the LSC17 LDT to clinical outcome for a reference cohort of AML patients, establishing a median assay value that can be used for clinical risk stratification of individual patients with newly-diagnosed AML. The assay was established in a second independent CAP/CLIA-certified laboratory and its technical performance validated using an independent cohort of AML patient samples, demonstrating that the LSC17 LDT can be readily implemented in other settings.

Moreover, the correlation between serologic response and status of cellular immunity has been poorly studied. OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to assess humoral immune and cellular responses to the BNT162b2 messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccination in CLL. METHODS: The presence of the spike antibodies was assessed at a median time of 14 days from the second vaccine dose of SARS-CoV2 in 70 CLL followed-up at a single institution. RESULTS: The antibody response rate (RR) in CLL patients was 58.5%, compared to 100% of 57 healthy controls of the same sex and age (P< 0.0001). Patients treatment-naive and those in sustained clinical remission after therapy had the highest RR (87.0% and 87.7%, respectively). In contrast, patients on therapy with a pathway inhibitor as monotherapy and those treated with an association of anti-CD20 antibody were unlikely to respond to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (52% and 10%, respectively). In multivariate analysis, early Rai stage (OR, 0.19 [0.05-0.79]; P=0.02) and no previous therapy (OR, 0.06[0.02-0.27]; P<0.0001) were found to be independent predictors of vaccination response. An increase in absolute NK cells (i.e., CD16/CD56 positive cells) in patients with a serological response was found following the second dose of vaccine (P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that serological response to the BNT162b2 vaccine in patients with CLL is impaired. A third boosting vaccine dosage should be considered for these patients.","['S.

The endothelial niche reportedly enhances the paracrine action of the soluble secretory proteins responsible for chemoresistance in a vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A)/VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) signaling pathway-dependent manner. To further investigate the contribution of VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 signaling to the chemoresistance of AML cells, a biochemical assay system in which the AML cells were cocultured with human endothelial EA.hy926 cells in a monolayer was developed. By coculture with EA.hy926 cells, this study revealed that the AML cells resisted apoptosis induced by the anticancer drug cytarabine. SU4312, a VEGFR-2 inhibitor, attenuated VEGFR-2 phosphorylation and VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 signaling-dependent endothelial cell migration; thus, this inhibitor was observed to block VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 signaling. Interestingly, this inhibitor did not reverse the chemoresistance. When VEGFR-2 was knocked out in EA.hy926 cells using the CRISPR-Cas9 system, the cytarabine-induced apoptosis of AML cells did not significantly change compared with that of wild-type cells. Thus, coculture-induced chemoresistance appears to be independent of VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 signaling. When the transwell, a coculturing device, separated the AML cells from the EA.hy926 cells in a monolayer, the coculture-induced chemoresistance was inhibited. Given that the migration of VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 signaling-dependent endothelial cells is necessary for the endothelial niche formation in the bone marrow, VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 signaling contributes to chemoresistance by mediating the niche formation process, but not to the chemoresistance of AML cells in the niche.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: A systematic search of publications indexed in the electronic databases from January 1988 to October 2020 was performed. Over 7525 cases of AML from 25 studies were involved. RESULTS: At diagnosis, overexpression of either BAALC or EVI1 had a negative impact on complete remission achievement (Summary Odds ratios [SORs] for BAALC = 0.32; SORs for EVI1 = 0.49) and survival outcome. The summary hazard ratios of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were 1.97 and 2.04 for BAALC and 1.33 and 1.86 for EVI1, respectively. The prognostic value of pretreatment WT1 levels was heterogeneous while subgroup analyses unveiled that overexpressed WT1 may correlate with a favorable outcome (summary hazard ratio [SHR] for OS = 0.42). Both WT1 and BAALC played a role in prognosis assessment at post-induction and the diagnostic performance of WT1 transcript reduction was superior to the absolute WT1 level. Post-consolidation WT1 overexpression consistently indicated an increased risk of relapse, while the combined HR for RFS was statistically insignificant (SHR = 4.22).

However, no study has been performed on the tumorigenesis role of circ-PVT1 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the correlation of circ-PVT1 with disease risk, clinical characteristics, cytogenetics/molecular genetics, and prognosis of AML. METHODS: A total of 68 de novo AML patients, 30 disease controls and 30 health donors were enrolled in this study. Circ-PVT1 expression in bone marrow (BM) was determined. Complete remission (CR) status after induction therapy, event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated in AML patients. RESULTS: Circ-PVT1 expression was different among AML patients, disease controls and health donors, which was highest in AML patients, followed by disease controls and lowest in health donors. Meanwhile, circ-PVT1 could distinguish AML patients from health donors and disease controls by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Furthermore, circ-PVT1 was correlated with BM blasts and FLT3-ITD mutation, but not other clinical features, such as French-American-Britain subtypes in AML patients. Moreover, circ-PVT1 expression was lower in AML patients with CR compared with those without CR. Besides, high circ-PVT1 expression was correlated with shorter EFS and OS in AML patients. After adjustment by multivariate Cox's regression analysis, higher circ-PVT1 expression was an independent factor in predicting shorter EFS and OS for AML patients.

We identified children and young adults with relapsed/refractory CD19+ ALL/lymphoblastic lymphoma treated on 5 CD19-directed CAR T-cell (CTL019 or humanized CART19) clinical trials or with commercial tisagenlecleucel from April 2012 to April 2019. Patients were hierarchically categorized according to leukemia cytogenetics: High-risk lesions were defined as KMT2A (MLL) rearrangements, Philadelphia-chromosome (Ph+), Ph-like, hypodiploidy, or TCF3/HLF; favorable as hyperdiploidy or ETV6/RUNX1; and intermediate as iAMP21, IKZF1 deletion, or TCF3/PBX1. Of 231 patients aged 1-29, 74 (32%) were categorized as high-risk, 28 (12%) as intermediate, 43 (19%) as favorable, and 86 (37%) as uninformative. Overall CR rate was 94%, with no difference between strata. There was no difference in relapse free survival (RFS, p=0.8112), with 2-year RFS for the high-risk group of 63% (95%CI 52-77). There was similarly no difference seen in OS (p=0.5488) with 2-year OS for the high-risk group of 70% (95%CI 60-82). For patients with KMT2A-rearranged infant ALL (n=13), 2-year RFS was 67% (95%CI 45-99), and OS was 62% (95%CI 40-95), with multivariable analysis demonstrating no increased risk of relapse (HR 0.70, 95%CI 0.21-2.90, p=0.7040), but a higher proportion of relapses associated with myeloid lineage switch, and a 3.6-fold increased risk of all-cause death (95%CI 1.04-12.75, p=0.0434). CTL019/huCART19/tisagenlecleucel are effective at achieving durable remissions across cytogenetic categories.

Standard salvage chemotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) have little curative potential. Previous studies showed that natural killer (NK) cells can be stimulated ex vivo with interleukin-12 (IL-12), IL-15, and IL-18 to generate memory-like (ML) NK cells with enhanced anti-leukemia responses. We treated nine pediatric/YA patients with post-HCT relapsed AML with donor ML NK cells on a phase I trial. Patients received fludarabine, cytarabine and filgrastim followed two weeks later by infusion of DLI and ML NK cells from the original HCT donor. ML NK cells were successfully generated from haploidentical, matched-related and matched-unrelated donors. Following infusion, donor-derived ML NK cells expanded and maintained ML multidimensional mass cytometry phenotype for over 3 months. Furthermore, ML NK cells exhibited persistent functional responses as evidenced by leukemia-triggered IFN-g production. Following DLI and ML NK cell adoptive transfer, 4 of 8 evaluable patients achieved complete remission at day 28. Two patients maintained a durable remission for over 3 months with one patient in remission for greater than two years. No significant toxicity was experienced. This study demonstrates that in a compatible immune environment post-HCT, donor ML NK cells robustly expand and persist with potent anti-leukemic activity in the absence of exogenous cytokines. ML NK cells in combination with DLI present a novel immunotherapy platform for AML that has relapsed after allogeneic HCT.

Using washed red blood cells is the most effective method for preventing such a reaction. However, the availability of other washed transfusion components, including platelets, is limited. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 69-year-old patient with acute myeloid leukemia progressed from myelodysplastic syndrome and was treated with azacitidine. She experienced a minor reaction to platelet transfusion that initially responded to the administration of corticosteroids and antihistamines. However, she worsened even after subsequent preventive treatments and was referred to the emergency department due to anaphylaxis. The patient developed hypotension, chest pain, and dyspnea 10 minutes after the initiation of platelet transfusion. DIAGNOSES: She was diagnosed with platelet-induced anaphylaxis. INTERVENTIONS: In an attempt to prevent anaphylaxis, 150 mg of omalizumab was prescribed 1 week prior to transfusion. However, she experienced anaphylaxis again and was administered intramuscular epinephrine. For the following transfusion, we treated her with a 300 mg dose of omalizumab 24 hours before the transfusion. OUTCOMES: She tolerated well and continued to receive further chemotherapy and platelet transfusion with premedication. LESSONS: This case suggests that omalizumab is a good candidate for the management of severe allergic transfusion reactions.","['Copyright (c) 2021 the Author(s).

Characterization of the genetic profile will allow risk stratification of patients before theranostic radionuclide management of advanced cancers and offers the opportunity to minimize toxicity while preserving optimal individualized efficacy in the practice of personalized precision nuclear oncology. Our review of a single-center experience of prospective radionuclide theranostic management of metastatic non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), NETs, and castration-resistant prostate cancer (metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer [mCRPC]) over the past decade, and comparison with published studies, shows that while the risk of significant myelotoxicity is generally low, at <3%, the consequences in the small minority of patients who develop MDS or AL are substantial, and survival is poor. Timely identification of patients at heightened risk of hematologic toxic complication, using novel genomic technology before institution of radionuclide therapy, will facilitate amelioration of myelotoxicity.

Because of the storage temperature, bacterial contamination of PCs can result in life-threatening infections in transfused patients. The potential of blood components to cause infections through contaminating pathogens or transmitting blood-borne diseases has always been a concern. The current safety practice to prevent pathogen transmission through blood transfusion starts with a stringent screening of donors and regulated testing of blood samples to ensure that known infections cannot reach transfusion products. Pathogen reduction technologies (PRTs), initially implemented to ensure the safety of plasma products, have been adapted to treat platelet products. In addition to reducing bacterial contamination, PRT applied to PCs can extend their shelf life up to 7 days, alleviating the impact of their shortage, while providing an additional safety layer against emerging blood-borne infectious diseases. While a deleterious action of PRTs in quantitative and qualitative aspects of plasma is accepted, the impact of PRTs on the quality, function, and clinical efficacy of PCs has been under constant examination. The potential of PRTs to prevent the possibility of new emerging diseases to reach cellular blood components has been considered more hypothetical than real.

Although these enzymes have an unremarkable DNA sequence specificity (CpG), their regional specificity is regulated by interactions with various protein factors, chromatin modifiers, and post-translational modifications of histones. Changes in the DNMT expression or interacting partners affect DNA methylation patterns. Consequently, the acquired gene expression may increase the proliferative potential of cells, often concomitant with loss of cell identity as found in cancer. Aberrant DNA methylation, including hypermethylation and hypomethylation at various genomic regions, therefore, is a hallmark of most cancers. Additionally, somatic mutations in DNMTs that affect catalytic activity were mapped in Acute Myeloid Leukemia cancer cells. Despite being very effective in some cancers, the clinically approved DNMT inhibitors lack specificity, which could result in a wide range of deleterious effects. Elucidating distinct molecular mechanisms of DNMTs will facilitate the discovery of alternative cancer therapeutic targets. This review is focused on: (i) the structure and characteristics of DNMTs, (ii) the prevalence of mutations and abnormal expression of DNMTs in cancer, (iii) factors that mediate their abnormal expression and (iv) the effect of anomalous DNMT-complexes in cancer.","['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

Herein, we aimed to construct an N6-methylandenosine (m6A)-related long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) signature to accurately predict the prognosis of patients with AML using the data downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Methods: The RNA-seq and clinical data were obtained from the TCGA AML cohort. First, Pearson correlation analysis was performed to identify the m6A-related lncRNAs. Next, univariate Cox regression analysis was used to determine the candidate lncRNAs with prognostic value. Then, feature selection was carried out by Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis, and seven eligible m6A-related lncRNAs were included to construct the prognostic risk signature. Kaplan-Meier and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed to evaluate the predictive capacity of the risk signature both in the training and testing datasets. A nomogram was used to predict 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year overall survival (OS) of AML patients. Next, the expression levels of lncRNAs in the signature were validated in AML samples by qRT-PCR. Functional enrichment analyses were carried out to identify probable biological processes and cellular pathways. The ceRNA network was developed to explore the downstream targets and mechanisms of m6A-related lncRNAs in AML. Results: Seven m6A-related lncRNAs were identified as a prognostic signature. The low-risk group hold significantly prolonged OS. The nomogram showed excellent accuracy of the signature for predicting 1-year, 2-year and 3-year OS (AUC = 0.769, 0.820, and 0.800, respectively). Moreover, the risk scores were significantly correlated with enrichment in cancer hallmark- and malignancy-related pathways and immunotherapy response in AML patients. Conclusion: We developed and validated a novel risk signature with m6A-related lncRNAs which could predict prognosis accurately and reflect the immunotherapy response in AML patients.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Li, Liang, Cheng, Guo, Li, Song, Song, Bai, Zhang, Wu and', 'Zhang.']","['Li, Ding', 'Liang, Jiaming', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'Guo, Wenbin', 'Li, Shuolei', 'Song, Wenping', 'Song, Zhenguo', 'Bai, Yongtao', 'Zhang, Yongna', 'Wu, Xuan', 'Zhang, Wenzhou']","['Li D', 'Liang J', 'Cheng C', 'Guo W', 'Li S', 'Song W', 'Song Z', 'Bai Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Wu X', 'Zhang W']","['Department of Pharmacy, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Pingtan Comprehensive Experimental Area Hospital, Fuzhou, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211116,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",2021/12/07 06:00,2021/12/07 06:01,['2021/12/06 09:20'],"['2021/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/06 09:20 [entrez]', '2021/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fcell.2021.770451 [doi]', '770451 [pii]']",epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Nov 16;9:770451. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.770451. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8637120,['NOTNLM'],"['M6A', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'immunotherapy response', 'long noncoding RNA', 'prognostic signature']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Resident and transient cells occupy and interact with some well characterized niches to produce molecular and cellular mechanisms that interfere with differentiation, migration, survival, and proliferation in this microenvironment. The acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the most common and severe hematological neoplasm in adults, arises and develop in the BM. The osteoblastic, vascular, and reticular niches provide surface co-receptors, soluble factors, cytokines, and chemokines that mediate important functions on hematopoietic cells and leukemic blasts. There are some evidences of how AML modify the architecture and function of these three BM niches, but it has been still unclear how essential those modifications are to maintain AML development. Basic studies and clinical trials have been suggesting that disturbing specific cells and molecules into the BM niches might be able to impair leukemia competencies. Either through niche-specific molecule inhibition alone or in combination with more traditional drugs, the bone marrow microenvironment is currently considered the potential target for new strategies to treat AML patients. This review describes the cellular and molecular constitution of the BM niches under healthy and AML conditions, presenting this anatomical compartment by a new perspective: as a prospective target for current and next generation therapies.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Pimenta, Varela, Datoguia, Caraciolo, Lopes and Pereira.']","['Pimenta, Debora Bifano', 'Varela, Vanessa Araujo', 'Datoguia, Tarcila Santos', 'Caraciolo, Victoria Bulcao', 'Lopes, Gabriel Herculano', 'Pereira, Welbert Oliveira']","['Pimenta DB', 'Varela VA', 'Datoguia TS', 'Caraciolo VB', 'Lopes GH', 'Pereira WO']","['Faculdade Israelita de Ciencias da Saude Albert Einstein, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Faculdade Israelita de Ciencias da Saude Albert Einstein, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Faculdade Israelita de Ciencias da Saude Albert Einstein, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Faculdade Israelita de Ciencias da Saude Albert Einstein, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Faculdade Israelita de Ciencias da Saude Albert Einstein, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Faculdade Israelita de Ciencias da Saude Albert Einstein, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211119,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",2021/12/07 06:00,2021/12/07 06:01,['2021/12/06 09:20'],"['2021/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/06 09:20 [entrez]', '2021/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fcell.2021.764698 [doi]', '764698 [pii]']",epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Nov 19;9:764698. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.764698. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8639599,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'bone marrow', 'endosteal niche', 'hematopoiesis', 'molecular targets', 'reticular niche', 'treatment', 'vascular niche']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most AML prognostic stratifications focused on genetic abnormalities. However, none of them was established based on the cell type compositions (CTCs) of peripheral blood or bone marrow aspirates from patients at diagnosis. Here we sought to develop a novel prognostic model for AML in adults based on the CTCs. First, we applied the CIBERSORT algorithm to estimate the CTCs for patients from two public datasets (GSE6891 and TCGA-LAML) using a custom gene expression signature reference constructed by an AML single-cell RNA sequencing dataset (GSE116256). Then, a CTC-based prognostic model was established using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator Cox regression, termed CTC score. The constructed prognostic model CTC score comprised 3 cell types, GMP-like, HSC-like, and T. Compared with the low-CTC-score group, the high-CTC-score group showed a 1.57-fold [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.23 to 2.00; p = 0.0002] and a 2.32-fold (95% CI, 1.53 to 3.51; p < 0.0001) higher overall mortality risk in the training set (GSE6891) and validation set (TCGA-LAML), respectively. When adjusting for age at diagnosis, cytogenetic risk, and karyotype, the CTC score remained statistically significant in both the training set [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.25; 95% CI, 1.20 to 4.24; p = 0.0119] and the validation set (HR = 7.97; 95% CI, 2.95 to 21.56; p < 0.0001]. We further compared the performance of the CTC score with two gene expression-based prognostic scores: the 17-gene leukemic stem cell score (LSC17 score) and the AML prognostic score (APS). It turned out that the CTC score achieved comparable performance at 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-years timepoints and provided independent and additional prognostic information different from the LSC17 score and APS. In conclusion, the CTC score could serve as a powerful prognostic marker for AML and has great potential to assist clinicians to formulate individualized treatment plans.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Dai, Chen, Wang and Hao.']","['Dai, Chengguqiu', 'Chen, Mengya', 'Wang, Chaolong', 'Hao, Xingjie']","['Dai C', 'Chen M', 'Wang C', 'Hao X']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Key Laboratory for Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Key Laboratory for Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Key Laboratory for Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Key Laboratory for Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211112,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",2021/12/07 06:00,2021/12/07 06:01,['2021/12/06 09:20'],"['2021/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/06 09:20 [entrez]', '2021/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fcell.2021.762260 [doi]', '762260 [pii]']",epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Nov 12;9:762260. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.762260. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8633313,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'cell type composition', 'gene expression profiles', 'prognostic model', 'transcriptome deconvolution']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanism by which ferroptosis contributes to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is to be clarified. Here, we explored erastin-induced ferroptosis in ALL cells and the impact of autophagic activity on this process. Materials and Methods: Cell viability was evaluated in various ALL cell lines following erastin treatment by the MTS assay, while cell death was evaluated via a trypan blue assay. Immunoblotting and quantitative real-time PCR were used to detect protein and mRNA expression, respectively. The UbiBrowser database was used to predict the E3 ligase of VDAC3, which was confirmed by immunoprecipitation. The role of FBXW7 in erastin-induced ferroptosis in vitro was evaluated via lentiviral-mediated silencing and overexpression. ALL xenograft mice were used to observe the impact of autophagy on erastin-induced ferroptosis. Results: Resistance to erastin-induced ferroptosis was higher in Jurkat and CCRF-CEM cells than in Reh cells. The sensitivity could be modified by the autophagy activator rapamycin (Rapa) and the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ). Rapa sensitized ALL cells to erastin-induced ferroptosis. In ALL xenograft mice, the combination treatment of Rapa and erastin resulted in longer survival time than those observed with erastin or Rapa treatment alone. VDAC3 was regulated by autophagy post-transcriptionally, mainly via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). FBXW7 was verified as a specific E3 ligase of VDAC3. FBXW7 knockdown attenuated VDAC3 degradation by suppressing its ubiquitination, thereby increasing the sensitivity of ALL cells to erastin. Conclusion: Autophagy regulated erastin-induced ferroptosis via the FBXW7-VDAC3 axis. Rapa sensitized ALL cells to erastin-induced ferroptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings provide potential therapeutic targets for ALL.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Zhu, Liu, Wu, Xu and Fan.']","['Zhu, Ting', 'Liu, Bo', 'Wu, Di', 'Xu, Gang', 'Fan, Yang']","['Zhu T', 'Liu B', 'Wu D', 'Xu G', 'Fan Y']","['Pediatric Department, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Medical Research Center, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Liaoning Key Laboratory of Research and Application of Animal Models for Environmental and Metabolic Diseases, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Medical Research Center, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Liaoning Key Laboratory of Research and Application of Animal Models for Environmental and Metabolic Diseases, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Medical Research Center, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Liaoning Key Laboratory of Research and Application of Animal Models for Environmental and Metabolic Diseases, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Pediatric Department, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Pediatric Department, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Medical Research Center, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Liaoning Key Laboratory of Research and Application of Animal Models for Environmental and Metabolic Diseases, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211115,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",2021/12/07 06:00,2021/12/07 06:01,['2021/12/06 09:20'],"['2021/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/06 09:20 [entrez]', '2021/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fcell.2021.740884 [doi]', '740884 [pii]']",epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2021 Nov 15;9:740884. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2021.740884. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8634639,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', 'autophagy', 'erastin', 'ferroptosis', 'ubiquitination']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA damage is considered a major cause of stem cell senescence. Although stem cells develop sophisticated DNA repair systems, when the intrinsic and extrinsic insults exceed the DNA repair capacity, cellular senescence, and age-related diseases inevitably occur. Therefore, the prevention and alleviation of DNA damage is an alternative to DNA repair in attenuating stem cell senescence and preventing age-related diseases. Pre-B-cell leukaemia homeobox 1 (PBX1) participates in maintaining the pluripotency of human embryonic and haematopoietic stem cells. Our recent studies showed that PBX1 promotes hair follicle-derived mesenchymal stem cell (HF-MSC) proliferation, decreases cellular senescence and apoptosis, and enhances induced pluripotent stem cell generation. Whether PBX1 attenuates HF-MSC senescence and apoptosis by alleviating DNA damage or by enhancing DNA repair remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to determine the effects of PBX1 on the intrinsic ROS or extrinsic H2O2-induced cellular senescence of HF-MSCs. To this end, we generated HF-MSCs overexpressing either PBX1, or poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1, or both. Our results showed that PBX1 overexpression attenuates HF-MSC senescence and apoptosis by alleviating reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated DNA damage instead of enhancing DNA repair. This is the first study to report that PBX1 attenuates stem cell senescence and apoptosis by alleviating DNA damage. It provides new insight into the mechanism of stem cell senescence and lays the foundation for the development of strategies for age-related disease prevention and treatment, and in particular, hair follicle repair and regeneration.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wang, Sui, Lian, Han, Liu, Zuo, Liu, Sun, Wang, Liu, Zou, Lu,', 'Jin, Du, Xu, Liu and Liu.']","['Wang, Yuan', 'Sui, Yutong', 'Lian, Aobo', 'Han, Xing', 'Liu, Feilin', 'Zuo, Kuiyang', 'Liu, Mingsheng', 'Sun, Wei', 'Wang, Ziyu', 'Liu, Zinan', 'Zou, Fei', 'Lu, Rifeng', 'Jin, Minghua', 'Du, Haiying', 'Xu, Kan', 'Liu, Xiaomei', 'Liu, Jinyu']","['Wang Y', 'Sui Y', 'Lian A', 'Han X', 'Liu F', 'Zuo K', 'Liu M', 'Sun W', 'Wang Z', 'Liu Z', 'Zou F', 'Lu R', 'Jin M', 'Du H', 'Xu K', 'Liu X', 'Liu J']","['Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Eye Center, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Neuroscience, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, United States.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Neurovascular Surgery, First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Jilin University, Changchun, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211115,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,"['Author FL was employed by the company Mayo Clinic.

The group consists of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), atypical chronic myeloid leukemia, BCR-ABL1-negative (aCML), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm with ringed sideroblasts and thrombocytosis (MDS/MPN-RS-T), and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms, unclassifiable (MDS/MPN-U). The most frequent entity in this category is CMML, while all other diseases are extremely rare. Thus, only very limited data on the epidemiology of these subgroups exists. An appropriate diagnosis and classification can be challenging since the diagnosis is still largely based on morphologic criteria and myelodysplastic as well as myeloproliferative features can be found in various occurrences. The diseases in this category share several features that are common in this specific WHO-category, but also exhibit specific traits for each disease. This review summarizes published data on epidemiological features and offers a brief overview of the main diagnostic criteria and clinical characteristics of the five MDS/MPN subgroups.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Kuendgen, Kasprzak and Germing.']","['Kuendgen, Andrea', 'Kasprzak, Annika', 'Germing, Ulrich']","['Kuendgen A', 'Kasprzak A', 'Germing U']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich-Heine-University Hospital Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich-Heine-University Hospital Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich-Heine-University Hospital Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211116,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",2021/12/07 06:00,2021/12/07 06:01,['2021/12/06 09:19'],"['2021/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/06 09:19 [entrez]', '2021/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.778741 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Nov 16;11:778741. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.778741. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8635204,['NOTNLM'],"['CMML', 'JMML', 'MDS/MPN', 'MDS/MPN-RS-T', 'MDS/MPN-U', 'aCML', 'epidemiology', 'overlap syndromes']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a typically aggressively growing and chemotherapy-resistant malignancy with a poor prognosis. T-PLL cells resemble activated, post-thymic T-lymphocytes with memory-type effector functions. Constitutive transcriptional activation of genes of the T-cell leukemia 1 (TCL1) family based on genomic inversions/translocations is recognized as a key event in T-PLL's pathogenesis. TCL1's multiple effector pathways include the enhancement of T-cell receptor (TCR) signals. New molecular dependencies around responses to DNA damage, including repair and apoptosis regulation, as well as alterations of cytokine and non-TCR activation signaling were identified as perturbed hallmark pathways within the past years. We currently witness these vulnerabilities to be interrogated in first pre-clinical concepts and initial clinical testing in relapsed/refractory T-PLL patients. We summarize here the current knowledge on the molecular understanding of T-PLL's pathobiology and critically assess the true translational progress around this to help appraisal by caregivers and patients. Overall, the contemporary concepts on T-PLL's pathobiology are condensed in a comprehensive mechanistic disease model and promising interventional strategies derived from it are highlighted.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Braun, Dechow, Friedrich, Seifert, Stachelscheid and Herling.']","['Braun, Till', 'Dechow, Annika', 'Friedrich, Gregor', 'Seifert, Michael', 'Stachelscheid, Johanna', 'Herling, Marco']","['Braun T', 'Dechow A', 'Friedrich G', 'Seifert M', 'Stachelscheid J', 'Herling M']","['Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology (CIO), Aachen-Bonn-Cologne-Duesseldorf, Excellence Cluster for Cellular Stress Response and Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne (UoC), Cologne, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology (CIO), Aachen-Bonn-Cologne-Duesseldorf, Excellence Cluster for Cellular Stress Response and Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne (UoC), Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Cellular Therapy, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry (IMB), Carl Gustav Carus Faculty of Medicine, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology (CIO), Aachen-Bonn-Cologne-Duesseldorf, Excellence Cluster for Cellular Stress Response and Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne (UoC), Cologne, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology (CIO), Aachen-Bonn-Cologne-Duesseldorf, Excellence Cluster for Cellular Stress Response and Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne (UoC), Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Cellular Therapy, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211119,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",2021/12/07 06:00,2021/12/07 06:01,['2021/12/06 09:19'],"['2021/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/06 09:19 [entrez]', '2021/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.775363 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Nov 19;11:775363. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.775363. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8639578,['NOTNLM'],"['ATM', 'T-PLL', 'TCL1A', 'clonal evolution', 'pathogenesis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Metabolic alteration, as an important hallmark of cancer cells, not only contributes to the malignant transformation of cells, but also promotes tumor progression and metastasis. As an immune-escape mechanism, the metabolic adaptation of the bone marrow microenvironment and leukemic cells is a major player in the suppression of anti-leukemia immune responses. Therefore, metabolic rewiring in leukemia would provide promising opportunities for newer therapeutic interventions. Several therapeutic agents which affect essential bioenergetic pathways in cancer cells including glycolysis, beta-oxidation of fatty acids and Krebs cycle, or anabolic pathways such as lipid biosynthesis and pentose phosphate pathway, are being tested in various types of cancers. So far, numerous preclinical or clinical trial studies using such metabolic agents alone or in combination with other remedies such as immunotherapy are in progress and have demonstrated promising outcomes. In this review, we aim to argue the importance of metabolic alterations and bioenergetic pathways in different types of leukemia and their vital roles in disease development. Designing treatments based on targeting leukemic cells vulnerabilities, particularly in nonresponsive leukemia patients, should be warranted.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Soltani, Zhao, Xia, Ganjalikhani Hakemi and Bazhin.']","['Soltani, Mojdeh', 'Zhao, Yue', 'Xia, Zhijia', 'Ganjalikhani Hakemi, Mazdak', 'Bazhin, Alexandr V']","['Soltani M', 'Zhao Y', 'Xia Z', 'Ganjalikhani Hakemi M', 'Bazhin AV']","['Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of General, Visceral, and Transplant Surgery, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of General, Visceral, and Transplant Surgery, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of General, Visceral, and Transplant Surgery, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site Munich, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211110,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",2021/12/07 06:00,2021/12/07 06:01,['2021/12/06 09:19'],"['2021/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/06 09:19 [entrez]', '2021/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.767026 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Nov 10;11:767026. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.767026. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8636012,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphocytic leukemia', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'cellular metabolism', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'immunometabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we have identified CENPE, a microtubular kinesin-like motor protein that is highly expressed in the peripheral blood of patients with chemoresistant AML. In our in vitro studies, knockdown of CENPE expression resulted in the suppression of proliferation of myeloid leukemia cells and reversal of cytarabine (Ara-C) chemoresistance. Furthermore, Lin28A, one of the RNA-binding oncogene proteins that increase cell proliferation and invasion and contribute to unfavorable treatment responses in certain malignancies, was found to be remarkably correlated with CENPE expression in chemoresistance AML. Overexpression of LIN28A promoted the proliferation and Ara-C chemoresistance of leukemic cells. RIP assay, RNA pull-down, and dual luciferase reporter analyses indicated that LIN28A bound specifically to the promoter region GGAGA of CENPE. In addition, the impacts of LIN28A on cell growth, apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and Ara-C chemoresistance were reverted by the knockdown of CENPE. Hence, Lin28A/CENPE has enhanced the proliferation and chemoresistance of AML, and therefore, it could be a prospective candidate for AML treatment.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Shi, Niu, Niu, Guo, Bai, Shi, Li, Sun, Chen and Shao.']","['Shi, Mingyue', 'Niu, Junwei', 'Niu, Xiaona', 'Guo, Honggang', 'Bai, Yanliang', 'Shi, Jie', 'Li, Weiya', 'Sun, Kai', 'Chen, Yuqing', 'Shao, Fengmin']","['Shi M', 'Niu J', 'Niu X', 'Guo H', 'Bai Y', 'Shi J', 'Li W', 'Sun K', 'Chen Y', 'Shao F']","[""Department of Hematology, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital and Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital and Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital and Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital and Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital and Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital and Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital and Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital and Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital and Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, China."", ""Department of Nephrology, Henan Provincial Key Laboratory of Kidney Disease and Immunology, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital and Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211112,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",2021/12/07 06:00,2021/12/07 06:01,['2021/12/06 09:19'],"['2021/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/06 09:19 [entrez]', '2021/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.763232 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Nov 12;11:763232. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.763232. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8632764,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'CENPE', 'LIN28A', 'cell cycle', 'chemoresistance']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a population-based study of all APL patients in Zhejiang Province, China, with a total population of 82 million people, to assess the generalization of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic as front-line treatment. The outcomes of APL patients were also analyzed. Between January 2015 and December 2019, 1,233 eligible patients were included in the final analysis. The rate of ATRA and arsenic as front-line treatment increased steadily from 66.2% in 2015 to 83.3% in 2019, with no difference among the size of the center (>/=5 or <5 patients per year, p = 0.12) or age (>/=60 or <60 years, p = 0.35). The early death (ED) rate, defined as death within 30 days after diagnosis, was 8.2%, and the 3-year overall survival (OS) was 87.9% in the whole patient population. Age (>/=60 years) and white blood cell count (>10 x 10(9)/L) were independent risk factors for ED and OS in the multivariate analysis. This population-based study showed that ATRA and arsenic as front-line treatment are widely used under real-world conditions and yield a low ED rate and a high survival rate, which mimic the results from clinical trials, thereby supporting the wider application of APL guidelines in the future.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Zhu, Ma, Yu, Ouyang, Luo, Pei, Xu, Hu, Mo, Xu, Lan, Shen,', 'Shou, Qian, Feng,

The present study aimed to investigate the role of lncRNA MIR17HG in AML. Differential expression of MIR17HG in AML was determined by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Overexpression assays and dual luciferase reporter assays were performed to determine the relationship between MIR17HG and microRNA (miR)-21, and apoptosis was analyzed by using an apoptosis assay. The results showed that the expression of MIR17HG was decreased in AML, which was further decreased following homoharringtonine (HHT)-based chemotherapy. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that miR-21 could bind with MIR17HG. However, miR-21 overexpression had no effect on the expression level of MIR17HG. Dual luciferase reporter assays were performed to verify the direct interaction between miR-21 and MIR17HG. In addition, overexpression of MIR17HG and miR-21 in AML cell lines up- and downregulated the expression level of PTEN, respectively. Furthermore, cell apoptosis showed that MIR17HG and PTEN overexpression enhanced cell apoptosis following cell treatment with HTT. However, miR-21 overexpression exerted the opposite effect, since it reversed the effects of MIR17HG and PTEN overexpression in AML cell apoptosis.

About 10-15% of patients will relapse with a 5-year OS of 57.5% for the past 20 years. As tumor microenvironment plays an important role in the disease process, many types of immunotherapy are approached. New immunotherapies including CAR-T cells have been developed for refractory B-ALL treatment. However, CAR-T treatment faces several problems, including loss of the target antigen and in vivo T-cell persistence. Here, we analyzed the tumor microenvironment of pediatric B-ALL patients in TARGET database. Using Cox analysis and PPI network, we finally sorted out the DAP10 gene. We found that DAP10 was hardly expressed in leukemic B cells. DAP10 was downregulated in B-ALL compared with normal individuals, and low expression level of DAP10 predicted poor survival. Furthermore, we found the tumor microenvironment was different in DAP10 high and low expression children. The CD8+ T cells might be hard to activate and more likely to suffer from exhaustion in DAP10 lowly expressed children. In conclusion, our results showed that DAP10 was a well biomarker to indicate the prognosis and tumor microenvironment in pediatric B-ALL.

There is, however, the potential of overloading the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) capacity when producing recombinant proteins in the seeds. This leads to an ER-stress condition and accumulating of unfolded proteins. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated to alleviate the ER-stress. With the aim to increase the yield of human epidermal growth factor (EGF) and mouse leukemia inhibitory factor (mLIF) in barley, we selected genes reported to have increased expression during ER-induced stress. The selected genes were calreticulin (CRT), protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IPI), glutathione-s-transferase (GST), HSP70, HSP26, and HSP16.9. These were knocked out using CRISPR/Cas9 or overexpressed by conventional transgenesis. The generated homozygous barley lines were crossed with barley plants expressing EGF or mLIF and the offspring plants analyzed for EGF and mLIF protein accumulation in the mature grain. All manipulated genes had an impact on the expression of UPR genes when plantlets were subjected to tunicamycin (TN). The PDI knockout plant showed decreased protein body formation, with protein evenly distributed in the cells of the endosperm. The two genes, GST and IPI, were found to have a positive effect on recombinant protein production. mLIF expression was increased in a F2 homozygous GST knockout mutant background as compared to a F2 GST wild-type offspring. The overexpression of IPI in a F1 cross showed a significant increase in EGF expression. We demonstrate that manipulation of UPR related genes can have a positive effect on recombinant protein accumulation.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Panting, Holme, Bjornsson, Zhong and Brinch-Pedersen.']","['Panting, Michael', 'Holme, Inger Baeksted', 'Bjornsson, Jon Mar', 'Zhong, Yingxin', 'Brinch-Pedersen, Henrik']","['Panting M', 'Holme IB', 'Bjornsson JM', 'Zhong Y', 'Brinch-Pedersen H']","['Department of Agroecology, Research Center Flakkebjerg, Aarhus University, Slagelse, Denmark.', 'Department of Agroecology, Research Center Flakkebjerg, Aarhus University, Slagelse, Denmark.', 'ORF Genetics, Kopavogur, Iceland.', 'National Technique Innovation Center for Regional Wheat Production, Key Laboratory of Crop Physiology and Ecology in Southern China, Ministry of Agriculture, National Engineering and Technology Center for Information Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Agroecology, Research Center Flakkebjerg, Aarhus University, Slagelse, Denmark.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211115,Switzerland,Front Plant Sci,Frontiers in plant science,101568200,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",2021/12/07 06:00,2021/12/07 06:01,['2021/12/06 09:08'],"['2021/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/06 09:08 [entrez]', '2021/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fpls.2021.755788 [doi]'],epublish,Front Plant Sci. 2021 Nov 15;12:755788. doi: 10.3389/fpls.2021.755788. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8634432,['NOTNLM'],"['CRISPR', 'barley', 'heterologous expression', 'recombinant protein', 'unfolded protein response']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

O-GlcNAcylation is a post-translational modification that results when the amino-sugar beta-D-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) is made in the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) and covalently attached to serine and threonine residues in intracellular proteins by the glycosyltransferase O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). O-GlcNAc moieties reflect the metabolic state of a cell and are removed by O-GlcNAcase (OGA). O-GlcNAcylation affects signaling pathways and protein expression by cross-talk with kinases and proteasomes and changes gene expression by altering protein interactions, localization, and complex formation. The HBP and O-GlcNAcylation are also recognized to mediate survival of cells in harsh conditions. Consequently, O-GlcNAcylation can affect many of the cellular processes that are relevant for cancer and is generally thought to promote tumor growth, disease progression, and immune escape. However, recent studies suggest a more nuanced view with O-GlcNAcylation acting as a tumor promoter or suppressor depending on the stage of disease or the genetic abnormalities, proliferative status, and state of the p53 axis in the cancer cell.

However, the therapy is mainly limited by severe acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), both being life-threatening complications after allo-HCT. GvHD develops when donor T cells do not only recognize remaining tumor cells as foreign, but also the recipient's tissue, leading to a severe inflammatory disease. Typical GvHD target organs include the skin, liver and intestinal tract. Currently all approved strategies for GvHD treatment are immunosuppressive therapies, with the first-line therapy being glucocorticoids. However, therapeutic options for glucocorticoid-refractory patients are still limited. Novel therapeutic approaches, which reduce GvHD severity while preserving GvL activity, are urgently needed. Targeting kinase activity with small molecule inhibitors has shown promising results in preclinical animal models and clinical trials. Well-studied kinase targets in GvHD include Rho-associated coiled-coil-containing kinase 2 (ROCK2), spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) and interleukin-2-inducible T-cell kinase (ITK) to control B- and T-cell activation in acute and chronic GvHD. Janus Kinase 1 (JAK1) and 2 (JAK2) are among the most intensively studied kinases in GvHD due to their importance in cytokine production and inflammatory cell activation and migration. Here, we discuss the role of kinase inhibition as novel treatment strategies for acute and chronic GvHD after allo-HCT.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Braun and Zeiser.'],"['Braun, Lukas M', 'Zeiser, Robert']","['Braun LM', 'Zeiser R']","['Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) Partner Site Freiburg, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center Freiburg (CCCF), University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Centre for Biological Signalling Studies (BIOSS) and Centre for Integrative Biological Signalling Studies (CIBSS), University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211117,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,"['RZ received honoraria from Novartis, Incyte and Mallinckrodt.

During decades, researchers have used engraftment to study the function of adhesion molecules in HSC's homeostasis regulation. Since the 90's, progress in genetically engineered mouse models has allowed a better understanding of adhesion molecules involved in HSCs regulation by BM niches and raised questions about the role of adhesion mechanisms in conferring drug resistance to cancer cells nested in the BM. This has been especially studied in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) which was the first disease in which the concept of cancer stem cell (CSC) or leukemic stem cells (LSCs) was demonstrated. In AML, it has been proposed that LSCs propagate the disease and are able to replenish the leukemic bulk after complete remission suggesting that LSC may be endowed with drug resistance properties. However, whether such properties are due to extrinsic or intrinsic molecular mechanisms, fully or partially supported by molecular crosstalk between LSCs and surrounding BM micro-environment is still matter of debate. In this review, we focus on adhesion molecules that have been involved in HSCs or LSCs anchoring to BM niches and discuss if inhibition of such mechanism may represent new therapeutic avenues to eradicate LSCs.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Grenier, Testut, Fauriat, Mancini and Aurrand-Lions.']","['Grenier, Julien M P', 'Testut, Celine', 'Fauriat, Cyril', 'Mancini, Stephane J C', 'Aurrand-Lions, Michel']","['Grenier JMP', 'Testut C', 'Fauriat C', 'Mancini SJC', 'Aurrand-Lions M']","['Aix-Marseille Universite, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), Institut Paoli Calmettes, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille (CRCM), Equipe Labellisee Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer 2020, Marseille, France.', 'Aix-Marseille Universite, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), Institut Paoli Calmettes, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille (CRCM), Equipe Labellisee Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer 2020, Marseille, France.', 'Aix-Marseille Universite, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), Institut Paoli Calmettes, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille (CRCM), Equipe Labellisee Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer 2020, Marseille, France.', 'Aix-Marseille Universite, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), Institut Paoli Calmettes, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille (CRCM), Equipe Labellisee Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer 2020, Marseille, France.', 'Aix-Marseille Universite, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), Institut Paoli Calmettes, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille (CRCM), Equipe Labellisee Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer 2020, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20211112,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",2021/12/07 06:00,2021/12/07 06:00,['2021/12/06 09:07'],"['2021/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/06 09:07 [entrez]', '2021/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2021.756231 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2021 Nov 12;12:756231. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.756231. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8636127,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*adhesion', '*bone marrow', '*haematopoiesis', '*haematopoietic stem cell', '*leukemic stem cell']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The potential mechanisms that cause relapse involve clonal evolution, innate and acquired chemoresistance, and the ability of ALL cells to escape the immune-suppressive tumor response. Currently, immunotherapy in combination with conventional treatment is used to enhance the immune response against tumor cells, thereby significantly improving the OS in patients with ALL.

Here we report a novel peptide biosensor (PABL)-ELISA assay to investigate ABL1 activity in four immortalized leukemic cell lines with different genetic background. The PABL sequence comprises an ABL1 tyrosine (Y) phosphorylation site and a targeting sequence that increases the specificity for ABL1; additional peptides (Y-site-mutated (PABL-F) and fully-phosphorylated (PPHOSPHO-ABL) biosensors) were included in the assay. After incubation with whole cell lysates, average PABL phosphorylation was significantly increased (basal vs. PABL phosphorylation: 6.84 +/- 1.46% vs. 32.44 +/- 3.25%, p-value < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA, Bonferroni post-test, percentages relative to PPHOSPHO-ABL in each cell line). Cell lines expressing ABL1-chimeric proteins (K562, ALL-SIL) presented the higher TK activity on PABL; a lower signal was instead observed for NALM6 and REH (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05 vs. K562, respectively). Phosphorylation was ABL1-mediated, as demonstrated by the specific inhibition of imatinib (p < 0.001 for K562, NALM6, ALL-SIL and p < 0.01 for REH) in contrast to ruxolitinib (JAK2-inhibitor), and occurred on the ABL1 Y-site, as demonstrated by PABL-F whose phosphorylation was comparable to basal levels. In order to validate this novel PABL-ELISA assay on leukemic cells isolated from patient's bone marrow aspirates, preliminary analysis on blasts derived from an adult affected by chronic myeloid leukaemia (BCR-ABL1 positive) and a child affected by ALL (BCR-ABL1 negative) were performed. Phosphorylation of PABL was specifically inhibited after the incubation of BCR-ABL1 positive cell lysates with imatinib, but not with ruxolitinib. While requiring further optimization and validation in leukemic blasts to be of clinical interest, the PABL-based ELISA assay provides a novel in vitro tool for screening both the aberrant ABL1 activity in BCR-ABL1 like ALL leukemic cells and their potential response to TK inhibitors.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Montecchini, Braidotti, Franca, Zudeh, Boni, Sorio,', 'Toffoletti, Rabusin, Tommasini, Decorti and Stocco.']","['Montecchini, Oksana', 'Braidotti, Stefania', 'Franca, Raffaella', 'Zudeh, Giulia', 'Boni, Christian', 'Sorio, Claudio', 'Toffoletti, Eleonora', 'Rabusin, Marco', 'Tommasini, Alberto', 'Decorti, Giuliana', 'Stocco, Gabriele']","['Montecchini O', 'Braidotti S', 'Franca R', 'Zudeh G', 'Boni C', 'Sorio C', 'Toffoletti E', 'Rabusin M', 'Tommasini A', 'Decorti G', 'Stocco G']","['Department of Medical, Surgical and Health Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.', 'Department of Medical, Surgical and Health Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.', 'Department of Medical, Surgical and Health Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.', 'Department of Life Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria, Udine, Italy.', 'Institute for Maternal and Child Health (I.R.C.C.S) Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy.', 'Department of Medical, Surgical and Health Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.', 'Institute for Maternal and Child Health (I.R.C.C.S) Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy.', 'Department of Medical, Surgical and Health Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.', 'Institute for Maternal and Child Health (I.R.C.C.S) Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy.', 'Department of Life Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211119,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",2021/12/07 06:00,2021/12/07 06:01,['2021/12/06 09:04'],"['2021/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/06 09:04 [entrez]', '2021/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fphar.2021.749361 [doi]', '749361 [pii]']",epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2021 Nov 19;12:749361. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2021.749361. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8640483,['NOTNLM'],"['ABL1 peptide biosensor', 'ABL1 tyrosin kinase inhibitors', 'ABL1-class BCR-ABL1 like acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'in vitro ELISA assay', 'precision therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No rigorous testing of this hypothesis is available to guide clinicians. METHODS: We tested whether oral dasatinib increased the frequency of dexamethasone-induced osteonecrosis in a murine model and tested its effects on dexamethasone's antileukemic efficacy in a murine BCR-ABL(+) model of ALL. RESULTS: Dasatinib did not change the frequency of osteonecrosis (p = .99) nor of arteriopathy (p = .36) in dexamethasone-treated mice when given at dosages that achieved clinically relevant steady-state dasatinib plasma concentrations of 53.1 ng/ml (95% CI: 43.5-57.3 ng/ml). These dasatinib exposures were not associated with increased dexamethasone plasma exposure in nonleukemia-bearing mice. These same dosages were not associated with any decrement in antileukemic efficacy of dexamethasone in a responsive BCR-ABL(+) model of ALL. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of our preclinical murine studies, we conclude that dasatinib is unlikely to increase the osteonecrotic effects of dexamethasone in ALL regimens.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Finch, Emily R', 'Janke, Laura J', 'Li, Lie', 'Payton, Monique A', 'Jenkins, David A', 'Crews, Kristine R', 'Relling, Mary V', 'Karol, Seth E']","['Finch ER', 'Janke LJ', 'Li L', 'Payton MA', 'Jenkins DA', 'Crews KR', 'Relling MV', 'Karol SE']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, Division of Comparative Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211205,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,,2021/12/07 06:00,2021/12/07 06:00,['2021/12/06 06:15'],"['2021/10/26 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/06 06:15 [entrez]', '2021/12/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.29490 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2021 Dec 5:e29490. doi: 10.1002/pbc.29490.,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3720-9591', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8113-8180']","['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA142665/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities', 'CA250418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM115279/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 GM115279/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA142665/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'dasatinib', 'osteonecrosis', 'preclinical models']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identification of the clinical significance and prognostic value of these small molecules in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL); a disease of heterogeneous biological landscape and clinical course, has always been of tremendous translational value. AIM: To evaluate the prognostic value of microRNA17-92 cluster members in Egyptian CLL patients. METHODS: The expression levels of miR17-92 cluster members were evaluated by qRT-PCR, including miR17, miR18a, miR19a, miR19b-1, miR20a, and miR92a-1. Other investigations included serum LDH, serum beta2 microglobulin (beta2M), CD38 and ZAP70 expression by flow cytometry, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for 17p deletion, and imaging studies (computerized tomography (CT) scans of neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis or PET-CT scans). RESULTS: Overexpression of all members of the miRNA17-92 cluster was detected in CLL patients compared to controls (p = < 0.001 for all miRs while p = 0.01 for miR19b-1). A significant positive correlation between Hb and miR17 and a significant negative correlation between Hb and miR19b-1 were observed (p = 0.041, 0.017 respectively). A statistically significant positive correlation between miR19b-1 expression and each of the WBCs and absolute lymphocytic count (ALC) was detected (p = 0.023, 0.022 respectively). Moreover, a statistically significant relation between miR19b-1 expression and advanced Binet stages was also found (p = 0.05). Regarding miR18a, a statistically significant positive correlation with LDH level was found (p = 0.003). We also found a significant positive correlation between miR92a-1 and beta2M level (p = 0.005), as well as a significant relation between miR17 and negative CD38 expression (p = 0.034). However, no significant relationships between any of studied miRNA expression levels and 17p deletion or response to treatment were observed. Patients who expressed miR19b-1 were significantly indicated to start therapy at diagnosis (p = 0.05). The overall survival of CLL patients included in our study was 90.2% after 1 year from the time of diagnosis. Patients with high expression of miR19a had better OS than those with low expression (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of all members of the miR17-92 cluster was detected in Egyptian CLL patients.

METHODS: A retrospective study of cases with OIM was carried out in a tertiary-care center. Mycological and histological examinations were performed, and the isolated organisms were identified by morphology and molecular biology. RESULTS: Fifty-five OIM patients were included, with a median age of 38 years (61.8% males). The most frequent associated disease was type-2 diabetes mellitus (61%), followed by neutropenia due to acute lymphocytic leukemia (27%). The main presentation was palatal and mandibular ulcers (92.7%) and, to a lesser extent, gingival and lingual necrosis. The diagnosis was established by mycological and histopathological studies. The most frequent fungi isolated was Rhizopus arrhizus (67.2%). CONCLUSION: OIM is a rapidly progressing disease, therefore, an early diagnosis and the proper control of predisposing factors is necessary, and consequently, contributing to improve the outcome of mucormycosis.","['Copyright (c) 2020 Sociedad Espanola de Enfermedades Infecciosas y Microbiologia', 'Clinica.

Ph-like ALL is characterized by frequent IKZF1 alterations and a kinase-activated gene expression profile similar to that of Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) ALL, yet lacks the canonical BCR-ABL1 rearrangement. Advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies during the past decade have unraveled the genomic landscape of Ph-like ALL, revealing a diverse array of kinase-activating translocations and mutations that may be amenable to targeted therapies that have set a remarkable precision medicine paradigm for patients with Ph + ALL. Collaborative scientific efforts to identify and characterise Ph-like ALL during the past decade has directly informed current precision medicine trials investigating the therapeutic potential of tyrosine kinase inhibitor-based therapies for children, adolescents, and adults with Ph-like ALL, although the most optimal treatment paradigm for this high-risk group of patients has yet to be established. Herein, we describe the epidemiology, clinical features, and biology of Ph-like ALL, highlight challenges in implementing pragmatic and cost-effective diagnostic algorithms in the clinic, and describe the milieu of treatment strategies under active investigation that strive to decrease relapse risk and improve long-term survival for patients with Ph-like ALL as has been successfully achieved for those with Ph + ALL.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

PV is the ultimate phenotypic expression of constitutive JAK2 activation since it alone of the three MPN is characterized by overproduction of normal red cells, white cells and platelets. Paradoxically, however, although PV is a panmyelopathy involving myeloid, erythroid and megakaryocytic progenitor cells, pluripotent HSC only express a single type of HGF receptor, the thrombopoietin receptor, MPL. In this review, the basis for how a pluripotent HSC with one type of HGF can give rise to three separate types of myeloid cells will be explained and it will be demonstrated that PV is actually a hormone-sensitive disorder, characterized by elevated thrombopoietin levels. Finally, it will be shown that the most common form of acute leukemia in PV is due to the inappropriate use of chemotherapy, including hydroxyurea, which facilitates expansion of DNA-damaged, mutated HSC at the expense of their normal counterparts.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent studies utilizing genomic sequencing and complementary approaches have provided key insights that are changing the way in which such leukemias are classified, and potentially, treated. Several recurrent genomic alterations define leukemias that straddle immunophenotypic entities, such as ZNF384-rearranged childhood B-ALL and B/myeloid MPAL, and BCL11B-rearranged T/myeloid MPAL, ETP-ALL and AML. In contrast, some cases of MPAL represent canonical ALL/AML entities exhibiting lineage aberrancy. For many cases of ALAL, experimental approaches indicate lineage aberrancy arises from acquisition of a founding genetic alteration into a hematopoietic stem or progenitor cell. Determination of optimal therapeutic approach requires genomic characterization of uniformly treated ALAL patients in prospective studies, but several approaches, including kinase inhibitors and BH3 mimetics may be efficacious in subsets of ALAL.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the majority of people with CH never develop an overt myeloid neoplasm, and CH can be a precursor to lymphoid cancers as well as myeloid neoplasms. In addition, CH increases all-cause mortality and augments the risk of several non-neoplastic medical conditions, including atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. CH can arise during aging, or in the context of an inherited marrow failure syndrome, aplastic anemia, or hematopoietic cell transplantation. Risk factors for progression of CH to myeloid neoplasia include larger clone size; the presence of a TP53, IDH1/2, or splicing mutation; multiple mutations; and associated cytopenias or abnormal red blood cell indices.

Therefore, new innovative approaches are urgently needed to improve outcomes for this population. CD19-targeted immunotherapies such as blinatumomab and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy have produced remarkable responses in relapsed/refractory (r/r) B-cell ALL, including clearance of minimal residual disease (MRD). Available data support the efficacy and safety of blinatumomab in older adults with advanced B-cell ALL. Therefore, its application is being extended to frontline regimens for B-cell ALL, particularly in older adults. There are several studies actively examining the role of blinatumomab alone or in combination with attenuated dosing of conventional chemotherapy or novel agents in older adults with newly diagnosed ALL and early data are encouraging. While CD19-targeted CAR (CD19CAR) T cell therapy is active in children and young adults with r/r B-cell ALL, data supporting its efficacy and safety in older adults with ALL is scarce. Furthermore, the commercially FDA approved CD19CAR T cell therapy product for r/r ALL is restricted only to patients </=25 years of age. Although there are concerns about older adults tolerating the expected toxicities associated with CAR T cell therapy, which may be life threatening, tailored approaches for prophylactic and pre-emptive interventions combined with utilization of safer CAR T cell platforms may improve tolerability and further extend the use of this promising treatment to older patients with ALL.

Fifty-two ALL-related genes were detected by high-throughput sequencing technique. The clonal heterogeneity of mutations was analyzed according to the variant allele frequency (VAF) and the results of flow cytometry. The prognostic value of mutations was also evaluated. Results: Gene mutations were detected in 121 (71.2%, 121/170) patients, of which 2 or more clones were detected in 18 (52.9%, 18/34) T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients, while only 23 (16.9%, 23/136) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients were positive of multiple mutations (P<0.01).Gene mutation-related clonal heterogeneity analysis showed that 2 or more clones were frequent in patients with NOTCH1 mutations (13/19 patients) (P<0.01). Event free survival (EFS) in patients with 3 or more clones was significantly lower than other patients (chi(2)=10.330, P=0.016).

The pooled analysis included 89 patients with TP53 aberrations receiving first-line treatment with single-agent ibrutinib (n = 45) or ibrutinib in combination with an anti-CD20 antibody (n = 44). All 89 patients had del(17p) (53% of 89 patients) and/or TP53 mutation (91% of 58 patients with TP53 sequencing results available). With a median follow-up of 49.8 months (range, 0.1-95.9), median progression-free survival was not reached. Progression-free survival rate and overall survival rate estimates at four years were 79% and 88%, respectively. Overall response rate was 93%, including complete response in 39% of patients.

To discover age-specific differences and critical drivers that mediate poor outcome in KMT2A-r ALL, we subjected KMT2A-r leukemias and normal hematopoietic cells from patients of different ages to single cell multi-omics analyses. We uncovered the following critical new insights: leukemia cells from patients younger than 6 months have significantly increased lineage plasticity. Steroid response pathways are downregulated in the most immature blasts from younger patients. We identify a hematopoietic stem and progenitor-like (HSPC-like) population in the blood of younger patients that contains leukemic blasts and form an immunosuppressive signaling circuit with cytotoxic lymphocytes. These observations offer a compelling explanation for the ability of leukemias in young patients to evade chemotherapy and immune mediated control. Our analysis also revealed pre-existing lymphomyeloid primed progenitors and myeloid blasts at initial diagnosis of B-ALL. Tracking of leukemic clones in two patients whose leukemia underwent a lineage switch documented the evolution of such clones into frank AML. These findings provide critical insights into KMT2A-r ALL and have clinical implications for molecularly targeted and immunotherapy approaches.

Treatment regimens promoting differentiation have resulted in incredible cure rates in certain AML subtypes, such as acute promyelocytic leukemia. Over the past several years, we have seen many new therapies for MDS/AML enter clinical practice, including epigenetic therapies (e.g., 5-azacitidine), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) inhibitors, fms-like kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitors, and lenalidomide for deletion 5q (del5q) MDS. Despite not being developed with the intent of manipulating differentiation, induction of differentiation is a major mechanism by which several of these novel agents function. In this review, we examine the new therapeutic landscape for these diseases, focusing on the role of hematopoietic differentiation and the impact of inflammation and aging. We review how current therapies in MDS/AML promote differentiation as a part of their therapeutic effect, and the cellular mechanisms by which this occurs. We then outline potential novel avenues to achieve differentiation in the myeloid malignancies for therapeutic purposes. This emerging body of knowledge about the importance of relieving differentiation blockade with anti-neoplastic therapies is important to understand how current novel agents function and may open avenues to developing new treatments that explicitly target cellular differentiation. Moving beyond cytotoxic agents has the potential to open new and unexpected avenues in the treatment of myeloid malignancies, hopefully providing more efficacy with reduced toxicity.",['(c) 2021.

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness against some malignancies. However, most of CAR-Ts targeting the candidate proteins on AML cells induce hematopoietic cell suppression. Because of extensive heterogeneity among different types of AML, it is essential to expand the choice of target antigen for the CAR-T treatment of AML. CD64 (FcgammaRI) is a transmembrane protein with broad expression on various types of AML cells, especially monocytic AML cells, but it is absent on hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and most of nonmonocytes. Here, we found that some types of AML patients showed the homogeneous high-level expression of CD64. So, we created a CAR-T targeting CD64 (64bbz) and further verified its high efficiency for eradicating CD64+AML cells. In addition, 64bbz showed no cytotoxicity to HSCs. Overall, we developed a new treatment option for AML by using CD64 CAR-T cells while avoiding ablation of HSCs.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The presentation of leukemic or allospecific antigens by malignant blasts is regarded as a crucial trigger for an effective allogeneic immune response. Conversely, insufficient stimulatory capacity by the leukemic blasts is thought to be a relevant escape mechanism from cellular immunotherapy (alloSCT). Our purpose was to test, whether the ability of malignant blasts to differentiate in vitro toward dendritic cells of leukemic origin (DCleu) is associated with clinical outcome. We isolated leukemic blasts from peripheral blood or bone marrow of AML and myelodysplastic syndrome patients before alloSCT (n=47) or at relapse after alloSCT (n=22). A panel of 6 different assays was used to generate DCleu in vitro. Results were correlated with clinical outcome. DCleu could be generated from all 69 samples. Significantly higher mean frequencies of DCleu were found in clinical long-term responders versus nonresponders to SCT (76.8% vs. 58.8%, P=0.006). Vice versa, the chance for response to SCT was significantly higher, if a DCleu+/dendritic cells (DC) ratio of >50% could be reached in vitro (P=0.004). Those patients were characterized by a longer time to relapse (P=0.04) and by a higher probability for leukemia-free survival (P=0.005). In vitro generation of DC and DCleu from leukemic blasts correlated with the clinical outcome. This observation may support a role of leukemic antigen presentation by ""leukemia-derived DC"" for the stimulation of an allogeneic immune response in AML.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Protegrin-1 (PG-1) is an antimicrobial peptide with effective antimicrobial activity, immunomodulatory function, and porcine growth-promoting effects. PG-1 has been detected in porcine ovaries follicles. This study aimed to investigate the effect of PG-1 on oxidative stress-induced apoptosis of porcine ovarian granulosa cells and the underlying molecular mechanism. Granulosa cells were obtained from porcine follicles and treated with H2O2 to establish the oxidative stress model, and then treated with or without PG-1 (10 mug/mL). PG-1 significantly suppressed H2O2-induced apoptosis in granulosa cells after 24 h of treatment. Furthermore, these results revealed that PG-1 increased the mRNA and protein expression of anti-apoptotic B cell lymphoma/leukemia 2 (BCL2) and the BCL2/Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX) ratio while decreasing the expression of pro-apoptotic BAX and active caspase-3. Using Western blot analysis, it was found that PG-1 decreased the phosphorylation of RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and the alpha-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha) as well as the protein expression level of CCAAT enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), all of which were increased by H2O2. Moreover, inhibitors against PERK and phospho-eIF2a both suppressed the H2O2-induced granulosa cells apoptosis and enhanced the anti-apoptosis effect of PG-1. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that PG-1 inhibited porcine ovarian granulosa cell apoptosis from oxidative stress via the PERK/eIF2alpha/CHOP signaling pathway in vitro, which suggests the novel regulatory function of the antimicrobial peptide in the ovary.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Traditional treatment includes aggressive induction therapy followed by consolidation therapy that may include a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Thus far, HSCT remains the only potentially curative therapy for many patients with AML owing to the graft-versus-leukemia effect elicited by this treatment. The use of novel therapies, specifically immunotherapy, in the treatment of AML has been limited by the lack of appropriate target antigens, therapy associated toxicities and variable success with treatment. Antigenic variability on leukemia cells and the sharing of antigens by malignant and non-malignant cells makes the identification of appropriate antigens problematic. While studies with immunotherapeutic agents are underway, prior investigations have demonstrated a mixed response with some studies prematurely discontinued due to associated toxicities.

Therefore, this study aimed to determine the signaling axis by which DTX induced the expression of TNF-alpha in U937 leukemia and MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells. DTX treatment promoted Ca(2+)-controlled autophagy and SIDT2 expression, resulting in lysosomal degradation of miR-25 in U937 cells. Downregulation of miR-25 increased NOX4 mRNA stability and protein expression. NOX4-stimulated ROS generation led to JNK-mediated phosphorylation of cytosolic HuR at Ser221, thereby increasing TNF-alpha protein expression by stabilizing TNF-alpha mRNA. Consequently, DTX induced TNF-alpha-dependent death in U937 cells. Depletion of HuR using siRNA or abolishment of JNK activation reduced TNF-alpha expression and eliminated DTX-mediated cytotoxicity. Knockdown of SIDT2 or pretreatment with chloroquine (a lysosome inhibitor) reduced DTX-induced NOX4 and TNF-alpha expression and mitigated JNK-mediated HuR phosphorylation. Altogether, our data indicate that DTX triggers HuR-mediated TNF-alpha mRNA stabilization through the Ca(2+)/SIDT2/NOX4/ROS/JNK axis, thereby inducing TNF-alpha-dependent apoptosis in U937 cells. In addition, DTX induces apoptosis in MCF-7 cells through SIDT2/NOX4/JNK/HuR axis-mediated TNF-alpha expression.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

However, evidence demonstrating that TKI are unable to fully eradicate dormant leukemic stem cells (LSC) indicate that new therapeutic strategies are needed to control LSC and to prevent relapse. In this study we investigated the metabolic pathways responsible for CML surviving to imatinib exposure and its potential therapeutic utility to improve the efficacy of TKI against stem-like CML cells. METHODS: Using complementary cell-based techniques, metabolism was characterized in a large panel of BCR-ABL+ cell lines as well as primary CD34+ stem-like cells from CML patients exposed to TKI and L-Asparaginases. Colony forming cell (CFC) assay and flow cytometry were used to identify CML progenitor and stem like-cells. Preclinical models of leukemia dormancy were used to test the effect of treatments. RESULTS: Although TKI suppressed glycolysis, compensatory glutamine-dependent mitochondrial oxidation supported ATP synthesis and CML cell survival. Glutamine metabolism was inhibited by L-asparaginases such as Kidrolase or Erwinase without inducing predominant CML cell death. However, clinically relevant concentrations of TKI render CML cells susceptible to Kidrolase. The combination of TKI with Lasparaginase reactivates the intinsic apoptotic pathway leading to efficient CML cell death.

To treat or control autoimmune diseases, one of the options is to develop immune tolerance for Tregs cell therapy, which includes promotion and activation. Recently, cell-based treatment as a promising approach to increase cells function and number has been developed. Cell therapy by chimeric T antigen receptor (CAR-T) cells has shown significant efficacy in the treatment of leukemia, which has led researchers to use CAR-T cells in other diseases like autoimmune diseases. Here, we describe the existing treatments for autoimmune diseases and the available treatments based on Treg, their benefits and restrictions for implementation in clinical trials. We also discussed potential solutions to overcome these limitations.

However, their prognostic value in the setting of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is controversial. METHODS: FLT3 and NPM1 mutational status was determined at diagnosis using single-gene polymerase chain reaction or next-generation sequencing in 247 adult patients with cytogenetically intermediate-risk AML who underwent myeloablative HCT. Multivariate Fine-Gray and Cox regression was used to analyze the cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: FLT3(ITD) and NPM1(mut) were present in 74 of 247 (30%) and 79 of 247 (32%) patients, respectively. There was no significant difference between patients without a FLT3(ITD) or NPM1(mut) (FLT3(NONITD)/NPM1(WT)) and patients with a FLT3(ITD) mutation alone (FLT3(ITD)/NPM1(WT)) with regard to CIR (P = 0.60), RFS (P = 0.91) or OS (P = 0.66). Similarly, there was no significant difference between FLT3(NONITD)/NPM1(WT) and FLT3(NONITD)/NPM1(mut) patients with regard to CIR (P = 0.70), RFS (P = 0.75) or OS (P = 0.95). The presence of a concurrent mutation in NPM1 did not appear to modify the impact of having a FLT3(ITD) mutation. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to chemotherapy-only treatment, FLT3 and NPM1 mutational status does not appear to predict outcomes in patients with cytogenetically intermediate-risk AML following HCT. These results suggest that HCT may ameliorate the poor prognostic effect of FLT3(ITD) mutation and that HCT should be considered over chemotherapy-only treatment in FLT3(ITD)-mutated AML.","['Copyright (c) 2021 International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy.

Sensitive and specific detection of gene fusions through the analysis of next-generation-based RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data is computationally challenging and may be confounded by low tumor cellularity or underlying genomic complexity. Furthermore, numerous computational tools are available to identify fusions from supporting RNA-Seq reads, yet each algorithm demonstrates unique variability in sensitivity and precision, and no clearly superior approach currently exists. To overcome these challenges, we have developed an ensemble fusion calling approach to increase the accuracy of identifying fusions. RESULTS: Our Ensemble Fusion (EnFusion) approach utilizes seven fusion calling algorithms: Arriba, CICERO, FusionMap, FusionCatcher, JAFFA, MapSplice, and STAR-Fusion, which are packaged as a fully automated pipeline using Docker and Amazon Web Services (AWS) serverless technology. This method uses paired end RNA-Seq sequence reads as input, and the output from each algorithm is examined to identify fusions detected by a consensus of at least three algorithms. These consensus fusion results are filtered by comparison to an internal database to remove likely artifactual fusions occurring at high frequencies in our internal cohort, while a ""known fusion list"" prevents failure to report known pathogenic events. We have employed the EnFusion pipeline on RNA-Seq data from 229 patients with pediatric cancer or blood disorders studied under an IRB-approved protocol. The samples consist of 138 central nervous system tumors, 73 solid tumors, and 18 hematologic malignancies or disorders. The combination of an ensemble fusion-calling pipeline and a knowledge-based filtering strategy identified 67 clinically relevant fusions among our cohort (diagnostic yield of 29.3%), including RBPMS-MET, BCAN-NTRK1, and TRIM22-BRAF fusions. Following clinical confirmation and reporting in the patient's medical record, both known and novel fusions provided medically meaningful information. CONCLUSIONS: The EnFusion pipeline offers a streamlined approach to discover fusions in cancer, at higher levels of sensitivity and accuracy than single algorithm methods. Furthermore, this method accurately identifies driver fusions in pediatric cancer, providing clinical impact by contributing evidence to diagnosis and, when appropriate, indicating targeted therapies.",['(c) 2021.

Although it is well-known that adult and pediatric AMLs are genetically distinct diseases, the driver genes for high-risk pediatric and adult AMLs are still not fully understood. Particularly, the interactions between RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) for high-risk AMLs have not been explored. AIM: To identify RBPs and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) that are the master regulators of high-risk AML. METHODS: In this manuscript, we identify over 400 upregulated genes in high-risk adult and pediatric AMLs respectively with the expression profiles of TCGA and TARGET cohorts. There are less than 5% genes commonly upregulated in both cohorts, highlighting the genetic differences in adult and childhood AMLs. A novel distance correlation test is proposed for gene regulatory network construction. We build RBP-based regulatory networks with upregulated genes in high-risk adult and pediatric AMLs, separately. RESULTS: We discover that three RBPs, three snoRNAs, and two circRNAs function together and regulate over 100 upregulated RNA targets in adult AML, whereas two RBPs are associated with 17 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and all together regulate over 90 upregulated RNA targets in pediatric AML. Of which, two RBPs, MLLT3 and RBPMS, and their circRNA targets, PTK2 and NRIP1, are associated with the overall survival (OS) in adult AML (p </= 0.01), whereas two different RBPs, MSI2 and DNMT3B, and 13 (out of 17) associated lncRNAs are prognostically significant in pediatric AML. CONCLUSIONS: Both RBPs and ncRNAs are known to be the major regulators of transcriptional processes. The RBP-ncRNA pairs identified from the regulatory networks will allow better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying high-risk adult and pediatric AMLs, and assist in the development of novel RBPs and ncRNAs based therapeutic strategies.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

There is no standard treatment for relapsed or refractory (r/r) ATL, and clinical outcomes are poor. This systematic review examined the survival outcomes for r/r ATL treated with various systemic therapies. METHODS: EMBASE and PubMed were searched for studies on r/r ATL, published between January 2010 and January 2020. The main outcome of interest was overall survival (OS). Median OS and an exploratory 30% OS time were assessed based on published data and Kaplan-Meier curves. RESULTS: There were 21 unique treatment subgroups (from 14 studies), that met the eligibility criteria. Nine subgroups were mogamulizumab treatment, two were mogamulizumab prior to allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), five were allo-HSCT, and five were other chemotherapy. Respectively, the median OS and 30% OS varied considerably in range for mogamulizumab treatment (2.2-17.6 months and 8.7-27.1 months), allo-HSCT (3.8-6.2 months and 7.5-19.8 months), and other chemotherapy arms (4.1-20.3 months and 7.1-17.0 months). CONCLUSION: Mogamulizumab was the most frequently studied treatment regimen and can potentially provide longer survival compared with chemotherapy alone. Future comparisons with synthetic or historical control arms may enable clearer insights into treatment efficacy.","['(c) 2021 Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd.

However, the known potential of high-dose steroids to significantly elevate intraocular pressure (IOP) and lead to glaucomatous optic neuropathy has not been intensively investigated in children with ALL. Moreover, as children with ALL do not routinely undergo IOP measurements, the need for IOP monitoring and therapy is unknown. We prospectively measured IOP in 90 children with newly diagnosed ALL attending a tertiary paediatric haematology/oncology centre, at diagnosis and at the middle and end of induction therapy. Ocular hypertension (IOP > 21 mm Hg) at any time point was documented in 64 children (71%), and the prevalence increased during induction. Thirty-six children (40%) had elevated IOP at ALL diagnosis before therapy initiation, and stratification to non-standard ALL was a risk factor. IOP reduction therapy was administered to 13 children (14%); none required surgery. Values normalised in all cases. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, dexamethasone therapy was a significant risk factor for ocular hypertension. High body mass index was an additional risk factor in children with elevated IOP at ALL diagnosis.

However, progress in targeting cancer metabolism therapeutically in the past decade has been limited. Only a few metabolism-based drugs for cancer have been successfully developed, some of which are in - or en route to - clinical trials. Strategies for targeting the intrinsic metabolism of cancer cells often did not account for the metabolism of non-cancer stromal and immune cells, which have pivotal roles in tumour progression and maintenance. By considering immune cell metabolism and the clinical manifestations of inborn errors of metabolism, it may be possible to isolate undesirable off-tumour, on-target effects of metabolic drugs during their development. Hence, the conceptual framework for drug design must consider the metabolic vulnerabilities of non-cancer cells in the tumour immune microenvironment, as well as those of cancer cells. In this Review, we cover the recent developments, notable milestones and setbacks in targeting cancer metabolism, and discuss the way forward for the field.",['(c) 2021.

However, the complete understanding of their complex mechanism of action is still unreached. Here, we unraveled a novel mode of action of the LSD1 inhibitors MC2580 and DDP-38003, showing that they can induce differentiation of AML cells through the downregulation of the chromatin protein GSE1. Analysis of the phenotypic effects of GSE1 depletion in NB4 cells showed a strong decrease of cell viability in vitro and of tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that a set of genes associated with immune response and cytokine-signaling pathways are upregulated by LSD1 inhibitors through GSE1-protein reduction and that LSD1 and GSE1 colocalize at promoters of a subset of these genes at the basal state, enforcing their transcriptional silencing. Moreover, we show that LSD1 inhibitors lead to the reduced binding of GSE1 to these promoters, activating transcriptional programs that trigger myeloid differentiation.

Up to now, only a few cases of JMML with -5/5q- and HLH secondary to JMML were described. Here we described an extremely rare case of HLH second to JMML with 5q-. PATIENT CONCERNS: The patient had multiple cafe-au-lait-spots at birth and was found that NF1 gene mutation was positive. At his 6 years old, he developed hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, monocyte count 4.12x109/L in peripheral blood, 13% blasts in peripheral blood, and 11% blasts in bone marrow, without BCR/ABL rearrangement, combining with positive NF1 gene mutation, he was diagnosed as JMML. In the bone marrow, there was chromosomal abnormalities with -5/5q-. In the treatment, HLH occurred. DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed as secondary HLH to JMML. INTERVENTIONS: The patient received the chemotherapy treatment of the improved diffuse alveolar hemorrhage protocol, and meanwhile, he prepared for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Then on the basis of anti-infection, symptomatic and supportive therapy, he was commenced the treatment according to the HLH-2004 protocol. OUTCOMES: He had a partial response, manifesting that his fever resolved, but the blood coagulation function did not improve, and the severe thrombocytopenia remained. Then, the parents refused the continual treatment, and the child died of intracranial hemorrhage 3 months after the diagnosis of JMML. LESSONS: JMML and HLH were relatively easy to diagnose based on clinical and laboratory results. Due to the low incidence of JMML with -5/5q- and HLH secondary to JMML, no clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of the disease have been established yet. The clinical data of a case of HLH secondary to JMML with 5q- were analyzed, and relevant studies were studied.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Three children received CHOEP chemotherapy including cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, etoposide, while 1 child received CHOP. Two children received induction as per acute lymphoblastic leukemia followed by Bendamustine. Two patients succumbed to progressive disease, the infant with PTCL-NOS and 1 child with hepatosplenic TCL. Three children were in remission (median follow up of 44 mo). One child with PTCL-NOS Stage IV had an underlying STAT3 mutated hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome and was in remission 12 months post a matched unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. He had grade 4 skin graft versus host disease and required extracorporeal photopheresis and ibrutinib, to which he had responded.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Initial dosing regimens were: 1A (Day 1; 21-day cycle; dose 12.5-350 mg); 2A (Days 1-14; 28-day cycle; dose 1-20 mg). Alternative regimens included 1B (Days 1 and 8; 28-day cycle) and 2C (Days 1-7; 28-day cycle). The primary endpoint was incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) during Cycle 1. RESULTS: Overall, 115 patients with solid tumors and 93 with hematologic malignancies received treatment. DLTs occurred in 8/92 patients with solid tumors and 10/53 patients with hematologic malignancies. In solid tumors, an RDE of 120 mg was defined in 1B. In hematologic tumors, RDEs were defined in 1A: 250 mg, 1B: 120 mg, and 2C: 45 mg. More patients with hematologic malignancies compared with solid tumors experienced Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events (71% vs. 45%), most commonly resulting from myelosuppression. These were more frequent and severe in patients with hematologic malignancies; 22 patients exhibited tumor lysis syndrome. Overall response rates at the RDEs were 10.3% (95% CI, 2.2-27.4) in solid tumors and 4.2% (95% CI, 0.1-21.1), 20% (95% CI, 4.3-48.1), or 22.2% (95% CI, 8.6-42.3) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in 1B, 1A, and 2C, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A common safety profile was identified and preliminary activity was noted, particularly in AML.

OBJECTIVE: To identify oral manifestations as the first clinical signs of leukemia. METHODS: This is an integrative review, that gathered data from articles with oral manifestations of leukemia as part of its first clinical features. The were included case reports, case series, clinical research, or reviews with case reports. The variables that were considered relevant: age, sex, sites of the oral lesions, characteristics of the oral lesions, medical history and physical examination, time of evolution, radiographic examination, blood test results, initial diagnosis, differential diagnosis and final diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 31 studies were included, with a total of 33 individuals identified. There were 19 (57.57%) males and 14 (42.42%) females. The age range was from 1.6 to 74 years. Acute myeloid leukemia (72.72%) and acute lymphoid leukemia (18.18%) presented more oral manifestations as the first clinical signs of the disease. All individuals with leukemia presented lesions, such as ulcer, erosion, bleeding, ecchymosis, color change of the bluish or pale mucous membranes and areas of tissue necrosis. Hard tissue lesions were less frequent, being 6 (18.18%). CONCLUSION: The first clinical manifestations of leukemia can be present in the oral cavity, mainly in acute myeloid leukemia. The principal oral tissues affected were gingival tissue, buccal mucosa and hard and/or soft palate. When hard tissues, such as the maxilla bone or mandible bone were affected, dental mobility was the principal clinical sign.","['Copyright (c) 2021.

To gain insight into the clonal architecture of acquired genomic resistance to BTK inhibitors and BCL2 inhibitors in CLL, particularly in patients carrying multiple resistance mutations, we performed targeted single-cell DNA sequencing of eight patients who developed progressive disease (PD) on TAs (either class). In all cases, analysis of single-cell architecture revealed mutual exclusivity between multiple resistance mutations to the same TA class, variable clonal co-occurrence of multiple mutations affecting different TAs in patients exposed to both classes, and a phenomenon of multiple independent emergences of identical nucleotide changes leading to canonical resistance mutations. We also report the first observation of established BCL2 resistance mutations in a patient with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) following PD on sequential monotherapy, implicating BCL2 as a venetoclax resistance mechanism in MCL. Taken together, these data reveal the significant clonal complexity of CLL and MCL progression on TAs at the nucleotide level and confirm the presence of multiple, clonally independent, mechanisms of TA resistance within each individual disease context.",['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society of Hematology.'],"['Thompson, Ella R', 'Nguyen, Tamia', 'Kankanige, Yamuna', 'Markham, John F', 'Anderson, Mary Ann', 'Handunnetti, Sasanka M', 'Thijssen, Rachel', 'Yeh, Paul Sung-Hao', 'Tam, Constantine S', 'Seymour, John F', 'Roberts, Andrew W', 'Westerman, David A', 'Blombery, Piers']","['Thompson ER', 'Nguyen T', 'Kankanige Y', 'Markham JF', 'Anderson MA', 'Handunnetti SM', 'Thijssen R', 'Yeh PS', 'Tam CS', 'Seymour JF', 'Roberts AW', 'Westerman DA', 'Blombery P']","['Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre & Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Peter McCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VI, Australia.', ""Peter MacCallum Cancer Center & St. Vincent's Hospital and the University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia."", 'Department of Hematology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre and Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical research, Parkville, Australia.', 'Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211203,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,,2021/12/04 06:00,2021/12/04 06:00,['2021/12/03 20:28'],"['2021/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/15 00:00 [revised]', '2021/12/03 20:28 [entrez]', '2021/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/04 06:00 [medline]']","['482896 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2021006211 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Blood Adv. 2021 Dec 3. pii: 482896. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2021006211.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-8790-4675', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9759-5017', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2188-6835', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7341-5720']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, the aim of this prospective clinical trial was to investigate safety and efficacy of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination in five selected groups of immunocompromised patients and healthy controls. METHODS: 539 study subjects (449 patients and 90 controls) were included. The patients had either primary (n=90), or secondary immunodeficiency disorders due to human immunodeficiency virus infection (n=90), allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation/CAR T cell therapy (n=90), solid organ transplantation (SOT) (n=89), or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (n=90). The primary endpoint was seroconversion rate two weeks after the second dose. The secondary endpoints were safety and documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. FINDINGS: Adverse events were generally mild, but one case of fatal suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction occurred. 72.2% of the immunocompromised patients seroconverted compared to 100% of the controls (p=0.004). Lowest seroconversion rates were found in the SOT (43.4%) and CLL (63.3%) patient groups with observed negative impact of treatment with mycophenolate mofetil and ibrutinib, respectively. INTERPRETATION: The results showed that the mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine was safe in immunocompromised patients. Rate of seroconversion was substantially lower than in healthy controls, with a wide range of rates and antibody titres among predefined patient groups and subgroups. This clinical trial highlights the need for additional vaccine doses in certain immunocompromised patient groups to improve immunity.

However, factors associated with their health care use at the EOL are unknown. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of 168 deceased patients with AML within the United States. We assessed quality of life (QOL) (Functional-Assessment-Cancer-Therapy-Leukemia), and psychological distress (Hospital-Anxiety-and-Depression Scale [HADS]; Patient-Health-Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]) at diagnosis. We used multivariable logistic regression models to examine the association between patient-reported factors and the following outcomes: (1) hospitalizations in the last 7 days of life, (2) receipt of chemotherapy in the last 30 days of life, and (3) hospice utilization. Results: About 66.7% (110/165) were hospitalized in the last 7 days of life, 51.8% (71/137) received chemotherapy in the last 30 days of life, and 40.7% (70/168) utilized hospice. In multivariable models, higher education (odds ratio [OR] = 1.54, p = 0.006) and elevated baseline depression symptoms (PHQ-9: OR = 1.09, p = 0.028) were associated with higher odds of hospitalization in the last seven days of life, while higher baseline QOL (OR = 0.98, p = 0.009) was associated with lower odds of hospitalization at the EOL. Higher baseline depression symptoms were associated with receipt of chemotherapy at the EOL (HADS-Depression: OR = 1.10, p = 0.042). Higher education was associated with lower hospice utilization (OR = 0.356, p = 0.024). Conclusions: Patients with AML who are more educated, with higher baseline depression symptoms and lower QOL, were more likely to experience high health care utilization at the EOL. These populations may benefit from interventions to optimize the quality of their EOL care.",,"['Vaughn, Dagny M', 'Johnson, P Connor', 'Jagielo, Annemarie D', 'Topping, Carlisle E W', 'Reynolds, Matthew J', 'Kavanaugh, Alison R', 'Webb, Jason A', 'Fathi, Amir T', 'Hobbs, Gabriela', 'Brunner, Andrew', ""O'Connor, Nina"", 'Luger, Selina', 'Bhatnagar, Bhavana', 'LeBlanc, Thomas W', 'El-Jawahri, Areej']","['Vaughn DM', 'Johnson PC', 'Jagielo AD', 'Topping CEW', 'Reynolds MJ', 'Kavanaugh AR', 'Webb JA', 'Fathi AT', 'Hobbs G', 'Brunner A', ""O'Connor N"", 'Luger S', 'Bhatnagar B', 'LeBlanc TW', 'El-Jawahri A']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Medical Oncology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology/Oncology, West Virginia University Cancer Institute, Wheeling Hospital, Wheeling, West Virginia, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapy, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211203,United States,J Palliat Med,Journal of palliative medicine,9808462,IM,,2021/12/04 06:00,2021/12/04 06:00,['2021/12/03 20:09'],"['2021/12/03 20:09 [entrez]', '2021/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/jpm.2021.0249 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Palliat Med. 2021 Dec 3. doi: 10.1089/jpm.2021.0249.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-3943-6608'],,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'end-of-life', 'health care utilization', 'palliative care']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Novel treatment strategies are therefore needed to improve patient outcomes. Here, we performed direct drug testing on primary CLL cells and identified synergy between eight different mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors and the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) antagonist venetoclax. Drug sensitivity was independent of immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene variable region (IGVH) and tumor protein p53 (TP53) mutational status, and CLL cells from idelalisib-resistant patients remained sensitive to the treatment. This suggests that combined MEK/Bcl-2 inhibition may be an option for high-risk CLL. To test whether sensitivity could be detected in other B-cell malignancies, we performed drug testing on cell line models of CLL (n = 4), multiple myeloma (MM; n = 8), and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL; n = 7). Like CLL, MM cells were sensitive to the MEK inhibitor trametinib, and synergy was observed with venetoclax. In contrast, MCL cells were unresponsive to MEK inhibition. To investigate the underlying mechanisms of the disease-specific drug sensitivities, we performed flow cytometry-based high-throughput profiling of 31 signaling proteins and regulators of apoptosis in the 19 cell lines. We found that high expression of the antiapoptotic proteins myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) or B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL) predicted low sensitivity to trametinib + venetoclax. The low sensitivity could be overcome by combined treatment with an Mcl-1 or Bcl-xL inhibitor. Our findings suggest that MEK/Bcl-2 inhibition has therapeutic potential in leukemia and myeloma, and demonstrate that protein expression levels can serve as predictive biomarkers for treatment sensitivities.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Here, we evaluated the antibody response to a third BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in patients with CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) who failed to achieve a humoral response after standard two-dose vaccination regimen. Anti-SARS-CoV-2S and neutralizing antibodies were measured 3 weeks after administration of the third dose. In 172 patients with CLL the antibody response rate was 23.8%. Response rate among actively treated patients (12.0%, n=12/100) was lower compared to treatment-naive patients (40.0%, n=16/40; OR=4.9, 95% CI 1.9-12.9; p<0.001) and patients off-therapy (40.6%, n=13/32; OR=5.0, 95% CI 1.8-14.1; p<0.001), (p<0.001). In those actively treated with BTK inhibitors or venetoclax +/- anti-CD20 antibody, response rates were extremely low (15.3%, n=9/59 and 7.7%, n=3/39, respectively). Only one of the 28 patients (3.6%) treated with anti-CD20 antibodies <12 months prior to vaccination responded. The anti-SARS-CoV-2S antibody levels correlated linearly with neutralizing antibody titers (r=0.732, p<0.001). In a multivariate analysis, the independent variables that were associated with response included lack of active therapy (OR=5.6, 95% CI 2.3-13.8; p<0.001) and serum IgA levels >/=80 mg/dL (OR=5.8, 95% CI 2.1-15.9; p<0.001) In conclusion, in patients with CLL/SLL who failed to achieve a humoral response after standard two-dose BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination regimen, close to a quarter responded to the third dose of vaccine.

Amongst many epigenetic marks, methylation of histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) is one of the most widely conserved and occupies a central position in gene expression. Mixed lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1/KMT2A) is the founding mammalian H3K4 methyltransferase. It was discovered as the causative mutation in early onset leukemia and subsequently found to be required for the establishment of definitive hematopoiesis and the maintenance of adult hematopoietic stem cells. Despite wide expression, the roles of MLL1 in non-hematopoietic tissues remain largely unexplored. To bypass hematopoietic lethality, we used bone marrow transplantation and conditional mutagenesis to discover that the most overt phenotype in adult Mll1-mutant mice is intestinal failure. MLL1 is expressed in intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and transit amplifying (TA) cells but not in the villus. Loss of MLL1 is accompanied by loss of ISCs and a differentiation bias towards the secretory lineage with increased numbers and enlargement of goblet cells. Expression profiling of sorted ISCs revealed that MLL1 is required to promote expression of several definitive intestinal transcription factors including Pitx1, Pitx2, Foxa1, Gata4, Zfp503 and Onecut2, as well as the H3K27me3 binder, Bahcc1.

Given their very low frequency, discovering and testing disease-causing rare germline variations remains challenging. The tag-single nucleotide polymorphism rs17728461 in 22q12.2 is highly associated with lung cancer risk. Here, we identified a functional rare germline variation rs548071605 (A>G) in a p65-responsive enhancer located within 22q12.2. The enhancer significantly promoted lung cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model by upregulating the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) gene via the formation of a chromatin loop. Differential expression of LIF and its significant correlation with first progression survival time of patients further supported the lung cancer-driving effects of the 22q-Enh enhancer. Importantly, the rare variation was harbored in the p65 binding sequence and dramatically increased the enhancer activity by increasing responsiveness of the enhancer to p65 and B-cell lymphoma 3 protein, an oncoprotein that assisted the p65 binding.

Although ART systems have evolved rapidly over the decades, it is still difficult to diagnose uterine conditions suitable for embryo transfer (ET) without the use of invasive endometrial procedures. Previous studies in mice showed that leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a well-known endometrial biomarker for uterine implantation capacity, also known as uterine receptivity. This study focused on LIF in the mouse and human cervix as a possible biomarker of implantation capacity. We found that high expression of LIF in the cervical epithelium is strongly correlated with that of the uterine epithelium during the peri-implantation period in mice. Likewise, human cervical epithelia also exhibit elevated levels of LIF in the peri-implantation period. In addition, cervical LIF is downregulated in mice with defective implantation caused by pharmacological treatments.

However, its role in tumors has been reported in several cancers, such as B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, medulloblastoma, neuroblastoma, and glioblastoma. Based on TCGA and GEO data, our first pancancer study of MXD3 confirmed the high expression of MXD3 in cancer tissues. Our results revealed that patients suffering from cancers with higher MXD3 expression had poor OS, DSS, DFI, and PFI. We further explored the methylation status of the MXD3 gene body and gene promoter in cancer. Patients with a higher MXD3 gene body have better OS, while the prognosis of patients with a high MXD3 promoter is more complex. We also verified the differential expression of three clinical phenotypes of MXD3: age, sex, and tumor stage, in a variety of tumors, suggesting a correlation between MXD3 and clinical characteristics. We explored the negative relationship between MXD3 and TMB and MSI in most types of cancer, indicating the poor prognosis of patients with high MXD3 expression. We further investigated the relationship between MXD3 and immune infiltrating cells and identified the relationship between MXD3 and immune genes, immunosuppressive genes, and antigen-presenting genes. All of the above findings established a solid relationship between MXD3 and the immune environment and immune cells. These results demonstrated that MXD3 might also be a potential immune factor. We also found a higher expression of MXD3 and promoter according to the increasing glioma WHO grade or histologic types. Glioma patients with high MXD3 or MXD3 promoter expression had poor survival. Finally, we used IHC to verify the higher expression of MXD3 in glioma samples compared to normal samples. Our study shows that MXD3, as a poor prognostic factor, plays a significant role in many cancers, especially glioma. Although more clinical evidence for MXD3 as a clinical therapeutic target and an immunotherapy site is needed, MXD3 can play an important guiding role in multiple clinical treatments, including immunotherapy and demethylation therapy.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Zhang, He, Li, Xu, Chen, Liu, Hu, Xiong and Xu.']","['Zhang, Xiaoyu', 'He, Xiaoqin', 'Li, Yue', 'Xu, Yangtao', 'Chen, Wenliang', 'Liu, Xin', 'Hu, Xinyao', 'Xiong, Lin', 'Xu, Ximing']","['Zhang X', 'He X', 'Li Y', 'Xu Y', 'Chen W', 'Liu X', 'Hu X', 'Xiong L', 'Xu X']","['Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211111,Switzerland,Front Mol Biosci,Frontiers in molecular biosciences,101653173,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",2021/12/04 06:00,2021/12/04 06:01,['2021/12/03 07:08'],"['2021/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/03 07:08 [entrez]', '2021/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fmolb.2021.702206 [doi]', '702206 [pii]']",epublish,Front Mol Biosci. 2021 Nov 11;8:702206. doi: 10.3389/fmolb.2021.702206. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8632067,['NOTNLM'],"['MXD3', 'cancer', 'immune', 'immune infiltrating cell', 'methylation', 'prognosis']",,,,,,,,,['Front Mol Biosci. 2021 Dec 22;8:826905.

Even though it is still controversial about the possible explanation for clinical cases of long-term viral shedding, it remains unclear whether the persistent viral shedding means re-infection or recurrence. Methods: Specimens were collected from three COVID-19-confirmed patients, and whole-genome sequencing was performed on these clinical specimens during their first hospital admission with a high viral load of SARS-CoV-2. Laboratory tests were examined and analyzed throughout the whole course of the disease. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out for SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes. Results: We found haplotypes of SARS-CoV-2 co-infection in two COVID-19 patients (YW01 and YW03) with a long period of hospitalization. However, only one haplotype was observed in the other patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (YW02), which was verified as one kind of viral haplotype. Patients YW01 and YW02 were admitted to the hospital after being infected with COVID-19 as members of a family cluster, but they had different haplotype characteristics in the early stage of infection; YW01 and YW03 were from different infection sources; however, similar haplotypes were found together. Conclusion: These findings show that haplotype diversity of SARS-CoV-2 may result in viral adaptation for persistent shedding in multiple recurrences of COVID-19 patients, who met the discharge requirement. However, the correlation between haplotype diversity of SARS-CoV-2 virus and immune status is not absolute. It showed important implications for the clinical management strategies for COVID-19 patients with long-term hospitalization or cases of recurrence.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wu, Zheng, Liu, Liu, Tang, He, Xu, Li, Yu, Xing and Xia.']","['Wu, Yingping', 'Zheng, Shufa', 'Liu, Tian', 'Liu, Xueke', 'Tang, Huina', 'He, Yutong', 'Xu, Wei', 'Li, Lele', 'Yu, Wenxu', 'Xing, Ke', 'Xia, Xiaoping']","['Wu Y', 'Zheng S', 'Liu T', 'Liu X', 'Tang H', 'He Y', 'Xu W', 'Li L', 'Yu W', 'Xing K', 'Xia X']","['Fourth Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Jinhua, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, National Clinical Research Centre for Infectious Diseases, Collaborative Innovation Centre for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Fourth Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Jinhua, China.', 'Fourth Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Jinhua, China.', 'Fourth Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Jinhua, China.', 'School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Fourth Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Jinhua, China.', 'Fourth Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Jinhua, China.', 'Fourth Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Jinhua, China.', 'School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Fourth Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Jinhua, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20211103,Switzerland,Front Cell Infect Microbiol,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,101585359,IM,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",2021/12/04 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/12/03 07:07'],"['2021/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/03 07:07 [entrez]', '2021/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcimb.2021.715143 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Infect Microbiol. 2021 Nov 3;11:715143. doi: 10.3389/fcimb.2021.715143. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8631178,['NOTNLM'],"['*COVID-19', '*SARS-CoV-2', '*prolonged viral shedding', '*viral haplotype', '*whole-genome sequencing']",20211207,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",,"['*COVID-19', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Phylogeny', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Virus Shedding']",,,,,,,,,,

Based on the B cell count, MBL is further classified into 2 distinct subtypes: 'low-count' and 'high-count' MBL. High-count MBL shares a series of biological and clinical features with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), at least of the indolent type, and evolves to CLL requiring treatment at a rate of 1-2% per year, whereas 'low-count' MBL seems to be distinct, likely representing an immunological rather than a pre-malignant condition. That notwithstanding, both subtypes of MBL can carry 'CLL-specific' genomic aberrations such as cytogenetic abnormalities and gene mutations, yet to a much lesser extent compared to CLL. These findings suggest that such aberrations are mostly relevant for disease progression rather than disease onset, indirectly pointing to microenvironmental drive as a key contributor to the emergence of MBL. Understanding microenvironmental interactions is therefore anticipated to elucidate MBL ontogeny and, most importantly, the relationship between MBL and CLL.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Galigalidou, Zaragoza-Infante, Iatrou, Chatzidimitriou,', 'Stamatopoulos and Agathangelidis.']","['Galigalidou, Chrysi', 'Zaragoza-Infante, Laura', 'Iatrou, Anastasia', 'Chatzidimitriou, Anastasia', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas', 'Agathangelidis, Andreas']","['Galigalidou C', 'Zaragoza-Infante L', 'Iatrou A', 'Chatzidimitriou A', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Agathangelidis A']","['Institute of Applied Biosciences (INAB), Centre for Research and Technology Hellas (CERTH), Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences (INAB), Centre for Research and Technology Hellas (CERTH), Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Hematology Department, University General Hospital of Thessaloniki AHEPA, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences (INAB), Centre for Research and Technology Hellas (CERTH), Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences (INAB), Centre for Research and Technology Hellas (CERTH), Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences (INAB), Centre for Research and Technology Hellas (CERTH), Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences (INAB), Centre for Research and Technology Hellas (CERTH), Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Biology, School of Science, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211111,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",2021/12/04 06:00,2021/12/04 06:01,['2021/12/03 07:07'],"['2021/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/03 07:07 [entrez]', '2021/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/04 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.769612 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Nov 11;11:769612. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.769612. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8631769,['NOTNLM'],"['B cell receptor', 'chronic Lymphocutic Leukemia (CLL)', 'genetics', 'immunogenetics', 'immunoglobulin', 'monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis (MBL)', 'ontogenesis', 'tumor microenvironment']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ibrutinib treatment can be limited by adverse events (AEs) including atrial fibrillation, arthralgias, rash, diarrhea, and bleeding events, leading to drug discontinuation in 4%-26% of patients. Acalabrutinib, a second-generation BTK inhibitor, is approved by the FDA to treat adult patients with CLL/SLL or MCL (relapsed after 1 prior therapy); and by the EMA to treat adult patients with CLL or R/R MCL. The most common AE associated with acalabrutinib is headache of limited duration, which occurs in 22%-51% of patients, and is mainly grade 1-2 in severity, with only 1% of patients experiencing grade >/=3 headache. Furthermore, acalabrutinib is associated with a low incidence of atrial fibrillation. Zanubrutinib, a selective next-generation covalent BTK inhibitor, is approved by the FDA to treat adult patients with MCL who have received >/=1 prior therapy, and is under investigation for the treatment of patients with CLL. In the phase 3 SEQUOIA trial in patients with CLL, the most common grade >/=3 AEs were neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased and infections.

An effective and safe CAR-T cell therapy strategy relies on identifying an antigen that has high expression and is tumor specific. This strategy has been successfully used to treat patients with CD19 (+) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Finding a suitable target antigen for other cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has proven challenging, as the majority of currently targeted AML antigens are also expressed on hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) or mature myeloid cells. Herein, we developed a computational method to perform a data transformation to enable the comparison of publicly available gene expression data across different datasets or assay platforms. The resulting transformed expression values (TEVs) were used in our antigen prediction algorithm to assess suitable tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) that could be targeted with CAR-T cells. We validated this method by identifying B-ALL antigens with known clinical effectiveness, such as CD19 and CD22. Our algorithm predicted TAAs being currently explored preclinically and in clinical CAR-T AML therapy trials, as well as novel TAAs in pediatric megakaryoblastic AML. Thus, this analytical approach presents a promising new strategy to mine diverse datasets for identifying TAAs suitable for immunotherapy.","['(c) 2021 The Author(s).

Its complexity in the human bone marrow, in particular in a context of hematological malignancy, is more difficult to decipher by these strategies and could benefit from the knowledge acquired on the niches of solid tumors. Indeed, some common features can be suspected, since the bone marrow is a frequent site of solid tumor metastases. Recent research on solid tumors has provided very interesting information on the interactions between tumoral cells and their microenvironment, composed notably of mesenchymal, endothelial and immune cells. This review thus focuses on recent discoveries on tumor niches that could help in understanding hematopoietic niches, with special attention to 4 particular points: i) the heterogeneity of carcinoma/cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs), ii) niche cytokines and chemokines, iii) the energy/oxidative metabolism and communication, especially mitochondrial transfer, and iv) the vascular niche through angiogenesis and endothelial plasticity. This review highlights actors and/or pathways of the microenvironment broadly involved in cancer processes. This opens avenues for innovative therapeutic opportunities targeting not only cancer stem cells but also their regulatory tumor niche(s), in order to improve current antitumor therapies.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Mancini, Balabanian, Corre, Gavard, Lazennec, Le', 'Bousse-Kerdiles, Louache, Maguer-Satta, Mazure, Mechta-Grigoriou, Peyron, Trichet', 'and Herault.']","['Mancini,

The apoptolidin family of glycomacrolides are distinguished by their selective cytotoxicity towards oncogene-transformed cells, yet their molecular mechanism remains uncertain. We used photoaffinity analogs of the apoptolidins to identify the F1 subcomplex of mitochondrial ATP synthase as the target of apoptolidin A. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) of apoptolidin and ammocidin-ATP synthase complexes revealed a novel shared mode of inhibition that was confirmed by deep mutational scanning of the binding interface to reveal resistance mutations which were confirmed using CRISPR-Cas9. Ammocidin A was found to suppress leukemia progression in vivo at doses that were tolerated with minimal toxicity. The combination of cellular, structural, mutagenesis, and in vivo evidence defines the mechanism of action of apoptolidin family glycomacrolides and establishes a path to address oxidative phosphorylation-dependent cancers.","['(c) 2021.

However, little is known about the impact of IDH2 mutations on intracellular signaling. Using an isogenic cell line model, we investigated both differentiation and signaling responses in IDH2 mutant cells and show augmented responses to inflammatory immune ligands. Using phospho-specific flow and mass cytometry, we demonstrate IDH2 mutant cells were significantly more sensitive to IL-1beta at multiple downstream readouts. Further, bulk RNA sequencing confirmed increases in cytokine-related signaling pathways and NF-kappaB target genes. Single-cell RNA sequencing of unstimulated and stimulated cells confirmed altered IL-1beta transcriptional responses in the IDH2 mutant cells. Targeted inhibition of the IKK complex reduced IL-1beta responses and induced cell death in primary IDH-mutated leukemia samples. Together, these results confirm altered IL-1beta signaling in IDH2 mutant cells and identify this pathway as a potential therapeutic target.","['(c) 2021.

Genes located on chromosome 21 and expressed in hematopoietic cells are likely candidates for investigation of CRLF2r DS-ALL pathogenesis. We explored the high-mobility group nucleosome-binding protein 1 (HMGN1), located in the DS critical region, in an inducible CRISPR/Cas9 knockout (KO) xenograft model to assess the effect of HMGN1 loss of function on the leukemic burden. We demonstrated HMGN1 KO-mitigated leukemic phenotypes including hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, commonly observed in leukemia patients, and significantly increased survival in vivo. HMGN1 overexpression in murine stem cells and Ba/F3 cells in vitro, in combination with P2RY8-CRLF2, resulted in cytokine-independent transformation and upregulation of cell signaling pathways associated with leukemic development. Finally, in vitro screening demonstrated successful targeting of P2RY8-CRLF2 and HMGN1 co-expressing cell lines and patient samples with fedratinib (JAK2 inhibitor), and GSK-J4 (demethylase inhibitor) in combination. Together, these data provide critical insight into the development and persistence of CRLF2r DS-ALL and identify HMGN1 as a potential therapeutic target to improve outcomes and reduce toxicity in this high-risk cohort of young patients.",['(c) 2021.

Here, we show a small peptide derived from the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus transactivator (K-Rta) sequence, which attenuates cellular MYC expression, reduces cell proliferation, and selectively kills cancer cell lines in both tissue culture and a xenograft tumor mouse model. Mechanistically, the peptide functions as a decoy to block the recruitment of coactivator complexes consisting of Nuclear receptor coactivator 2 (NCOA2), p300, and SWI/SNF proteins to the MYC promoter in primary effusion lymphoma cells.

The present study showed that in addition to the FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutation status, telomere length (TL) and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene polymorphisms may affect risk and overall survival (OS) in AML. TL was longer in healthy controls than in AML patients and positively correlated with age in the patients, but not in healthy subjects. TL was found to be independently affected by the presence of the FLT3-ITD mutation. As for the TERT gene polymorphism, AML patients with the TERT rs2853669 CC genotype were characterized by significantly shorter OS than patients carrying the T allele. Another observation in our study is the difference in TL and OS in patients belonging to various risk stratification groups related to the FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutation status. Patients with adverse risk classification (mutation in FLT3-ITD and lack of mutation in NPM1) presented with the shortest telomeres and significantly worse OS. In conclusion, OS of AML patients appears to be affected by TERT gene variability and TL in addition to other well-established factors such as age, WBC count, or FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutation status.",['(c) 2021.

We performed a high-throughput RNAi screen in three different AML cell lines and primary human leukemic blasts to identify genes that synergize with common antileukemic therapies. We used a pooled shRNA library that covered 5043 different genes and combined transfection with exposure to either azacytidine or cytarabine analog to the concept of synthetic lethality. Suppression of the chemokine CXCL12 ranked highly among the candidates of the cytarabine group. Azacytidine in combination with suppression of genes within the neddylation pathway led to synergistic results. NEDD8 and RBX1 inhibition by the small molecule inhibitor pevonedistat inhibited leukemia cell growth. These findings establish an in vitro synergism between NEDD8 inhibition and azacytidine in AML. Taken together, neddylation constitutes a suitable target pathway for azacytidine combination strategies.",['(c) 2021.

Adoption of targeted-immunotherapeutics since 2011, may alter the risk of CH progression to tMDS/AML. To study this, we evaluated risk of tMDS and tAML in 667 588 >/= 1-year survivors of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), melanoma and multiple-myeloma (MM) diagnosed during: 2000-2005, 2006-2010 and 2011-2016. The risk of tMDS increased significantly after NSCLC across all time periods (Ptrend = 0.002) while tAML risk decreased from 2006-2010 to 2011-2016, coinciding with increasing use of non-chemotherapeutic agents. tAML risk after RCC decreased (Ptrend = 0.007) whereas tMDS risk did not significantly change over time. After melanoma, tMDS and tAML risks were similar to the general population. tMDS and tAML risk after MM increased from the first to second time-period, however, only risk of tMDS decreased during last period. We report diverging trends in the risk of tAML and tMDS after adoption of modern cancer therapies for specific cancers. It is imperative to further explore impact of contemporary treatment strategies on clonal evolution. Modern treatments via their discrete mechanism of actions on pre-existing CH may alter the risk of subsequent tMDS and tAML.",['(c) 2021.

However, bulk data only allows the analysis of miRNA regulation regarding a group of cells, rather than the miRNA regulation unique to individual cells. Recent advance in single-cell miRNA-mRNA co-sequencing technology has opened a way for investigating miRNA regulation at single-cell level. However, as currently single-cell miRNA-mRNA co-sequencing data is just emerging and only available at small-scale, there is a strong need of novel methods to exploit existing single-cell data for the study of cell-specific miRNA regulation. RESULTS: In this work, we propose a new method, CSmiR (Cell-Specific miRNA regulation) to combine single-cell miRNA-mRNA co-sequencing data and putative miRNA-mRNA binding information to identify miRNA regulatory networks at the resolution of individual cells. We apply CSmiR to the miRNA-mRNA co-sequencing data in 19 K562 single-cells to identify cell-specific miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks for understanding miRNA regulation in each K562 single-cell. By analyzing the obtained cell-specific miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks, we observe that the miRNA regulation in each K562 single-cell is unique. Moreover, we conduct detailed analysis on the cell-specific miRNA regulation associated with the miR-17/92 family as a case study. The comparison results indicate that CSmiR is effective in predicting cell-specific miRNA targets. Finally, through exploring cell-cell similarity matrix characterized by cell-specific miRNA regulation, CSmiR provides a novel strategy for clustering single-cells and helps to understand cell-cell crosstalk. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, CSmiR is the first method to explore miRNA regulation at a single-cell resolution level, and we believe that it can be a useful method to enhance the understanding of cell-specific miRNA regulation.",['(c) 2021.

METHODS: In this study, a virtual high throughput screening (vHTS) technique was employed to screen a library of phytochemicals of reported anti-cancer plants. A docking score of -10 kcalmol-1 was used as the cut-off for the selection of phyto-compounds for pharmacophore-based virtual screening. Statistically robust and thoroughly validated QSAR model (R = 0.914, R2 = 0.836, Adjusted R2 = 0.764, LOO-CV= 0.6680) was derived for the inhibition of BCR-ABL kinase domain. RESULTS: The virtual screening, pharmacophore screening, QSAR model and molecular docking techniques applied herein revealed ellagic acid, a polyphenolic compound, as a potential competitive inhibitor of the BCR-ABL kinase domain. Ellagic acid binds to the inactive ABL state and forms similar interactions with key residues within the BCR-ABL Kinase domain as obtained in ponatinib (possesses inhibitory effects on the ABL thr-315I mutant). It forms hydrogen bond interaction with thr-315 residue (the gatekeeper residue). It is not likely to be prone to the various mutations associated with nilotinib because of its small size. CONCLUSION: The procedure of VHTs, Pharmacophore, QSAR, and molecular docking applied in this study could help in detecting more anti-CML compounds.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Metibemu, Damilohun Samuel', 'Oyeneyin, Oluwatoba Emmanuel', 'Metibemu, Ayorinde Omolara', 'Adeniran, Olawole Yakubu', 'Omotuyi, Idowu Olaposi']","['Metibemu DS', 'Oyeneyin OE', 'Metibemu AO', 'Adeniran OY', 'Omotuyi IO']","['Department of Biochemistry, Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba-Akoko, Ondo State.

Recently, post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) has been shown to be effective in GVHD prevention. In this registry-based study, we compared outcomes of 118 patients treated with PTCy and 1202 patients with CSA/MTX who underwent MSD allo-HCT for acute myelogenous leukemia. In a matched-pair analysis, PTCy was associated with a higher incidence of relapse at 2 years compared with CSA/MTX (41.1% versus 21.3%; P = .039). The incidences of day +180 grade II-IV acute GVHD and 2-year chronic GVHD were comparable in the PTCy and CSA/MTX arms (25.2% versus 25.4% [P = .90] and 42.6% versus 42.6% [P = .84], respectively). Similarly, 2-year leukemia-free survival (LFS; 54.4% versus 74.32%; P = .052), overall survival (OS; 70.6% versus 79.7%; P = .15), and GVHD-free relapse-free survival (GRFS; 38.1% versus 52.5%; P = .49) were not statistically different in the 2 arms. Our data show that GVHD prophylaxis with PTCy is feasible, resulting in similar incidences of GVHD, GRFS, LFS, and OS as seen with conventional CSA/MTX in patients undergoing allo-HCT from an MSD. The higher rate of relapse observed with PTCy needs further evaluation in a prospective study. (c) 2021 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.

METHODS: We analyzed the outcomes of 93 patients (median age: 52 years) who underwent allo-HCT at our center between 1989 and 2019. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 35 months, relapse was observed in 15.1% (n = 14) patients. The estimated 2-year non-relapse mortality, relapse-free survival, and overall survival (OS) were 38.1%, 54.2%, and 58.7%, respectively. The ECOG performance status >/= 2 (hazard ratio [HR]: 4.1; p = .001) and use of total body irradiation (in a myeloablative conditioning regimen; HR: 2.64; p = .005) were predictive of poor OS after multivariable analysis. The occurrence of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome/veno-occlusive disease post-transplant was associated with poor survival (p = .001). CONCLUSION: Although the use of kinase and bcl2 inhibitors may result in a decrease in the number and need of transplants, allo-HCT remains a viable option in selected patients with high-risk CLL and good performance status.","['Copyright (c) 2021 King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre.

However, ALL can rarely involve the nerve roots causing symmetrical polyradiculopathy which can present with rapid onset paralysis, mimicking Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS). The symmetrical polyradiculopathy can be the earliest manifestation of ALL occurring even before the hematological and systemic manifestations. CASE REPORT: We report a case of a healthy 29-year-old man who presented with subacute bilateral lower extremity weakness and numbness preceded by a respiratory infection. He was initially treated as a suspected (GBS) but cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings suggested an alternative diagnosis. His prior TB exposure created a diagnostic confusion. Lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging revealed nerve root enhancements at L4-L5 and L5-S1 that are seen in GBS and TB arachnoidids. Brain magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated bilateral distention of the optic nerve sheath complexes with CSF suggestive of intracranial hypertension. CSF revealed elevated protein, nucleated cells 2145 leukocytes/mm3, numerous atypical lymphoid cells. He was later diagnosed with ALL associated symmetrical polyradiculopathy presenting with GBS-like symptoms. CONCLUSION: Symmetrical polyradiculopathy is a rare complication of ALL and can be confused with acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. ALL associated polyradiculopathy in young individuals can be clinically indistinguishable from GBS. Our case highlights that when CSF findings are atypical for GBS, ALL should be considered on the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with GBS like symptoms.","['Copyright (c) Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Research characterizing the impact of cancer on pain and sensory processing in survivors of childhood cancer is scarce. This study aimed to quantify generalized differences in pain and sensory processing in survivors of childhood cancer compared with reference data using a standardized thermal and mechanical quantitative sensory testing (QST) protocol. The association between demographic, clinical (eg, leukemia vs other cancers and treatment exposures), and psychosocial (eg, anxiety and pain catastrophizing) variables and sensitivity to pain and sensory stimuli were also evaluated. Participants were 56 survivors of various types of childhood cancer (52% male, Mage = 13.5 years, SD = 3.2, range = 8-17 years). On average, children were 7 years (SD = 4.1, range = 1.2-16.5) post treatment. Almost all participants (86%) had at least 1 abnormal QST parameter compared with age- and sex-matched reference data; however, few participants self-reported the presence of sensory abnormalities. Generally, participants exhibited reduced sensitivity across the QST parameters examined (Ps < 0.05, ds = 0.40-3.45). A significant minority (45%) also exhibited pain sensitization (P <0.001, d = 0.42). Several risk factors for changes in sensory processing were identified, including current age, history of leukemia, certain treatment exposures (eg, vincristine cumulative dose, major surgery, and bone marrow or stem cell transplant), time off treatment, and higher anxiety and pain catastrophizing scores. Overall, this study demonstrated that somatosensory changes are prevalent in survivors of childhood cancer years after the completion of treatment. Future research is needed to understand long-term implications of altered somatosensation in this complex population.",['Copyright (c) 2021 International Association for the Study of Pain.'],"['Tutelman, Perri R', 'Chambers, Christine T', 'Cornelissen, Laura', 'Fernandez, Conrad V', 'Flanders, Annette', 'MacLeod, Julia', 'Sherry, Simon B', 'Stewart, Sherry H', 'Urquhart, Robin', 'de Gagne, Sitara', 'Guilcher, Gregory M T', 'Hashmi, Javeria', 'Heathcote, Lauren C', 'Noel, Melanie', 'Schulte, Fiona S M', 'Stinson, Jennifer N', 'Stern, Maya']","['Tutelman PR', 'Chambers CT', 'Cornelissen L', 'Fernandez CV', 'Flanders A', 'MacLeod J', 'Sherry SB', 'Stewart SH', 'Urquhart R', 'de Gagne S', 'Guilcher GMT', 'Hashmi J', 'Heathcote LC', 'Noel M', 'Schulte FSM', 'Stinson JN', 'Stern M']","[""Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada Centre for Pediatric Pain Research, IWK Health Centre, Halifax, NS, Canada Department of Anesthesiology, Critical Care & Pain Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, United States Department of Anaesthesia, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, IWK Health Centre, Halifax, NS, Canada Departments of Pediatrics and Bioethics, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada Patient Partner, Halifax, NS, Canada Department of Psychiatry, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada Department of Community Health and Epidemiology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada Patient Partner, Toronto, ON, Canada Department of Pediatrics, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada Haematology, Oncology & Transplant Program, Alberta Children's Hospital, Calgary, AB, Canada Department of Oncology, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada Department of Anesthesia, Pain Management, and Perioperative Medicine, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative, and Pain Medicine, Stanford University Medical School, Stanford, CA, United States Department of Psychology, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada Alberta Children's Hospital Research Institute, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada Hotchkiss Brain Institute, Calgary, AB, Canada Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada Lawrence S.

In this study, we defined CD123 expression and associated clinical characteristics in a uniformly treated cohort of pediatric patients with newly diagnosed AML enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 phase III trial (NCT01371981). MATERIALS AND METHODS: AML blasts within diagnostic bone marrow specimens (n = 1,040) were prospectively analyzed for CD123 protein expression by multidimensional flow cytometry immunophenotyping at a central clinical laboratory. Patients were stratified as low-risk or high-risk on the basis of (1) leukemia-associated cytogenetic and molecular alterations and (2) end-of-induction measurable residual disease levels. RESULTS: The study population was divided into CD123 expression-based quartiles (n = 260 each) for analysis. Those with highest CD123 expression (quartile 4 [Q4]) had higher prevalence of high-risk KMT2A rearrangements and FLT3-ITD mutations (P < .001 for both) and lower prevalence of low-risk t(8;21), inv(16), and CEBPA mutations (P < .001 for all). Patients in lower CD123 expression quartiles (Q1-3) had similar relapse risk, event-free survival, and overall survival. Conversely, Q4 patients had a significantly higher relapse risk (53% v 39%, P < .001), lower event-free survival (49% v 69%, P < .001), and lower overall survival (32% v 50%, P < .001) in comparison with Q1-3 patients. CD123 maintained independent significance for outcomes when all known contemporary high-risk cytogenetic and molecular markers were incorporated into multivariable Cox regression analysis. CONCLUSION: CD123 is strongly associated with disease-relevant cytogenetic and molecular alterations in childhood AML. CD123 is a critical biomarker and promising immunotherapeutic target for children with relapsed or refractory AML, given its prevalent expression and enrichment in patients with high-risk genetic alterations and inferior clinical outcomes with conventional therapy.",,"['Lamble, Adam J', 'Eidenschink Brodersen, Lisa', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Wang, Jim', 'Pardo, Laura', 'Sung, Lillian', 'Cooper, Todd M', 'Kolb, E Anders', 'Aplenc, Richard', 'Tasian, Sarah K', 'Loken, Michael R', 'Meshinchi, Soheil']","['Lamble AJ', 'Eidenschink Brodersen L', 'Alonzo TA', 'Wang J', 'Pardo L', 'Sung L', 'Cooper TM', 'Kolb EA', 'Aplenc R', 'Tasian SK', 'Loken MR', 'Meshinchi S']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Seattle Children's Hospital, University of Washington, Seattle, WA."", 'Hematologics Inc, Seattle, WA.', ""Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, CA."", 'University of Southern California, Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA.', ""Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, CA."", 'Hematologics Inc, Seattle, WA.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, CA.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Seattle Children's Hospital, University of Washington, Seattle, WA."", 'Division of Oncology, Nemours/Alfred I.

Prior data suggested that CNI-free approaches using donor T-cell depletion, either by ex vivo CD34 selection or in vivo post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) as a single agent, are associated with lower rates of chronic GVHD (cGVHD). METHODS: This multicenter phase III trial randomly assigned patients with acute leukemia or myelodysplasia and an HLA-matched donor to receive CD34-selected peripheral blood stem cell, PTCy after a bone marrow (BM) graft, or tacrolimus and methotrexate after BM graft (control). The primary end point was cGVHD (moderate or severe) or relapse-free survival (CRFS). RESULTS: Among 346 patients enrolled, 327 received HCT, 300 per protocol. Intent-to-treat rates of 2-year CRFS were 50.6% for CD34 selection (hazard ratio [HR] compared with control, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.15; P = .24), 48.1% for PTCy (HR, 0.86; 0.61 to 1.23; P = .41), and 41.0% for control. Corresponding rates of overall survival were 60.1% (HR, 1.74; 1.09 to 2.80; P = .02), 76.2% (HR, 1.02; 0.60 to 1.72; P = .95), and 76.1%. CD34 selection was associated with lower moderate to severe cGVHD (HR, 0.25; 0.12 to 0.52; P = .02) but higher transplant-related mortality (HR, 2.76; 1.26 to 6.06; P = .01).

Due to the positive correlation between mutational burden and response rate to inhibitors of the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), those inhibitors are considered promising candidates for the systemic therapy of cSCC. Recently, the PD-1 inhibitors pembrolizumab, nivolumab and cemiplimab demonstrated efficacy in the systemic treatment of locally advanced or metastatic cSCC leading to the approval of cemiplimab by the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) in 2018 and the EMA (European Medicines Agency) in 2019. Patients with haematological malignancies tend to develop skin cancers of high aggressiveness, enhanced cumulative recurrence rate and higher rates of metastases with subsequent death. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most frequent type of leukaemia in the United States and Europe with the majority of patients older than 50 years of age. This neoplasm predominantly originates from B -cells leading to an impaired immune system of the patient. Although CLL is a B-cell malignancy, studies have also described the involvement of T cells in the pathogenesis and progression of the disease with contradictory findings on the effects of PD-1 inhibitors in CLL. Due to their underlying hematologic malignancy, these patients have commonly no access to PD-1 inhibitor trials for treatment of advanced cSCC. We report on two patients with locally advanced or metastatic cSCC. Both patients had been suffering from a CLL for many years without indication for treatment. Despite a potential immunosuppressive state of the patients due to their CLL, both were treated with the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab resulting in different therapy outcomes.",['(c) 2021 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.'],"['Jansen, P', 'Lodde, G C', 'Wetter, A', 'Welt, A', 'Stuschke, M', 'Duhrsen, U', 'Stoffels, I', 'Klode, J', 'Livingstone, E', 'Zimmer, L', 'Roesch, A', 'Hadaschik, E', 'Griewank, K G', 'Schadendorf, D', 'Ugurel, S']","['Jansen P', 'Lodde GC', 'Wetter A', 'Welt A', 'Stuschke M', 'Duhrsen U', 'Stoffels I', 'Klode J', 'Livingstone E', 'Zimmer L', 'Roesch A', 'Hadaschik E', 'Griewank KG', 'Schadendorf D', 'Ugurel S']","['Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology and Neuroradiology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Radiotherapy, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Dermatopathologie bei Mainz, Nieder-Olm, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],,England,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV,9216037,IM,,2021/12/03 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/12/02 12:32'],"['2021/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/02 12:32 [entrez]', '2021/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jdv.17405 [doi]'],ppublish,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol. 2022 Jan;36 Suppl 1:41-44. doi: 10.1111/jdv.17405.,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3139-2118', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6930-2694', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0773-6067', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3524-7858']",['Sanofi'],,,,20211206,['0 (Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors)'],,"['*Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors', 'Immunotherapy', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Male', '*Skin Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'United States']",,,,,,,,,,

Although mutations in these genes in cancer were long thought to lead to a 'loss of function', combined genomic and metabolomic studies led to the discovery that a common IDH 1 mutation, present in low-grade glioma and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), yields a variant (R132H) with a striking change of function leading to the production of (2R)-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) which consequently accumulates in large quantities both within and outside cells. Elevated 2HG is proposed to promote tumorigenesis, although the precise mechanism by which it does this remains uncertain. Inhibitors of R132H IDH1, and other subsequently identified cancer-linked 2HG producing IDH variants, are approved for clinical use in the treatment of chemotherapy-resistant AML, though resistance enabled by additional substitutions has emerged. In this review, we provide a current overview of cancer linked IDH mutations focussing on their distribution in different cancer types, the effects of substitution mutations on enzyme activity, the mode of action of recently developed inhibitors, and their relationship with emerging resistance-mediating double mutations.",['(c) 2021 The Author(s).'],"['Cadoux-Hudson, Thomas', 'Schofield, Christopher J', 'McCullagh, James S O']","['Cadoux-Hudson T', 'Schofield CJ', 'McCullagh JSO']","['Chemistry Research Laboratory, Department of Chemistry and the Ineos Institute for Antimicrobial Research, University of Oxford, Mansfield Road, Oxford OX1 3TA, U.K.', 'Chemistry Research Laboratory, Department of Chemistry and the Ineos Institute for Antimicrobial Research, University of Oxford, Mansfield Road, Oxford OX1 3TA, U.K.', 'Chemistry Research Laboratory, Department of Chemistry and the Ineos Institute for Antimicrobial Research, University of Oxford, Mansfield Road, Oxford OX1 3TA, U.K.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biochem Soc Trans,Biochemical Society transactions,7506897,IM,,2021/12/03 06:00,2021/12/03 06:00,['2021/12/02 12:21'],"['2021/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/13 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/03 06:00 [medline]', '2021/12/02 12:21 [entrez]']","['230356 [pii]', '10.1042/BST20210277 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Soc Trans. 2021 Dec 17;49(6):2561-2572. doi: 10.1042/BST20210277.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-4733-1205'],['106244/Z/14/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,['NOTNLM'],"['*2-hydroxyglutarate', '*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*chemotherapy resistance', '*gene variants', '*glioma', '*isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cluster of differentiation 47 (CD47), the dominant macrophage immune checkpoint ('do not eat me' signal), interacts with its receptor signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRPalpha) to suppress phagocytic activities. This axis plays a pivotal role in immune evasion in myeloid malignancies as well as multiple cancers providing strong rationale for therapeutic exploitation. RECENT FINDINGS: Preclinical studies have revealed overexpression of CD47 on leukemic stem cells and myeloblasts from patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which contributes to immune surveillance evasion and is associated with poor outcomes. Blockade of CD47 with different approaches has demonstrated proof-of-concept antitumor activities mainly through phagocytic clearance. Early phase clinical trials combining the anti-CD47 mAb magrolimab with the hypomethylating agent azacitidine have showed synergistic activities, deep and durable responses, as well as a tolerable safety profile in these patients, including those with TP53 mutations. SUMMARY: Targeting CD47/SIRPalpha axis, in combination with other therapeutic agents, represents a promising treatment approach for patients with myeloid malignancies, particularly the challenging TP53-mutated subgroup.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

RECENT FINDINGS: Several studies have recently reported that deregulated lncRNAs are novel key players in the development of AML and are associated with AML pathophysiology and may serve as prognostic indicators. A few aberrantly expressed lncRNAs that correlated with the recurrent genetic mutations in AML such as NPM1 and RUNX1 have recently been characterized. Moreover, a few lncRNAs in MLL-rearranged leukemia have been described. Additionally, the involvement of lncRNAs in AML chemoresistance has been postulated. SUMMARY: Investigating the functional roles of the noncoding regions including lncRNAs, may provide novel insights into the pathophysiology, refine the prognostic schema, and provide novel therapeutic treatment strategies in AML.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

This may either result in a severe paucity of functional neutrophils (neutropenia), an excess production of mature cells (myeloproliferative disorders) or in clonal expansions of dysplastic or immature myeloid cells (myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia). Although these conditions can be regarded as separate entities, caused by the accumulation of distinct sets of somatic gene mutations, it becomes increasingly clear that they may also evolve as the prime consequence of a congenital defect resulting in severe neutropenia. Prominent examples of such conditions include the genetically heterogeneous forms of severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) and Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome. CSF3 treatment is a successful therapy to alleviate neutropenia in the majority of these patients but does not cure the disease nor does it prevent malignant transformation. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is currently the only therapeutic option to cure SCN, but is relatively cumbersome, e.g., hampered by treatment-related mortality and donor availability. Hence, there is a need for new therapeutic approaches. RECENT FINDINGS: Developments in disease modeling, amongst others based on induced pluripotent stem cell and CRISPR/Cas9 based gene-editing technologies, have created new insights in disease biology and possibilities for treatment. In addition, they are fueling expectations for advanced disease monitoring to prevent malignant transformation. SUMMARY: This review highlights the recent progress made in SCN disease modeling and discusses the challenges that are still ahead of us to gain a better understanding of the biological heterogeneity of the disease and its consequences for patient care.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s).

When a patient has silent inactivation, a switch to Erwinia anti-asparaginase is warranted, but there is currently a global shortage of Erwinia. The only way to identify silent inactivation is to measure an asparaginase level. However, routine asparaginase level monitoring is not currently standard of care at all Canadian centers. This study aims to identify variations in practice regarding asparaginase level monitoring and Erwinia use. METHODS: A 21-item survey was developed using OPINIO software and distributed to all Pediatric Hematology-Oncologists in Canada from February to October 2020. RESULTS: Respondents represented 15 hospitals across each region of Canada (response rate = 52%). Only 39.2% of respondents reported routinely measuring asparaginase levels, yet 53% of respondents have modified therapy from pegaspargase to Erwinia in up to half of their patients. The most common reason for not measuring asparaginase levels was not knowing how to use levels clinically (25.5%). There was variation in the timing of levels and their target. CONCLUSIONS: We identified substantial variation in asparaginase activity monitoring practices across Canada. Therefore, future research should aim to develop a national practice guideline on asparaginase activity monitoring.",,"['Pike, Meghan', 'Kulkarni, Ketan', 'MacDonald, Tamara']","['Pike M', 'Kulkarni K', 'MacDonald T']","['Department of Pediatrics/Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Dalhousie University/IWK Health Centre, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics/Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Dalhousie University/IWK Health Centre, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Dalhousie3682, University/IWK Health Centre, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211202,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,IM,,2021/12/03 06:00,2021/12/03 06:00,['2021/12/02 12:15'],"['2021/12/02 12:15 [entrez]', '2021/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/10781552211055405 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2021 Dec 2:10781552211055405. doi: 10.1177/10781552211055405.,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3688-6822', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5241-9220']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Asparaginase', 'Erwinia', 'Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM)', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'hypersensitivity', 'survey']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two thirds of the SCCs arise in the oral cavity and are typically preceded by visible lesions. These lesions can be classified with brush biopsy-based cytological methods regarding their risk of a malignant transformation. As a proof of concept, this study aims to investigate genetic changes and chromosomal aneuploidy using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) on oral squamous cells derived from FA affected individuals. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Five FA oral SCC (OSCC) tumor cell lines, one FA OSCC cervical lymph node metastasis as well as tumor-negative and atypical smears from oral brush biopsies were analyzed with FISH probes covering 5p15.2, MYC, EGFR, TERC, 9q34.1, CCND1, 9p21 and centromeres of chromosomes 3, 6, 7, 9, 11, and 17. RESULTS: OSCC specimens showed gains of all analyzed chromosomal regions. Chromosomal aneuploidy was observed in five of the six OSCC specimens in two multicolor FISH assays with panels of four probes each. Five out of six OSCC specimens displayed a relative deletion of 9p21. Applied on atypical brush biopsy-based smears, chromosomal aneuploidy was detected in malignant lesions but not in the smear derived from a severe parodontitis. CONCLUSIONS: As proof of concept, FISH was able to detect genetic changes and chromosomal aneuploidy discriminating oral cancer from noncancerous lesions in individuals with FA. This supports its application on oral brush biopsy-based cytology.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

However, the management of pediatric Ph(+) ALL relapses is not currently standardized. PROCEDURE: We retrospectively analyzed the therapeutic strategies and outcomes of pediatric Ph(+) ALL patients in first relapse who were initially treated with a TKI-containing regimen in one of the French pediatric hematology centers from 2004 to 2019. RESULTS: Twenty-seven children experienced a Ph(+) ALL relapse: 24 (89%) had an overt relapse and three a molecular relapse. Eight involved the central nervous system. A second complete remission (CR2) was obtained for 26 patients (96%). Induction consisted of nonintensive chemotherapy for 13 patients (48%) and intensive chemotherapy for 14 (52%). Thirteen patients (48%) received consolidation. Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) was performed for 21 patients (78%). The TKI was changed for 23 patients (88%), mainly with dasatinib (n = 15). T315I was the most common mutation at relapse (4/7). The 4-year event-free survival and survival rates were 60.9% and 76.1%, respectively. Survival was positively associated with alloHSCT in CR2. CONCLUSION: We show that pediatric first-relapse Ph(+) ALL reinduces well with a second course of TKI exposure, despite the use of different therapeutic approaches. The main prognostic factor for survival was alloHSCT in CR2. Because of the small size of the cohort, we could not draw any conclusions about the respective impact of TKIs, but the predominance of the T315I mutation should encourage careful consideration of the TKI choice.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Aubert, Lucie', 'Petit, Arnaud', 'Bertrand, Yves', 'Ray-Lunven, Anne-France', 'Angoso, Marie', 'Pluchart, Claire', 'Millot, Frederic', 'Saultier, Paul', 'Cheikh, Nathalie', 'Pellier, Isabelle', 'Plantaz, Dominique', 'Sirvent, Anne', 'Thouvenin-Doublet, Sandrine', 'Valduga, Julie', 'Plat, Genevieve', 'Rialland, Fanny', 'Henry, Catherine', 'Esvan, Maxime', 'Gandemer, Virginie']","['Aubert L', 'Petit A', 'Bertrand Y', 'Ray-Lunven AF', 'Angoso M', 'Pluchart C', 'Millot F', 'Saultier P', 'Cheikh N', 'Pellier I', 'Plantaz D', 'Sirvent A', 'Thouvenin-Doublet S', 'Valduga J', 'Plat G', 'Rialland F', 'Henry C', 'Esvan M', 'Gandemer V']","['Department of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, University Hospital of Rennes, Rennes, France.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Department, Armand Trousseau Hospital, APHP, Paris, France.', 'Department of the Institute of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Robert Debre Hospital, APHP, Paris, France.', 'Pediatric Hematology Oncology Department, University Hospital of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Onco-Hematology, University Hospital of Reims, Reims, France.', 'Department of Hematological Oncology and Cell Therapy, University Hospital of Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', ""Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Department, La Timone Children's Hospital, AP-HM, Marseille, France."", 'Pediatric Hematology Oncology Unity, University Hospital of Besancon, Besancon, France.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Immunology Department, University Hospital of Angers, Angers, France.', 'Pediatric Immuno-Hemato-Oncology Department, University Hospital of Grenoble, Grenoble, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Onco-Hematology, University Hospital of Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Onco-Hematology, University Hospital of Saint-Etienne, Saint-Etienne, France.', 'Pediatric Oncology and Hematology Department, University Hospital of Nancy (CHRU Nancy), Nancy, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, University Hospital of Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Onco-Hematology, University Hospital of Nantes, Nantes, France.', 'Cytogenetic and Cell Biology Department, University Hospital of Rennes, Rennes, France.', ""Rennes University, University Hospital of Rennes, Inserm, CIC 1414 (Centre d'Investigation Clinique de Rennes), Rennes, France."", 'Department of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, University Hospital of Rennes, Rennes, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211202,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,,2021/12/03 06:00,2021/12/03 06:00,['2021/12/02 08:57'],"['2021/09/23 00:00 [revised]', '2021/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/03 06:00 [medline]', '2021/12/02 08:57 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.29441 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2022 Feb;69(2):e29441. doi: 10.1002/pbc.29441.

PROCEDURE: Survivors in the St. Louis Children's Hospital Late Effects Clinic were recruited. Eligibility included (a) diagnosis of a pediatric cancer treated without platinum chemotherapy or cranial radiation, (b) at least 6 months from completion of therapy, (c) between the ages of 7 and 18 years, (d) cognitively/behaviorally able to participate, and (e) English speaking. Behavioral hearing screenings from 1000 to 8000 Hz were performed by trained personnel using a calibrated audiometer. A failed screen was defined by a participant not responding to two or more of the three screening attempts for at least one frequency in at least one ear. RESULTS: One hundred nine patients met eligibility criteria with 78 enrolled (71.5%). Diagnoses included leukemia (57.7%), sarcoma (11.5%), Wilms tumor (14.1%), lymphoma (12.8%), and other solid tumors (3.9%). The median age was 13.2 years (Q1-Q3: 9.6-15.4) and the median time from treatment completion was 3.7 years (Q1-Q3: 2.3-7.4). Eighteen patients (23%) failed the hearing screen (95% CI: 14%-34%). No demographic or treatment-related variables were significantly correlated to screening failure.

Re-expression in somatic cells has been revealed to be present in pathologic conditions such as dystrophy, leukemia, and other cancer types. Embryonic cells, cancer cells and testis cells that show DUX4 expression are pluri-multipotent cells. This lead us to question ""Could DUX4 be a TF that is active in certain types of potent somatic cells?"" As a perfect reflection of the potent cell pool, we aimed to reveal DUX4 expression in the bone marrow. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Bone marrow aspiration materials of seven healthy donors aged between 3 and 32 (2 males/5 females) were investigated with qPCR analysis after RNA isolation for the presence of DUX4 full length mRNA expression. Samples have been investigated for protein existence of DUX4 via immunohistochemistry in two donors that had sufficient aspiration material. RESULTS: DUX4 mRNA expression was present in all donors, with higher expression compared to B-actin. DUX4 positive stained cells were also detected by immunohistochemistry. CONCLUSION: With these results, novel expression for DUX4 in hematopoietic tissue is described. Further studies on the function of DUX4 in hematopoietic cells can shed light on DUX4-related pathways, and contribute to the treatment of DUX4-related diseases such as B-ALL, other cancers, and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy.",,"['Hangul, Ceren', 'Tokta, Oznur', 'Karauzum, Sibel Berker', 'Akkaya, Bahar', 'Yildirim, Hulya', 'Kupesiz, Funda Tayfun', 'Akinel, Ayse Nur']","['Hangul C', 'Tokta O', 'Karauzum SB', 'Akkaya B', 'Yildirim H', 'Kupesiz FT', 'Akinel AN']","['Department of Medical Biology and Genetics, Akdeniz University, Faculty of Medicine, ANTALYA, TURKEY.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211202,Turkey,Turk Patoloji Derg,Turk patoloji dergisi,9440471,IM,,2021/12/03 06:00,2021/12/03 06:00,['2021/12/02 08:48'],"['2021/12/02 08:48 [entrez]', '2021/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5146/tjpath.2021.01564 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Turk Patoloji Derg. 2021 Dec 2. doi: 10.5146/tjpath.2021.01564.,,,,,,,,,,,,Analysis of DUX4 Expression in Bone Marrow and Re-Discussion of DUX4 Function in the Health and Disease.,,,,,,,

In studying transcriptomes from AML patients with chromosome 3q rearrangements, we identified a significant upregulation of the Nuclear Receptor Interacting Protein 1 (NRIP1) as well as its adjacent non-coding RNA LOC101927745. Utilizing transcriptomic and epigenomic data from over 900 primary patient samples as well as genetic and transcriptional engineering approaches, we have identified several mechanisms that can lead to upregulation of NRIP1 in AML. We hypothesize that the LOC101927745 transcription start site harbors a context-dependent enhancer that is bound by EVI1, causing upregulation of NRIP1 in AML with chr3 abnormalities. Furthermore, we show that NRIP1 knockdown negatively affects the proliferation and survival of 3q-rearranged AML cells and increases their sensitivity towards ATRA, suggesting that NRIP1 is relevant for the pathogenesis of inv(3)/t(3;3) AML and could serve as a novel therapeutic target in myeloid malignancies with 3q abnormalities.",,"['Grasedieck, Sarah', 'Cabantog, Ariene', 'MacPhee, Liam', 'Im, Junbum', 'Ruess, Christoph', 'Demir, Burcu', 'Sperb, Nadine', 'Rucker, Frank G', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Herold, Tobias', 'Pollack, Jonathan R', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Rouhi, Arefeh', 'Kuchenbauer, Florian']","['Grasedieck S', 'Cabantog A', 'MacPhee L', 'Im J', 'Ruess C', 'Demir B', 'Sperb N', 'Rucker FG', 'Dohner K', 'Herold T', 'Pollack JR', 'Bullinger L', 'Rouhi A', 'Kuchenbauer F']","['University of British Columbia, Dept. of Microbiology and Immunology, MSL Building, 2125 East Mall Vancouver, BC. sgrasedieck@bcgsc.ca.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, 675 West 10th Avenue, Vancouver, BC.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, 675 West 10th Avenue, Vancouver, BC.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, 675 West 10th Avenue, Vancouver, BC.', 'Ulm University Hospital, Dept of Internal Medicine III, Albert-Einstein-Allee 23, Ulm.', 'Ulm University Hospital, Dept of Internal Medicine III, Albert-Einstein-Allee 23, Ulm.', 'Ulm University Hospital, Dept of Internal Medicine III, Albert-Einstein-Allee 23, Ulm.', 'Ulm University Hospital, Dept of Internal Medicine III, Albert-Einstein-Allee 23, Ulm.', 'Ulm University Hospital, Dept of Internal Medicine III, Albert-Einstein-Allee 23, Ulm.', 'Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Marchioninistr. 15, Munich.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Charite University Medicine, Berlin.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, 675 West 10th Avenue, Vancouver, BC.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, 675 West 10th Avenue, Vancouver, BC. fkuchenbauer@bccrc.ca.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211202,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,,2021/12/03 06:00,2021/12/03 06:00,['2021/12/02 07:11'],"['2020/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/12/02 07:11 [entrez]', '2021/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3324/haematol.2021.276048 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Haematologica. 2021 Dec 2. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2021.276048.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So, we established a TaqMan real-time fluorescence quantitative methylation specific PCR (TaqMan real-time FQ-MSP) assay and use it for quantitative detection of PER2 methylation in leukemia patients. METHODS: According to the PER2 sequence searched by GenBank, a CpG sequence enrichment region of the PER2 gene promoter was selected, and the methylated and unmethylated target sequences were designed according to the law of bisulfite conversion of DNA to construct PER2 methylation positive and negative reference materials. Specific primers and probe were designed. The reference materials were continuously diluted into gradient samples by tenfold ratio to evaluate the analytical sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and reproducibility of the method, and the analytical sensitivity of TaqMan real-time FQ-MSP assay was compared with that of the conventional MSP assay. At the same time, the new-established TaqMan real-time FQ-MSP assay and the conventional MSP assay were used to detect the PER2 methylation level of 81 patients with leukemia, and the samples with inconsistent detection results of the two assays were sent to pyromethylation sequencing to evaluate the clinical detection performance. RESULTS: The minimum detection limit of TaqMan real-time FQ-MSP assay for detecting PER2 methylation level established in this study was 6 copies/uL, and the coefficient of variation(CV) of intra-assay and inter-assay was less than 3%. Compared with the conventional MSP assay, it has higher analytical sensitivity. For the samples with inconsistent detection results, the results of pyrosequencing and TaqMan real-time FQ-MSP assay are consistent. CONCLUSION: TaqMan real-time FQ-MSP assay of PER2 methylation established in this study has high detection performance and can be used for the detection of clinical samples.","['(c) 2021.

Few biological factors at diagnosis have been associated with this level of response. Telomere length (TL) in peripheral blood cells of patients with CML has been related to disease stage, response to therapy and disease progression, but little is known about its role on DMR. In this study, we analyzed if age-adjusted TL (referred as ""delta-TL"") at diagnosis of chronic phase (CP)-CML might correlate with the achievement of DMR under first-line imatinib treatment. TL from 96 CP-CML patients had been retrospectively analyzed at diagnosis by monochrome multiplex quantitative PCR. We observed that patients with longer age-adjusted telomeres at diagnosis had higher probabilities to achieve DMR with imatinib than those with shortened telomeres (P = 0.035 when delta-TL was studied as a continuous variable and P = 0.047 when categorized by the median). Moreover, patients carrying long telomeres also achieved major molecular response significantly earlier (P = 0.012). This study provides proof of concept that TL has a role in CML biology and when measured at diagnosis of CP-CML could help to identify patients likely to achieve DMR to first-line imatinib treatment.","['Copyright (c) 2021 the Author(s).

In this regard, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modification of NK cells is considered as a compelling approach to augment the specificity and cytotoxicity of NK cells against AML. Using a non-viral piggyBac transposon technology and human peripheral blood-derived primary NK cells, we generated CAR-NK cells to target NKG2D ligands and demonstrated their in vitro activity in lysing cancer cells expressing the ligands and in vivo efficacy in inhibiting tumor growth in a xenograft KG-1 AML model. We further generated CAR-NK cells co-expressing transgenes for the NKG2D CAR and interleukin-15 (IL-15). The ectopic expression of IL-15 improved the in vitro and in vivo persistence of NKG2D CAR-NK cells, leading to enhanced in vivo tumor control and significant prolongation of mouse survival in the KG-1 AML model. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the ectopic expression of IL-15 as an important means to improve the antileukemic activity of NKG2D CAR-NK cells.

Lobaplatin (LBP) is a third-generation platinum antitumor agent; compared with the first two generations of platinum agents, it has lower toxicity and has been approved for the treatment of breast cancer, small cell lung cancer, and chronic granulocytic leukemia. However, its role in the treatment of esophageal cancer warrants further investigations. AIM: To investigate the efficacy and safety of induction chemotherapy with ABP plus LBP followed by concurrent radiochemotherapy (RCT) for locally advanced esophageal cancer. METHODS: Patients with pathologically confirmed advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) at our hospital were enrolled in this study. All patients were treated with two cycles of induction chemotherapy with ABP plus LBP followed by concurrent RCT: ABP 250 mg/m(2), ivgtt, 30 min, d1, every 3 wk; and LBP, 30 mg/m(2), ivgtt, 2 h, d1, every 3 wk. A total of four cycles were scheduled. The dose of the concurrent radiotherapy was 56-60 Gy/28-30 fractions, 1.8-2.0 Gy/fraction, and 5 fractions/wk. RESULTS: A total of 29 patients were included, and 26 of them completed the treatment protocol. After the induction chemotherapy, the objective response rate (ORR) was 61.54%, the disease control rate (DCR) was 88.46%, and the progressive disease (PD) rate was 11.54%; after the concurrent RCT, the ORR was 76.92%, the DCR was 88.46%, and the PD rate was 11.54%. The median progression-free survival was 11.1 mo and the median overall survival was 15.83 mo. Cox multivariate analysis revealed that two cycles of induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent RCT significantly reduced the risk of PD compared with two cycles of chemotherapy alone (P = 0.0024). Non-hematologic toxicities were tolerable, and the only grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity was radiation-induced esophagitis (13.79%). The main hematologic toxicity was neutropenia, and no grade 4 adverse event occurred. CONCLUSION: Induction chemotherapy with ABP plus LBP followed by concurrent RCT is effective in patients with locally advanced ESCC, with mild adverse effects. Thus, this protocol is worthy of clinical promotion and application.","['(c)The Author(s) 2021. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

Moreover, the common goal of both lineages is to ensure tissue homeostasis under steady-state conditions, fight invading pathogens, and promote tissue repair. We will highlight accumulating evidence that innate and adaptive immunity modulate several aspects of hematopoiesis within the hormetic zone in which the biological response to low exposure to potential stressors generally is favorable and benefits hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). Innate immunity impact on hematopoiesis is pleiotropic and involves both the cellular arm, comprised of innate immunity cells, and the soluble arm, whose major component is the complement cascade (ComC). In addition, several mediators released by innate immunity cells, including inflammatory cytokines and small antimicrobial cationic peptides, affect hematopoiesis. There are intriguing observations that HSPCs and immune cells share several cell-surface pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cytosol-expressed NOD, NOD-like, and RIG-I-like receptors and thus can be considered ""pathogen sensors"". In addition, not only lymphocytes but also HSPCs express functional intracellular complement proteins, defined as complosome which poses challenging questions for further investigation of the intracellular ComC-mediated intracrine regulation of hematopoiesis.",['(c) 2021.

While the whole-body knockout of Setd5 in mice leads to embryonic lethality, the role of SETD5 in adult stem cell remains unexplored. Here, a critical role of Setd5 in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is identified. Specific deletion of Setd5 in hematopoietic system significantly increased the number of immunophenotypic HSCs by promoting HSC proliferation. Setd5-deficient HSCs exhibited impaired long-term self-renewal capacity and multiple-lineage differentiation potentials under transplantation pressure. Transcriptome analysis of Setd5-deficient HSCs revealed a disruption of quiescence state of long-term HSCs, a cause of the exhaustion of functional HSCs. Mechanistically, SETD5 was shown to regulate HSC quiescence by mediating the release of promoter-proximal paused RNA polymerase II (Pol II) on E2F targets in cooperation with HCF-1 and PAF1 complex. Taken together, these findings reveal an essential role of SETD5 in regulating Pol II pausing-mediated maintenance of adult stem cells.",['(c) 2021.

However, on-target off-tumor toxicity and poor persistence severely limit the clinical application of CAR-T cell therapy. METHODS: T-cell immunoglobulin mucin domain molecule 3 (TIM-3) was used to develop a second-generation 41BB CD19 CAR linked with a T3/28 chimera, in which truncated extracellular TIM-3 was fused with the CD28 transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. The efficacy of T3/28 CAR-T cells was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: We demonstrated that the switch receptor T3/28 preserved the TCM phenotype, improved proliferative capacity, and reduced exhaustion of CAR-T cells, resulting in superior in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity in B lymphoma. Importantly, the switch receptor T3/28 substantially prolonged the persistence of CAR-T cells, and the interleukin-21/Stat3 axis probably contributed to the enhanced cytotoxicity of T3/28 CAR-T cells. CONCLUSION: Overall, the T3/28 chimera significantly prolonged the persistence of CAR-T cells, and T3/28 CAR-T cells possessed potent antitumor activity in mice, shedding new light on potential improvements in adoptive T cell therapies.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

This screen identified the histone acetyltransferase KAT6A as a novel regulator of myeloid differentiation that drives critical leukemogenic gene expression programs. We show that KAT6A is the initiator of a newly-described transcriptional control module in which KAT6A-catalyzed promoter H3K9ac is bound by the acetyllysine reader ENL, which in turn cooperates with a network of chromatin factors to induce transcriptional elongation. Inhibition of KAT6A has strong anti-AML phenotypes in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that KAT6A small molecule inhibitors could be of high therapeutic interest for mono or combinatorial differentiation-based treatment of AML.","['Copyright (c)2021, American Association for Cancer Research.']","['Yan, Fangxue', 'Li, Jinyang', 'Milosevic, Jelena', 'Petroni, Ricardo', 'Liu, Suying', 'Shi, Zhennan', 'Yuan, Salina', 'Reynaga, Janice M', 'Qi, Yuwei', 'Rico, Joshua', 'Yu, Sixiang', 'Liu, Yiman', 'Rokudai, Susumu', 'Palmisiano, Neil', 'Meyer, Sara E', 'Sung, Pamela J', 'Wan, Liling', 'Lan, Fei', 'Garcia, Benjamin A', 'Stanger, Ben Z', 'Sykes, David B', 'Blanco, M Andres']","['Yan F', 'Li J', 'Milosevic J', 'Petroni R', 'Liu S', 'Shi Z', 'Yuan S', 'Reynaga JM', 'Qi Y', 'Rico J', 'Yu S', 'Liu Y', 'Rokudai S', 'Palmisiano N', 'Meyer SE', 'Sung PJ', 'Wan L', 'Lan F', 'Garcia BA', 'Stanger BZ', 'Sykes DB', 'Blanco MA']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania.', 'School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania.', 'Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital.', 'University of Pennsylvania.', 'University of Pennsylvania.', 'Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences.', 'Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania.', 'University of Pennsylvania.', 'University of Pennsylvania.', 'Biomedical Sciences, University of Pennsylvania.', 'University of Pennsylvania.', 'Raymond and Ruth Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Oncology, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine.', 'Thomas Jefferson University.', 'Cancer Biology, Thomas Jefferson University.', 'Medicine, University of Pennsylvania.', 'Cancer Biology, Department of Cancer Biology, University of Pennsylvania; Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania; Epigenetics Institute, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania; Institute for Regenerative Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania.', 'Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania.', 'Center for Regenerative Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital.', 'University of Pennsylvania ablanco@vet.upenn.edu.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211201,United States,Cancer Discov,Cancer discovery,101561693,IM,,2021/12/03 06:00,2021/12/03 06:00,['2021/12/02 05:54'],"['2021/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/02 00:00 [revised]', '2021/12/02 05:54 [entrez]', '2021/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/03 06:00 [medline]']","['2159-8290.CD-20-1459 [pii]', '10.1158/2159-8290.CD-20-1459 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Cancer Discov. 2021 Dec 1. pii: 2159-8290.CD-20-1459. doi: 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-20-1459.,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3107-426X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8125-6603', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7503-7081', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0814-2997', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0300-0391', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2930-748X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5828-5622', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0410-4037', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9788-0221']",['R00 CA226399/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We utilized National Cancer Database (NCDB) to explore utilization of multiagent therapy in APL and identify any disparities in treatment in real-world practices. PATIENTS AND METHODS: NCDB categorizes use of systemic chemotherapy into single agent versus multiagent therapy. Some patients received hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, and unknown therapy; details of these treatments could not be ascertained. We therefore used multiple logistic regression analysis to evaluate effects of covariates on the probability of multiagent therapy use in 6678 patients. RESULTS: Compared to patients >60 years, patients aged 0 to 18 years (hazard ratio[HR] 3.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.8-5.5, P< .0001), 19 to 40 years (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.03-2.54, P= .03), and 41 to 60 years (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.3-1.9, P< .0001) were more likely to receive multiagent therapy. Patients with Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) of 0 (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.3, P= .001) and CCI of 1 (HR 1.4, 95% CI 1.0-1.9, P= .04) had a higher likelihood of receiving multiagent therapy than patients with CCI >/= 3. Patients treated at academic cancer centers, compared to those treated at community cancer center (HR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.7, P= .001), comprehensive community cancer center (HR 0.7, 95% CI 0.6-0.8, P< .0001), and integrated network cancer center (HR 0.8, 95% CI 0.6-0.9, P= .02) were more likely to be treated with multiagent therapy. Compared to the patients with private insurance, those with Medicaid had increased likelihood (HR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0-1.4, P= .04) whereas uninsured patients had a lower likelihood of receiving multiagent therapy (HR 0.6, 95% CI 0.5-0.8, P= .0005). CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this study is the first and the largest scale analysis of treatment practices in APL in real-world practices. Our findings highlight significant disparities in treatment of APL based on age, insurance, and health-system factors.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

MS with megakaryocytic differentiation (MSmgk) is extremely rare and its clinicopathological features have not been well described. We reviewed 11 cases in 11 patients of extramedullary mass-forming malignant tumours composed of immature non-lymphoid haematopoietic cells expressing CD41 with or without concurrent bone marrow lesions. The patients consisted of seven men and four women (1.75:1 male-to-female ratio). The mean and median ages at diagnosis were 50 and 62 years, respectively, ranging from 2 to 78 years. Extramedullary mass lesions were solitary in three cases (27%) and multiple in eight cases (73%). Tumour locations were lymph nodes (6 cases), subcutaneous tissue (3 cases), intramuscular (1 case), and bone (1 case). Seven of the 11 patients (64%) had a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). Three patients (27%) developed MS during remissions of acute myelogenous leukaemia, and one patient had a recurrence of MS at other sites. Follow-up data were available for four cases. Tumour cells were positive for CD41, CD33, CD34, MPO, and CD68 in 11 (100%), three (27%), seven (64%), four (36%), and seven (64%) cases, respectively. Cytogenetic analysis was successfully performed in two cases. Complex but inconsistent abnormalities were evident. When compared with cases of MS without megakaryocytic differentiation, the survival of MSmgk was significantly shorter (p=0.0033). Compared to MS without megakaryocytic differentiation, MSmgk is more likely to follow MDS/MPN, to involve multiple sites, and to be associated with poorer outcomes. More detailed studies, including genomic or gene expression analyses, could confirm the characteristics of MSmgk.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia.

Following collection of patient T cells, chemotherapy (""bridging chemotherapy"") is utilized during the manufacture of CAR T cells. However, the optimal bridging chemotherapy has yet to be defined. Our objective in this study was to report clinical outcomes following bridging chemotherapy in a cohort of pediatric/young adult patients with R/R B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) treated with CAR T cell therapy. This retrospective study included patients enrolled on clinical trial NCT01860937 or referred to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center for commercial CAR T cell therapy (tisagenlecleucel). Bridging chemotherapy (given after T cell collection and before CAR T cell infusion) was defined as high intensity if myelosuppression was expected for >7 days. Outcome comparison analyses were performed in high-intensity versus low-intensity bridging chemotherapy, 1 cycle versus >/=2 cycles of bridging chemotherapy, disease burden at the start of bridging chemotherapy, disease burden at the start of bridging chemotherapy with chemotherapy intensity, tumor debulking by bridging chemotherapy, and disease burden pre-lymphodepleting chemotherapy (LDC) for CAR T cell treatment. The outcomes of this analysis showed that the incidence of grade >/=3 infection was significantly higher (94% versus 56%; P = .019) and overall survival (OS) was significantly lower (hazard ratio, 3.73; 95% confidence interval, 1.39 to 9.97; P = .006) in patients who received >/=2 cycles versus 1 cycle of bridging chemotherapy. No difference in incidence was found for cytokine release syndrome (P > .99) or neurotoxicity/immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (P = .70). Disease burden at the start of bridging chemotherapy, disease burden prior to LDC, and tumor debulking by bridging chemotherapy also did not significantly affect outcomes after CAR T cell therapy in this cohort. In this study, patients receiving >/=2 cycles of bridging chemotherapy had higher rates of infection and lower OS but no difference in CAR-specific toxicity. Clinicians should carefully consider the use of additional cycles of chemotherapy during the bridging period as it delays treatment with CAR T cells and increases the risk of infectious complications.

To gain a deeper understanding of the molecular characteristics associated with CAR T cell differentiation, we performed longitudinal genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of CD8(+) CD19-CAR T cells post-infusion in ALL patients. We report that CAR T cells undergo a rapid and broad erasure of repressive DNA methylation reprograms at effector-associated genes. The CAR T cell post-infusion changes are further characterized by repression of genes (e.g., TCF7 and LEF1) associated with memory potential and a DNA methylation signature (e.g., demethylation at CX3CR1, BATF, and TOX) demarcating a transition toward exhaustion-progenitor T cells. Thus, CD19-CAR T cells undergo exhaustion-associated DNA methylation programming, indicating that efforts to prevent this process may be an attractive approach to improve CAR T cell efficacy.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s).

A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical studies of immune responses to COVID-19 vaccination stratified by underlying malignancy and published from 1 January 2021 to 31 August 2021 was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL. Primary outcome was the rate of seropositivity following 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccine with rates of seropositivity following 1 dose, rates of positive neutralising antibody (nAb), cellular responses and adverse events as secondary outcomes. Rates were pooled from single arm studies while rates of seropositivity were compared against the rate in healthy controls for comparator studies using a random effects model and expressed as a pooled odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals. Forty-four studies (16 mixed group, 28 disease specific) with 7064 patients were included in the analysis (2331 following first dose, 4733 following second dose). Overall seropositivity rates were 61-67% following 2 doses and 37-51% following 1 dose of COVID-19 vaccine.

It is anticipated that with an increase in life expectancy consequent upon the improved standard of living and increasing urbanization, the burden of hematological malignancies in sub-Saharan Africa particularly in Ethiopia is likely to increase recently. Therefore, this study was aimed to determine the incidence and trend of hematological malignancy in Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: A facility-based retrospective study was conducted from 2015 to 2019 at the University of Gondar and Bahir-Dar Felegehiwot comprehensive specialized hospitals. Hematological malignancy data were collected by using a data collection sheet that was consisted of patients' socio-demography, clinical, and laboratory data. Then, data were entered into Epi-info 3.5.1 and exported to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Skewness and kurtosis were used to check data distribution. Descriptive statistics were summarized as percentages, means, and standard deviations of background variables, and the trend were analyzed. RESULTS: In this study, a total of 1,342 study participants were included. The mean age of study participants was 41.49 +/- 16.3 years with a range of 1 to 92 years. About 58.3%, 52.2%, and 80% of the cases were observed among males, 18-45 age group, and urban residences, respectively. Of the total cases, 92.9% and 7.1% were lymphoma and leukemia, respectively. On the other hand, from lymphoma cases, 72.3% and 27.7% were HL and NHL, respectively while from leukemic cases, 61.1%, 23.2, 6.3%, 4.2%, and 5.3% were CLL, ALL, CML, AML, and other HM types, respectively. In this study, there was no trend. CONCLUSION: We concluded that lymphoma was the dominant type of hematological malignancy observed in northwest Ethiopia. The study indicated that the majority of cases were observed among male, urban residents, and adult populations aged 18-45 years. Therefore, special focus should be given to the highly affected population. Further, a prospective cohort study should be conducted for a better understanding of the prevalence and associated factors to it.",,"['Enawgaw, Bamlaku', 'Aynalem, Melak', 'Melku, Mulugeta', 'Asrie, Fikir', 'Abebe, Molla', 'Yalew, Aregawi', 'Bekele, Tiruzer', 'Mesfin, Nebiyu', 'Ayalew, Mulugeta', 'Shiferaw, Elias']","['Enawgaw B', 'Aynalem M', 'Melku M', 'Asrie F', 'Abebe M', 'Yalew A', 'Bekele T', 'Mesfin N', 'Ayalew M', 'Shiferaw E']","['University of Gondar, College of Medicine and Health Science, School of Biomedical and Laboratory Sciences, Department of Hematology and Immunohematology, Gondar, Ethiopia.', 'University of Gondar, College of Medicine and Health Science, School of Biomedical and Laboratory Sciences, Department of Hematology and Immunohematology, Gondar, Ethiopia.', 'University of Gondar, College of Medicine and Health Science, School of Biomedical and Laboratory Sciences, Department of Hematology and Immunohematology, Gondar, Ethiopia.', 'University of Gondar, College of Medicine and Health Science, School of Biomedical and Laboratory Sciences, Department of Hematology and Immunohematology, Gondar, Ethiopia.', 'University of Gondar, College of Medicine and Health Science, School of Biomedical and Laboratory Sciences, Department of Hematology and Immunohematology, Gondar, Ethiopia.', 'University of Gondar, College of Medicine and Health Science, School of Biomedical and Laboratory Sciences, Department of Hematology and Immunohematology, Gondar, Ethiopia.', 'University of Gondar, College of Medicine and Health Science, School of Medicine, Department of Pathology, Gondar, Ethiopia.', 'University of Gondar, College of Medicine and Health Science, School of Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Gondar, Ethiopia.', 'University of Gondar, College of Medicine and Health Science, School of Medicine, Unit of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Gondar, Ethiopia.', 'University of Gondar, College of Medicine and Health Science, School of Biomedical and Laboratory Sciences, Department of Hematology and Immunohematology, Gondar, Ethiopia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211201,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist in this study.'],2021/12/02 06:00,2022/01/12 06:00,['2021/12/01 17:22'],"['2021/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/01 17:22 [entrez]', '2021/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0260639 [doi]', 'PONE-D-21-28947 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2021 Dec 1;16(12):e0260639. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0260639. eCollection 2021.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-1461-0160'],,PMC8635328,,,20220111,,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Ethiopia', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*classification', 'Hospitals, Special', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rural Population', 'Urban Population']",,,,,,,,,,

However, the biological effects and mechanisms of corilagin on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have not been clarified. The Cell Counting Kit8 and Carboxyfluorescein Diacetate Succinimidyl Ester assay results showed that corilagin significantly inhibited proliferation of the AML cell line HL60 in a time and dosedependent manner. Western blotting and flow cytometry analysis were performed to determine the levels of apoptosis in HL60 cells. The protein levels of cleaved caspase3 and Bak were upregulated, while Bclxl was downregulated in cells treated with corilagin. The percentage of early and latestage apoptotic cells increased following corilagin treatment in a dosedependent manner, indicating that the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis pathway was activated by corilagin. Simultaneously, western blotting and immunofluorescence results revealed that autophagy was suppressed; this was accompanied by a decrease in light chain 3II (LC3II) conversion and autophagosomes. MicroRNA (miRNA/miR) profile analysis showed that corilagin elevated the expression of the tumor suppressor miR451, while the mRNA and protein levels of high mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1), the target of miR451, decreased following exposure to corilagin. Knockdown of miR451 decreased the downregulation of HMGB1 caused by corilagin, indicating negative regulation of HMGB1 by miR451 during corilagin treatment. Furthermore, knockdown of miR451 also attenuated corilagininduced proliferation inhibition of HL60 cells, implying that miR451 was essential for the proliferation inhibitory effect of corilagin. In conclusion, these results indicated that corilagin induced apoptosis and inhibited autophagy in HL60 cells by regulating the miR451/HMGB1 axis, and corilagin may be a novel therapeutic drug for the treatment of AML.",,"['Jia, Shu', 'He, Dongye', 'Liang, Xiao', 'Cheng, Panpan', 'Liu, Jilan', 'Chen, Mingtai', 'Wang, Cuiling', 'Zhang, Hao', 'Meng, Chunyang']","['Jia S', 'He D', 'Liang X', 'Cheng P', 'Liu J', 'Chen M', 'Wang C', 'Zhang H', 'Meng C']","['Medical Research Center, Affiliated Hospital of Jining Medical University, Jining, Shandong 272029, P.R.

This study aimed to describe the distribution pattern and prevalence of haematological cancers among adults in Abakaliki, Nigeria. Materials and Methods: This was an 8-year retrospective study in which the hospital records/case notes of adult patients diagnosed and managed for haematological cancers from May 2012 to April 2020 were reviewed. Data obtained were analysed with the SPSS software, version 20. Results: One hundred and thirty-five cases of haematological cancers were included in the study, with 72 (53.4%) males and 63 (46.6%) females and male-to-female ratio of 1.1:1. The age range was 18-82 years, with a mean age of 49 +/- 17 years. Lymphoid malignancies predominate more than myeloid (101 [74.8%] vs. 34 [25.2%]). The leukaemias were more predominant than the lymphomas and myeloma accounting for 48.2%, 36.3% and 7.4%, respectively. Chronic leukaemias were more common than the acute leukaemias with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) being the most common accounting for 24.4% of haematological cancers. In general, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) was the most common haematologic cancer accounting for 35 (25.9%), followed by CLL 33 (24.4%), chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) 17 (12.6%), Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) 14 (10.4%) and multiple myeloma (MM) 10 (7.4%). Others include acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) 9 (6.7%) and acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) 6 (4.4%). Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and polycythaemia vera (PV), each contributed 3% while myelofibrosis (MF) and essential thrombocythaemia (ET) contributed 1.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Conclusion: This study has shown that haematological cancers are not uncommon in our locality with NHL being the most common, followed by CLL, CML, HL, MM, ALL, AML, MDS, PV. MF and ET in that order.

Fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) is known to contribute to rhabdomyosarcoma progression; here, we sought to investigate the involvement and potential for therapeutic targeting of other FGFRs in this disease. Cell-based screening of FGFR inhibitors with potential for clinical repurposing (NVP-BGJ398, nintedanib, dovitinib, and ponatinib) revealed greater sensitivity of fusion-gene-positive versus fusion-gene-negative rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines and was shown to be correlated with high expression of FGFR2 and its specific ligand, FGF7. Furthermore, patient samples exhibit higher mRNA levels of FGFR2 and FGF7 in fusion-gene-positive versus fusion-gene-negative rhabdomyosarcomas. Sustained intracellular mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity and FGF7 secretion into culture media during serum starvation of PAX3-FOXO1 rhabdomyosarcoma cells together with decreased cell viability after genetic silencing of FGFR2 or FGF7 was in keeping with a novel FGF7-FGFR2 autocrine loop. FGFR inhibition with NVP-BGJ398 reduced viability and was synergistic with SN38, the active metabolite of irinotecan. In vivo, NVP-BGJ398 abrogated xenograft growth and warrants further investigation in combination with irinotecan as a therapeutic strategy for fusion-gene-positive rhabdomyosarcomas.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a leading cause of malignancy in AIDS. KSHV latently infects tumor cells and its genome is decorated with epigenetic marks. Here, we show that KSHV latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) recruits MLL1 to viral DNA where it establishes H3K4me3 modifications at the extensive KSHV terminal repeat elements during primary infection. LANA interacts with MLL1 complex members, including WDR5, integrates into the MLL1 complex, and regulates MLL1 activity. We describe the 1.5-A crystal structure of N-terminal LANA peptide complexed with MLL1 complex member WDR5, which reveals a potential regulatory mechanism. Disruption of MLL1 expression rendered KSHV latency establishment highly deficient. This deficiency was rescued by MLL1 but not by catalytically inactive MLL1. Therefore, MLL1 is LANA regulable and exerts a central role in virus infection. These results suggest broad potential for MLL1 regulation, including by non-host factors.","['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

Previous studies demonstrate that increased uterine and placental ferroptosis is associated with oxidative stress-induced fetal loss in a pre-clinical PCOS-like rat model. Here, we investigated the efficacy and molecular mechanism of action of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in reversing gravid uterine and placental ferroptosis in pregnant rats exposed to 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and INS. Molecular and histological analyses showed that NAC attenuated DHT and INS-induced uterine ferroptosis, including dose-dependent increases in anti-ferroptosis gene content. Changes in other molecular factors after NAC treatment were also observed in the placenta exposed to DHT and INS, such as increased glutathione peroxidase 4 protein level. Furthermore, increased apoptosis-inducing factor mitochondria-associated 2 mRNA expression was seen in the placenta but not in the uterus. Additionally, NAC was not sufficient to rescue DHT + INS-induced mitochondria-morphological abnormalities in the uterus, whereas the same treatment partially reversed such abnormalities in the placenta. Finally, we demonstrated that NAC selectively normalized uterine leukemia inhibitory factor, osteopontin/secreted phosphoprotein 1, progesterone receptor, homeobox A11 mRNA expression and placental estrogen-related receptor beta and trophoblast-specific protein alpha mRNA expression. Collectively, our data provide insight into how NAC exerts beneficial effects on differentially attenuating gravid uterine and placental ferroptosis in a PCOS-like rat model with fetal loss. These results indicate that exogenous administration of NAC represents a potential therapeutic strategy in the treatment of HAIR-induced uterine and placental dysfunction.","['(c) The Author(s) 2021.

Clinical studies reported that the combination of ATO and ATRA could achieve a significant curative effect. However, the retinoic acid syndrome, serious drug resistance and the short half-life in vivo which lead to frequent and large dose administration limit the application of ATRA. In addition, the preparations of arsenic are conventional injections and tablets in clinic, which has poor patients' compliance caused by frequent long-term administration and serious side effects. In order to overcome the above limitations, a phospholipid phase separation gel (PPSG) loaded with ATO and ATRA was developed. ATO+ATRA-PPSG (AAP), as a biodegradable sustained-release delivery system, was the first achievement of co-delivery of hydrophilic ATO and lipophilic ATRA with high drug loading which is the main problem in the application of nano preparation. The prepared PPSG displayed high safety and biocompatibility. The drug in PPSG was released slowly and continuously in vivo and in vitro for up to 10 d, which could reduce the side effects caused by the fluctuation of blood drug concentration and solve the problem of the long treatment cycle and frequent administration. In vivo pharmacokinetics depicted that PPSG could improve the bioavailability, decrease the peak concentration, and prolong the t1/2 of ATO and ATRA. Particularly, AAP significantly inhibited the tumor volume, extended the survival period of tumor-bearing mice, and promoted the differentiation of APL cells into normal cells. Therefore, ATO+ATRA-PPSG not only could co-load hydrophilic ATO and lipophilic ATRA according to the clinical dosage, but also possessed the sustained-release and long-acting treatment effect which was expected to reduce administration time and ameliorate compliance of patients. Thus, it had great potential for clinical transformation and application.",['(c) 2021 Shenyang Pharmaceutical University.

The expression of lncRNA TCL6 in the serum of the included patients was detected. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was applied to evaluate the efficiency of lncRNA TCL6 in terms of preeclampsia diagnosis and grading. Kaplan-Meier analysis was adopted to assess the effect of lncRNA TCL6 expression on the rate of adverse pregnancy. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine high-risk factors of adverse pregnancy. The results indicated that lncRNA TCL6 was significantly increased in the serum of patients with preeclampsia. Furthermore, TCL6 was elevated in subgroups of patients with early-onset or severe preeclampsia and with Haemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes and Low Platelet count syndrome in comparison with other patients with preeclampsia. High expression of TCL6 in pregnant females corresponded to a higher rate of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Severe preeclampsia, early-onset preeclampsia and high TCL6 expression were identified as independent risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes. For each unit increase in TCL6 expression, a 9.5-fold increase of the risk of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes was determined.

CLL is characterized by low physical fitness, reduced immunity, and increased risk of secondary malignancies and infections. One approach to improving CLL patients' physical fitness and immune functions may be participation in a structured exercise program. The aims of this pilot study were to examine physical and immunological changes, and feasibility of a 12-week high-intensity interval training (HIIT) combined with muscle endurance-based resistance training on older adults with treatment naive CLL. We enrolled eighteen participants with CLL aged 64.9 +/- 9.1 years and assigned them to groups depending on distance lived from our fitness center. Ten participants (4 M/6F) completed HIIT and six participants (4 M/2F) completed a non-exercising control group (Controls). HIIT consisted of three 30-min treadmill sessions/week plus two concurrent 30-min strength training sessions/week. Physical and immunological outcomes included aerobic capacity, muscle strength and endurance, and natural killer (NK) cell recognition and killing of tumor cells. We confirmed feasibility if > 70% of HIIT participants completed > 75% of prescribed sessions and prescribed minutes, and if > 80% of high-intensity intervals were at a heart rate corresponding to at least 80% of peak aerobic capacity (VO2peak). Results are presented as Hedge's G effect sizes (g), with 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 representing small, medium and large effects, respectively. Following HIIT, leg strength (g = 2.52), chest strength (g = 1.15) and seated row strength (g = 3.07) were 35.4%, 56.1% and 39.5% higher than Controls, respectively, while aerobic capacity was 3.8% lower (g = 0.49) than Controls. Similarly, following HIIT, in vitro NK-cell cytolytic activity against the K562 cell line (g = 1.43), OSU-CLL cell line (g = 0.95), and autologous B-cells (g = 1.30) were 20.3%, 3.0% and 14.6% higher than Controls, respectively.

This study evaluated the role of monoammonium glycyrrhizinate for the prevention of hepatotoxicity after the first methotrexate-containing intrathecal chemotherapy (ITC) in children and adolescents with leukemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia (age 0-18 years) who received ITC during the first week of induction therapy at our hospital between April 2016 and March 2021 were enrolled. Intravenous monoammonium glycyrrhizinate (IVMG) was defined as the intravenous administration of monoammonium glycyrrhizinate initiated on the day before or the day of the first ITC. RESULTS: Overall, 39 of 118 patients (33%) developed grade 3-4 hepatotoxicity. The inverse probability of treatment weighting logistic regression model showed that IVMG was not associated with the development of grade 3-4 hepatotoxicity (OR=1.9, 95%CI=0.808-4.468). CONCLUSION: IVMG did not protect against the development of grade 3-4 hepatotoxicity after the first methotrexate-containing ITC for leukemia.","['Copyright (c) 2021 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['Kishimoto, Kenji', 'Hasegawa, Daiichiro', 'Uemura, Suguru', 'Nakamura, Sayaka', 'Kozaki, Aiko', 'Saito, Atsuro', 'Ishida, Toshiaki', 'Mori, Takeshi', 'Kosaka, Yoshiyuki']","['Kishimoto K', 'Hasegawa D', 'Uemura S', 'Nakamura S', 'Kozaki A', 'Saito A', 'Ishida T', 'Mori T', 'Kosaka Y']","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Cancer Center, Kobe Children's Hospital, Kobe, Japan ken@yacht.ocn.ne.jp."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Cancer Center, Kobe Children's Hospital, Kobe, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Cancer Center, Kobe Children's Hospital, Kobe, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Cancer Center, Kobe Children's Hospital, Kobe, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Cancer Center, Kobe Children's Hospital, Kobe, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Cancer Center, Kobe Children's Hospital, Kobe, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Cancer Center, Kobe Children's Hospital, Kobe, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Cancer Center, Kobe Children's Hospital, Kobe, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Cancer Center, Kobe Children's Hospital, Kobe, Japan.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,,2021/12/02 06:00,2021/12/16 06:00,['2021/12/01 06:05'],"['2021/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/28 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/12/01 06:05 [entrez]', '2021/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['41/12/6231 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.15443 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2021 Dec;41(12):6231-6236. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.15443.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chemotherapy', 'glycyrrhizinate', 'hepatotoxicity', 'leukemia', 'methotrexate']",20211215,['6FO62043WK (Glycyrrhizic Acid)'],,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Glycyrrhizic Acid/*adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Injections, Spinal/*methods', 'Leukemia/*complications/drug therapy', 'Liver/*drug effects', 'Male']",,,,,,,,,,

But these methods are costly, slow and affected by the proficiency and expertise of the specialists concerned. Leukemia can be detected with the help of image processing-based methods by analyzing microscopic smear images to detect the presence of leukemic cells and such techniques are simple, fast, cheap and not biased by the specialists. The proposed study presents a computer aided diagnosis system that uses pretrained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for detection of leukemia images against normal images. The use of pretrained networks is comparatively an easy method of applying deep learning for image analysis and the comparison results of the present study can be used to choose appropriate networks for diagnostic tasks. The microscopic images used in the proposed work were downloaded from a public dataset ALL-IDB. In the proposed work, image classification is done without using any image segregation and feature extraction practices and the study used pretrained series network AlexNet, VGG-16, VGG-19, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) networks GoogLeNet, Inceptionv3, MobileNet-v2, Xception, DenseNet-201, Inception-ResNet-v2 and residual networks ResNet-18, ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 for performing the classification and comparison. A classification accuracy of 100% is obtained with all the pretrained networks used in the study for ALL_IDB1 dataset and for ALL_IDB2 dataset, 100% accuracy is obtained with all networks except the AlexNet and VGG-16. The efficacy of three optimization algorithms Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (SGDM), Root Mean Square propagation (RMSprop) and Adaptive Moment estimation (ADAM) is also compared in all the classifications performed.

However, its mechanism of action in CRC progression has not been comprehensively elucidated. The drug-disease targets were obtained using publicly available databases. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, Gene ontology (GO) function and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment were performed to reveal the core targets, biological processes and signaling pathways of HHT against CRC. Cell and animal experiments were performed to validate the inhibitory effects of HHT on CRC. A total of 98 overlapping target genes of HHT and CRC were predicted. Through PPI network and topology analysis, we screened out 23 hub genes. Enrichment assays showed 163 biological processes (BP), 18 cell components (CC), 35 molecular functions (MF), and 85 related pathways. Functionally, HHT inhibited CRC cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, colony formation, migration and invasion, and promoted apoptosis. HHT treatment resulted in the inactivation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in CRC cells. Moreover, activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling by 740Y-P abated the suppressive effects of HHT on cell malignant phenotypes. Furthermore, HHT repressed CRC tumor growth in nude mice. Our current study demonstrated that HHT repressed CRC progression at least partly by inactivating PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways, highlighting HHT as a potential therapeutic agent for CRC patients.",,"['Qu, Muwen', 'Li, Junyi', 'Yuan, Lingling']","['Qu M', 'Li J', 'Yuan L']","['Department of Anorectal Branch, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', ""Department of Surgery, Guang'anmen Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China."", 'Department of Dermatology, Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Bioengineered,Bioengineered,101581063,IM,,2021/12/02 06:00,2021/12/02 06:00,['2021/12/01 05:46'],"['2021/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/02 06:00 [medline]', '2021/12/01 05:46 [entrez]']",['10.1080/21655979.2021.2012626 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioengineered. 2021 Dec;12(2):12940-12953. doi: 10.1080/21655979.2021.2012626.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-3444-1918'],,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Network pharmacology', '*PI3K/AKT signaling', '*colorectal cancer', '*homoharringtonine']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the timing of calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) used in combination with PTCY is increasingly becoming a topic of controversy. METHOD: We evaluated 49 children with acute leukemia who underwent unmanipulated haplo-HSCT with PTCY according to the initiation day of CNIs (pre- or post-CY). RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the overall survival analysis between the two groups. The cumulative incidence of relapse at 2 years was 21.2% in the pre-CY group and 38.9% in the post-CY group (p=0.33). Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was observed more frequently in the post-CY group (p=0.04). The OS and EFS at 2 years in patients with and without CRS in the pre-Cy group were 42.9% vs 87.5% (p=0.04) and 38.1% vs 87.5% (p=0.04), respectively. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that the argument for starting CNI administration after CY is tenuous, and the rationale for not starting CNI before CY needs to be reconsidered.","['S.

Here, we develop a novel nanoconjugate that combines a self-assembled, multivalent protein nanoparticle, targeting the CXCR4 receptor, with an Oligo-Ara-C prodrug, a pentameric form of Ara-C, to highly increase the delivered payload to target cells. This 13.4 nm T22-GFP-H6-Ara-C nanoconjugate selectively eliminates CXCR4(+) AML cells, which are protected by its anchoring to the bone marrow (BM) niche, being involved in AML progression and chemotherapy resistance. This nanoconjugate shows CXCR4-dependent internalization and antineoplastic activity in CXCR4(+) AML cells in vitro. Moreover, repeated T22-GFP-H6-Ara-C administration selectively eliminates CXCR4(+) leukemic cells in BM, spleen and liver. The leukemic dissemination blockage induced by T22-GFP-H6-Ara-C is significantly more potent than buffer or Oligo-Ara-C-treated mice, showing no associated on-target or off-target toxicity and, therefore, reaching a highly therapeutic window. In conclusion, T22-GFP-H6-Ara-C exploits its 11 ligands-multivalency to enhance target selectivity, while the Oligo-Ara-C prodrug multimeric form increases 5-fold its payload.

It is particularly efficient in treatment for acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. Here we tested whether BS-HH-002 also had anti-cancer effects on solid tumors, especially pancreatic cancer. The results showed that BS-HH-002 treatment resulted in the complete degradation of the anti-apoptosis protein MCL-1, thereby inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells. In contrast, BCL-2 and BCL-XL protein levels were still detected in apoptotic cells. Further, we compared HHT and BS-HH-002 in terms of PK and heart toxicity in animals. Compared to HHT, BS-HH-002 quickly reached high blood concentration after intravenous injection or oral administration, without causing obvious cardiac toxicity.

Whether late toxicity risks are also elevated is unknown. METHODS: The authors identified all patients diagnosed with leukemia before the age of 18 years in Ontario, Canada between 1987 and 2013 and who survived greater than 5 years since their last pediatric cancer event. Survivors were divided into those with and without DS, matched by birth year, sex, leukemia type, and receipt of radiation. DS survivors were matched to individuals with DS without childhood cancer (DS controls) in a 1:10 ratio. Outcomes were identified through linkage to population-based health services databases. RESULTS: DS survivors (n = 79) experienced inferior overall survival compared to non-DS survivors (n = 231) (20-year overall survival, 81.7% +/- 6.8% vs 98.3% +/- 1.2%; hazard ratio [HR], 12.8; P < .0001) and to DS controls (n = 790; 96.3% +/- 1.2%; HR, 5.4 P < .0001). Pulmonary and infectious deaths were noted among DS survivors. There was no difference in the incidence of congestive heart failure between DS survivors and either control cohort, nor of hearing loss or dementia between DS survivors and DS controls. CONCLUSIONS: DS survivors were at substantially higher risk of late mortality than non-DS survivors or DS controls. This excess risk was not attributable to cardiac- or subsequent malignant neoplasm-related late effects, historically main causes of premature death among non-DS survivors. Chronic morbidities associated with DS were not increased compared to DS controls.

The broader clinical implications of PTPN11 mutations in AML are still not well understood. The objective of this study was to determine which cytogenetic abnormalities and gene mutations co-occur with PTPN11 mutations and how PTPN11 mutations impact outcomes of patients treated with intensive chemotherapy. We studied 1,725 newly diagnosed AML patients (excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia) enrolled onto the Cancer and Leukemia Group B/Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology trials. In 140 PTPN11-mutated patient samples, PTPN11 most commonly co-occurred with mutations in NPM1, DNMT3A, and TET2. PTPN11 mutations were relatively common in patients with an inv(3)(q21q26)/t(3;3)(q21;q26) and a normal karyotype but were very rare in patients with typical complex karyotype and core-binding factor AML. Mutations in the N-terminal SH2 domain of PTPN11 were associated with a higher early death rate than those in the phosphatase domain. PTPN11 mutations did not affect outcomes of NPM1-mutated patients, but these patients were less likely to have co-occurring kinase mutations (i.e., FLT3-ITD), suggesting activation of overlapping signaling pathways. However, in AML patients with wild-type NPM1, PTPN11 mutations were associated with adverse patient outcomes providing a rationale to study the biology and treatment approaches in this molecular group.",['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society of Hematology.'],"['Fobare, Sydney', 'Kohlschmidt, Jessica', 'Ozer, Hatice Gulcin', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Nicolet, Deedra', 'Mims, Alice S', 'Garzon, Ramiro', 'Blachly, James S', 'Orwick, Shelley', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Wang, Eunice S', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Oakes, Christopher C', 'Eisfeld, Ann-Kathrin', 'Hertlein, Erin', 'Byrd, John C']","['Fobare S', 'Kohlschmidt J', 'Ozer HG', 'Mrozek K', 'Nicolet D', 'Mims AS', 'Garzon R', 'Blachly JS', 'Orwick S', 'Carroll AJ', 'Stone RM', 'Wang ES', 'Kolitz JE', 'Powell BL', 'Oakes CC', 'Eisfeld AK', 'Hertlein E', 'Byrd JC']","['The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States.', 'The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States.', 'The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States.', 'The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States.', 'The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States.', 'The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States.', 'The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States.', 'The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States.', 'The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States.', 'University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, United States.', 'Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, New York, United States.', 'Monter Cancer Institute, Northwell Health System, Lake Success, New York, United States.', 'Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, United States.', 'The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States.', 'The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States.', 'The Ohio State University, United States.', 'The Ohio State University, United States.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211130,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,,2021/12/01 06:00,2021/12/01 06:00,['2021/11/30 17:26'],"['2021/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/26 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/30 17:26 [entrez]', '2021/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/01 06:00 [medline]']","['482838 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2021006242 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Blood Adv. 2021 Nov 30. pii: 482838. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2021006242.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-8315-8051', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1408-5063', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7796-0251', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8971-2199', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4275-5562', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4537-1409', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8493-5679']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FMRP and RNA helicase Moloney Leukemia virus 10 (MOV10) are important Argonaute (AGO) cofactors for miRNA-mediated translation regulation. We previously showed that MOV10 functionally associates with FMRP. Here we quantify the effect of reduced MOV10 and FMRP expression on dendritic morphology. Murine neurons with reduced MOV10 and FMRP phenocopied Dicer1 KO neurons which exhibit impaired dendritic maturation Hong J (2013), leading us to hypothesize that MOV10 and FMRP regulate DICER expression. In cells and tissues expressing reduced MOV10 or no FMRP, DICER expression was significantly reduced. Moreover, the Dicer1 mRNA is a Cross-Linking Immunoprecipitation (CLIP) target of FMRP Darnell JC (2011), MOV10 Skariah G (2017) and AGO2 Kenny PJ (2020). MOV10 and FMRP modulate expression of DICER1 mRNA through its 3'untranslated region (UTR) and introduction of a DICER1 transgene restores normal neurite outgrowth in the Mov10 KO neuroblastoma Neuro2A cell line and branching in MOV10 heterozygote neurons.

In addition, owing to the large surface area, PMANs efficiently transported doxorubicin (DOX) to prostate cancer for synergistic therapy. Surprisingly, we found that PMANs could sensitize prostate cancer cells to DOX through downregulating the expression of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), which further augmented the GPX4 downregulation-mediated ferroptotic tumoricidal effect. Given that arsenic trioxide has been routinely and successfully used in the clinical treatment of leukemia for a long time, we anticipate that PMANs will offer a promising strategy for prostate cancer therapy.",,"['Wang, Hui', 'Zhang, Li', 'Miao, Zhaohua', 'Zhang, Meng', 'Liu, Hang', 'He, Qiong', 'Meng, Jialin', 'Wen, Longping', 'Ke, Zunfu', 'Zha, Zhengbao', 'Lin, Run', 'Liang, Chaozhao']","['Wang H', 'Zhang L', 'Miao Z', 'Zhang M', 'Liu H', 'He Q', 'Meng J', 'Wen L', 'Ke Z', 'Zha Z', 'Lin R', 'Liang C']","['Department of Urology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Institute of Urology, Anhui Medical University and Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Genitourinary Diseases, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, 230022, China. liang_chaozhao@ahmu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210621,England,Mater Horiz,Materials horizons,101623537,IM,,2021/12/01 06:00,2021/12/01 06:00,['2021/11/30 12:25'],"['2021/11/30 12:25 [entrez]', '2021/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/d0mh01992e [doi]'],ppublish,Mater Horiz. 2021 Aug 1;8(8):2216-2229. doi: 10.1039/d0mh01992e.

However, the application of ATO in treating advanced solid tumors like hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still restricted by limited therapeutic efficacy and insufferable side effects. To solve this problem, we reported a general and facile strategy using human serum albumin (HSA) as a template for synthesizing a series of ATO-based nanoparticles with uniform single-albumin size. Then, we prepared a multifunctional drug delivery system (MDDS) based on MnAs/HSA termed MnAs/ICG/HSA-RGD, and tested its efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. Our results revealed that the photothermal effect of MnAs/ICG/HSA-RGD can not only cause irreversible damage to the tumor but also accelerate the discharge of As and Mn(2+) ions, enabling responsive chemotherapy and magnetic resonance imaging. Interestingly, the expression of HSP90, vimentin, and MMP-9 in tumor cells was inhibited during the treatment, resulting in less metastasis and recurrence. Moreover, no apparent side effect has been observed during the treatment. Therefore, MnAs/ICG/HSA-RGD can be considered as a promising option for HCC with excellent therapeutic efficacy and minimum side effects.",,"['Zhang, Ke', 'Li, Dan', 'Zhou, Bin', 'Liu, Jiani', 'Luo, Xiangjie', 'Wei, Ruixue', 'Wang, Lizhu', 'Hu, Xiaojun', 'Su, Zhongzhen', 'Lin, Hongyu', 'Gao, Jinhao', 'Shan, Hong']","['Zhang K', 'Li D', 'Zhou B', 'Liu J', 'Luo X', 'Wei R', 'Wang L', 'Hu X', 'Su Z', 'Lin H', 'Gao J', 'Shan H']","['Department of Interventional Medicine, Department of Ultrasound, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Molecular Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong 519000, China. suzhzh3@mail.sysu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Interventional Medicine, Department of Ultrasound, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Molecular Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong 519000, China. suzhzh3@mail.sysu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Interventional Medicine, Department of Ultrasound, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Molecular Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong 519000, China. suzhzh3@mail.sysu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Interventional Medicine, Department of Ultrasound, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Molecular Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong 519000, China. suzhzh3@mail.sysu.edu.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, The MOE Laboratory of Spectrochemical Analysis & Instrumentation, The Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology of Fujian Province, and Department of Chemical Biology, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361005, China. hylin007@xmu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Cerebrovascular Diseases, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan 450052, China.', 'Department of Interventional Medicine, Department of Ultrasound, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Molecular Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong 519000, China. suzhzh3@mail.sysu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Interventional Medicine, Department of Ultrasound, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Molecular Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong 519000, China. suzhzh3@mail.sysu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Interventional Medicine, Department of Ultrasound, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Molecular Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong 519000, China. suzhzh3@mail.sysu.edu.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, The MOE Laboratory of Spectrochemical Analysis & Instrumentation, The Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology of Fujian Province, and Department of Chemical Biology, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361005, China. hylin007@xmu.edu.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, The MOE Laboratory of Spectrochemical Analysis & Instrumentation, The Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology of Fujian Province, and Department of Chemical Biology, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361005, China. hylin007@xmu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Interventional Medicine, Department of Ultrasound, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging, Guangdong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Molecular Imaging, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong 519000, China. suzhzh3@mail.sysu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211221,England,Biomater Sci,Biomaterials science,101593571,IM,,2021/12/01 06:00,2021/12/24 06:00,['2021/11/30 12:21'],"['2021/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/24 06:00 [medline]', '2021/11/30 12:21 [entrez]']",['10.1039/d1bm01374b [doi]'],epublish,Biomater Sci. 2021 Dec 21;10(1):243-257. doi: 10.1039/d1bm01374b.,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1821-3640', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7281-7357', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3215-7013']",,,,,20211223,"['0 (Arsenites)', 'ZIF514RVZR (Serum Albumin, Human)']",,"['*Arsenites', '*Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/drug therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', '*Liver Neoplasms/drug therapy', '*Nanoparticles', 'Photothermal Therapy', 'Serum Albumin, Human']",,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out in the Hospital University of Sfax, south of Tunisia from January 2016 to October 2020, including all CML patients in the chronic phase at diagnosis, treated with TKI (tyrosine kinase inhibitors) for a minimum duration of 6 months. Quantitative assessment of the BCR-ABL transcript was performed using the Cepheid Xpert BCR-ABL ultra-assay. Molecular response and outcome were evaluated, according to the European Leukemia Net guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 162 CML patients were carried out. The median age was 50 years, the sex ratio M/F was 1.62. The rate of cumulative EMR; MMR and DMR was 80.8%; 73.8% and 55.9% respectively. According to the ELN criteria, 141 CML patients were evaluable. Optimal, suboptimal response and failure were noted in 81 (57.4%), 33(23.4%), and 27(19.1%) patients, respectively. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 96.3% and 85%. Risk factors for an event (death/progression) were lack of EMR, MMR, and DMR (P < 0.05). Among 149 patients with sustained DMR; 14 (8.6%) CML patients have discontinued TKI therapy. CONCLUSION: Despite the limit of our study (duration and size), the available real-life molecular responses with TKI therapy should be considered to identify potentially CML patients eligible for discontinuation of TKI therapy.",,"['Frikha, Rim', 'Kassar, Olfa', 'Elloumi, Moez', 'Kamoun, Hassen']","['Frikha R', 'Kassar O', 'Elloumi M', 'Kamoun H']","['Department of Medical Genetics, Hospital Hedi Chaker of Sfax, Tunisia.', 'Department of Haematology, Hospital Hedi Chaker of Sfax, Tunisia.', 'Department of Haematology, Hospital Hedi Chaker of Sfax, Tunisia.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Hospital Hedi Chaker of Sfax, Tunisia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211130,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,IM,,2021/12/01 06:00,2021/12/01 06:00,['2021/11/30 12:16'],"['2021/11/30 12:16 [entrez]', '2021/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/10781552211048232 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2021 Nov 30:10781552211048232. doi: 10.1177/10781552211048232.,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4415-8785'],,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'molecular response', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report the case of a patient with severe cardiomyopathy, mechanically supported by a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), who subsequently developed Philadelphia-chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph + ALL). To our knowledge, this is the first report of anthracycline administration in a patient with heart failure requiring mechanical support. CASE REPORT: Our 27-year-old female patient was diagnosed with Ph + B-ALL as part of workup for leukocytosis. Past medical history included non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30-35% and moderate-severe right ventricular dysfunction, for which LVAD had been placed 4 years previously. MANAGEMENT & OUTCOME: After shared decision-making and multidisciplinary discussions, we felt that hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and dexamethasone alternating with cytarabine and high-dose methotrexate in addition to ponatinib (HyperCVAD-ponatinib) best balanced the patient's goals for aggressive treatment with the potential for rapid and durable remissions. The patient received a single reduced dose of doxorubicin alongside dexrazoxane with her first cycle of HyperCVAD-ponatinib. She attained a complete molecular response 22 days later and remains in remission (with stable cardiac function) 30 months later on maintenance therapy. DISCUSSION: In conclusion, LVAD placement is not an absolute contra-indication to anthracyclines if such therapies offer the best opportunity for a durable response.",,"['Banerjee, Rahul', 'Lo, Mimi', 'Klein, Liviu', 'Aras, Mandar', 'Logan, Aaron C']","['Banerjee R', 'Lo M', 'Klein L', 'Aras M', 'Logan AC']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, 8785University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pharmacy, 8785University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.', 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, 8785University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.', 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, 8785University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, 8785University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211130,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,IM,,2021/12/01 06:00,2021/12/01 06:00,['2021/11/30 12:16'],"['2021/11/30 12:16 [entrez]', '2021/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/10781552211062148 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2021 Nov 30:10781552211062148. doi: 10.1177/10781552211062148.,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3781-5441'],,,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'Case report', 'anthracycline', 'cardiomyopathy', 'dexrazoxane', 'doxorubicin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (HPP), the severe clinical form of HE, the morphological diagnosis is difficult due to the presence of a RBC morphological picture characterized by a mixture of elliptocytes, spherocytes, tear-drop cells, and fragmented cells. This difficulty increases in new-borns and/or patients requiring frequent transfusions, making impossible the prediction of the disease course or its severity. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the measurement of osmotic gradient ektacytometry (OGE), using a laser-assisted optical rotational ektacytometer LoRRca (MaxSis, RR Mechatronics), allows a clear differentiation between HS and HE, where the truncated osmoscan curve reflects the inability of the already elliptical cells to deform further under shear stress in the face of hypotonicity. In HPP, however, the RBCs appear to have a significantly decreased ability to maintain deformability in these conditions, and the classical trapezoidal profile of HE is less evident or indistinguishable from HS. Here, two unrelated patients with hereditary hemolytic anemia (HHA) due to HPP and HS, respectively, are described with the joint inheritance of a complex set of five genetic defects. Two of these defects are novel alpha-spectrin gene (SPTA1) variants, one is a microdeletion that removes the entire SPTA1 gene, and two are well-known low-expression polymorphic alleles: alpha-LELY and alpha-LEPRA. In the HPP patient (ID1), with many circulating spherocytes, the interactions between the two SPTA1 gene variants may lead, in addition to an elongation defect (elliptocytes), to a loss of membrane stability and vesiculation (spherocytes), and RBCs appear to have a significantly decreased ability to maintain deformability in hypotonic conditions. Due to this, the classical trapezoidal profile of HE may become less evident or indistinguishable from HS. The second patient (ID2) was a classical severe form of HS with the presence of more than 20% of spherocytes and few pincered cells. The severity of clinical manifestation is due to the coinheritance of a microdeletion of chromosome 1 that removes the entire SPTA1 gene with a LEPRA SPTA1 variant in trans.

Here, we report the development of an AML cell membrane-coated nanoparticle (AMCNP) vaccine platform, in which immune-stimulatory adjuvant-loaded nanoparticles are coated with leukemic cell membrane material. This AMCNP vaccination strategy stimulates leukemia-specific immune responses by co-delivering membrane-associated antigens along with adjuvants to antigen-presenting cells. To demonstrate that this AMCNP vaccine enhances leukemia-specific antigen presentation and T cell responses, we modified a murine AML cell line to express membrane-bound chicken ovalbumin as a model antigen. AMCNPs were efficiently acquired by antigen-presenting cells in vitro and in vivo and stimulated antigen cross-presentation. Vaccination with AMCNPs significantly enhanced antigen-specific T cell expansion and effector function compared with control vaccines. Prophylactic vaccination with AMCNPs enhanced cellular immunity and protected against AML challenge. Moreover, in an AML post-remission vaccination model, AMCNP vaccination significantly enhanced survival in comparison to vaccination with whole leukemia cell lysates. Collectively, AMCNPs retained AML-specific antigens, elicited enhanced antigen-specific immune responses, and provided therapeutic benefit against AML challenge.",['(c) 2021.

Identification of the mechanisms responsible for long vs. more typical, standard remissions may help to define prognostic determinants for chemotherapy responses. Using exome sequencing, RNA-sequencing, and functional immunologic studies, we characterized 28 normal karyotype (NK)-AML patients with >5 y first remissions after chemotherapy (LFRs) and compared them to a well-matched group of 31 NK-AML patients who relapsed within 2 y (standard first remissions [SFRs]). Our combined analyses indicated that genetic-risk profiling at presentation (as defined by European LeukemiaNet [ELN] 2017 criteria) was not sufficient to explain the outcomes of many SFR cases. Single-cell RNA-sequencing studies of 15 AML samples showed that SFR AML cells differentially expressed many genes associated with immune suppression. The bone marrow of SFR cases had significantly fewer CD4(+) Th1 cells; these T cells expressed an exhaustion signature and were resistant to activation by T cell receptor stimulation in the presence of autologous AML cells. T cell activation could be restored by removing the AML cells or blocking the inhibitory major histocompatibility complex class II receptor, LAG3. Most LFR cases did not display these features, suggesting that their AML cells were not as immunosuppressive. These findings were confirmed and extended in an independent set of 50 AML cases representing all ELN 2017 risk groups. AML cell-mediated suppression of CD4(+) T cell activation at presentation is strongly associated with unfavorable outcomes in AML patients treated with standard chemotherapy.",,"['Ferraro, Francesca', 'Miller, Christopher A', 'Christensen, Keegan A', 'Helton, Nichole M', ""O'Laughlin, Margaret"", 'Fronick, Catrina C', 'Fulton, Robert S', 'Kohlschmidt, Jessica', 'Eisfeld, Ann-Kathrin', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Ramakrishnan, Sai Mukund', 'Day, Ryan B', 'Wartman, Lukas D', 'Uy, Geoffrey L', 'Welch, John S', 'Christopher, Matthew J', 'Heath, Sharon E', 'Baty, Jack D', 'Schuelke, Matthew J', 'Payton, Jacqueline E', 'Spencer, David H', 'Rettig, Michael P', 'Link, Daniel C', 'Walter, Matthew J', 'Westervelt, Peter', 'DiPersio, John F', 'Ley, Timothy J']","['Ferraro F', 'Miller CA', 'Christensen KA', 'Helton NM', ""O'Laughlin M"", 'Fronick CC', 'Fulton RS', 'Kohlschmidt J', 'Eisfeld AK', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Ramakrishnan SM', 'Day RB', 'Wartman LD', 'Uy GL', 'Welch JS', 'Christopher MJ', 'Heath SE', 'Baty JD', 'Schuelke MJ', 'Payton JE', 'Spencer DH', 'Rettig MP', 'Link DC', 'Walter MJ', 'Westervelt P', 'DiPersio JF', 'Ley TJ']","['Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO 63110.', 'Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO 63110.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO 63110.', 'Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO 63110.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO 63110.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO 63110.', 'McDonnell Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO 63110.', 'McDonnell Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO 63110.', 'McDonnell Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO 63110.', 'The Clara D.

This is the first description with such wide use of proteasome inhibitors in first line treatment. POEMS (Polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M-protein, skin changes) syndrome is a rare and challenging plasma cell disorder, both in the diagnostic and therapeutic management of the disease. Currently, the literature on POEMS is sparse with most evidence being case reports and small case studies. We present a retrospective real world experience of 108 patients with POEMS. We analyzed the clinical features and therapeutic interventions. Regarding clinical features, our findings demonstrated that skin lesions, thrombocythemia and polycythemia were present less frequently than reported previously. Regarding clinical interventions, this is one of the largest analyses of front line treatment in POEMS and the first one to include frequent utilization of proteasome inhibitors (37%). Bortezomib monotherapy was the most effective therapy achieving complete remission/very good partial remissions (CR/VGPR) in 69% of patients.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to be involved in 5-FU resistance. Previously, we first detected that lncRNA cetuximab resistance-associated RNA transcript 16 (CRART16) could contribute to cetuximab resistance by upregulating V-Erb-B2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homologue 3 (ERBB3) expression by sponging miR-371a-5p in CRC cells. The current study aimed to explore the role of CRART16 in acquired 5-FU resistance in CRC cells and its possible mechanism. METHODS: Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to measure the expression levels of CRART16 in a 5-FU-resistant CRC cell subline (SW620/5-FU) and the parent cell line. Lentivirus transduction was performed to establish SW620 and Caco-2 cells stably overexpressing CRART16. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assays and colony formation assays were applied to measure cell chemosensitivity to 5-FU. Flow cytometric and immunofluorescence staining were adopted to assess cell apoptosis induced by 5-FU. The dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to validate the direct interactions between CRART16 and miR-193b-5p and between miR-193b-5p and high-mobility group AT-hook-2 (HMGA2). The expression levels of HMGA2, apoptosis-associated proteins and p-ERK were examined by western blotting. The statistical differences within any two groups were used Student's t test. RESULTS: CRART16 was upregulated in SW620/5-FU cells. Overexpression of CRART16 reduced the sensitivity of CRC cells to 5-FU by attenuating apoptosis. In addition, CRART16 promoted 5-FU resistance by suppressing the expression of miR-193b-5p. Furthermore, CRART16 modulated the expression of HMGA2 by inhibiting miR-193b-5p and activated the MAPK signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: CRART16 confers 5-FU resistance in CRC cells through the CRART16/miR-193b-5p/HMGA2/MAPK pathway.",['(c) 2021.

A methodology for the efficient development of the underlying analytics that improve care.,336,10.1186/s12911-021-01682-9 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Much has been invested in big data and artificial intelligence-based solutions for healthcare. However, few applications have been implemented in clinical practice. Early economic evaluations can help to improve decision-making by developers of analytics underlying these solutions aiming to increase the likelihood of successful implementation, but recommendations about their use are lacking. The aim of this study was to develop and apply a framework that positions best practice methods for economic evaluations alongside development of analytics, thereby enabling developers to identify barriers to success and to select analytics worth further investments. METHODS: The framework was developed using literature, recommendations for economic evaluations and by applying the framework to use cases (chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), intensive care, diabetes). First, the feasibility of developing clinically relevant analytics was assessed and critical barriers to successful development and implementation identified. Economic evaluations were then used to determine critical thresholds and guide investment decisions. RESULTS: When using the framework to assist decision-making of developers of analytics, continuing development was not always feasible or worthwhile. Developing analytics for progressive CLL and diabetes was clinically relevant but not feasible with the data available. Alternatively, developing analytics for newly diagnosed CLL patients was feasible but continuing development was not considered worthwhile because the high drug costs made it economically unattractive for potential users. Alternatively, in the intensive care unit, analytics reduced mortality and per-patient costs when used to identify infections (- 0.5%, - euro886) and to improve patient-ventilator interaction (- 3%, - euro264). Both analytics have the potential to save money but the potential benefits of analytics that identify infections strongly depend on infection rate; a higher rate implies greater cost-savings. CONCLUSIONS: We present a framework that stimulates efficiency of development of analytics for big data and artificial intelligence-based solutions by selecting those applications of analytics for which development is feasible and worthwhile. For these applications, results from early economic evaluations can be used to guide investment decisions and identify critical requirements.",['(c) 2021.

The objective of our study was to evaluate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibody responses in patients with CLL after the first, second, and third doses of the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines and after a single dose for patients with confirmed previous COVID-19. In all, 530 patients were included in the study. Patients received 2 doses at a 4-week interval and a third dose if they were seronegative after the second dose. Response rate was 27% after dose 1 and 52% after dose 2. Post-dose 2 treatment-naive patients had the highest response rate (72%) followed by patients previously treated by chemoimmunotherapy (60%). Among patients receiving therapy, those receiving Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor alone (22%) or in combination with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies or venetoclax (0%) had the poorer response rate whereas patients who received venetoclax monotherapy achieved a significantly higher response rate (52%). A multivariable analysis identified age older than 65 years, ongoing CLL treatment, and gamma globulin </=6 g/L as independent predictors of the absence of seroconversion. Post-dose 2 seronegative patients had a global response rate of 35% after dose 3.

Also, iron deficiency anemia and anemia in general are linked with an increased risk of various cancers, particularly blood cancers. It is known that subjects with IDA as well as smokers have elevated blood levels of toxic divalent cations, particularly cadmium (Cd(2+)) and lead (Pb(2+)). Cadmium is a proven carcinogen. Most of the circulating cadmium is bound to transferrin and apart from the target organs of cadmium accumulation, kidney and liver, tissues (cells) which highly express transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) may also accumulate high levels of circulating cadmium. Density of TfR1, glycoprotein that is expressed on cell surface, is not uniform in bone marrow cells. Namely, megakaryocyte/erythrocyte progenitors and pro-erythroblasts express TfR1 incomparably more than other cell lines within the bone marrow and we hypothesize that the mentioned cell lines will uptake most of the circulating cadmium and lead, and will consequently be most suitable for malignant transformation.

Whether this occurs in natural membranes is unknown. Here, we investigated this issue using plasma membrane vesicles (PMVs) from rat leukemia RBL-2H3 cells. Membrane domain formation and order was assessed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer and fluorescence anisotropy. We found that ordered domains in PMVs prepared from cells by N-ethyl maleimide (NEM) treatment formed up to approximately 37 degrees C, whereas ordered domains in symmetric vesicles formed from the extracted PMV lipids were stable up to 55 degrees C, indicating the stability of ordered domains was substantially decreased in intact PMVs. This behavior paralleled lesser ordered domain stability in artificial asymmetric lipid vesicles relative to the corresponding symmetric vesicles, suggesting intact PMVs exhibit some degree of lipid asymmetry. This was supported by phosphatidylserine mislocalization on PMV outer leaflets as judged by annexin binding, which indicated NEM-induced PMVs are much more asymmetric than PMVs formed by dithiothreitol/paraformaldehyde treatment. Destroying asymmetry by reconstitution of PMVs using detergent dilution also showed stabilization of domain formation, even though membrane proteins remained associated with reconstituted vesicles. Similar domain stabilization was observed in artificial asymmetric lipid vesicles after destroying asymmetry via detergent reconstitution. Proteinase K digestion of proteins had little effect on domain stability in NEM PMVs. We conclude that loss of PMV lipid asymmetry can induce ordered domain formation. The dynamic control of lipid asymmetry in cells may regulate domain formation in plasma membranes.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The advent of the first BCR-ABL inhibitor imatinib has significantly improved the clinical outcome of CML cases. However, resistance to imatinib occurs in 25-30% of CML patients. Due to the lack of effective therapeutic strategies, novel treatment approaches are urgently required for imatinib-resistant CML. Simvastatin, a well-known HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor that confers tremendous clinical benefits in cardiovascular diseases, has attracted mounting attentions for its potent antitumor effects on multiple tumor types. In this study, we demonstrated that simvastatin monotherapy was effective in diminishing cell viability in both imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant CML cells, including T351I mutated cells, with the latter being less vulnerable to the simvastatin than the former. Notably, we found that simvastatin acted as a robust cytotoxic sensitizer of imatinib to kill imatinib-resistant and T315I mutated CML cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, the cooperative interaction of simvastatin and imatinib was associated with the inactivation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which was a classical downstream pro-survival cascade of the BCR-ABL kinase. In addition, this drug combination obviously decreased Myc expression through attenuation of canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and increased H3K27 trimethylation. Taken together, we provide attractive preclinical results for the combinatorial regimen of simvastatin and imatinib against imatinib-resistant and T315I mutated CML cells. This combined regimens warrants further clinical investigations in patients with imatinib-resistant CML.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of M-Sec reduced viral infection in multiple co-culture conditions. Furthermore, M-Sec knockdown reduced the number of proviral copies in the tissues of a mouse model of HTLV-1 infection. Phenotypically, M-Sec knockdown or inhibition reduced not only plasma membrane protrusions and migratory activity of cells, but also large clusters of Gag, a viral structural protein required for the formation of viral particles.

A concomitant suppression of local defence mechanisms, such as saliva may further aggravate the adverse consequences of chemotherapy. The present study was conducted to evaluate alterations in salivary flow rate, pH and buffering capacity and to correlate these parameters with Absolute Neutrophil Counts (ANC). METHODS: A cohort of 43 patients, aged 3-12 years were evaluated for the aforementioned parameters at baseline, post-induction and post-consolidation phases. Salivary collection was done and ANC was measured from routine haematological reports. RESULTS: A decrease in the salivary parameters was observed at the end of Induction phase as compared to baseline, with a statistically significant decrease in unstimulated salivary flow rates (p < 0.01). Statistically significant positive correlations were found between ANC and salivary flow rate (p = 0.005), pH (p < 0.00) and buffering capacity (p < 0.00). On testing the significance of these correlations, all the values for these parameters were found to be statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Salivary parameters showed derangements over the phases of chemotherapy, with maximum decrease at the end of induction phase. The positive correlations of salivary parameters with ANC of the subjects may be considered indicative of a concomitant immunological compromise in these children.",['(c) 2021.

The impact of early palliative care (PC) consultation on EOL quality outcomes in HMs has not been well described. Objectives: In 2017 we embedded a PC specialist within our inpatient malignant hematology team at our hospital in Providence, Rhode Island to facilitate the use of early PC. We sought to determine if this practice was accompanied by a shift in EOL outcomes. Design/Setting: We conducted a retrospective review of patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at our institution in the two years before (Cohort A) and after (Cohort B) insertion of a PC specialist. We identified patients who received a PC consultation and whether it was early or late. We then examined EOL quality outcomes: hospitalizations and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions in the last 30 days of life, chemotherapy use in the last 14 days of life, use of hospice, and death out of hospital. Results: Among 139 AML patients, 46 in Cohort A and 93 in Cohort B, we identified 34 and 47 decedents in each cohort, respectively. There was no significant improvement in EOL outcomes between Cohort A and B or among patients receiving early PC (p > 0.05); however, PC in general across all cohorts was associated with significant increase in hospice use and fewer ICU admissions (p = 0.016 and 0.0043, respectively). Conclusion: Earlier PC consultation in AML was not significantly associated with improvement in EOL quality outcomes; however, PC use in general was with improvement in use of hospice and ICU utilization. Further studies are needed to more definitively examine the relationship between early PC and EOL outcomes in patients with HMs and to examine non EOL outcomes such as patient experience and quality-of-life measures.",,"['Pelcovits, Ari', 'Olszewski, Adam J', 'Decker, Dominic', 'Guyer, Dana', 'Leblanc, Thomas W', 'Egan, Pamela']","['Pelcovits A', 'Olszewski AJ', 'Decker D', 'Guyer D', 'Leblanc TW', 'Egan P']","['Department of Medicine, Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, USA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, Rhode Island, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, USA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, Rhode Island, USA.', 'Allina Health, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, USA.', 'Division of Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, Rhode Island, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapy, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, USA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, Rhode Island, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211125,United States,J Palliat Med,Journal of palliative medicine,9808462,IM,,2021/11/30 06:00,2021/11/30 06:00,['2021/11/29 12:19'],"['2021/11/29 12:19 [entrez]', '2021/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/jpm.2021.0193 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Palliat Med. 2021 Nov 25. doi: 10.1089/jpm.2021.0193.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-3354-4499', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8590-2916']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['early palliative care', 'end-of-life outcomes in hematologic malignancies']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to assess the possible protective effect of omega 3 fatty acids on early doxorubicin-induced cardiac toxicity in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty children of newly diagnosed ALL were randomized into two groups: group I (n = 30) who received omega 3 fatty acids 1000 mg/day for 6 months in addition to their usual protocol of chemotherapy including doxorubicin; and group II (n = 30) who received their usual doxorubicin protocol during the period from February 2020 till August 2021. Echocardiographic examinations were performed before and after the treatment. Glutathione, malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), troponin I, creatine kinase MB (CK-MB), and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) were measured also before and after omega 3 treatment. RESULTS: After 6 months of omega 3 administration, group I had a significantly lower MDA level and a significantly higher glutathione and SOD levels than group II. Similarly, the levels of troponin I, CK-MB, and NT-proBNP were significantly high in group II, whereas they were unchanged in group I after treatment. Similarly, systolic function (presented with peak mitral annular systolic velocity and two-dimensional global longitudinal strain) of the heart was preserved in omega 3-treated patients, unlike the control group that showed significant impairment of left ventricular function after 6 months. CONCLUSION: Omega 3 fatty acids may decrease early cardiac injury and doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in children with ALL.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['El Amrousy, Doaa', 'El-Afify, Dalia', 'Khedr, Rasha', 'Ibrahim, Ashraf Mohamed']","['El Amrousy D', 'El-Afify D', 'Khedr R', 'Ibrahim AM']","['Pediatric Department, Faculty of Medicine, Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt.', 'Clinical Oncology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt.', 'Pediatric Department, Faculty of Medicine, Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211129,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,,2021/11/30 06:00,2021/11/30 06:00,['2021/11/29 09:11'],"['2021/11/07 00:00 [revised]', '2021/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/29 09:11 [entrez]', '2021/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.29496 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2021 Nov 29:e29496. doi: 10.1002/pbc.29496.,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7836-1170'],,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'cardiotoxicity', 'doxorubicin', 'omega 3 fatty acids']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These tumors show overlapping characteristics on conventional MRI scans, making diagnosis difficult. PURPOSE: To investigate whether apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values differ between tumor types and to identify optimum cut-off values to accurately classify the tumors using different performance metrics. STUDY TYPE: Systematic review and meta-analysis. SUBJECTS: Seven studies reporting ADC in pediatric posterior fossa tumors (115 medulloblastoma, 68 ependymoma, and 86 pilocytic astrocytoma) were included following PubMed and ScienceDirect searches. SEQUENCE AND FIELD STRENGTH: Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) was performed on 1.5 and 3 T across multiple institution and vendors. ASSESSMENT: The combined mean and standard deviation of ADC were calculated for each tumor type using a random-effects model, and the effect size was calculated using Hedge's g. STATISTICAL TESTS: Sensitivity/specificity, weighted classification accuracy, balanced classification accuracy. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant, and a Hedge's g value of >1.2 was considered to represent a large difference. RESULTS: The mean (+/- standard deviation) ADCs of medulloblastoma, ependymoma, and pilocytic astrocytoma were 0.76 +/- 0.16, 1.10 +/- 0.10, and 1.49 +/- 0.16 mm(2) /sec x 10(-3) . To maximize sensitivity and specificity using the mean ADC, the cut-off was found to be 0.96 mm(2) /sec x 10(-3) for medulloblastoma and ependymoma and 1.26 mm(2) /sec x 10(-3) for ependymoma and pilocytic astrocytoma. The meta-analysis showed significantly different ADC distributions for the three posterior fossa tumors. The cut-off values changed markedly (up to 7%) based on the performance metric used and the prevalence of the tumor types. DATA CONCLUSION: There were significant differences in ADC between tumor types. However, it should be noted that only summary statistics from each study were analyzed and there were differences in how regions of interest were defined between studies.

In this study, it was investigated whether suppression of STAT5 via a ""STAT5 inhibitor"" Pimozide resulted in any regain of chemosensitivity to third-generation TKI Ponatinib. Accordingly, the experimental work was designed on both parental CML cell line K562WT and its 1 nM Ponatinib-resistant counterpart, indicated as K562-Pon1. Based on the experimental results, Pimozide was more effective in resistant cells compared to wild-type cells for inducing apoptosis and block cell arrest. Combination therapy of Pimozide and Ponatinib demonstrated that STAT5 was a significant protein for regaining chemosensitivity to Ponatinib when its expression was suppressed both at mRNA and protein level. In conclusion, we consider that STAT5 inhibitor Pimozide can be a good alternative or combination therapy with TKIs for patients suffering from chemotherapeutic drug resistance.

We designed a chemical genetics approach to investigate AURKB function. Using Crispr/Cas9 genome editing in mouse, we replaced an ATP binding pocket amino acid to permit binding of cell-permeable ATP analogs. We also introduced a second site supressor mutation to tolerate the pocket enlargement. Heterozygous mice were fertile, but never produced homozygous analog-sensitive mice.

However, nearly all children receiving vincristine treatment develop vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy (VIPN). The impact of adolescent vincristine treatment across the lifespan remains poorly understood. We, consequently, developed an adolescent rodent model of VIPN which can be utilized to study possible long term consequences of vincristine treatment in the developing rat. We also evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of voluntary exercise and potential impact of obesity as a genetic risk factor in this model on the development and maintenance of VIPN. Out of all the dosing regimens we evaluated, the most potent VIPN was produced by fifteen consecutive daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) vincristine injections at 100 microg/kg/day, throughout the critical period of adolescence from postnatal day 35 to 49. With this treatment, vincristine-treated animals developed hypersensitivity to mechanical and cold stimulation of the plantar hind paw surface, which outlasted the period of vincristine treatment and resolved within two weeks following the cessation of vincristine injection. By contrast, impairment in grip strength gain was delayed by vincristine treatment, emerging shortly following the termination of vincristine dosing, and persisted into early adulthood without diminishing. Interestingly, voluntary wheel running exercise prevented the development of vincristine-induced hypersensitivities to mechanical and cold stimulation. However, Zucker fa/fa obese animals did not exhibit higher risk of developing VIPN compared to lean rats. Our studies identify sensory and motor impairments produced by vincristine in adolescent animals and support the therapeutic efficacy of voluntary exercise for suppressing VIPN in developing rats.",['(c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Inc.'],"['Li, Ai-Ling', 'Crystal, Jonathon D', 'Lai, Yvonne Y', 'Sajdyk, Tammy J', 'Renbarger, Jamie L', 'Hohmann, Andrea G']","['Li AL', 'Crystal JD', 'Lai YY', 'Sajdyk TJ', 'Renbarger JL', 'Hohmann AG']","['Psychological and Brain Sciences, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA.', 'Psychological and Brain Sciences, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA.', 'Program in Neuroscience, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA.', 'Psychological and Brain Sciences, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Psychological and Brain Sciences, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA.', 'Gill Center for Biomolecular Science, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA.', 'Program in Neuroscience, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211111,United States,Neurobiol Pain,"Neurobiology of pain (Cambridge, Mass.)",101705141,,"['The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or', 'personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in', 'this paper.']",2021/11/30 06:00,2021/11/30 06:01,['2021/11/29 06:34'],"['2021/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/04 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/29 06:34 [entrez]', '2021/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.ynpai.2021.100077 [doi]', 'S2452-073X(21)00018-0 [pii]']",epublish,Neurobiol Pain. 2021 Nov 11;10:100077. doi: 10.1016/j.ynpai.2021.100077. eCollection 2021 Aug-Dec.,,,PMC8605395,['NOTNLM'],"['Adolescence', 'Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy', 'Exercise', 'Neuropathic pain', 'Obesity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we have evaluated and explored the effects of miR-125b, which is carried by HLAL-derived exosomes, on the hematopoietic function of HSCs and BM-MSCs. For this purpose, we have isolated exosomes from the peripheral blood of HLAL patients and healthy volunteers. Then, we measured the level of miR-125b in exosomes cocultured exosomes with HSCs and BM-MSCs. Moreover, we have used miR-125b inhibitors/mimic for intervention and then measured miR-125b expression and colony forming unit (CFU). Apart from it, HSC and BM-MSC hematopoietic-related factors alpha-globulin, gamma-globulin, CSF2, CRTX4 and CXCL12, SCF, IGF1, and DKK1 expression were measured. Evaluation of the miR-125b and BAK1 targeting relationship, level of miR-125b, and expression of hematopoietic-related genes was performed after patients are treated with miR-125b mimic and si-BAK1. We have observed that miR-125b was upregulated in HLAL-derived exosomes. After HLAL-exosome acts on HSCs, the level of miR-125b is upregulated, reducing CFU and affecting the expression of alpha-globulin, gamma-globulin, CSF2, and CRCX4. For BM-MSCs, after the action of HLAL-exo, the level of miR-125b is upregulated and affected the expression of CXCL12, SCF, IGF1, and DKK1. Exosomes derived from HLAL carry miR-125b to target and regulate BAK1. Further study confirmed that miR-125b and BAK1mimic reduced the expression of miR-125b and reversed the effect of miR-125b mimic on hematopoietic-related genes. These results demonstrated that HLAL-derived exosomes carrying miR-125b inhibit the hematopoietic differentiation of HSC and hematopoietic support function of BM-MSC through BAK1.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Yanmei Yang et al.'],"['Yang, Yanmei', 'He, Haiping', 'He, Jigang', 'Gu, Xuezhong', 'Hu, Peng', 'Zuo, Rongxia', 'Sa, Yalian']","['Yang Y', 'He H', 'He J', 'Gu X', 'Hu P', 'Zuo R', 'Sa Y']","[""Hematology Department, The First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, The Affiliated Hospital of Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan, China."", ""Hematology Department, The First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, The Affiliated Hospital of Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan, China."", ""Cardiac and Vascular Surgery, The First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, The Affiliated Hospital of Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan, China."", ""Hematology Department, The First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, The Affiliated Hospital of Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan, China."", ""Hematology Department, The First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, The Affiliated Hospital of Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan, China."", ""Institute of Clinical and Basic Medical Sciences, The First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, The Affiliated Hospital of Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan, China."", ""Institute of Clinical and Basic Medical Sciences, The First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, The Affiliated Hospital of Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan, China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211119,England,J Healthc Eng,Journal of healthcare engineering,101528166,IM,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],2021/11/30 06:00,2021/11/30 06:00,['2021/11/29 06:28'],"['2021/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/18 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/29 06:28 [entrez]', '2021/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2021/9457070 [doi]'],epublish,J Healthc Eng. 2021 Nov 19;2021:9457070. doi: 10.1155/2021/9457070. eCollection 2021.,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3720-1925'],,PMC8626181,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report a CLL evolved to mantle cell lymphoma by acquiring t(11;14)(q13;q32); CCND1-IGH. METHOD: A Retrospective review of clinical and laboratory data. RESULTS: A 39-year-old male patient was diagnosed with CLL/SLL, and was initially followed without specific treatment, but subsequently received chlorambucil/fludarabine/rituximab due to exacerbated lymphocytosis. While his CLL/SLL waned and waxed, the immunophenotype and genotype of neoplastic B-cells remained unchanged, without cyclin D1 expression and CCND1-IGH fusion. Eleven years after the diagnosis, the patient's disease showed evidence of progression. Bone marrow examination demonstrated ""CLL"" with the morphology and immunophenotype similar to those seen in the previous biopsies. Unexpectedly, the neoplastic B-cells demonstrated cyclin D1 expression and harbored t(11;14)(q13;q32); CCND1-IGH, suggesting a clonal evolution to mantle cell lymphoma. He subsequently received cytoreductive chemotherapy followed by allogenic bone marrow transplant and remained in remission since then. CONCLUSION: The retention of immunophenotype suggests a clonal relationship between CLL/SLL and mantle cell lymphoma. While the acquisition of t(11;14)(q13;q32); CCND1-IGH likely alters the disease course, the pathogenesis of this illegitimate translocation in CLL remains to be studied.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

The development of CAR T-cells for patients with haematological malignancies, especially B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (BCP-ALL), has been spectacular. However, currently, there are scientific, clinical and logistical challenges for use of CAR T-cells in BCP-ALL and other paediatric malignancies, particularly in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), lymphomas and solid tumours. The aims of the Forum were to summarise the current landscape of CAR T-cell therapy development in paediatrics, too identify current challenges and future directions, with consideration of other immune effector modalities and ascertain the best strategies to accelerate their development and availability to children. Although the effect is of limited duration in about half of the patients, anti-CD19 CAR T-cells produce high response rates in relapsed/refractory BCP-ALL and this has highlighted previously unknown mechanisms of relapse. CAR T-cell treatment as first- or second-line therapy could also potentially benefit patients whose disease has high-risk features associated with relapse and failure of conventional therapies. Identifying patients with very early and early relapse in whom CAR T-cell therapy may replace haematopoietic stem cell transplantation and be definitive therapy versus those in whom it provides a more effective bridge to haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a very high priority. Development of approaches to improve persistence, either by improving T cell fitness or using more humanised/fully humanised products and co-targeting of multiple antigens to prevent antigen escape, could potentially further optimise therapy. Many differences exist between paediatric B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (B-NHL) and BCP-ALL. In view of the very small patient numbers with relapsed lymphoma, careful prioritisation is needed to evaluate CAR T-cells in children with Burkitt lymphoma, primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma and other NHL subtypes. Combination trials of alternative targets to CD19 (CD20 or CD22) should also be explored as a priority to improve efficacy in this population. Development of CD30 CAR T-cell immunotherapy strategies in patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma will likely be most efficiently accomplished by joint paediatric and adult trials. CAR T-cell approaches are early in development for AML and T-ALL, given the unique challenges of successful immunotherapy actualisation in these diseases. At this time, CD33 and CD123 appear to be the most universal targets in AML and CD7 in T-ALL. The results of ongoing or planned first-in-human studies are required to facilitate further understanding. There are promising early results in solid tumours, particularly with GD2 targeting cell therapies in neuroblastoma and central nervous system gliomas that represent significant unmet clinical needs. Further understanding of biology is critical to success. The comparative benefits of autologous versus allogeneic CAR T-cells, T-cells engineered with T cell receptors T-cells engineered with T cell receptor fusion constructs, CAR Natural Killer (NK)-cell products, bispecific T-cell engager antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates require evaluation in paediatric malignancies. Early and proactive academia and multi-company engagement are mandatory to advance cellular immunotherapies in paediatric oncology. Regulatory advice should be sought very early in the design and preparation of clinical trials of innovative medicines, for which regulatory approval may ultimately be sought. Aligning strategic, scientific, regulatory, health technology and funding requirements from the inception of a clinical trial is especially important as these are very expensive therapies. The model for drug development for cell therapy in paediatric oncology could also involve a 'later stage handoff' to industry after early development in academic hands. Finally, and very importantly, strategies must evolve to ensure appropriate ease of access for children who need and could potentially benefit from these therapies.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s).

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated carnitine concentrations in patients with CML treated with TKIs. METHOD: This study included patients with well-controlled CML. Total carnitine and free carnitine concentrations were evaluated using the enzyme cycling method. The Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) and Cancer Fatigue Scale (CFS) were used to assess general fatigue developed during TKI therapy. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients on TKIs were included; 12 (21.8%) had low free carnitine concentrations. Free carnitine concentrations were higher in men than in women. Younger age was closely associated with lower free carnitine concentrations. TKI type, TKI dose, treatment response, or therapy duration were not associated with free carnitine concentrations. None of the scores (the global fatigue score with the BFI and CFS score) correlated with carnitine concentrations. Concentrations of free carnitine in the treatment-free remission group were slightly higher than those in the TKI group, with only 9.1% having a low concentration of free carnitine.

Currently, multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in mTOR gene (rs2295080, rs17036508 and rs1034528), mLST8 gene (rs3160 and rs26865) and RPTOR gene (rs1062935, rs3751932, rs3751834, rs12602885) have been extensively studied for their associations with cancer risk. However, the results remained inconclusive and conflicting. Therefore, we here performed a meta-analysis of all available studies to investigate the association between these SNPs and cancer risk. METHODS: Up to April 2021, 25 related publications were retrieved and included in this meta-analysis. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) calculated by fixed or random effects models were applied to assess the strength of association. Trial Sequential Analysis (TSA) was conducted to weaken the random error and enhance the reliability of evidence. RESULTS: After Bonferroni correction, it was revealed that rs3160, rs26865, rs1062935, rs3751932, rs3751834 and rs10602885 were not associated with cancer risk. However, rs17036508 and rs1034528 showed significant association with total cancer risk. A significant association was also found between rs2295080 and total cancer risk, and stratified analysis by cancer type suggested that rs2295080 was specifically associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia risk, prostate cancer risk, and breast cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS: The present meta-analysis suggested that the rs2295080, rs17036508 and rs1034528 polymorphisms in mTOR gene may be the susceptive factors for cancer development, while the target genetic polymorphisms in mLST8 gene or RPTOR gene may not be associated with cancer risk. However, these findings remain to be confirmed or further reinforced in large and well-designed studies in different ethnic populations.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier GmbH.

Prior studies on effects of home-based treatment lack inclusion of patients with hematologic malignancies. We present data from a multicenter single-arm feasibility and safety study of home-based intensive chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia and their quality of life and psychological wellbeing. This national study included patients from six sites in Denmark who received intensive chemotherapy on programmed CADD Solis infusion pumps through a central venous catheter and were also managed as outpatients during treatment-induced pancytopenia. Data are presented from 104 patients, receiving 272 treatments with 1.096 (mean 4.57, SD 3.0) home infusion days out of 1.644 treatment days (67 %). Sixty-two of 168 (36.9 %) reinduction and consolidation treatment cycles ensuing pancytopenia phases were solely handled in the outpatient clinic. Patients reported high satisfaction with home-based treatment, which had a positive influence on their ability to be involved in their treatment and be socially and physically active. No unexpected events occurred during the intervention. Overall, patients improved in all quality of life outcomes over time. Home-based intensive chemotherapy treatment was feasible and safe in this population. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04904211.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients who were >65 years old and not eligible for intensive induction regimens or patients with relapsed or refractory AML received 10 days of decitabine followed by 12 days of rapamycin in cycle 1 and 5 days of decitabine followed by 17 days of rapamycin in subsequent cycles. The composite complete remission rate (CR) was 33 % (CR plus CR with incomplete count recovery). Median overall survival was 7.7 months in newly diagnosed elderly AML patients and 6.6 months in relapsed/refractory AML patients. Twenty-four evaluable patients were enrolled, and the study did not meet its primary endpoint of demonstrating a significant improvement in composite CR rate with the combination as compared to an established historical CR rate of 25 % with decitabine alone. Despite that, the survival rates in relapsed/refractory cases appear comparable to what is reported with other salvage regimens, and no significant patterns of non-hematologic toxicity were noted. 50 % of subjects in the de novo group achieved a composite CR which is significantly higher (p = 0.02) than the rate of 25 % with decitabine alone.

Whether consolidative unrelated cord blood transplantation (UCBT) is suitable in R/R B-ALL after CAR-T therapy remain uncertain. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of CAR-T therapy before UCBT in children and young adults with R/R B-ALL. We retrospectively analyzed 43 patients aged <18 years with R/R B-ALL who underwent single-unit UCBT at the First Affiliated Hospital of the University of Science and Technology of China between February 2012 and November 2020. Among them, 21 patients achieved complete remission (CR) following CAR-T therapy before UCBT (the CAR-T group), and the remaining 22 patients remained in nonremission (NR) without prior CAR-T therapy before UCBT (the NR group). The clinical outcomes in the 2 groups were analyzed. The median time from CAR-T therapy to UCBT was 62 days (range, 42 to 185 days). There were no significant between-group differences in the incidences of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), grade III-IV acute GVHD, and 2-year extensive chronic GVHD. Compared with the NR group, the CAR-T group had a lower 2-year cumulative incidence of transplantation-related mortality and higher probabilities of 2-year overall survival, leukemia-free survival, and GVHD-free relapse-free survival (P = .037, .005, .028, and .017, respectively). However, the 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was comparably high in the 2 groups (26.7% in the CAR-T group and 38.3% in the NR group; P = .41). In the CAR-T group, patients who were minimal residual disease (MRD)-positive before UCBT had a higher CIR compared with those who were MRD-negative before UCBT (66.7% versus 19.2%; P = .006). CAR-T therapy followed by UCBT produces superior survival in R/R B-ALL, but treated patients still have a high post-transplantation relapse rate.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are self-report measures used to assess HRQOL and symptom burden. The extent to which PROs have been included in trials that include common AYA cancer types has not been previously assessed. METHODS: Therapeutic phase 3 trials among common AYA cancer types (Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, sarcomas, and germ cell tumors) initiated between 2007 and 2020 were identified on ClinicalTrials.gov. The proportions and characteristics of trials including a PRO endpoint were assessed. For comparison with an older population, the proportion of breast and colorectal therapeutic phase 3 trials including PRO endpoints were assessed. RESULTS: Eighty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria. Overall, 20.7% of therapeutic phase 3 AYA trials included a PRO endpoint, and only one trial published PRO data. Germ cell tumors (42.9%) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (40%) trials had the highest proportions of PRO inclusion. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer generic, cancer-specific quality of life questionnaire was the most commonly used PRO measure; nevertheless, the measures used varied within and between cancer types. The proportion of trials including a PRO endpoint did not change significantly between 2007 to 2013 and 2014 to 2020 (18.6% vs 22.7%, P=.79). CONCLUSIONS: Few therapeutic phase 3 AYA cancer trials include PRO endpoints, fewer publish PRO data, and there is no homogeneity in the measures administered. Therapeutic trials represent an underused opportunity to capture PRO data in the AYA population with the goal of improving HRQOL outcomes.","['Copyright (c) 2021 ISPOR-The Professional Society for Health Economics and', 'Outcomes Research.

In the process of cancer development, microRNAs act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Moreover, they are implicated in muscle development and wasting. This study sought to explore the mechanisms and correlation between miR-29c and muscle wasting in lung cancer cachexia. METHODS: Data for expression analysis were retrieved from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. qRT-PCR analyses were performed to explore the expression levels of miR-29c and Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF). Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cell line was used to establish a cachexia model to explore the functions of miR-29c and LIF in lung cancer cachexia. Furthermore, in vitro (in C2C12 myotubes) and in vivo (in LLC tumor-bearing mice) experiments were performed to explore the mechanisms of miR-29c and LIF in lung cachexia. RESULTS: Analysis of the lung cancer cachexia model showed that miR-29c was down-regulated, and its expression was negatively correlated with muscle catabolic activity. Overexpression of miR-29c mitigated the cachectic phenotype. Mechanistic studies showed that LIF was a direct target gene of miR-29c, and LIF was upregulated in vitro and in vivo. Analysis showed that LIF promoted muscle wasting through the JAK/STAT and MAP-kinase pathways. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicated that miR-29c was negatively correlated with the cachectic phenotype, and the miR-29c-LIF axis is a potential therapeutic target for cancer cachexia.",['(c) 2021.

This is believed to arise from aberrant DNA methyltransferase activity establishing abnormal levels of DNA methylation in tumor cells. DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-azacytidine (5-AZA), is a clinically used epigenetic drug which induces promoter demethylation and gene re-expression in human cancers. In this study, we investigated the cytotoxicity of on MOLT4 and Jurkat leukemic cell line in vitro and characterized the underlying molecular mechanisms of cell death and motility. MOLT4 and Jurkat cells were treated with 5-AZA for 12, 24 and 48 hours. The effect of the 5-AZA treatment on cell viability (MTT assay), apoptosis (annexin V/PI staining), microRNA (miRNA) and mRNA expression (real-time PCR) was measured. The results showed that 5-AZA could induce MOLT4 and Jurkat apoptotic cell death in vitro in a time-dependent manner and probably via apoptotic mechanisms. We found that treatment with 5-AZA could increase the expression of epigenetically silenced miRNAs, miR-34a, miR-34b and miR-124-1 in treated cells. In addition, mRNA analyses demonstrated that MOLT4 and jurkat cells, expressed p53 gene more than 10-fold higher compared with untreated cells in three independent experiments while the cells suppressed the expression of a subset of functionally related genes including MYC, BCL2, APEX, SIRT1, SNAIL1 and vimentin to some extent, following 5-AZA treatment. We found that a miRNAs expression level in treated cell lines was closely correlated to the expression of their target genes. Together, these findings suggest that 5-AZA may affect the viability of MOLT4 and jurkat cells, at least in part, by regulating the transcription of genes that are associated with cellular apoptotic response.",,"['Mogadasi, Maryam', 'Mohammadi, Ali', 'Emamgolizadeh, Behnam', 'Alivand, Mohammad Reza', 'Rahmanpour, Dara', 'Solali, Saeed']","['Mogadasi M', 'Mohammadi A', 'Emamgolizadeh B', 'Alivand MR', 'Rahmanpour D', 'Solali S']","['Student Research Committee, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, Division of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Cancer and Inflammation Research, Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.', 'Student Research Committee, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, Division of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Genetic, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Student Research Committee, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Molecular Medicine Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211101,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,IM,,2021/11/29 06:00,2021/11/29 06:00,['2021/11/28 17:37'],"['2021/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/28 17:37 [entrez]', '2021/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.31557/APJCP.2021.22.11.3723 [doi]'],epublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2021 Nov 1;22(11):3723-3734. doi: 10.31557/APJCP.2021.22.11.3723.,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-4275-628X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6487-3551']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['5-AZA', 'Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', 'Apoptosis', 'DNA Methylation', 'MicroRNA']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Around 30% of malignancies in children (ages 0-14) are caused by leukemia. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the time trends in the incidence of childhood leukemia (aged 0-14 years) in Iraq between 2000 and 2019. METHODS: Poisson regression with a log link function was used to analyze the long-term trends of incidence related to childhood leukemia cancer based on published data from the Iraqi cancer registry between 2000 and 2019. Annual estimates of the population, by 5-year age groups and by gender obtained from the United Nations, population Division. RESULTS: A total of 8,570 cases of leukemia children in Iraq between 2000 and 2019 were recorded, the boys to girl ratio were 1.32 to 1. The most diagnosed type of leukemia was Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, accounting for about 33.56%, followed by Leukemia Not specify (NOS) (17.3%) with a relatively equal proportion of stated instances between boys and girls in these subsets. The age-standardized incidence rates, aged 0-14 years, from 2000-2019 were 3.45/100,000 for both genders. The Joinpoint regression ASRs analysis of childhood leukemia from 2000-2019 among 0 -14 age group for both genders indicate that there was an overall significant increasing trend at 1.23% per year, while no one joinpoint was identified during the entire study period. Among boys, there was an overall insignificant increasing trend at 0.77% per year. Among girls, there was an overall significant increasing trend at 1.93% per year, while one joinpoint was identified during the entire study period. Conclusions: The overall (both genders) incidence rate of childhood leukemia has been increasing significantly in Iraq. The test for trends was insignificant among boys, while it was significant among girls.

This study assessed the efficiency of poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA)-miR 143/206 transfection on apoptosis in mouse leukemia cancer cells (El4) and spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, neonatal mouse spermatogonia cells and EL4 cancer cell lines were used. MicroRNA-PLGA NPs were prepared, characterized, and targeted with folate. Several doses were evaluated to obtain a suitable miR dose that can induce appropriate apoptosis in EL4 cells, while not harming SSCs. Cells were treated separately at 3 doses of each miR (for miR 143, doses of 25, 50 and 75 nmol and for miR 206, doses of 50, 100 and 150 nmol). The experiments were performed at 24, 48 and 72 hours. Viability and apoptosis were investigated by MTT and Annexin Kits. Results: Based on MTT assay results, the optimal dose of miR 143 was 75 nmol (59.87 +/- 2.85 % SSC and 35.3 +/- 0.78 % EL4) (P</=0.05), and for miR 206, the optimal dose was 150 nmol (54.82 +/- 6.7 % SSC and 33.92 +/- 3.01% EL4) (P</=0.05). The optimal time was 48 hours. At these doses, the survival rate of the EL4 cells was below the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) and SSC survival was above 50%. Annexin V staining also confirmed the selected doses (for miR 143 total apoptosis was 6.62% +/- 1.8 SSC and 37.4% +/- 4.2 EL4 (P</=0.05), and miR 206 was (10.98% +/- 1.5 SSC and 36.4% +/- 3.7 EL4, P</=0.05).

Although a previous study found that the PML-RARalpha fusion protein, which contributes to the pathophysiology of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), positively regulates STMN1 at the transcription and protein activity levels, little is known about the role of STMN1 in APL. In this study, we aimed to investigate the STMN1 expression levels and their associations with laboratory, clinical, and genomic data in APL patients. We also assessed the dynamics of STMN1 expression during myeloid cell differentiation and cell cycle progression, and the cellular effects of STMN1 silencing and pharmacological effects of microtubule-stabilizing drugs on APL cells. We found that STMN1 transcripts were significantly increased in samples from APL patients compared with those of healthy donors (all p < 0.05). However, this had no effect on clinical outcomes. STMN1 expression was associated with proliferation- and metabolism-related gene signatures in APL. Our data confirmed that STMN1 was highly expressed in early hematopoietic progenitors and reduced during cell differentiation, including the ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation model. STMN1 phosphorylation was predominant in a pool of mitosis-enriched APL cells. In NB4 and NB4-R2 cells, STMN1 knockdown decreased autonomous cell growth (all p < 0.05) but did not impact ATRA-induced apoptosis and differentiation. Finally, treatment with paclitaxel (as a single agent or combined with ATRA) induced microtubule stabilization, resulting in mitotic catastrophe with repercussions for cell viability, even in ATRA-resistant APL cells. This study provides new insights into the STMN1 functions and microtubule dynamics in APL.","['(c) 2021.

In the livestock production field, identifying the ECs of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection in cattle is desired to stop BLV transmission chains on farms. Cattle carrying the bovine leukocyte antigen (BoLA)-DRB3*009:02 allele (DRB3*009:02) have a strong possibility of being BLV ECs. Most of cattle carrying this allele maintain undetectable BLV proviral loads and do not shed virus even when infected. BLV ECs can act as transmission barriers when placed between uninfected and infected cattle in a barn. To identify cattle carrying DRB3*009:02 in large populations more easily, we developed a pooled testing system. It employs a highly sensitive, specific real-time PCR assay and TaqMan MGB probes (DRB3*009:02-TaqMan assay). Using this system, we determined the percentage of DRB3*009:02-carrying cattle on Kyushu Island, Japan. Our pooled testing system detected cattle carrying the DRB3*009:02 allele from a DNA pool containing one DRB3*009:02-positive animal and 29 cattle with other alleles. Its capacity is sufficient for herd-level screening for DRB3*009:02-carrying cattle. The DRB3*009:02-TaqMan assay showed high-discriminative sensitivity and specificity toward DRB3*009:02, making it suitable for identifying DRB3*009:02-carrying cattle in post-screening tests on individuals. We determined that the percentage of DRB3*009:02-carrying cattle in Kyushu Island was 10.56%. With its ease of use and reliable detection, this new method strengthens the laboratory typing for DRB3*009:02-carrying cattle. Thus, our findings support the use of BLV ECs in the field.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

There is increasing evidence that prolonged and intensive chemotherapy often fails to eradicate leukemic stem cells, which are protected by the bone marrow niche and can induce relapse. Thus, new therapeutic approaches to overcome chemoresistance are urgently needed. By conducting an ex vivo small molecule screen, here we have identified Quinacrine (QC) as a sensitizer for Cytarabine (AraC) in treating acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We show that QC enhances AraC-mediated killing of ALL cells, and subsequently abrogates AraC resistance both in vitro and in an ALL-xenograft model. However, while combo AraC+QC treatment prolongs the survival of primary transplanted recipients, the combination exhibits limited efficacy in secondary transplanted recipients, consistent with the survival of niche-protected leukemia stem cells. Introduction of Cdc42 Activity Specific Inhibitor, CASIN, enhances the eradication of ALL leukemia stem cells by AraC+QC and prolongs the survival of both primary and secondary transplanted recipients without affecting normal long-term human hematopoiesis. Together, our findings identify a small-molecule regimen that sensitizes AraC-mediated leukemia eradication and provide a potential therapeutic approach for better ALL treatment.",['(c) 2021.

It has become abundantly clear over the intervening decades that this family of cytokines has truly astonishing pleiotropic capacity, capable of regulating not only hematopoiesis but also many other normal and pathological processes such as development, inflammation, allergy and cancer. As noted in the current pandemic, betac cytokines contribute to the cytokine storm seen in acutely ill COVID-19 patients. Ongoing studies to discover how these cytokines activate their receptor are revealing insights into the fundamental mechanisms that give rise to cytokine pleiotropy and are providing tantalizing glimpses of how discrete signaling pathways may be dissected for activation with novel ligands for therapeutic benefit.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

Neurologic manifestations of these malignancies are manifolds. AML is the most common form of acute leukemia in adults and this review describes the neurologic complications in this age group. Neurologic symptoms and signs may develop in AML either from a direct neoplastic involvement of the central or the peripheral nervous system or as an indirect effect of the disease process. Direct involvement of the nervous system includes invasion of the central or the peripheral nervous system (parenchymal and leptomeningeal dissemination, myeloid sarcoma, neuroleukemiosis). Thrombotic and hemorrhagic events are common manifestations of indirect involvement of the nervous system and they are the outcome of hyperleukocytosis, thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy. Many neurologic complications are iatrogenic and include diverse categories such as lumbar puncture and intrathecal or systemic chemotherapy and targeted therapies, radiotherapy and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Most neurologic manifestations require urgent treatment and confer a poor prognosis. This review describes the neurologic complications of acute myeloid malignancies in the era of contemporary treatment.

Retinoic acid (RA) is an embryonic morphogen and dietary factor that demonstrates chemotherapeutic efficacy in inducing differentiation of a non-APL AML cell model, the HL-60 human myeloblastic (FAB-M2) leukemia cell line, via activation of a novel signalsome containing an ensemble of signaling molecules that drive differentiation. Bosutinib is an inhibitor of SFKs used to treat myeloid leukemias where prominent high expression of SFKs, in particular Lyn, has been observed. Using either Bosutinib or loss of Lyn expression due to shRNA promoted RA-induced phenotypic differentiation, G0 arrest, and respiratory burst (functional differentiation) of HL-60 cells. Signaling events putatively seminal to RA-induced differentiation, the expression of Fgr, Cbl, Slp-76 and Vav, and the phosphorylation of c-Raf (pS259), Vav (p-tyr), and Slp76 (p-tyr) were not inhibited by Bosutinib or loss of Lyn. Nor was RA-induced upregulation of p-tyr phosphorylation of p47phox, a member of the NADPH complex that produces ROS, a putative phosphorylation dependent signaling regulator. Surprisingly, Bosutinib still works in the absence of Lyn to enhance RA-induced differentiation and neither compromised RA-induced expression, nor phosphorylation of signaling molecules that drive differentiation. These findings suggested there is a novel, off-target, Lyn-independent effect of Bosutinib that is of therapeutic significance to differentiation therapy.",,"['Kazim, Noor', 'Yen, Andrew']","['Kazim N', 'Yen A']","['Department of Biomedical Science, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211126,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,,2021/11/28 06:00,2021/11/28 06:00,['2021/11/27 05:18'],"['2022/11/26 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2021/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/28 06:00 [medline]', '2021/11/27 05:18 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15384101.2021.2005275 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2021 Dec;20(24):2638-2651. doi: 10.1080/15384101.2021.2005275.

Crosslinked poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-acrylic acid-co-N-tert-butylacrylamide) was grown onto silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles by reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. The lysozyme binding property of the nanoparticles was investigated as a function of time, protein concentration, pH, ionic strength and temperature and their selectivity was assessed against other proteins. High-abundant proteins, like human serum albumin and gamma-globulins did not interfere with the binding of lysozyme even at elevated concentrations characteristic of proteinuria. A sample cleanup procedure for urine samples has been developed utilizing the thermocontrollable protein binding ability of the nanoparticles. Method validation was carried out according to current bioanalytical method validation guidelines. The method was highly selective, and the calibration was linear in the 25 to 1000 microg/mL concentration range, relevant in the diagnosis of monocytic and myelomonocytic leukemia. Intra- and inter-day precision values ranged from 2.24 to 8.20% and 1.08 to 5.04%, respectively. Intra-day accuracies were between 89.9 and 117.6%, while inter-day accuracies were in the 88.8 to 111.0% range. The average recovery was 94.1 +/- 8.1%.

Here, we design a chimeric receptor with a full-length natural Flt3-ligand recognition module that targets Flt3 tyrosine kinase, known as an adverse marker in AML. We demonstrate specific killing of Flt3-positive THP-1 cells by Flt3-CAR T cells and the lack of cytotoxicity towards Flt3-negative U937 cells. We prove that the inherent cytolytic capacity of T cells is essential for the killing. Finally, we confirm the authenticity of targeting by its competitive dose-dependent inhibition with a soluble Flt3-ligand. The developed system can be viewed as a non-immunogenic functional equivalent of scFv-mediated targeting. The robust in vitro antitumor effects of Flt3-CAR T cells, combined with their low off-target cytotoxicity, hold promise for AML treatment.",,"['Maiorova, Varvara', 'Mollaev, Murad D', 'Vikhreva, Polina', 'Kulakovskaya, Elena', 'Pershin, Dmitry', 'Chudakov, Dmitriy M', 'Kibardin, Alexey', 'Maschan, Michael A', 'Larin, Sergey']","['Maiorova V', 'Mollaev MD', 'Vikhreva P', 'Kulakovskaya E', 'Pershin D', 'Chudakov DM', 'Kibardin A', 'Maschan MA', 'Larin S']","['Dmitry Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, 117997 Moscow, Russia.', 'Center of Life Sciences, Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, 121205 Moscow, Russia.', 'Dmitry Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, 117997 Moscow, Russia.', 'Dmitry Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, 117997 Moscow, Russia.', 'Dmitry Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, 117997 Moscow, Russia.', 'Dmitry Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, 117997 Moscow, Russia.', 'Center of Life Sciences, Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, 121205 Moscow, Russia.', 'Institute of Translational Medicine, Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University, 117997 Moscow, Russia.', 'Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, 117997 Moscow, Russia.', 'Dmitry Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, 117997 Moscow, Russia.', 'Dmitry Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, 117997 Moscow, Russia.', 'Dmitry Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, 117997 Moscow, Russia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211025,Switzerland,Vaccines (Basel),Vaccines,101629355,,,2021/11/28 06:00,2021/11/28 06:01,['2021/11/27 01:26'],"['2021/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/01 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/27 01:26 [entrez]', '2021/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/28 06:01 [medline]']","['vaccines9111238 [pii]', '10.3390/vaccines9111238 [doi]']",epublish,Vaccines (Basel). 2021 Oct 25;9(11). pii: vaccines9111238. doi: 10.3390/vaccines9111238.,,"['N/A/Dmitry Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Hematology, Oncology and', ""Immunology Foundation 'Science - for Children' Benefit'""]",PMC8621097,['NOTNLM'],"['CAR T cell therapy', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'ligand-based targeting']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The long development timescales for such drugs are a major problem, but could be shortened by repurposing existing drugs. We therefore screened a small library of FDA-approved compounds for potential severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antivirals using a pseudovirus system that allows a sensitive read-out of infectivity. A group of structurally-related compounds, showing moderate inhibitory activity with IC50 values in the 2-5 muM range, were identified. Further studies demonstrated that these ""kite-shaped"" molecules were surprisingly specific for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 and that they acted early in the entry steps of the viral infectious cycle, but did not affect virus attachment to the cells. Moreover, the compounds were able to prevent infection in both kidney- and lung-derived human cell lines. The structural homology of the hits allowed the production of a well-defined pharmacophore that was found to be highly accurate in predicting the anti-viral activity of the compounds in the screen.

The unintegrated DNA forms, like those of DNAs entering cells by other means, are rapidly loaded with nucleosomes and heavily silenced by epigenetic histone modifications. This review summarizes our present understanding of the silencing machinery for the DNAs of the mouse leukemia viruses and human immunodeficiency virus type 1. We consider the potential impact of the silencing on virus replication, on the sensing of the virus by the innate immune system, and on the formation of latent proviruses.

This has been especially true in the field of virology, where the discovery of a ""contagium vivum fluidum"", or infectious fluid remaining after excluding bacteria by filtration, was initially ignored because it did not coincide with the established view of microorganisms. Subsequent studies on such infectious agents, eventually termed ""viruses"", were met with skepticism. However, after an abundance of proof accumulated, viruses were eventually acknowledged as defined microbiological entities. Next, the proposed role of viruses in oncogenesis in animals was disputed, as was the unique mechanism of genome replication by reverse transcription of RNA by the retroviruses. This same pattern of skepticism holds true for the prediction of the existence of retroviral ""antisense"" transcripts and genes. From the time of their discovery, it was thought that retroviruses encoded proteins on only one strand of proviral DNA. However, in 1988, it was predicted that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and other retroviruses, express an antisense protein encoded on the DNA strand opposite that encoding the known viral proteins. Confirmation came quickly with the characterization of the antisense protein, HBZ, of the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), and the finding that both the protein and its antisense mRNA transcript play key roles in viral replication and pathogenesis. However, acceptance of the existence, and potential importance, of a corresponding antisense transcript and protein (ASP) in HIV-1 infection and pathogenesis has lagged, despite gradually accumulating theoretical and experimental evidence. The most striking theoretical evidence is the finding that asp is highly conserved in group M viruses and correlates exclusively with subtypes, or clades, responsible for the AIDS pandemic. This review outlines the history of the major shifts in thought pertaining to the nature and characteristics of viruses, and in particular retroviruses, and details the development of the hypothesis that retroviral antisense transcripts and genes exist. We conclude that there is a need to accelerate studies on ASP, and its transcript(s), with the view that both may be important, and overlooked, targets in anti-HIV therapeutic and vaccine strategies.",,"['Miller, Roger H', 'Zimmer, Alexis', 'Moutot, Gilles', 'Mesnard, Jean-Michel', 'Chazal, Nathalie']","['Miller RH', 'Zimmer A', 'Moutot G', 'Mesnard JM', 'Chazal N']","['CyberGenomics LLC, Brookeville, MD 20833, USA.', ""DHVS-Departement d'Histoire des Sciences de la Vie et de la Sante, Faculte de Medecine, Universite de Strasbourg, 4 Rue Kirschleger, CEDEX, F-67085 Strasbourg, France."", ""Centre d'Etudes Politiques et Sociales (CEPEL), Departement de Sciences Humaines et Sociales, Universite de Montpellier, 34090 Montpellier, France."", 'Institut de Recherche en Infectiologie de Montpellier (IRIM), Universite de Montpellier, CNRS, 1919 Route de Mende, CEDEX 5, 34293 Montpellier, France.', 'Institut de Recherche en Infectiologie de Montpellier (IRIM), Universite de Montpellier, CNRS, 1919 Route de Mende, CEDEX 5, 34293 Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211104,Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,IM,,2021/11/28 06:00,2021/11/28 06:00,['2021/11/27 01:26'],"['2021/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/28 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/27 01:26 [entrez]', '2021/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/28 06:00 [medline]']","['v13112221 [pii]', '10.3390/v13112221 [doi]']",epublish,Viruses. 2021 Nov 4;13(11). pii: v13112221. doi: 10.3390/v13112221.,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-3344-5367', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1528-9607']",,PMC8622228,['NOTNLM'],"['ASP', 'HIV-1', 'HTLV-1', 'antisense protein', 'antisense transcript', 'oncogenesis', 'retrovirology', 'virology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It causes enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL), which is the most important neoplastic disease in cattle. Most BLV-infected cattle are asymptomatic, which potentiates extremely high shedding rates of the virus in many cattle populations. Approximately 30% of them show persistent lymphocytosis that has various clinical outcomes; only a small proportion of animals (less than 5%) exhibit signs of EBL. BLV causes major economic losses in the cattle industry, especially in dairy farms. Direct costs are due to a decrease in animal productivity and in cow longevity; indirect costs are caused by restrictions that are placed on the import of animals and animal products from infected areas. Most European regions have implemented an efficient eradication programme, yet BLV prevalence remains high worldwide. Control of the disease is not feasible because there is no effective vaccine against it.

The pharmacological and genetic inhibition of JNK effectively prevented 2'-HCA-induced apoptosis and activator protein-1 (AP-1)-DNA binding. In addition, 2'-HCA resulted in the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and depletion of intracellular glutathione (GSH) and protein thiols (PSH) in HL-60 cells.

We tested the cytotoxic activity of xestoquinone on a series of hematological cancer cell lines. The antileukemic effect of xestoquinone was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. This marine metabolite suppressed the proliferation of Molt-4, K562, and Sup-T1 cells with IC50 values of 2.95 +/- 0.21, 6.22 +/- 0.21, and 8.58 +/- 0.60 microM, respectively, as demonstrated by MTT assay.

The flow cytometric analysis indicated that the cytotoxic effect of xestoquinone was mediated through the induction of multiple apoptotic pathways in Molt-4 cells. The pretreatment of Molt-4 cells with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) diminished the disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and apoptosis, as well as retaining the expression of both Topo I and II. In the nude mice xenograft model, the administration of xestoquinone (1 mug/g) significantly attenuated tumor growth by 31.2% compared with the solvent control.

The aim of this study was to perform structural modification in Q by acetylation, thus, obtaining the quercetin pentaacetate (Q5) analogue, in order to investigate the biological potentials (antioxidant, antileishmania, anti-inflammatory and cytotoxicity activities) in cell cultures. Q5 was characterized by FTIR, (1)H and (13)C NMR spectra. The antioxidant potential was evaluated against the radical ABTS(*+). The anti-inflammatory potential was evaluated by measuring the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and the production of nitric oxide (NO) in peritoneal macrophages from BALB/c mice. Cytotoxicity tests were performed using the AlamarBlue method in cancer cells HepG2 (human hepatocarcinoma), HL-60 (promyelocytic leukemia) and MCR-5 (healthy human lung fibroblasts) as well as the MTT method for C6 cell cultures (rat glioma). Q and Q5 showed antioxidant activity of 29% and 18%, respectively, which is justified by the replacement of hydroxyls by acetyl groups. Q and Q5 showed concentration-dependent reductions in NO and TNF production (p < 0.05); Q and Q5 showed higher activity at concentrations > 40microM when compared to dexamethasone (20 microM). For the HL-60 lineage, Q5 demonstrated selectivity, inducing death in cancer cells, when compared to the healthy cell line MRC-5 (IC50 > 80 microM). Finally, the cytotoxic superiority of Q5 was verified (IC50 = 11 microM), which, at 50 microM for 24 h, induced changes in the morphology of C6 glioma cells characterized by a round body shape (not yet reported in the literature).

The clonal process leads to excessive red cells production, platelets production, and bone marrow fibrosis. According to the phenotype, MPN can be classified as polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). MPN patients have shortened survival due to the increased risk of thrombosis, hemorrhages, and transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Prognosis is variable, with a shorter life expectancy in myelofibrosis. Currently, drug therapy can reduce symptoms, splenomegaly, and risk of thrombosis. Still, some patients can be resistant or intolerant to the treatment. At the same time, allogeneic stem cell transplant (ASCT) is the only treatment modality with the potential to cure the disease. Nevertheless, the ASCT is reserved for high-risk leukemic progression patients due to the risk of treatment-related death and comorbidity. Therefore, there is a need for new drugs that can eradicate clonal hematopoiesis and prevent progression to more aggressive myeloid neoplasms.

Its diagnosis is based on well-defined major and minor criteria, including the pathognomonic dense infiltrate of MCs detected in bone marrow (BM), elevated serum tryptase level, abnormal MCs CD25 expression, and the identification of KIT D816V mutation. The World Health Organization (WHO) classification subdivides mastocytosis into a cutaneous form (CM) and five systemic variants (SM), namely indolent/smoldering (ISM/SSM) and advanced SM (AdvSM) including aggressive SM (ASM), SM associated to hematological neoplasms (SM-AHN), and mast cell leukemia (MCL). More than 80% of patients with SM carry a somatic point mutation of KIT at codon 816, which may be targeted by kinase inhibitors.

COMPARE and cluster analyses of transcriptomic data of the NCI cell line panel indicated that genes with different cellular functions regulated the sensitivity or resistance of cancer cells to crizotinib. Transcription factor binding motif analyses in gene promoters divulged two transcription factors possibly regulating the expression of these genes, i.e., RXRA and GATA1, which are important for leukemia and erythroid development, respectively. COMPARE analyses also implied that cell lines of various cancer types displayed varying degrees of sensitivity to crizotinib. Unexpectedly, leukemia but not lung cancer cells were the most sensitive cells among the different types of NCI cancer cell lines. Re-examining this result in another panel of cell lines indeed revealed that crizotinib exhibited potent cytotoxicity towards acute myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma cells. P-glycoprotein-overexpressing CEM/ADR5000 leukemia cells were cross-resistant to crizotinib. NCI-H929 multiple myeloma cells were the most sensitive cells. Hence, we evaluated the mode of action of crizotinib on these cells. Although crizotinib is a TKI, it showed highest correlation rates with DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors and tubulin inhibitors. The altered gene expression profiles after crizotinib treatment predicted several networks, where TOP2A and genes related to cell cycle were downregulated. Cell cycle analyses showed that cells incubated with crizotinib for 24 h accumulated in the G2M phase. Crizotinib also increased the number of p-H3(Ser10)-positive NCI-H929 cells illustrating crizotinib's ability to prevent mitotic exit. However, cells accumulated in the sub-G0G1 fraction with longer incubation periods, indicating apoptosis induction. Additionally, crizotinib disassembled the tubulin network of U2OS cells expressing an alpha-tubulin-GFP fusion protein, preventing migration of cancer cells. This result was verified by in vitro tubulin polymerization assays. In silico molecular docking also revealed a strong binding affinity of crizotinib to the colchicine and Vinca alkaloid binding sites. Taken together, these results demonstrate that crizotinib destabilized microtubules. Additionally, the decatenation assay showed that crizotinib partwise inhibited the catalytic activity of DNA topoisomerase II. In conclusion, crizotinib exerted kinase-independent cytotoxic effects through the dual inhibition of tubulin polymerization and topoisomerase II and might be used to treat not only NSCLC but also multiple myeloma.",,"['Boulos, Joelle C', 'Saeed, Mohamed E M', 'Chatterjee, Manik', 'Bulbul, Yagmur', 'Crudo, Francesco', 'Marko, Doris', 'Munder, Markus', 'Klauck, Sabine M', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Boulos JC', 'Saeed MEM', 'Chatterjee M', 'Bulbul Y', 'Crudo F', 'Marko D', 'Munder M', 'Klauck SM', 'Efferth T']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences, Johannes Gutenberg University, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128 Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences, Johannes Gutenberg University, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128 Mainz, Germany.', 'Translational Oncology, Comprehensive Cancer Center Mainfranken, University Hospital Wurzburg, 97078 Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Third Department of Medicine (Hematology, Oncology, and Pneumology), University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University, 55131 Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Food Chemistry and Toxicology, University of Vienna, Wahringer Str. 38, 1090 Wien, Austria.', 'Department of Food Chemistry and Toxicology, University of Vienna, Wahringer Str. 38, 1090 Wien, Austria.', 'Third Department of Medicine (Hematology, Oncology, and Pneumology), University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University, 55131 Mainz, Germany.', 'Division of Cancer Genome Research, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences, Johannes Gutenberg University, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128 Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211105,Switzerland,Pharmaceuticals (Basel),"Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",101238453,,,2021/11/28 06:00,2021/11/28 06:01,['2021/11/27 01:20'],"['2021/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/28 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/27 01:20 [entrez]', '2021/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/28 06:01 [medline]']","['ph14111126 [pii]', '10.3390/ph14111126 [doi]']",epublish,Pharmaceuticals (Basel). 2021 Nov 5;14(11). pii: ph14111126. doi: 10.3390/ph14111126.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-4876-8057', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6568-2944', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2637-1681']",,PMC8617756,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'drug repurposing', 'multiple myeloma', 'network pharmacology', 'transcriptomics', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most active compounds, 1 and 2, were selected for further investigation of their effects on cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and ROS generation in U937 human leukemia cancer cells. Interestingly, it was found that compounds 1 and 2 induced antiproliferative effects in U937 cells through different mechanisms. Compound 1 caused cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and subsequent cell death in a dose- and time-dependent manner. However, 2-mediated antiproliferation of U937 cells triggered ROS-mediated mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis.

Herein, we report [(WR)5C]-GdNPs as an efficient siRNA delivery system. The peptide-based gadolinium nanoparticles (50 microM) did not exhibit significant cytotoxicity (~93% cell viability at 50 microM) in human leukemia T lymphoblast cells (CCRF-CEM) and triple-negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) after 48 h. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis indicated that the cellular uptakes of Alexa-488-labeled siRNA were found to be enhanced by more than 10 folds in the presence of [(WR)5C]-GdNPs compared with siRNA alone in CCRF-CEM and MDA-MB-231 cells after 6 h of incubation at 37 degrees C. The gene silencing efficacy of the nanoparticles was determined via the western blot technique using an over-expressed gene, STAT-3 protein, in MDA-MB-231 cells. The results showed ~62% reduction of STAT-3 was observed in MDA-MB-231 with [(WR)5C]-GdNPs at N/P 40. The integrity of the cellular membrane of CCRF-CEM cells was found to be intact when incubated with [(WR)5C]-Gd nanoparticles (50 microM) for 2 h.

The European Commission, in 2017, declared Italy to be an officially EBL-free country by means of Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2017/1910, despite the presence of some infection clusters located in four regions of Central-Southern Italy. As a consequence of persisting infection, the Italian Ministry of Health established specific eradication measures in these areas. In collaboration with the National Reference Laboratory for the Study of Ruminant Retroviral Infectious Diseases, the Ministry of Health employed data from the veterinary information system digital platform, combined with a gap analysis exercise, to monitor and verify the progress of control activities within infection clusters during the period 2018-2021. Our aim was to identify any remaining gaps and, consequently, specific measures to eliminate the factors favouring EBL persistence, on the basis of a description and analysis of the current data regarding epidemiological trends in Italian clusters. The final goal is to achieve the implementation of a less expensive surveillance plan in these areas, as well. The results of comprehensive analysis showed that the eradication activities had been effectively implemented by official local veterinary services, resulting in a drastic reduction of EBL outbreaks in most territories during the period 2018-2021.",,"['Righi, Cecilia', 'Iscaro, Carmen', 'Petrini, Stefano', 'Lomolino, Roberto', 'Feliziani, Francesco']","['Righi C', 'Iscaro C', 'Petrini S', 'Lomolino R', 'Feliziani F']","['Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale Umbria-Marche ""Togo Rosati"", Via Gaetano Salvemini, 1, 06126 Perugia, Italy.', 'Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale Umbria-Marche ""Togo Rosati"", Via Gaetano Salvemini, 1, 06126 Perugia, Italy.', 'Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale Umbria-Marche ""Togo Rosati"", Via Gaetano Salvemini, 1, 06126 Perugia, Italy.', 'Ministero della Salute, Viale Giorgio Ribotta, 5, 00144 Roma, Italy.', 'Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale Umbria-Marche ""Togo Rosati"", Via Gaetano Salvemini, 1, 06126 Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211112,Switzerland,Pathogens,"Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",101596317,,,2021/11/28 06:00,2021/11/28 06:01,['2021/11/27 01:19'],"['2021/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/03 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/27 01:19 [entrez]', '2021/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/28 06:01 [medline]']","['pathogens10111475 [pii]', '10.3390/pathogens10111475 [doi]']",epublish,Pathogens. 2021 Nov 12;10(11). pii: pathogens10111475. doi: 10.3390/pathogens10111475.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-6641-3762', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8689-832X']","['Not applicable/Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale Umbria-Marche ""Togo Rosati""']",PMC8621218,['NOTNLM'],"['Italy', 'cluster', 'enzootic bovine leukosis', 'eradication plan', 'gap analysis', 'surveillance plan']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A deep knowledge of the extracellular vesicle (EV) system allows for a better understanding of the whole series of phenomena responsible for cell proliferation and death. To this purpose, here, a thorough immuno-phenotypic characterization of B-cell EV membranes is presented. Furthermore, the cellular membrane of B lymphocytes, Burkitt lymphoma, and human myeloid leukemic cells were characterized through cytofluorimetry assays and fluorescent microscopy analysis. Through cytotoxicity and internalization tests, the tropism of B lymphocyte-derived EVs was investigated toward the parental cell line and two different cancer cell lines. In this study, an innate capability of passive targeting of the native EVs was distinguished from the active targeting capability of monoclonal antibody-engineered EVs, able to selectively drive the vesicles, enhancing their internalization into the target cancer cells. In particular, the specific targeting ability of anti-CD20 engineered EVs towards Daudi cells, highly expressing CD20 marker on their cell membrane, was proved, while almost no internalization events were observed in HL60 cells, since they did not express an appreciable amount of the CD20 marker on their plasma membranes.",,"['Limongi, Tania', 'Susa, Francesca', 'Dumontel, Bianca', 'Racca, Luisa', 'Perrone Donnorso, Michela', 'Debellis, Doriana', 'Cauda, Valentina']","['Limongi T', 'Susa F', 'Dumontel B', 'Racca L', 'Perrone Donnorso M', 'Debellis D', 'Cauda V']","['Department of Applied Science and Technology, Politecnico di Torino, Corso Duca degli Abruzzi 24, 10129 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Applied Science and Technology, Politecnico di Torino, Corso Duca degli Abruzzi 24, 10129 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Applied Science and Technology, Politecnico di Torino, Corso Duca degli Abruzzi 24, 10129 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Applied Science and Technology, Politecnico di Torino, Corso Duca degli Abruzzi 24, 10129 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Neuroscience, Rehabilitation, Ophthalmology, Genetics, Maternal and Child Health, University of Genova, 16132 Genova, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatrics, IRCCS Istituto Giannina Gaslini, University of Genova, 16128 Genova, Italy.', 'Electron Microscopy Laboratory, Center for Convergent Technologies, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), Via Morego 30, 16163 Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Applied Science and Technology, Politecnico di Torino, Corso Duca degli Abruzzi 24, 10129 Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211118,Switzerland,Membranes (Basel),Membranes,101577807,,,2021/11/28 06:00,2021/11/28 06:01,['2021/11/27 01:17'],"['2021/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/12 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/27 01:17 [entrez]', '2021/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/28 06:01 [medline]']","['membranes11110886 [pii]', '10.3390/membranes11110886 [doi]']",epublish,Membranes (Basel). 2021 Nov 18;11(11). pii: membranes11110886. doi: 10.3390/membranes11110886.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-5510-5561', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2382-1533']",['678151/ERC_/European Research Council/International'],PMC8617986,['NOTNLM'],"['B lymphocytes', 'Burkitt lymphoma', 'cell targeting', 'cell tropism', 'cellular uptake', 'extracellular vesicles', 'human myeloid leukemia', 'surface labeling']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This results in a vaccine comprising a broad array of endogenous tumor antigens combined with a mature dendritic cell (mDC) costimulatory profile, functioning as a local inflammatory adjuvant when injected into an allogeneic recipient. Intradermal DCP-001 vaccination has been shown to be safe and feasible as a post-remission therapy in acute myeloid leukemia. In the current study, the mode of action of DCP-001 was further characterized by static and dynamic analysis of the interaction between labelled DCP-001 and host antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Direct cell-cell interactions and uptake of DCP-001 cellular content by APCs were shown to depend on DCP-001 cell surface expression of calreticulin and phosphatidylserine, while blockade of CD47 enhanced the process. Injection of DCP-001 in an ex vivo human skin model led to its uptake by activated skin-emigrating DCs. These data suggest that, following intradermal DCP-001 vaccination, local and recruited host APCs capture tumor-associated antigens from the vaccine, become activated and migrate to the draining lymph nodes to subsequently (re)activate tumor-reactive T-cells.

Indeed, we detected that various aging/senescence-induced genes (ASIGs) were upregulated in malignant diseases compared to healthy control samples. To elucidate the importance of ASIGs during cell development, pseudotime analyses were performed, which revealed a late enrichment of distinct cancer-specific ASIG signatures. Notably, we were able to demonstrate that all cancer entities analyzed in this study comprised cell populations expressing ASIGs. While only minor correlations were detected between ASIGs and transcriptome-wide changes in PDAC, a high proportion of ASIGs was induced in CML, CRC, HCC, and LC samples.

Although patients are usually treated effectively by chemotherapy, a high rate of relapsed or refractory disease poses a major hurdle in its treatment. Recently, several studies have proposed implications of protein glycosylation in the pathobiology of AML including chemoresistance. Accordingly, associations have been found between specific glycan epitopes and the outcome of the disease. To advance this poorly studied field, we performed an exploratory glycomics study characterizing 21 widely used AML cell lines. Exploiting the benefits of porous graphitized carbon chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (PGC nano-LC-MS(2)), we qualitatively and quantitatively profiled N- and O-linked glycans.

Hence we hypothesize that micro RNA (miR) 155-5p regulates BTLA expression in CLL. In line with earlier data, expression of BTLA mRNA and miR-155-5p is elevated in CLL (p = 0.034 and p = 0.0006, respectively) as well as in MEC-1 cell line (p = 0.009 and 0.016, respectively). Inhibition of miR-155-5p partially restored BTLA protein expression in CLL patients (p = 0.01) and in MEC-1 cell lines (p = 0.058). Additionally, we aimed to evaluate the significance of BTLA deficiency in CLL cells on proliferation and IL-4 production of B cells. We found that secretion of IL-4 is not dependent on BTLA expression, since fractions of BTLA positive and BTLA negative B cells expressing intracellular IL-4 were similar in CLL patients and controls. We demonstrated that in controls the fraction of proliferating cells is lower in BTLA positive than in BTLA negative B cells (p = 0.059), which was not observed in CLL. However, the frequency of BTLA positive Ki67+ B cells in CLL was higher compared to corresponding cells from controls (p = 0.055) while there were no differences between the examined groups regarding frequency of BTLA negative Ki67+ B cells.

The pattern of downstream activation by this constitutively activated receptor tyrosine kinase is influenced by the localization of FLT3-ITD depending on its glycosylation status. Different pharmacological approaches can affect FLT3-ITD-driven oncogenic pathways by the modulation of FLT3-ITD localization. AIMS: The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of N-glycosylation inhibitors (tunicamycin or 2-deoxy-D-glucose) or the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid (VPA) on FLT3-ITD localization and downstream activity. We sought to determine the potential differences between the distinct FLT3-ITD variants, particularly concerning their susceptibility towards combined treatment by addressing either N-glycosylation and the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) by 17-AAG, or by targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway by rapamycin after treatment with VPA. METHODS: Murine Ba/F3 leukemia cell lines were stably transfected with distinct FLT3-ITD variants resulting in IL3-independent growth. These Ba/F3 FLT3-ITD cell lines or FLT3-ITD-expressing human MOLM13 cells were exposed to tunicamycin, 2-deoxy-D-glucose or VPA, and 17-AAG or rapamycin, and characterized in terms of downstream signaling by immunoblotting. FLT3 surface expression, apoptosis, and metabolic activity were analyzed by flow cytometry or an MTS assay. Proteome analysis by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was performed to assess differential protein expression. RESULTS: The susceptibility of FLT3-ITD-expressing cells to 17-AAG after pre-treatment with tunicamycin or 2-deoxy-D-glucose was demonstrated. Importantly, in Ba/F3 cells that were stably expressing distinct FLT3-ITD variants that were located either in the juxtamembrane domain (JMD) or in the tyrosine kinase 1 domain (TKD1), response to the sequential treatments with tunicamycin and 17-AAG varied between individual FLT3-ITD motifs without dependence on the localization of the ITD. In all of the FLT3-ITD cell lines that were investigated, incubation with tunicamycin was accompanied by intracellular retention of FLT3-ITD due to the inhibition of glycosylation. In contrast, treatment of Ba/F3-FLT3-ITD cells with VPA was associated with a significant increase of FLT3-ITD surface expression depending on FLT3 protein synthesis. The allocation of FLT3 to different cellular compartments that was induced by tunicamycin, 2-deoxy-D-glucose, or VPA resulted in the activation of distinct downstream signaling pathways. Whole proteome analyses of Ba/F3 FLT3-ITD cells revealed up-regulation of the relevant chaperone proteins (e.g., calreticulin, calnexin, HSP90beta1) that are directly involved in the stabilization of FLT3-ITD or in its retention in the ER compartment. CONCLUSION: The allocation of FLT3-ITD to different cellular compartments and targeting distinct downstream signaling pathways by combined treatment with N-glycosylation and HSP90 inhibitors or VPA and rapamycin might represent new therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance towards tyrosine kinase inhibitors in FLT3-ITD-positive AML. The treatment approaches addressing N-glycosylation of FLT3-ITD appear to depend on patient-specific FLT3-ITD sequences, potentially affecting the efficacy of such pharmacological strategies.",,"['Fleischmann, Maximilian', 'Fischer, Mike', 'Schnetzke, Ulf', 'Fortner, Colin', 'Kirkpatrick, Joanna', 'Heidel, Florian H', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Scholl, Sebastian']","['Fleischmann M', 'Fischer M', 'Schnetzke U', 'Fortner C', 'Kirkpatrick J', 'Heidel FH', 'Hochhaus A', 'Scholl S']","['Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Abteilung Hamatologie und Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, 07747 Jena, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Abteilung Hamatologie und Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, 07747 Jena, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Abteilung Hamatologie und Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, 07747 Jena, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Abteilung Hamatologie und Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, 07747 Jena, Germany.', 'Department for Proteomic Analysis, The Francis Crick Institute, London NW1 1AT, UK.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Abteilung Hamatologie und Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, 07747 Jena, Germany.', 'Leibniz Institute on Aging-Fritz-Lipmann-Institute, 07745 Jena, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin C, Universitatsmedizin Greifswald, 17489 Greifswald, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Abteilung Hamatologie und Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, 07747 Jena, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Abteilung Hamatologie und Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, 07747 Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20211103,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,IM,,2021/11/28 06:00,2021/12/24 06:00,['2021/11/27 01:14'],"['2021/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/28 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/27 01:14 [entrez]', '2021/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/24 06:00 [medline]']","['cells10112992 [pii]', '10.3390/cells10112992 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2021 Nov 3;10(11). pii: cells10112992. doi: 10.3390/cells10112992.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-2438-1955'],['CSP07/Interdisziplinares Zentrum fur klinische Forschung Jena'],PMC8616352,['NOTNLM'],"['*17-AAG', '*AML', '*FLT3-ITD', '*HSP90', '*TKI', '*VPA', '*rapamycin', '*resistance', '*tunicamycin']",20211223,"['0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', '9G2MP84A8W (Deoxyglucose)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Deoxyglucose/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', '*Gene Duplication', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mutant Proteins/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Signal Transduction', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology', 'Tunicamycin/pharmacology', 'Valproic Acid/pharmacology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,

More recently, inhibition of proteasome activity with the PI bortezomib has been clinically evaluated as a novel treatment strategy in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, we lack a marker that could identify ALL patients responding to PI-based therapy. By using a set of activity-based proteasome probes in conjunction with cytotoxicity assays, we show that B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL), in contrast to T-ALL, demonstrates an increased activity of immunoproteasome over constitutive proteasome, which correlates with high ex vivo sensitivity to the PIs bortezomib and ixazomib. The novel selective PI LU015i-targeting immunoproteasome beta5i induces cytotoxicity in BCP-ALL containing high beta5i activity, confirming immunoproteasome activity as a novel therapeutic target in BCP-ALL. At the same time, cotreatment with beta2-selective proteasome inhibitors can sensitize T-ALL to currently available PIs, as well as to beta5i selective PI. In addition, levels of total and spliced forms of XBP1 differ between BCP-ALL and T-ALL, and only in BCP-ALL does high-spliced XBP1 correlate with sensitivity to bortezomib.

Understanding resistance mechanisms against currently available drugs helps to recognize the therapeutic obstacles. Various mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapy or targeted inhibitors have been described for AML cells, including a role for the bone marrow niche in both the initiation and persistence of the disease, and in drug resistance of the leukemic stem cell (LSC) population. The BM niche supports LSC survival through direct and indirect interactions among the stromal cells, hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, and leukemic cells. Additionally, the BM niche mediates changes in metabolic and signal pathway activation due to the acquisition of new mutations or selection and expansion of a minor clone.

SUMO modulates protein function through covalent conjugation to lysine residues in a large number of proteins. Once covalently conjugated to a protein, SUMO often regulates that protein's function by recruiting other cellular proteins. Recruitment frequently involves a non-covalent interaction between SUMO and a SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) in the interacting protein. SIMs generally consist of a four-residue-long hydrophobic stretch of amino acids with aliphatic non-polar side chains flanked on one side by negatively charged amino acid residues. The SIM assumes an extended beta-strand-like conformation and binds to a conserved hydrophobic groove in SUMO. In addition to hydrophobic interactions between the SIM non-polar core and hydrophobic residues in the groove, the negatively charged residues in the SIM make favorable electrostatic contacts with positively charged residues in and around the groove. The SIM/SUMO interaction can be regulated by the phosphorylation of residues adjacent to the SIM hydrophobic core, which provide additional negative charges for favorable electrostatic interaction with SUMO. The SUMO interactome consists of hundreds or perhaps thousands of SIM-containing proteins, but we do not fully understand how each SUMOylated protein selects the set of SIM-containing proteins appropriate to its function. SIM/SUMO interactions have critical functions in a large number of essential cellular processes including the formation of membraneless organelles by liquid-liquid phase separation, epigenetic regulation of transcription through histone modification, DNA repair, and a variety of host-pathogen interactions.",,"['Yau, Tak-Yu', 'Sander, William', 'Eidson, Christian', 'Courey, Albert J']","['Yau TY', 'Sander W', 'Eidson C', 'Courey AJ']","['Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20211021,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,IM,,2021/11/28 06:00,2021/12/28 06:00,['2021/11/27 01:14'],"['2021/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/14 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/27 01:14 [entrez]', '2021/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/28 06:00 [medline]']","['cells10112825 [pii]', '10.3390/cells10112825 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2021 Oct 21;10(11). pii: cells10112825. doi: 10.3390/cells10112825.,,['R01 GM063596/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],PMC8616421,['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA repair', '*SUMO', '*SUMO interacting motif', '*histones', '*host-pathogen interactions', '*phase separation', '*post-translational protein modification']",20211227,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)']",,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'DNA Repair', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Nuclear Bodies/metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/*chemistry/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,

Recent analyses have confirmed earlier molecular cytogenetic studies on chromosome positioning within interphase nuclei and provided new information about the topologically associated domains (TADs). Examining the nuances of how genomes are organized within interphase nuclei will provide information fundamental to understanding gene regulation and expression in health and disease. Indeed, the radial spatial positioning of individual gene loci within nuclei has been associated with up- and down-regulation of specific genes, and disruption of normal genome organization within nuclei will result in compromised cellular health. In cancer cells, where reorganization of the nuclear architecture may occur in the presence of chromosomal rearrangements such as translocations, inversions, or deletions, gene repositioning can change their expression. To date, very few studies have focused on radial gene positioning and the correlation to gene expression in cancers. Further investigations would improve our understanding of the biological mechanisms at the basis of cancer and, in particular, in leukemia initiation and progression, especially in those cases where the molecular consequences of chromosomal rearrangements are still unclear. In this review, we summarize the main milestones in the field of genome organization in the nucleus and the alterations to this organization that can lead to cancer diseases.",,"['Federico, Concetta', 'Bruno, Francesca', 'Ragusa, Denise', 'Clements, Craig S', 'Brancato, Desiree', 'Henry, Marianne P', 'Bridger, Joanna M', 'Tosi, Sabrina', 'Saccone, Salvatore']","['Federico C', 'Bruno F', 'Ragusa D', 'Clements CS', 'Brancato D', 'Henry MP', 'Bridger JM', 'Tosi S', 'Saccone S']","['Department of Biological, Geological and Environmental Sciences, University of Catania, Via Androne 81, 95124 Catania, Italy.', 'Department of Biological, Geological and Environmental Sciences, University of Catania, Via Androne 81, 95124 Catania, Italy.', 'Leukaemia and Chromosome Research, Centre for Genome Engineering and Maintenance, College of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences, Brunel University London, Kingstone Lane, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, UK.', 'Laboratory of Nuclear and Genomic Health, Centre for Genome Engineering and Maintenance, College of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences, Brunel University London, Kingstone Lane, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, UK.', 'Department of Biological, Geological and Environmental Sciences, University of Catania, Via Androne 81, 95124 Catania, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Nuclear and Genomic Health, Centre for Genome Engineering and Maintenance, College of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences, Brunel University London, Kingstone Lane, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, UK.', 'Laboratory of Nuclear and Genomic Health, Centre for Genome Engineering and Maintenance, College of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences, Brunel University London, Kingstone Lane, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, UK.', 'Leukaemia and Chromosome Research, Centre for Genome Engineering and Maintenance, College of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences, Brunel University London, Kingstone Lane, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, UK.', 'Department of Biological, Geological and Environmental Sciences, University of Catania, Via Androne 81, 95124 Catania, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211122,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,2021/11/28 06:00,2021/11/28 06:01,['2021/11/27 01:14'],"['2021/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/09 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/27 01:14 [entrez]', '2021/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/28 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13225860 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13225860 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Nov 22;13(22). pii: cancers13225860. doi: 10.3390/cancers13225860.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-0160-9040', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0303-8683', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0036-0191', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7568-5823']","['UPB: 22722132159/Research Plan PIACERI L.3 Starting Grant from Department of', 'Biological, Geological, and Envi-ronmental Sciences, University of Catania to', 'C.F.']",PMC8616464,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'chromosomal rearrangements', 'genome organization', 'replication timing', 'topologically associated domains']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, eradication of every last LSC is critical for a patient's long-term cure. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disorder that arises from multipotent hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have dramatically improved long-term outcomes and quality of life for patients with CML in the chronic phase. Point mutations of the kinase domain of BCR-ABL1 lead to TKI resistance through a reduction in drug binding, and as a result, several new generations of TKIs have been introduced to the clinic. Some patients develop TKI resistance without known mutations, however, and the presence of LSCs is believed to be at least partially associated with resistance development and CML relapse. We previously proposed targeting quiescent LSCs as a therapeutic approach to CML, and a number of potential strategies for targeting insensitive LSCs have been presented over the last decade. The identification of specific markers distinguishing CML-LSCs from healthy HSCs, and the potential contributions of the bone marrow microenvironment to CML pathogenesis, have also been explored. Nonetheless, 25% of CML patients are still expected to switch TKIs at least once, and various TKI discontinuation studies have shown a wide range in the incidence of molecular relapse (from 30% to 60%). In this review, we revisit the current knowledge regarding the role(s) of LSCs in CML leukemogenesis and response to pharmacological treatment and explore how durable treatment-free remission may be achieved and maintained after discontinuing TKI treatment.",,"['Ito, Kyoko', 'Ito, Keisuke']","['Ito K', 'Ito K']","['Ruth L. and David S.

The most common of them is autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) with a frequency of 7-10% of cases. Pathogenesis is multifactorial involving humoral, cellular, and innate immunity. CLL B-cells have damaged apoptosis, produce less immunoglobulins, and could be responsible for antigen presentation and releasing inflammatory cytokines. CLL B-cells can act similar to antigen-presenting cells activating self-reactive T helper cells and may induce T-cell subsets imbalance, favoring autoreactive B-cells which produce anti-red blood cells autoantibodies. Treatment is individualized and it depends on the presence and severity of clinical symptoms, disease status, and comorbidities. Corticosteroids are the standardized first-line treatment; second-line treatment comprises rituximab. Patients not responding to corticosteroids and rituximab should be treated with CLL-specific drugs as per current guidelines according to age and comorbidities. New targeted drugs (BTK inhibitors and anti BCL2) are recently used after or together with steroids to manage AIHA.

Yet, lifelong exposure to low doses of pesticides, and more particularly their cocktail effect, although poorly known, could also participate to the development of such hematological diseases as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in elderly patients. (2) Methods: In this study, a cocktail of seven pesticides frequently present in water and food (maneb, mancozeb, iprodione, imazalil, chlorpyrifos ethyl, diazinon and dimethoate), as determined by the European Food Safety Authority, were selected. Their in vitro effects at low-doses on primary BM-MSCs from healthy volunteers were examined. (3) Results: Exposure of normal BM-MSCs to pesticides for 21 days inhibited cell proliferation and promoted DNA damage and senescence. Concomitantly, these cells presented a decrease in aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2: mRNA, protein and enzymatic activity) and an increase in acetaldehyde levels. Pharmacological inhibition of ALDH2 with disulfiram recapitulated the alterations induced by exposure to low doses of pesticides. Moreover, BM-MSCs capacity to support primitive hematopoiesis was significantly altered. Similar biological abnormalities were found in primary BM-MSCs derived from MDS patients. (4) Conclusions: these results suggest that ALDH2 could participate in the pathophysiology of MDS in elderly people long exposed to low doses of pesticides.",,"['Foucault, Amelie', 'Ravalet, Noemie', 'Besombes, Joevin', 'Picou, Frederic', 'Gallay, Nathalie', 'Babin, Laetitia', 'Bourgeais, Jerome', 'Hamard, Sophie', 'Domenech, Jorge', 'Loyer, Pascal', 'Vallet, Nicolas', 'Lejeune, Julien', 'Gyan, Emmanuel', 'Bene, Marie C', 'Vallette, Francois', 'Olivier, Christophe', 'Herault, Olivier']","['Foucault A', 'Ravalet N', 'Besombes J', 'Picou F', 'Gallay N', 'Babin L', 'Bourgeais J', 'Hamard S', 'Domenech J', 'Loyer P', 'Vallet N', 'Lejeune J', 'Gyan E', 'Bene MC', 'Vallette F', 'Olivier C', 'Herault O']","['Department of Biological Hematology, Tours University Hospital, 37000 Tours, France.', 'CNRS ERL 7001 LNOx, EA 7501, Tours University, 37000 Tours, France.', 'Department of Biological Hematology, Tours University Hospital, 37000 Tours, France.', 'CNRS ERL 7001 LNOx, EA 7501, Tours University, 37000 Tours, France.', 'Department of Biological Hematology, Tours University Hospital, 37000 Tours, France.', 'CNRS ERL 7001 LNOx, EA 7501, Tours University, 37000 Tours, France.', 'Department of Biological Hematology, Tours University Hospital, 37000 Tours, France.', 'CNRS ERL 7001 LNOx, EA 7501, Tours University, 37000 Tours, France.', 'Department of Biological Hematology, Tours University Hospital, 37000 Tours, France.', 'CNRS ERL 7001 LNOx, EA 7501, Tours University, 37000 Tours, France.', 'CNRS ERL 7001 LNOx, EA 7501, Tours University, 37000 Tours, France.', 'Department of Biological Hematology, Tours University Hospital, 37000 Tours, France.', 'CNRS ERL 7001 LNOx, EA 7501, Tours University, 37000 Tours, France.', 'CNRS ERL 7001 LNOx, EA 7501, Tours University, 37000 Tours, France.', 'Department of Biological Hematology, Tours University Hospital, 37000 Tours, France.', 'CNRS ERL 7001 LNOx, EA 7501, Tours University, 37000 Tours, France.', 'INSERM U1241, NuMeCan Institute, 35000 Rennes, France.', 'CNRS GDR 3697 Micronit ""Microenvironment of Tumor Niches"", 37000 Tours, France.', 'Canceropole Grand Ouest (CGO), NET ""Niches and Epigenetics of Tumors"" Network, 44000 Nantes, France.', 'Department of Hematology & Cell Therapy, Tours University Hospital, 37000 Tours, France.', 'CNRS ERL 7001 LNOx, EA 7501, Tours University, 37000 Tours, France.', 'Department of Hematology & Cell Therapy, Tours University Hospital, 37000 Tours, France.', 'CNRS ERL 7001 LNOx, EA 7501, Tours University, 37000 Tours, France.', 'Department of Hematology & Cell Therapy, Tours University Hospital, 37000 Tours, France.', 'Department of Biological Hematology & CRCINA, Nantes University Hospital, 44000 Nantes, France.', 'Federation Hospitalo-Universitaire, ""Grand Ouest Against Leukemia"" (FHU GOAL), 49000 Angers, France.', 'CNRS GDR 3697 Micronit ""Microenvironment of Tumor Niches"", 37000 Tours, France.', 'Canceropole Grand Ouest (CGO), NET ""Niches and Epigenetics of Tumors"" Network, 44000 Nantes, France.', 'INSERM UMR 1232 CRCINA, 44000 Nantes, France.', 'INSERM UMR 1232 CRCINA, 44000 Nantes, France.', 'Faculty of Pharmaceutical and Biological Sciences, Nantes University, 44000 Nantes, France.', 'Department of Biological Hematology, Tours University Hospital, 37000 Tours, France.', 'CNRS ERL 7001 LNOx, EA 7501, Tours University, 37000 Tours, France.', 'CNRS GDR 3697 Micronit ""Microenvironment of Tumor Niches"", 37000 Tours, France.', 'Canceropole Grand Ouest (CGO), NET ""Niches and Epigenetics of Tumors"" Network, 44000 Nantes, France.', 'Federation Hospitalo-Universitaire, ""Grand Ouest Against Leukemia"" (FHU GOAL), 49000 Angers, France.', 'OPALE Carnot Institute, The Organization for Partnerships in Leukemia, Hopital Saint-Louis, 75010 Paris, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211114,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,2021/11/28 06:00,2021/11/28 06:01,['2021/11/27 01:13'],"['2021/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/29 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/27 01:13 [entrez]', '2021/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/28 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13225699 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13225699 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Nov 14;13(22). pii: cancers13225699. doi: 10.3390/cancers13225699.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-5779-337X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2066-2146', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4236-4780', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5656-2673', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9568-3358', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9398-3215']",['2016-PENICA project/French Canceropole Grand-Ouest'],PMC8616329,['NOTNLM'],"['ALDH2', 'hematopoiesis', 'mesenchymal stem/stromal cells', 'myelodysplastic syndrome', 'pesticides']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, comparative outcome analyses between patients with and without trisomy 8 undergoing allogeneic HSCT have not been performed so far. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical features, outcomes, and measurable residual disease (MRD) of 659 AML (12%, n = 81, with a trisomy 8) patients subjected to allogeneic HSCT as a consolidation therapy. RESULTS: The presence of a trisomy 8 associated with a trend for higher age at diagnosis, AML of secondary origin, lower white blood cell counts at diagnosis, worse ELN2017 genetic risk, wild-type NPM1, and mutated IDH1/2 and JAK2. Outcomes after allogeneic HSCT in the entire cohort did not differ between patients with a sole trisomy 8, trisomy 8 with additional cytogenetic aberrations or without a trisomy 8. A trisomy 8 did not affect outcomes within the three ELN2017 risk groups. In accordance with findings in unselected patient cohorts, persistent MRD at allogeneic HSCT in patients with a trisomy 8 identified individuals with a higher risk of relapse following allogeneic HSCT. CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes of trisomy 8 patients after allogeneic HSCT did not compare unfavorably to that of other AML patients following allogeneic HSCT. Rather than the presence or absence of a trisomy 8, additional genetic aberrations and MRD at HSCT define outcome differences and aid in informed treatment decisions.",,"['Backhaus, Donata', 'Jentzsch, Madlen', 'Bischof, Lara', 'Brauer, Dominic', 'Wilhelm, Christina', 'Schulz, Julia', 'Franke, Georg-Nikolaus', 'Ponisch, Wolfram', 'Vucinic, Vladan', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Schwind, Sebastian']","['Backhaus D', 'Jentzsch M', 'Bischof L', 'Brauer D', 'Wilhelm C', 'Schulz J', 'Franke GN', 'Ponisch W', 'Vucinic V', 'Platzbecker U', 'Schwind S']","['Medical Clinic and Policlinic 1, Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Leipzig University Hospital, Liebigstrasse 22, Haus 7, 04103 Leipzig, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic 1, Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Leipzig University Hospital, Liebigstrasse 22, Haus 7, 04103 Leipzig, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic 1, Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Leipzig University Hospital, Liebigstrasse 22, Haus 7, 04103 Leipzig, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic 1, Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Leipzig University Hospital, Liebigstrasse 22, Haus 7, 04103 Leipzig, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic 1, Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Leipzig University Hospital, Liebigstrasse 22, Haus 7, 04103 Leipzig, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic 1, Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Leipzig University Hospital, Liebigstrasse 22, Haus 7, 04103 Leipzig, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic 1, Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Leipzig University Hospital, Liebigstrasse 22, Haus 7, 04103 Leipzig, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic 1, Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Leipzig University Hospital, Liebigstrasse 22, Haus 7, 04103 Leipzig, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic 1, Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Leipzig University Hospital, Liebigstrasse 22, Haus 7, 04103 Leipzig, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic 1, Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Leipzig University Hospital, Liebigstrasse 22, Haus 7, 04103 Leipzig, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Policlinic 1, Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Leipzig University Hospital, Liebigstrasse 22, Haus 7, 04103 Leipzig, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211113,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,2021/11/28 06:00,2021/11/28 06:01,['2021/11/27 01:13'],"['2021/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/11 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/27 01:13 [entrez]', '2021/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/28 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13225679 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13225679 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Nov 13;13(22). pii: cancers13225679. doi: 10.3390/cancers13225679.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-2270-0804', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1863-3239', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1315-2332']","['04R/2016/Deutsche Jose Carreras Leukamie-Stiftung', 'NA/Ein Herz fur Kinder e.V.', 'NA/Zusammen gegen den Krebs e.V.', 'Clinician Scientist/Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Innere Medizin']",PMC8616076,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'MRD', 'allogeneic HSCT', 'trisomy 8']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, they have not been directly compared in a randomised clinical trial. In addition, there are no studies comparing the optimal treatment schedule of each drug in AML. A systematic review and meta-analysis on the efficacy of decitabine and azacitidine monotherapy in newly diagnosed AML was conducted. Randomised controlled trials and retrospective studies were included. A total of 2743 patients from 23 cohorts were analysed (10 cohorts of azacitidine and 13 of decitabine). Similar response rates were observed for azacitidine (38%, 95% CI: 30-47%) compared to decitabine (40%, 95% CI: 32-48%) (p = 0.825). Overall survival (OS) between azacitidine (10.04 months, 95% CI: 8.36-11.72) and decitabine (8.79 months, 95% CI: 7.62-9.96) was also similar (p = 0.386).

The classification and diagnostic criteria of MPNs have undergone relevant changes over the years, reflecting the increased awareness on these conditions and a better understanding of their biological and clinical-pathological features. The current World Health Organization (WHO) Classification acknowledges four main sub-groups of MPNs: (i) Chronic Myeloid Leukemia; (ii) classical Philadelphia-negative MPNs (Polycythemia Vera; Essential Thrombocythemia; Primary Myelofibrosis); (iii) non-classical Philadelphia-negative MPNs (Chronic Neutrophilic Leukemia; Chronic Eosinophilic Leukemia); and (iv) MPNs, unclassifiable (MPN-U). The latter are currently defined as MPNs with clinical-pathological findings not fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for any other entity. The MPN-U spectrum traditionally encompasses early phase MPNs, terminal (i.e., advanced fibrotic) MPNs, and cases associated with inflammatory or neoplastic disorders that obscure the clinical-histological picture. Several lines of evidence and clinical practice suggest the existence of additional myeloid neoplasms that may expand the spectrum of MPN-U.

Besides broadening our biological understanding of cellular heterogeneity, sub-clonal architecture, and regulatory network of tumor cell populations, SCS can offer clinically relevant, detailed characterization of distinct compartments affected by leukemia and identify therapeutically exploitable vulnerabilities. In this review, we provide an overview of SCS studies focused on the high-resolution genomic and transcriptomic scrutiny of pediatric leukemia. Our aim is to investigate and summarize how different layers of single-cell omics approaches can expectedly support clinical decision making in the future. Although the clinical management of pediatric leukemia underwent a spectacular improvement during the past decades, resistant disease is a major cause of therapy failure. Currently, only a small proportion of childhood leukemia patients benefit from genomics-driven therapy, as 15-20% of them meet the indication criteria of on-label targeted agents, and their overall response rate falls in a relatively wide range (40-85%). The in-depth scrutiny of various cell populations influencing the development, progression, and treatment resistance of different disease subtypes can potentially uncover a wider range of driver mechanisms for innovative therapeutic interventions.",,"['Alpar, Donat', 'Egyed, Balint', 'Bodor, Csaba', 'Kovacs, Gabor T']","['Alpar D', 'Egyed B', 'Bodor C', 'Kovacs GT']","['HCEMM-SE Molecular Oncohematology Research Group, 1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, H-1085 Budapest, Hungary.', 'HCEMM-SE Molecular Oncohematology Research Group, 1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, H-1085 Budapest, Hungary.', '2nd Department of Pediatrics, Semmelweis University, H-1094 Budapest, Hungary.', 'HCEMM-SE Molecular Oncohematology Research Group, 1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, H-1085 Budapest, Hungary.', '2nd Department of Pediatrics, Semmelweis University, H-1094 Budapest, Hungary.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211112,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,2021/11/28 06:00,2021/11/28 06:01,['2021/11/27 01:13'],"['2021/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/05 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/27 01:13 [entrez]', '2021/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/28 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13225658 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13225658 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Nov 12;13(22). pii: cancers13225658. doi: 10.3390/cancers13225658.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-2638-5418', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8783-9025']","['FK20_134253, K21_137948 and ED18-1-2019-0019/Hungarian National Research,', 'Development and Innovation Office', ""739593/EU's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program"", 'BO/00320/18/5/Janos Bolyai Research Scholarship', 'UNKP-20-5-SE-22, UNKP-20-3-II-SE-20 and KDP-2020-1008491/New National Excellence', 'Program and Co-operative Doctoral Program of the Ministry for In-novation and', 'Technology', '03/MGYH-MGYGYT/2021/Hungarian Pediatric Oncology Network', 'EFOP-3.6.3-VEKOP-16-2017-00009/Complementary Research Excellence Program of', 'Semmelweis University']",PMC8616124,['NOTNLM'],"['cellular heterogeneity', 'evolutionary trajectory', 'pediatric leukemia', 'single-cell sequencing', 'targeted therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in a large proportion of cases (B-other), recurrent BCP-ALL-associated genomic alterations remain unidentifiable by current diagnostic procedures. In this study, we performed RNA sequencing and analyzed gene fusions, expression profiles, and mutations in diagnostic samples of 185 children with BCP-ALL. Gene expression clustering showed that a subset of B-other samples partially clusters with some of the known subgroups, particularly DUX4-positive. Mutation analysis coupled with gene expression profiling revealed the presence of distinctive BCP-ALL subgroups, characterized by the presence of mutations in known ALL driver genes, e.g., PAX5 and IKZF1. Moreover, we identified novel fusion partners of lymphoid lineage transcriptional factors ETV6, IKZF1 and PAX5. In addition, we report on low blast count detection thresholds and show that the use of EDTA tubes for sample collection does not have adverse effects on sequencing and downstream analysis.

Overall, 322 patients with acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome with a minimum follow-up of one year were included (the median follow-up in this study was 68 months). Pulmonary, cardiac, ocular, neurological and renal toxicities were observed in 23.9%, 14.0%, 23.6%, 23.9% and 20.2% of all patients, respectively. The majority of these side effects were grades 1 and 2 (64.9-89.2% of all toxicities in the respective categories). The use of 12 Gray total body irradiation resulted in a significant increase in ocular toxicities (p = 0.013) and severe mucositis (p < 0.001). Renal toxicities were influenced by the age at transplantation (relative risk: 1.06, p < 0.001) and disease entity.

Innovative solutions to improve on these drawbacks have been attempted, but none of them have been truly successful so far. In this work, we fully replaced the enzyme scaffold, generating an active, miniaturized form of L-asparaginase by protein engineering of a camel single domain antibody, a class of antibodies known to have a limited immunogenicity in humans. We then targeted it onto tumor cells by an antibody scFv fragment directed onto the CD19 B-cell surface receptor expressed on ALL cells. We named this new type of nanobody-based antibody-drug conjugate ""Targeted Catalytic Nanobody"" (T-CAN). The new molecule retains the catalytic activity and the binding capability of the original modules and successfully targets CD19 expressing cells in vitro.

Although the initiating transforming events are yet to be determined, current concepts suggest a stepwise acquisition of (additional) somatic mutations-apart from the initial driver mutations-that trigger disease evolution. In this study we molecularly analyzed paired bone marrow samples of MPN and MDS/MPN patients with known progression and compared them to a control cohort of patients with stable disease course. Cases with progression displayed from the very beginning a higher number of mutations compared to stable ones, of which mutations in five (ASXL1, DNMT3A, NRAS, SRSF2 and TP53) strongly correlated with progression and/or transformation, even if only one of these genes was mutated, and this particularly applied to MPN. TET2 mutations were found to have a higher allelic frequency than the putative driver mutation in three progressing cases (""TET2-first""), whereas two stable cases displayed a TET2-positive subclone (""TET2-second""), supporting the hypothesis that not only the sum of mutations but also their order of appearance matters in the course of disease.

We aim to assess the prevalence and the clinical, therapeutic and prognostic features of extramedullary localizations other than central nervous system or testis in children with relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) treated on a relapsed ALL protocol. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with relapse of ALL and LBL, treated according to the multicentric ALL-REZ BFM trials between 1983 and 2015, were analyzed for other extramedullary relapse (OEMR) of the disease regarding clinical features, treatment and outcome. Local treatment/irradiation has been recommended on an individual basis and performed only in a minority of patients. RESULTS: A total of 132 out of 2323 (5.6%) patients with ALL relapse presented with an OEMR (combined bone marrow relapse n = 78; isolated extramedullary relapse n = 54). Compared to the non-OEMR group, patients with OEMR had a higher rate of T-immunophenotype (p < 0.001), a higher rate of LBL (p < 0.001) and a significantly different distribution of time to relapse, i.e., more very early and late relapses compared to the non-OEMR group (p = 0.01). Ten-year probabilities of event-free survival (pEFS) and overall survival (pOS) in non-OEMR vs. OEMR were 0.38 +/- 0.01 and 0.32 +/- 0.04 (p = 0.0204) vs. 0.45 +/- 0.01 and 0.37 +/- 0.04 (p = 0.0112), respectively. OEMRs have been classified into five subgroups according to the main affected compartment: lymphatic organs (n = 32, 10y-pEFS 0.50 +/- 0.09), mediastinum (n = 35, 10y-pEFS 0.11 +/- 0.05), bone (n = 12, 0.17 +/- 0.11), skin and glands (n = 21, 0.32 +/- 0.11) and other localizations (n = 32, 0.41 +/- 0.09). Patients with OEMR and T-lineage ALL/LBL showed a significantly worse 10y-pEFS (0.15 +/- 0.04) than those with B-Precursor-ALL (0.49 +/- 0.06, p < 0.001). Stratified into standard risk (SR) and high risk (HR) groups, pEFS and pOS of OEMR subgroups were in the expected range whereas the mediastinal subgroup had a significantly worse outcome. Subsequent relapses involved more frequently the bone marrow (58.4%) than isolated extramedullary compartments (41.7%). In multivariate Cox regression, OEMR confers an independent prognostic factor for inferior pEFS and pOS. CONCLUSION: OEMR is adversely related to prognosis. However, the established risk classification can be applied for all subgroups except mediastinal relapses requiring treatment intensification. Generally, isolated OEMR of T-cell-origin needs an intensified treatment including allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as a curative approach independent from time to relapse. Local therapy such as surgery and irradiation may be of benefit in selected cases. The indication needs to be clarified in further investigations.",,"['Lissat, Andrej', 'van Schewick, Claudia', 'Steffen, Ingo G', 'Arakawa, Ayumu', 'Bourquin, Jean-Pierre', 'Burkhardt, Birgit', 'Henze, Guenter', 'Mann, Georg', 'Peters, Christina', 'Sramkova, Lucie', 'Eckert, Cornelia', 'von Stackelberg, Arend', 'Chen-Santel, Christiane']","['Lissat A', 'van Schewick C', 'Steffen IG', 'Arakawa A', 'Bourquin JP', 'Burkhardt B', 'Henze G', 'Mann G', 'Peters C', 'Sramkova L', 'Eckert C', 'von Stackelberg A', 'Chen-Santel C']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Augstenburger Platz 1, 13353 Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Augstenburger Platz 1, 13353 Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Augstenburger Platz 1, 13353 Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Augstenburger Platz 1, 13353 Berlin, Germany.', ""Eleonoren-Foundation, Pediatric Hematology Oncology Department, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Steinwiesstrasse 75, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Universitatsklinikum Munster, Albert-Schweitzer-Campus 1, Gebaude A1, 48149 Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Augstenburger Platz 1, 13353 Berlin, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, St. Anna Children's Hospital, Kinderspitalgasse 6, A-1090 Vienna, Austria."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, St. Anna Children's Hospital, Kinderspitalgasse 6, A-1090 Vienna, Austria."", 'Charles University 2nd Faculty of Medicine and UH Motol V Uvalu 84, Prague 5 15006, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Augstenburger Platz 1, 13353 Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Augstenburger Platz 1, 13353 Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Augstenburger Platz 1, 13353 Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211114,Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,,,2021/11/28 06:00,2021/11/28 06:01,['2021/11/27 01:12'],"['2021/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/08 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/27 01:12 [entrez]', '2021/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/28 06:01 [medline]']","['jcm10225292 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm10225292 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Med. 2021 Nov 14;10(22). pii: jcm10225292. doi: 10.3390/jcm10225292.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-1151-829X'],['DKS 2018.13/Deutsche Kinderkrebsstiftung'],PMC8621955,['NOTNLM'],"['lymphoblastic leukemia', 'other extramedullary relapse', 'pediatric']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therapeutic regimens with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) specifically targeting BCR-ABL have greatly improved overall survival of CML. However, drug intolerance and related toxicity remain. Combined therapy is effective in reducing drug magnitude while increasing therapeutic efficacy and, thus, lowers undesired adverse side effects. The p38 MAPK activity is critically linked to the pathogenesis of a number of diseases including hematopoietic diseases; however, the role of each isozyme in CML and TKI-mediated effects is still elusive. In this study, we used specific gene knockdown to clearly demonstrate that the deficiency of p38alpha greatly enhanced the therapeutic efficacy in growth suppression and cytotoxicity of TKIs, first-generation imatinib, and second generation dasatinib by approximately 2.5-3.0-fold in BCR-ABL-positive CML-derived leukemia K562 and KMB5 cells. Knockdown of p38beta, which displays the most sequence similarity to p38alpha, exerted distinct and opposite effects on the TKI-mediated therapeutic efficacy. These results show the importance of isotype-specific intervention in enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of TKI. A highly specific p38alpha inhibitor, TAK715, also significantly enhanced the imatinib- and dasatinib-mediated therapeutic efficacy, supporting the feasibility of p38alpha deficiency in future clinic application. Taken together, our results demonstrated that p38alpha is a promising target for combined therapy with BCR-ABL-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitors for future application to increase therapeutic efficacy.",,"['Kuo, Yi-Hue', 'Wei, Shih-Hsiang', 'Jiang, Jie-Hau', 'Chang, Yueh-Shih', 'Liu, Mei-Yin', 'Fu, Shu-Ling', 'Huang, Chi-Ying F', 'Lin, Wey-Jinq']","['Kuo YH', 'Wei SH', 'Jiang JH', 'Chang YS', 'Liu MY', 'Fu SL', 'Huang CF', 'Lin WJ']","['Institute of Biopharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei 112, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biopharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei 112, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biopharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei 112, Taiwan.', 'Hemato-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, College of Medicine, Keelung & Chang Gung University, Taoyuan City 33302, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei 112, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biopharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei 112, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Traditional Medicine, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei 112, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biopharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei 112, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei 112, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biopharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei 112, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211122,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,,2021/11/28 06:00,2021/12/18 06:00,['2021/11/27 01:12'],"['2021/10/11 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/18 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/27 01:12 [entrez]', '2021/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms222212573 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms222212573 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Nov 22;22(22). pii: ijms222212573. doi: 10.3390/ijms222212573.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-5182-7911', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2169-8298']","['MOST 108-2320-B-010-017 and grant No: MOST 110-2320-B-A49A-541 - and grant No:', 'CMRPG2F0231./Ministry of Science and Technology and Chang Gung medical research', 'fund']",PMC8623086,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic myeloid leukemia', 'combined therapy', 'dasatinib', 'imatinib', 'p38 MAPK']",20211217,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 14)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",,"['Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dasatinib/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 14/antagonists & inhibitors/deficiency/*genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology']",,,,,,,,,,

The Ph chromosome originates an aberrant fusion gene with abnormal kinase activity, leading to the buildup of reactive oxygen species and genetic instability of relevance in disease progression. Several genetic abnormalities have been correlated with CML in the blast phase, including chromosomal aberrations and common altered genes. Some of these genes are involved in the regulation of cell apoptosis and proliferation, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), tumor protein p53 (TP53), or Schmidt-Ruppin A-2 proto-oncogene (SRC); cell adhesion, e.g., catenin beta 1 (CTNNB1); or genes associated to TGF-beta, such as SKI like proto-oncogene (SKIL), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) or transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGFB2); and TNF-alpha pathways, such as Tumor necrosis factor (TNFA) or Nuclear factor kappa B subunit 1 (NFKB1).

Hyperactive FLT3 induces premature activation of multiple intracellular signaling pathways, resulting in cell proliferation and anti-apoptosis. We conducted the computational modeling studies of 40 pyrimidine-4,6-diamine-based compounds by integrating docking, molecular dynamics, and three-dimensional structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR). Molecular docking showed that K644, C694, F691, E692, N701, D829, and F830 are critical residues for the binding of ligands at the hydrophobic active site. Molecular dynamics (MD), together with Molecular Mechanics Poison-Boltzmann/Generalized Born Surface Area, i.e., MM-PB(GB)SA, and linear interaction energy (LIE) estimation, provided critical information on the stability and binding affinity of the selected docked compounds. The MD study suggested that the mutation in the gatekeeper residue F691 exhibited a lower binding affinity to the ligand. Although, the mutation in D835 in the activation loop did not exhibit any significant change in the binding energy to the most active compound. We developed the ligand-based comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative molecular similarity index analysis (CoMSIA) models. CoMFA (q(2) = 0.802, r(2) = 0.983, and QF32 = 0.698) and CoMSIA (q(2) = 0.725, r(2) = 0.965 and QF32 = 0.668) established the structure-activity relationship (SAR) and showed a reasonable external predictive power. The contour maps from the CoMFA and CoMSIA models could explain valuable information about the favorable and unfavorable positions for chemical group substitution, which can increase or decrease the inhibitory activity of the compounds. In addition, we designed 30 novel compounds, and their predicted pIC50 values were assessed with the CoMSIA model, followed by the assessment of their physicochemical properties, bioavailability, and free energy calculation.

Bexarotene treatment elicits side-effects by provoking or disrupting other RXR-dependent pathways. Analogs were assessed by the modeling of binding to RXR and then evaluated in a human cell-based RXR-RXR mammalian-2-hybrid (M2H) system as well as a RXRE-controlled transcriptional system. The analogs were also tested in KMT2A-MLLT3 leukemia cells and the EC50 and IC50 values were determined for these compounds. Moreover, the analogs were assessed for activation of LXR in an LXRE system as drivers of ApoE expression and subsequent use as potential therapeutics in neurodegenerative disorders, and the results revealed that these compounds exerted a range of differential LXR-RXR activation and selectivity. Furthermore, several of the novel analogs in this study exhibited reduced RARE cross-signaling, implying RXR selectivity. These results demonstrate that modification of partial agonists such as NEt-4IB and potent rexinoids such as bexarotene can lead to compounds with improved RXR selectivity, decreased cross-signaling of other RXR-dependent nuclear receptors, increased LXRE-heterodimer selectivity, and enhanced anti-proliferative potential in leukemia cell lines compared to therapeutics such as 1.",,"['Jurutka,

Despite improved treatment and survival for ALL, disproportionate health outcomes in Hispanics persist. Thus, it is essential to identify oncogenic mutations within this demographic to aid in the development of new strategies to diagnose and treat ALL. Using whole-exome sequencing, five single nucleotide polymorphisms within mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 (MAP2K3) were identified in an ALL cancer patient library from the U.S./Mexico border. MAP2K3 R26T and P11T are located near the substrate-binding site, while R65L and R67W localized to the kinase domain. Truncated-MAP2K3 mutant Q73* was also identified. Transfection in HEK293 cells showed that the quadruple-MEK3 mutant (4M-MEK3) impacted protein stability, inducing degradation and reducing expression. The expression of 4M-MEK3 could be rescued by cysteine/serine protease inhibition, and proteasomal degradation of truncated-MEK3 occurred in a ubiquitin-independent manner. MEK3 mutants displayed reduced auto-phosphorylation and enzymatic activity, as seen by decreases in p38 phosphorylation. Furthermore, uncoupling of the MEK3/p38 signaling pathway resulted in less suppressive activity on HEK293 cell viability. Thus, disruption of MEK3 activation may promote proliferative signals in ALL. These findings suggest that MEK3 represents a potential therapeutic target for treating ALL.",,"['Ayala-Marin, Yoshira M', 'Grant, Alice H', 'Rodriguez, Georgialina', 'Kirken, Robert A']","['Ayala-Marin YM', 'Grant AH', 'Rodriguez G', 'Kirken RA']","['Border Biomedical Research Center, Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968, USA.', 'Border Biomedical Research Center, Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968, USA.', 'Border Biomedical Research Center, Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968, USA.', 'Border Biomedical Research Center, Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211111,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,,2021/11/28 06:00,2021/12/16 06:00,['2021/11/27 01:10'],"['2021/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/06 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/27 01:10 [entrez]', '2021/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms222212210 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms222212210 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Nov 11;22(22). pii: ijms222212210. doi: 10.3390/ijms222212210.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-1124-5818'],"['5U54MD007592/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R25GM069621-18/RISE Scholars Program at UTEP funded by the National Institute of', 'General Medical Sciences']",PMC8618549,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'Hispanic', 'MAP2K3', 'MAPK p38', 'MEK3', 'cell proliferation', 'health disparities', 'leukemia', 'protein degradation']",20211215,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K3 protein, human)']",,"['Cell Proliferation/*genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', '*MAP Kinase Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*genetics', '*Mutation', '*Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/genetics', '*Proteolysis']",,,,,,,,,,

However, its mechanisms of action and target genes in iNKT cells are still elusive. Here, we show that Ets1 is required for the optimal expression of the Valpha14Jalpha18 T cell receptor (TCR) in post-selected thymic iNKT cells and their immediate differentiation. Ets1 is also critical for maintaining the peripheral homeostasis of iNKT cells, which is a role independent of the expression of the Valpha14Jalpha18 TCR. Genome-wide transcriptomic analyses of post-selected iNKT cells further reveal that Ets1 controls leukocytes activation, proliferation differentiation, and leukocyte-mediated immunity. In addition, Ets1 regulates the expression of ICOS and PLZF in iNKT cells. More importantly, restoring the expression of PLZF and the Valpha14Jalpha18 TCR partially rescues the differentiation of iNKT cells in the absence of Ets1.

In addition, they are also widely detected in normal tissues, contributing to transcriptomic complexity. Despite their prevalence, little is known about the characteristics and functions of chimeric RNAs. Here, we examine the genetic structure and biological roles of CLEC12A-MIR223HG, a novel chimeric transcript produced by the fusion of the cell surface receptor CLEC12A and the miRNA-223 host gene (MIR223HG), first identified in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. Surprisingly, we observed that CLEC12A-MIR223HG is not just expressed in CML, but also in a variety of normal tissues and cell lines. CLEC12A-MIR223HG expression is elevated in pro-monocytic cells resistant to chemotherapy and during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation. We observed that CLEC12A-MIR223HG is a product of trans-splicing rather than a chromosomal rearrangement and that transcriptional activation of CLEC12A with the CRISPR/Cas9 Synergistic Activation Mediator (SAM) system increases CLEC12A-MIR223HG expression. CLEC12A-MIR223HG translates into a chimeric protein, which largely resembles CLEC12A but harbours an altered C-type lectin domain altering key disulphide bonds.

Stromal cells in the bone marrow environment protect leukemia cells by secretion of chemokines as cues for BCP-ALL migration towards, and adhesion to, stroma. Stromal cells and BCP-ALL cells communicate through stromal galectin-3. Here, we investigated the significance of stromal galectin-3 to BCP-ALL cells. We used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to ablate galectin-3 in stromal cells and found that galectin-3 is dispensable for steady-state BCP-ALL proliferation and viability. However, efficient leukemia migration and adhesion to stromal cells are significantly dependent on stromal galectin-3. Importantly, the loss of stromal galectin-3 production sensitized BCP-ALL cells to conventional chemotherapy. We therefore tested novel carbohydrate-based small molecule compounds (Cpd14 and Cpd17) with high specificity for galectin-3. Consistent with results obtained using galectin-3-knockout stromal cells, treatment of stromal-BCP-ALL co-cultures inhibited BCP-ALL migration and adhesion. Moreover, these compounds induced anti-leukemic responses in BCP-ALL cells, including a dose-dependent reduction of viability and proliferation, the induction of apoptosis and, importantly, the inhibition of drug resistance. Collectively, these findings indicate galectin-3 regulates BCP-ALL cell responses to chemotherapy through the interactions between leukemia cells and the stroma, and show that a combination of galectin-3 inhibition with conventional drugs can sensitize the leukemia cells to chemotherapy.",,"['Tarighat, Somayeh S', 'Fei, Fei', 'Joo, Eun Ji', 'Abdel-Azim, Hisham', 'Yang, Lu', 'Geng, Huimin', 'Bum-Erdene, Khuchtumur', 'Grice, I Darren', 'von Itzstein, Mark', 'Blanchard, Helen', 'Heisterkamp, Nora']","['Tarighat SS', 'Fei F', 'Joo EJ', 'Abdel-Azim H', 'Yang L', 'Geng H', 'Bum-Erdene K', 'Grice ID', 'von Itzstein M', 'Blanchard H', 'Heisterkamp N']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplant, The Saban Research Institute of Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplant, The Saban Research Institute of Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplant, The Saban Research Institute of Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA."", 'Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, Monrovia, CA 91016, USA.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplant, The Saban Research Institute of Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA."", 'Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, Monrovia, CA 91016, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.', 'Institute for Glycomics, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Southport, QLD 4222, Australia.', 'Institute for Glycomics, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Southport, QLD 4222, Australia.', 'School of Medical Science, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Southport, QLD 4222, Australia.', 'Institute for Glycomics, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Southport, QLD 4222, Australia.', 'Institute for Glycomics, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Southport, QLD 4222, Australia.', 'School of Chemistry and Molecular Bioscience and Molecular Horizons, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.', 'Illawarra Health & Medical Research Institute, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplant, The Saban Research Institute of Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA."", 'Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, Monrovia, CA 91016, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211110,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,,2021/11/28 06:00,2021/11/28 06:00,['2021/11/27 01:10'],"['2021/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/06 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/27 01:10 [entrez]', '2021/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/28 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms222212167 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms222212167 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Nov 10;22(22). pii: ijms222212167. doi: 10.3390/ijms222212167.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-9218-457X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6302-7524']","['CA172040/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'CA090321/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'ID1043716/Cancer Council Queensland', 'ID1080845/Cancer Council Queensland']",PMC8624256,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell precursor ALL', 'adhesion', 'carbohydrate-based galectin-3 inhibitor', 'drug resistance', 'galectin', 'galectin-3', 'glycomimetic', 'lgals3', 'microenvironment', 'migration', 'monosaccharide', 'taloside']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CAR-T cells have been very effective in hematologic malignancies, such as diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), and multiple myeloma (MM); however, its effectiveness in treating solid tumors has not been evaluated clearly. Therefore, many studies and clinical investigations are emerging to improve the CAR-T cell efficacy in solid tumors.

Nevertheless, the biological consequences of BETi in NPM1c AML were not fully investigated. Even if of better prognosis AML patients with NPM1c may relapse and treatment remains difficult. Differentiation-based therapy by all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) combined with arsenic trioxide (ATO) demonstrated activity in NPM1c AML. We found that BETi, similar to ATO + ATRA, induced differentiation and apoptosis which was TP53 independent in the NPM1c cell line OCI-AML3 and primary cells. Furthermore, BETi induced proteasome-dependent degradation of NPM1c. BETi degraded NPM1c in the cytosol while BRD4 is degraded in the nucleus which suggests that restoration of the NPM1/BRD4 equilibrium in the nucleus of NPM1c cells is essential for the efficacy of BETi. While ATO + ATRA had significant biological activity in NPM1c IMS-M2 cell line, those cells were resistant to BETi. Gene profiling revealed that IMS-M2 cells probably resist to BETi by upregulation of LSC pathways independently of the downregulation of a core BET-responsive transcriptional program. ATO + ATRA downregulated a NPM1c specific HOX gene signature while anti-leukemic effects of BETi appear HOX gene independent.

Similarities in their homeobox sequences serve to arrange these genes in classes and subclasses, including NKL homeobox genes. In accordance with their normal functions, deregulated homeobox genes contribute to carcinogenesis along with hematopoietic malignancies. We have recently described the physiological expression of eleven NKL homeobox genes in the course of hematopoiesis and termed this gene expression pattern NKL-code. Due to the developmental impact of NKL homeobox genes these data suggest a key role for their activity in the normal regulation of hematopoietic cell differentiation including T-cells. On the other hand, aberrant overexpression of NKL-code members or ectopical activation of non-code members has been frequently reported in lymphoid and myeloid leukemia/lymphoma, demonstrating their oncogenic impact in the hematopoietic compartment.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Saliva was collected from 20 patients (4 healthy patients, 16 leukemia patients). Resin disks were made for each RBC and were immersed in the acute leukemia (acute lymphocytic (ALL), acute myeloid (AML)), chronic leukemia (chronic lymphocytic (CLL), chronic myeloid (CML)), Artificial saliva and Control environment, and maintained for seven days. At the end of the experiment, the characteristics and the effective response of saliva from the studied salivas' on RBCs was assessed using water sorption, water solubility, residual monomer and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Data analysis was performed and a p-value under 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The behaviour of RBCs in different immersion environments varies according to the characteristics of the RBCs. RBCs with a higher filler ratio have a lower water sorption. The solubility is also deteriorated by the types of organic matrix and filler; the results of solubility being inversely proportional on the scale of negative values compared to sorption values. Chromatograms of residual monomers showed the highest amount of unreacted monomers in ALL and AML, and the Control and artificial saliva environments had the smallest residual monomer peaks. Because of the low number of differences between the experimental conditions, we further considered that there were no important statistical differences between experimental conditions and analysed them as a single group. CONCLUSION: The influence of saliva on RBCs depends on the type of leukemia; acute leukemia influenced the most RBCs by changing their properties compared to chronic leukemia.",,"['Mester, Alexandru', 'Moldovan, Marioara', 'Cuc, Stanca', 'Tomuleasa, Ciprian', 'Pasca, Sergiu', 'Filip, Miuta', 'Piciu, Andra', 'Onisor, Florin']","['Mester A', 'Moldovan M', 'Cuc S', 'Tomuleasa C', 'Pasca S', 'Filip M', 'Piciu A', 'Onisor F']","['Department of Oral Health, University of Medicine and Pharmacy ""Iuliu Hatieganu"", 400012 Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Polymer Composites, Institute of Chemistry ""Raluca Ripan"", University Babes-Bolyai, 400294 Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Polymer Composites, Institute of Chemistry ""Raluca Ripan"", University Babes-Bolyai, 400294 Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Oncology ""Ion Chiricuta"", University of Medicine and Pharmacy ""Iuliu Hatieganu"", 400012 Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Oncology ""Ion Chiricuta"", University of Medicine and Pharmacy ""Iuliu Hatieganu"", 400012 Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Polymer Composites, Institute of Chemistry ""Raluca Ripan"", University Babes-Bolyai, 400294 Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Institute of Oncology ""Ion Chiricuta"", University of Medicine and Pharmacy ""Iuliu Hatieganu"", 400012 Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Maxillofacial Surgery and Implantology, University of Medicine and Pharmacy ""Iuliu Hatieganu"", 400012 Cluj-Napoca, Romania.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211104,Switzerland,Biomedicines,Biomedicines,101691304,,,2021/11/28 06:00,2021/11/28 06:01,['2021/11/27 01:10'],"['2021/10/20 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/01 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/27 01:10 [entrez]', '2021/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/28 06:01 [medline]']","['biomedicines9111618 [pii]', '10.3390/biomedicines9111618 [doi]']",epublish,Biomedicines. 2021 Nov 4;9(11). pii: biomedicines9111618. doi: 10.3390/biomedicines9111618.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-3393-4307', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9714-4809', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9812-695X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5500-1519', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6536-7696', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3831-1851', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1076-7726']",,PMC8615474,['NOTNLM'],"['dental composite', 'leukemia', 'oral health', 'resin-based composite', 'saliva']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The significance of endothelial cells (ECs) in this scenario relies on multiple vascular functions. By forming new blood vessels, ECs support tumor growth. In addition to their angiogenic properties, tumor-associated ECs (TECs) establish a unique vascular niche that actively modulates cancer development by shuttling a selected pattern of factors and metabolites to the CC. The profile of secreted metabolites is strictly dependent on the metabolic status of the cell, which is markedly perturbed in TECs. Recent evidence highlights the involvement of heme metabolism in the regulation of energy metabolism in TECs. The present study shows that interfering with endothelial heme metabolism by targeting the cell membrane heme exporter Feline Leukemia Virus subgroup C Receptor 1a (FLVCR1a) in TECs, resulted in enhanced fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Moreover, FAO-derived acetyl-CoA was partly consumed through ketogenesis, resulting in ketone bodies (KBs) accumulation in FLVCR1a-deficient TECs. Finally, the results from this study also demonstrate that TECs-derived KBs can be secreted in the extracellular environment, inducing a metabolic rewiring in the CC.

This may overcome the limitations (e.g., poor bioavailability and high-dose toxicity) in developing these agents as cancer medicines. We have previously reported that the hydroxycinnamic acid derivative (HCAD) methyl-4-hydroxycinnamate and the phenolic diterpene carnosic acid (CA) can synergistically induce massive calcium-dependent apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at non-cytotoxic concentrations of each agent. Here, we explored the chemical nature of the synergy between HCADs and either CA, in inducing cytotoxicity, or the active metabolite of vitamin D (calcitriol), in enhancing the differentiation of AML cells. This was done by determining the structure-activity relationship of a series of hydroxycinnamic acids and their derivatives (methyl hydroxycinnamates and hydroxybenzylideneacetones) in combination with CA or calcitriol. The HCAD/CA synergy required the following critical structural elements of an HCAD molecule: (a) the para-hydroxyl on the phenolic ring, (b) the carbon C7-C8 double bond, and (c) the methyl-esterified carboxyl. Thus, the only HCADs capable of synergizing with CA were found to be methyl-4-hydroxycinnamate and methyl ferulate, which also most potently enhanced calcitriol-induced cell differentiation. Notably, the C7-C8 double bond was the major requirement for this HCAD/calcitriol cooperation. Our findings may contribute to the rational design of novel synergistically acting AML drugs based on prototype combinations of HCADs with other agents studied here.",,"['Trachtenberg, Aviram', 'Sidoryk, Katarzyna', 'Alreate, Somaya', 'Muduli, Suchismita', 'Les, Andrzej', 'Cybulski, Marcin', 'Danilenko, Michael']","['Trachtenberg A', 'Sidoryk K', 'Alreate S', 'Muduli S', 'Les A', 'Cybulski M', 'Danilenko M']","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva 8410501, Israel.', 'Team of Chemistry, Department of Pharmacy, Cosmetic Chemicals and Biotechnology, Lukasiewicz Research Network-Industrial Chemistry Institute, 01-793 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva 8410501, Israel.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva 8410501, Israel.', 'Faculty of Chemistry, University of Warsaw, 02-093 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Team of Chemistry, Department of Pharmacy, Cosmetic Chemicals and Biotechnology, Lukasiewicz Research Network-Industrial Chemistry Institute, 01-793 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva 8410501, Israel.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211021,Switzerland,Biomedicines,Biomedicines,101691304,,,2021/11/28 06:00,2021/11/28 06:01,['2021/11/27 01:09'],"['2021/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/14 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/27 01:09 [entrez]', '2021/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/28 06:01 [medline]']","['biomedicines9111517 [pii]', '10.3390/biomedicines9111517 [doi]']",epublish,Biomedicines. 2021 Oct 21;9(11). pii: biomedicines9111517. doi: 10.3390/biomedicines9111517.,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-2030-1786', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1581-0693', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2956-8172', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4560-9317', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9466-6169']","['226/16/Israel Science Foundation', '841333/Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education']",PMC8615284,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'carnosic acid', 'hydroxycinnamates', 'structure-activity relationship', 'vitamin D']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The question arises if these substances have caspase-3- and apoptosis-activating effects on the cell proliferation in Jurkat and HF-SAR cells. Antioxidative capacity of several combined aKG + 5-HMF solution was estimated by cigarette smoke radical oxidized proteins of fetal calf serum (FCS) using the estimation of carbonylated proteins. The usage of 500 microg/mL aKG + 166.7 microg/mL 5-HMF showed the best antioxidative capacity to inhibit protein modification of more than 50% compared to control measurement. A Jurkat cell line and human fibroblasts (HF-SAR) were cultivated in the absence or presence of combined AKG + 5-HMF solutions between 0 microg/mL aKG + 0 microg/mL 5-HMF and different concentrations of 500 microg/mL aKG + 166.7 microg/mL 5-HMF. Aliquots of Jurkat cells were tested for cell proliferation, mitochondrial activity, caspase activity, apoptotic cells and of the carbonylated protein content as marker of oxidized proteins in cell lysates after 24, 48, and 72 h of incubation. The combined solutions of aKG + 5-HMF were shown to cause a reduction in Jurkat cell growth that was dependent on the dose and incubation time, with the greatest reductions using 500 microg/mL aKG + 166.7 microg/mL 5-HMF after 24 h of incubation compared to 24 h with the control (22,832 cells vs. 32,537 cells), as well as after 48 h (21,243 vs. 52,123 cells) and after 72 h (23,224 cells). Cell growth was totally inhibited by the 500 microg/mL AKG + 166.7 microg/mL solution between 0 and 72 h of incubation compared to 0 h of incubation for the control. The mitochondrial activity measurements supported the data on cell growth in Jurkat cells: The highest concentration of 500 microg/mL aKG + 166.7 microg/mL 5-HMF was able to reduce the mitochondrial activity over 24 h (58.9%), 48 h (28.7%), and 72 h (9.9%) of incubation with Jurkat cells compared not only to the control incubation, but also to the concentrations of 500 microg/mL aKG + 166.7 microg/mL 5-HMF or 375 microg/mL aKG 125 microg/mL 5-HMF, which were able to significantly reduce the mitochondrial activity after 48 h (28.7% or 35.1%) and 72 h (9.9% or 18.2%) compared to 24 h with the control (100%). A slight increase in cell proliferation was found in HF-SAR using the highest concentration (500 microg/mL aKG + 166.7 microg/mL 5-HMF) between 0 h and 72 h incubation of 140%, while no significant differences were found in the mitochondrial activity of HF-SAR in the absence or presence of several combined aKG + 5-HMF solutions.

Therefore, a fast diagnosis is needed for timely starting treatment. We developed a diagnostic algorithm using flow cytometric features for discrimination between acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and other types of acute myeloid leukemias (AML). (2) Methods: we analyzed newly diagnosed AMLs where immunophenotyping was performed at diagnosis by an 8-color protocol. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of each antigen used was assessed, and those best separating APL from other types of AML were obtained by a discriminant analysis. Phenotypic characteristics of myeloblasts of normal bone marrow were used as controls. (3) Results: 24 cases of APL and 56 cases of other primary AMLs entered the study. Among non-APL AMLs, 4 had fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 gene internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD) mutation, 2 had nucleophosmin (NPM1) and 10 had both mutations. SSC (p < 0.0001), HLA-DR (p < 0.0001), CD13 (p = 0.001), CD64 (p = 0.004) and CD33 (p = 0.002) were differentially expressed, but this was not the case for CD34 (50% of non-APLs had a low expression).

Primary prophylaxis using voriconazole has been shown to decrease the incidence of IFI. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis at the Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) unit of the American University of Beirut including 195 patients who underwent allo-HCT for hematological malignancies and received voriconazole as primary prophylaxis for IFI. The primary endpoints were based on the incidence of IFI at day 100 and day 180, and the secondary endpoint based on fungal-free survival. RESULTS: For the study, 195 patients who underwent allo-HCT between January 2015 and March 2021 were included. The median age at transplant was 43 years. Of the patients, 63% were male, and the majority of patients were diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (60%). Voriconazole was given for a median of 90 days and was interrupted in 20 patients. The majority of IFI cases were probable invasive aspergillosis (8%). The incidence of IFI including proven, probable and possible IFI was 34%. The incidence of proven and probable IFI was 5% were 8%, respectively. The incidence of proven-probable (PP-IFI) was 5.1% at day 100 and 6.6% at day 180. The majority of PP-IFI cases were invasive aspergillosis (8%). A univariate analysis of patients, transplant characteristics and IFI showed a significant correlation between the type of donor, disease status before transplant, graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis used and incidence of IFI. Only disease status post-transplant showed a significant correlation with fungal-free survival in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Primary prophylaxis with voriconazole in allo-HCT is associated with a low incidence of IFI.

The disadvantages of L-asparaginase, which restrict its industrial application, include its narrow range of pH stability and low thermostability. In this study, a novel L-asparaginase from Mycobacterium gordonae (GmASNase) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). GmASNase was found to be a tetramer with a monomeric size of 32 kDa, sharing only 32% structural identity with Helicobacter pylori L-asparaginases in the Protein Data Bank database. The purified GmASNase had the highest specific activity of 486.65 IU mg(-1) at pH 9.0 and 50 degrees C. In addition, GmASNase possessed superior properties in terms of stability at a wide pH range of 5.0-11.0 and activity at temperatures below 40 degrees C. Moreover, GmASNase displayed high substrate specificity towards L-asparagine with Km, kcat, and kcat/Km values of 6.025 mM, 11,864.71 min(-1) and 1969.25 mM(-1)min(-1), respectively. To evaluate its ability to mitigate acrylamide, GmASNase was used to treat potato chips prior to frying, where the acrylamide content decreased by 65.09% compared with the untreated control.

Our hypothesis has been based on the relation between B. rapa glucosinolate content and its healthy properties, and our aim is to establish guidelines for safe B. rapa vegetable consumption. Three B. rapa cultivars (143N5, 143N7 and 163N7) have been characterized by HPLC analysis of purified extracts from leaf samples in order to determine their glucosinolate content and to relate this content to beneficial effects on DNA protection, lifespan extension and chemoprevention. In order to ascertain the heath properties in vitro and in vivo, toxicity activities were assayed in the Drosophila melanogaster and leukaemia cell models; genomic safety was also assessed in both models using genotoxicity, fragmentation and comet assay. The Drosophila model has also been used to study the antioxidative activity and the longevity induction. Our results showed a relationship between B. rapa glucosinolate content and its safety and benefices in its consumption. Gluconapin, the main B. rapa glucosinolate, was directly related with these wholesome effects.

A retrospective case series included cats with diagnosis of FCGS, availability of detailed clinical records, full-mouth dental radiographs, and retroviral disease test results. Effectiveness of surgical treatment (EOT) was registered. Three groups were defined: control, FIV and FeLV. In this study, 111 cats were included: 60 controls, 29 FIV- and 22 FeLV-positive cats. When compared with control cases, FeLV-positive cats had significantly less proliferative stomatitis lesions, and they tended to have more lingual ulcers. Concurrently, FeLV-positive cats had significantly less tooth resorptive lesions. No other significant differences in FCGS clinical signs were found between groups. FeLV-positive cats had a significantly worse outcome after dental extractions compared to the other groups. In fact, FeLV-positive cats had 7.5 times more chances of having no improvement after dental extractions. This study concludes that the response to dental extractions in FeLV-positive cats is significantly worse, when comparing to cats that do not carry retroviral disease.

Predicted individual probabilities of COVID-19 hospitalization were then calculated for population risk stratification and vaccine prioritization and mapping. The leading COVID-19 hospitalization risk factors were non-white ethnicity, end-stage renal disease, advanced age, prior hospitalization, leukemia, morbid obesity, chronic kidney disease, lung cancer, chronic liver disease, pulmonary fibrosis or pulmonary hypertension, and chemotherapy. However, previously reported risk factors such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes conferred modest hospitalization risk.

Targeting BCR-ABL by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has changed fatal CML into an almost curable disease. Despite that, TKIs lose their effectiveness due to disease progression. Unfortunately, the mechanism of CML progression is poorly understood and common biomarkers for CML progression are unavailable. This study was conducted to find novel biomarkers of CML progression by employing whole-exome sequencing (WES). Materials and Methods: WES of accelerated phase (AP) and blast crisis (BC) CML patients was carried out, with chronic-phase CML (CP-CML) patients as control. After DNA library preparation and exome enrichment, clustering and sequencing were carried out using Illumina platforms. Statistical analysis was carried out using SAS/STAT software version 9.4, and R package was employed to find mutations shared exclusively by all AP-/BC-CML patients. Confirmation of mutations was carried out using Sanger sequencing and protein structure modeling using I-TASSER followed by mutant generation and visualization using PyMOL. Results: Three novel genes (ANKRD36, ANKRD36B and PRSS3) were mutated exclusively in all AP-/BC-CML patients. Only ANKRD36 gene mutations (c.1183_1184 delGC and c.1187_1185 dupTT) were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Protein modeling studies showed that mutations induce structural changes in ANKRD36 protein. Conclusions: Our studies show that ANKRD36 is a potential common biomarker and drug target of early CML progression. ANKRD36 is yet uncharacterized in humans. It has the highest expression in bone marrow, specifically myeloid cells. We recommend carrying out further studies to explore the role of ANKRD36 in the biology and progression of CML.",,"['Iqbal, Zafar', 'Absar, Muhammad', 'Akhtar, Tanveer', 'Aleem, Aamer', 'Jameel,

In approximately 50% of these cases, the mechanisms underlying this dysregulation are unknown. IKAROS Family Zinc Finger 1 (IKZF1) is a possible candidate to play a role in this dysregulation since it binds to the CRLF2 promoter region and suppresses its expression. We hypothesised that IKZF1 loss of function, caused by deletions or its short isoforms expression, could be associated with CRLF2 overexpression in B-ALL. A total of 131 paediatric and adult patients and 7 B-ALL cell lines were analysed to investigate the presence of IKZF1 deletions and its splicing isoforms expression levels, the presence of CRLF2 rearrangements or mutations, CRLF2 expression and JAK2 mutations. Overall survival analyses were performed according to the CRLF2 and IKZF1 subgroups. Our analyses showed that 25.2% of patients exhibited CRLF2 overexpression (CRLF2-high). CRLF2-high was associated with the presence of IKZF1 deletions (IKZF1del, p = 0.001), particularly with those resulting in dominant-negative isoforms (p = 0.006). Moreover, CRLF2 expression was higher in paediatric samples with high loads of the short isoform IK4 (p = 0.011). It was also associated with the occurrence of the IKZF1 plus subgroup (p = 0.004). Furthermore, patients with CRLF2-high/IKZF1del had a poorer prognosis in the RELLA05 protocol (p = 0.067, 36.1 months, 95%CI 0.0-85.9) and adult cohort (p = 0.094, 29.7 months, 95%CI 11.8-47.5). In this study, we show that IKZF1 status is associated with CRLF2-high and dismal outcomes in B-ALL patients regardless of age.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

However, increasing research on health inequities shows that these differences also extend to patients with haematological malignancies. In particular, Black and Hispanic patients with cancer have had markedly worse survival outcomes for several decades, although the need to critically evaluate and address these disparities has, for several compelling reasons, gained a greater sense of urgency. To effectively implement strategies to counteract barriers that underlie survival disparities and systemic racism, understanding the current state of survival outcomes for patients with haematological cancers who are racially or ethnically minoritised is important. In this Viewpoint, we review the specifics of outcome differences across haematological malignancies and investigate the contributions of race-associated differences in administration of treatment and genetic differences in underlying disease biology. We also provide our perspective on key actions that we feel are crucial for the haematology community to pursue to abrogate systemic racism and ensure fair and equitable care for all.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

However, because of their safety profile in this population, appropriate therapy has not been established. We aimed to investigate whether a lower than standard dose of dasatinib was an appropriate therapy for older patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia in the chronic phase. METHODS: DAsatinib, Very Low-dose, for Elderly CML-CP patients (DAVLEC) was a multicentre, single-arm, phase 2 trial done in 25 Japanese hospitals. We enrolled patients older than 70 years with newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukaemia in the chronic phase, ECOG performance status 0-2, and no previous treatment for CML other than hydroxyurea within 4 weeks. Second-generation TKI dasatinib was given orally at a starting dose of 20% of the standard dose (20 mg/day). If the treatment was assessed as optimal response at 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months and adverse events were grade 2 or better (according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria v 4.0), the same dose was continued. If response was suboptimal and adverse events were grade 2 or better, the dose was increased by 20 mg/day. Once a dose reduction had been made because of a grade 3 or worse adverse event, there were no further dose increases. Treatment was discontinued if assessed as failure (disease progression to the accelerated phase or acute phase). The primary endpoint was the achievement of major molecular response at 12 months, assessed using a per-protocol analysis. This trial is registered at with the UMIN clinical trial registry, UMIN000024548, and has completed its planned observation period. FINDINGS: Between Nov 1, 2016, and Oct 30, 2019, 52 patients received first-line dasatinib therapy at 20 mg/day. The median age at diagnosis was 77.5 years (73.5-83.0). 35 (67%) patients were male and 17 (33%) were female. 31 (60%) of 52 patients reached major molecular response at 12 months (one-sided 95% CI 48-71), with a median follow-up of 366 days (IQR 353-372). Grade 3-4 adverse events were reported in 12 (23%) patients. Neutropenia was the most frequent grade 3-4 adverse event, occurring in three (6%) patients. No treatment-related deaths were observed. INTERPRETATION: Low-dose dasatinib at 20mg/day is worthy of consideration as a starting dose for older patients with newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukaemia in the chronic phase. However, this dose needs to be further studied in a larger cohort and with a more ethnically diverse population. FUNDING: Bristol-Myers Squibb.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS: This multicenter, investigator-initiated, single-arm, phase 2 trial took place at two two academic medical centres in the USA. Patients were eligible for the primary cohort if they had treatment-naive chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma, required therapy, and were at least 18 years of age with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status up to 2. BOVen was administered in 28 day cycles (oral zanubrutinib at 160 mg twice per day starting in cycle 1 on day 1; intravenous obinutuzumab at 1000 mg on day 1 [split over day 1 with 100 mg and day 2 with 900 mg for an absolute lymphocyte count >25 000 cells per muL or lymph nodes >5 cm in diameter], day 8, and day 15 of cycle 1, and day 1 of cycles 2-8; and oral venetoclax ramp up to 400 mg per day starting in cycle 3 on day 1) and discontinued after 8-24 cycles when prespecified undetectable MRD criteria were met in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients that reached undetectable MRD in both the peripheral blood and bone marrow (flow cytometry cutoff less than one chronic lymphocytic leukaemia cell per 10 000 leukocytes [<10(-4)]) assessed per protocol. This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03824483). The primary cohort is closed to recruitment, and recruitment continues in the TP53-mutated mantle cell lymphoma cohort. FINDINGS: Between March 14, 2019, and Oct 10, 2019, 47 patients were screened for eligibility, and 39 patients were enrolled and treated. Median age was 62 years (IQR 52-70) with 30 (77%) of 39 male participants and nine (23%) of 39 female participants. 28 (72%) of 39 patients had unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable-region and five (13%) of 39 had 17p deletion or TP53 mutation. After a median follow-up of 25.8 months (IQR 24.0-27.3), 33 (89%) of 37 patients (95% CI 75-97) had undetectable MRD in both blood and bone marrow, meeting the prespecified undetectable MRD criteria to stop therapy after a median of ten cycles (IQR 8-12), which includes two cycles of zanubrutinib and obinutuzumab before starting venetoclax. After median surveillance after treatment of 15.8 months (IQR 13.0-18.6), 31 (94%) of 33 patients had undetectable MRD. The most common adverse events were thrombocytopenia (23 [59%] of 39), fatigue (21 [54%]), neutropenia (20 [51%]), and bruising (20 [51%]), and the most common adverse event at grade 3 or worse was neutropenia (seven [18%]) in the intention-to-treat population. One death occurred in a patient with intracranial haemorrhage on day 1 of cycle 1 after initiating intravenous heparin for pulmonary emboli. INTERPRETATION: BOVen was well tolerated and met its primary endpoint, with 33 (89%) of 37 previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma reaching undetectable MRD in both peripheral blood and bone marrow despite a median treatment duration of only 10 months, owing to our undetectable MRD-driven treatment discontinuation design. These data support further evaluation of the BOVen regimen in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma with treatment duration guided by early MRD response kinetics.

A novel purine nucleoside analogue, nelarabine, is available for the treatment of children with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We investigated the mechanisms of drug resistance to nelarabine. METHODS: Nelarabine-resistant cells were selected by stepwise and continuous exposure to nelarabine using the limiting dilution method in human B and T cell lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines. Expression analysis was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction, and epigenetic analysis was performed using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction and chromatin immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: The RNA expression level for deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) was decreased in nelarabine-resistant leukemia cells. There were no differences between the parental and nelarabine-resistant leukemia cells in the methylation status of the promoter region of the dCK gene. In the chromatin immune precipitation assay, decreased acetylation of histones H3 and H4 bound to the dCK promoter was seen in the nelarabine-resistant cells when compared to the parental cells. Furthermore, treatment with a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor, vorinostat, promoted the cytotoxic effect of nelarabine along with increased expression of the dCK gene, and it increased acetylation of both histones H3 and H4 bound to the dCK promoter in nelarabine-resistant leukemia cells.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play crucial roles in AML progression. This study aimed to explore the function and potential mechanism of circRNA Scm like with four mbt domains 2 (circ-SFMBT2; hsa_circ_0017639) in AML. METHODS: The levels of circ-SFMBT2, microRNA-582-3p (miR-582-3p) and zinc finger and BTB domain containing 20 (ZBTB20) were measured by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), colony formation, flow cytometry and transwell assays were used to evaluate cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion. Glycolysis was assessed by detecting glucose consumption, lactate production and ATP/ADP ratios. The related protein expression was examined by Western blot. The binding relationship between miR-582-3p and circ-SFMBT2/ZBTB20 was verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS: Circ-SFMBT2 and ZBTB20 levels were elevated, while miR-582-3p level was reduced in AML patients and cells. Depletion of circ-SFMBT2/ZBTB20 impeded proliferation, migration, invasion and glycolysis and induced apoptosis in AML cells. Moreover, circ-SFMBT2 facilitated AML progression by sponging miR-582-3p, and miR-582-3p targeted ZBTB20 to hinder AML development. CONCLUSION: Knockdown of circ-SFMBT2 suppressed AML progression by regulating the miR-582-3p/ZBTB20 axis, which might provide a potential therapeutic strategy for AML.",,"['Chang, Wei', 'Shang, Zhen', 'Ming, Xi', 'Wu, Jiaying', 'Xiao, Yi']","['Chang W', 'Shang Z', 'Ming X', 'Wu J', 'Xiao Y']","['Department of Hematology, Puren Hospital Affiliated to Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. yixiao@tjh.tjmu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211126,Spain,Histol Histopathol,Histology and histopathology,8609357,IM,,2021/11/27 06:00,2021/11/27 06:00,['2021/11/26 08:42'],"['2021/11/26 08:42 [entrez]', '2021/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/27 06:00 [medline]']","['HH-18-398 [pii]', '10.14670/HH-18-398 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Histol Histopathol. 2021 Nov 26:18398. doi: 10.14670/HH-18-398.,,"['81873444/Natural Science Foundation of China', '82070213/Natural Science Foundation of China', '2020BCB021/Key R&D Projects of Hubei Province']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are no well-defined predictive factors for benefit from lenalidomide in AML. One of the mechanisms of lenalidomide is natural killer (NK) cell activation; hence human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I alleles (serving as killer immunoglobulin-like receptor ligands) could play a predictive role. We here evaluate the same when lenalidomide was used as a bridge to transplant. METHODS: Consecutive AML patients started on lenalidomide as bridge to transplant between Aug-2013 to Aug-2018 were included in this single centre retrospective analysis. The starting dose and schedule of lenalidomide were at the discretion of the treating clinician. Lenalidomide was scheduled to be stopped about 2-4 weeks prior to planned transplant admission (or was stopped earlier if there was intolerance). For this study, event was defined as progression/relapse while on lenalidomide or within 4 weeks of stopping the drug. The primary endpoint was event free survival (EFS). Those who underwent transplant without an event were censored on the day of transplant. Toxicities and post-transplant outcomes were secondary endpoints. RESULTS: Twelve patients (8 males, median age 29 years) were included. At start of lenalidomide, 7 had complete remission (CR)-1 (measurable residual disease or MRD by flow cytometry was positive in 3, negative in 3, and 1 unknown), 4 CR-2 (all MRD negative) and 1 active disease. In the whole cohort, median EFS was not reached with projected 3 year EFS being 80%. There was a significantly reduced risk of event with HLA A*24 (0% vs 75%, P=0.018) or with HLA B*40 (0% vs 60%, P=0.045). Only 1 patient needed discontinuation due to toxicities (cytopenias). Among patients who underwent transplant, grade II-IV acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) was seen in 83%. CONCLUSIONS: This is first study to show that HLA alleles may have a bearing on the effect of lenalidomide in AML and could serve as predictive biomarkers.

Mitochondrial DNA alterations are well known in pediatric AML with possible prognostic significance; however, mitochondrial complex activity and its impact on disease outcome have not been previously explored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the mitochondrial complex II and complex V activity and its prognostic significance in pediatric AML patients. METHODS: Consecutive 82 de novo pediatric (</=18 years) patients with AML were included in the study along with age and sex matched controls. Bone marrow mononuclear cells were isolated from baseline bone marrow samples from all patients and controls. DNA, RNA and proteins were extracted and relative expression of mitochondrial biogenesis genes TFAM, POLG, POLRMT were estimated along with mitochondrial DNA copy number. The mitochondrial complex II and V enzymes were immunocaptured and their activity was measured by substrate specific absorbance change by kinetic ELISA. The mitochondrial complex II and V activity was compared with controls and their association with clinico-pathological features and survival outcome were analysed. Complex activity was also correlated with relative expression of biogenesis genes. RESULTS: The activity of mitochondrial complex II and V were found to be significantly enhanced (P = 0.010 and P = 0.0013 respectively) in pediatric AML patients compared to controls. The activity of mitochondrial complex II and V showed significant positive correlation with relative gene expression of mitochondrial biogenesis genes TFAM (P = 0.001 and P = 0.016 respectively) and POLG (P = 0.005 and P = 0.006 respectively). Neither of the two complex activities showed any significant association with baseline disease demographics or any clinico-pathological feature. Furthermore, the complex II and V activity did not show any impact on event free survival (P = 0.25 and P = 0.24 respectively) and overall survival (P = 0.14 and P = 0.17 respectively) in our cohort. CONCLUSION: The activity of both mitochondrial complex II and V are significantly elevated in bone marrow mononuclear cells of children with AML compared to controls. The enhanced activity may be related to upregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis genes TFAM and POLG. The enhanced activity of either of the complexes did not impact disease biology or survival outcomes in pediatric AML.",['AJBR Copyright (c) 2021.'],"['Chaudhary, Shilpi', 'Ganguly, Shuvadeep', 'Singh, Archna', 'Palanichamy, Jayanth Kumar', 'Chopra, Anita', 'Bakhshi, Radhika', 'Bakhshi, Sameer']","['Chaudhary S', 'Ganguly S', 'Singh A', 'Palanichamy JK', 'Chopra A', 'Bakhshi R', 'Bakhshi S']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dr. B.R.A.

AML can arise de novo (dn-AML) or can be secondary AML (s-AML) refers to a leukemic process which may arise from an antecedent hematologic disorder (AHD-AML), mostly from a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) or can be the result of an antecedent cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation therapy (therapy-related AML, t-AML). Clinical and biological features in secondary and therapy-related AML are distinct from de novo AML. Secondary and therapy-related AML occurs mainly in the elderly population and responds worse to therapy with higher relapse rates due to resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Over the last decade, advances in molecular genetics have disclosed the sub-clonal architecture of secondary and therapy-related AML. Recent investigations have revealed that cytogenetic abnormalities and underlying genetic aberrations (mutations) are likely to be significant factors dictating prognosis and critical impacts on treatment outcome. Secondary and therapy-related AML have a poorer outcome with adverse cytogenetic abnormalities and higher recurrences of unfavorable mutations compared to de novo AML. In this review, we present an overview of the clinical features of secondary and therapy-related AML and address the function of genetic mutations implicated in the pathogenesis of secondary leukemia. Detailed knowledge of the pathogenetic mechanisms gives an overview of new prognostic markers, including targetable mutations that will presumably lead to the designing and developing novel molecular targeted therapies for secondary and therapy-related AML. Despite significant advances in knowing the genetic aspect of secondary and therapy-related AML, its influence on the disease's pathophysiology, standard treatment prospects have not significantly evolved during the past three decades.

This study aimed to develop a frailty assessment tool based on clinical data and to estimate its feasibility in elderly patients with MM. This study analyzed data from 728 elderly transplant-ineligible patients with newly diagnosed MM who were treated between January 2010 and October 2019. Our clinical frailty index included age (< 75, and >/= 75 years), Charlson comorbidity index (CCI; < 3 and >/= 3), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score (ECOG score; 0, 1-2, and >/= 3). Patients were classified as fit, intermediate, or frail if they had a score of 0, 1, or >/= 2, respectively. The overall survival rates differed significantly according to frailty (fit vs. intermediate: hazard ratio [HR] = 2.41; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.43-4.06; P = 0.001; fit vs. frail: HR = 4.61; 95% CI = 2.74-7.77; P < 0.001 and intermediate vs. frail: HR = 1.91, 95% CI = 1.49-2.45, P < 0.001, respectively). The frail had significantly shorter EFS compared with the fit and intermediate group in our frailty index (fit vs. intermediate: HR = 1.34, 95% CI = 0.92-1.96, P = 0.132; fit vs. frail: HR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.40-3.02, P < 0.001; and intermediate vs. frail: HR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.22-1.92, P < 0.001, respectively).

Infant-ALL is usually caused by a single genetic hit that arises in utero: an MLL/KMT2A gene rearrangement (MLL-r). This is sufficient to induce a uniquely aggressive and treatment-refractory leukemia compared to older children. The reasons for disparate outcomes in patients of different ages with identical driver mutations are unknown. Using the most common MLL-r in infant-ALL, MLL-AF4, as a disease model, we show that fetal-specific gene expression programs are maintained in MLL-AF4 infant-ALL but not in MLL-AF4 childhood-ALL. We use CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing of primary human fetal liver hematopoietic cells to produce a t(4;11)/MLL-AF4 translocation, which replicates the clinical features of infant-ALL and drives infant-ALL-specific and fetal-specific gene expression programs. These data support the hypothesis that fetal-specific gene expression programs cooperate with MLL-AF4 to initiate and maintain the distinct biology of infant-ALL.",['(c) 2021.

We use single-cell transcriptomics/proteomics to identify differentially expressed gene networks across B cell development and correlate these networks with subtypes of B cell leukemia. Here we show unique transcriptional signatures that refine the pre-B cell expansion stages into pre-BCR-dependent and pre-BCR-independent proliferative phases. These changes correlate with reciprocal changes in expression of the transcription factor EBF1 and the RNA binding protein YBX3, that are defining features of the pre-BCR-dependent stage.

However, most PROTACs have been generated empirically because many determinants of PROTAC specificity and activity remain elusive. Through computational modelling of the entire NEDD8-VHL Cullin RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL(VHL))/PROTAC/BCL-xL/UbcH5B(E2)-Ub/RBX1 complex, we find that this complex can only ubiquitinate the lysines in a defined band region on BCL-xL. Using this approach to guide our development of a series of ABT263-derived and VHL-recruiting PROTACs, we generate a potent BCL-xL and BCL-2 (BCL-xL/2) dual degrader with significantly improved antitumor activity against BCL-xL/2-dependent leukemia cells. Our results provide experimental evidence that the accessibility of lysines on a target protein plays an important role in determining the selectivity and potency of a PROTAC in inducing protein degradation, which may serve as a conceptual framework to guide the future development of PROTACs.",['(c) 2021.

In light of recent advances in single-cell technologies, we sought to redefine the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape of mouse and human hematopoietic stem cells under telomere attrition, as induced by pathogenic germline variants in telomerase complex genes. Here, we show that telomere attrition maintains hematopoietic stem cells under persistent metabolic activation and differentiation towards the megakaryocytic lineage through the cell-intrinsic upregulation of the innate immune signaling response, which directly compromises hematopoietic stem cells' self-renewal capabilities and eventually leads to their exhaustion. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that targeting members of the Ifi20x/IFI16 family of cytosolic DNA sensors using the oligodeoxynucleotide A151, which comprises four repeats of the TTAGGG motif of the telomeric DNA, overcomes interferon signaling activation in telomere-dysfunctional hematopoietic stem cells and these cells' skewed differentiation towards the megakaryocytic lineage. This study challenges the historical hypothesis that telomere attrition limits the proliferative potential of hematopoietic stem cells by inducing apoptosis, autophagy, or senescence, and suggests that targeting IFI16 signaling axis might prevent hematopoietic stem cell functional decline in conditions affecting telomere maintenance.",['(c) 2021.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: The records of seventy-nine Iraqi patients diagnosed with non-promyelocytic AML, who underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation outside of Iraq between 2012 and 2019, had been reviewed. The information had been collected from the data available in Bone Marrow Transplant Centre in Baghdad Medical City. Overall survival had been calculated by Kaplan-Meier Method. Patients included in the study are those who were diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia according to French American British classes with the exclusion of acute promyelocytic leukemia (M3), who were allotransplanted for being diagnosed with high risk cytogenetic, refractory to chemotherapeutic regimen, relapsed after achieving complete remission, secondary to transformation from other myeloid malignancies or remaining with positive measurable residual disease after treatment. RESULTS: Results: The overall survival for 1 year, 2 years and 3 years were 63.20%, 55.09% and 46.58% respectively. The pre-transplanted factors found, no significant difference in overall survival regarding age, gender, extra medullary involvement. The transplant related criteria like stem cell source, presence of infection and type of conditioning regimen and incidence of any post-transplant complications do not predict overall survival apart from chronic graft versus host disease.

Protein kinase enzyme mutation results in abnormal cell division leading to a pathological condition like cancer. Tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitors, which helps as a potential drug candidate for the treatment of cancer, are continuously being developed. Majority of these drug candidates are being administered as conventional oral dosage form, which provides limited safety and efficacy due to non-specific delivery and uncontrolled biodistribution resulting into the adverse effects. A controlled drug delivery approach for the delivery of TK inhibitors may be a potential strategy with significant safety and efficacy profile. Novel drug delivery strategies provide target-specific drug delivery, improved pharmacokinetic behaviour, and sustained release leading to lower doses and dosing frequency with significantly reduced side effects. Along with basic aspects of tyrosine kinase, this review discusses various aspects related to the application of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in clinical oncological setting. Furthermore, the limitations/challenges and formulation advancements related to this class of candidates particularly for cancer management have been reviewed. It is expected that innovations in drug delivery approaches for TK inhibitors using novel techniques will surely provide a new insights for improved cancer treatment and patients' life quality.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Societe francaise de pharmacologie et de therapeutique.', 'Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase is an enzyme originally found in Enterobacteriaceae. CASE PRESENTATION: In this study, 80 isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were collected over the course of 2 years from two medical centers in Tehran, Iran. Production of carbapenemase was detected in the isolates using modified Hodge test. New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction amplification with specific primers. Two New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1-producing Escherichia coli strains were isolated from two Iranian patients with leukemia. These two patients were 6 and 15 years old, one female and the other male, from two oncology centers in Iran. The isolates were resistant to carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem), and two isolates were positive for carbapenemase production by modified Hodge test.

The aim of the present study was to establish a novel GC-resistant B-ALL cell line and investigate its biological characteristics. METHODS: A cell culture technique was used to establish the GC-resistant cell line from the parental cell, NALM-6. Molecular and cellular biological techniques including flow cytometry, MTT assay, western blotting, DNA fingerprinting analysis and whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS) were used to characterize the GC-resistant cell lines. Nude mice were used for xenograft studies. RESULTS: The GC-resistant cell line, NALM-6/HDR, was established by culturing NALM-6 cells under hypoxia for 5 weeks with a single dexamethasone (Dex) treatment. We subcloned the NALM-6/HDR cell lines, and got 6 monoclone Dex-resistant cell lines, NALM-6/HDR-C1, C3, C4, C5, C6 and C9 with resistance index (RI) ranging from 20,000-50,000. NALM-6/HDR and its monoclone cell line, NALM-6/HDR-C5, exhibited moderate (RI 5-15) to high resistance (RI > 20) to Ara-c; low or no cross-resistance to L-Asp, VCR, DNR, and MTX (RI < 5). STR analysis confirmed that NALM-6/HDR and NALM-6/H were all derived from NALM-6. All these cells derived from NALM-6 showed similar morphology, growth curves, immunophenotype, chromosomal karyotype and tumorigenicity. WTS analysis revealed that the main metabolic differences between NALM-6 or NALM-6/H (GC-sensitive) and NALM-6/HDR (GC-resistant) were lipid and carbohydrates metabolism. Western blotting analysis showed that NALM-6/HDR cells had a low expression of GR and p-GR. Moreover, AMPK, mTORC1, glycolysis and de novo fatty acid synthesis (FAS) pathway were inhibited in NALM-6/HDR when compared with NALM-6. CONCLUSIONS: NALM-6/HDR cell line may represent a subtype of B-ALL cells in patients who acquired GC and Ara-c resistance during the treatment. These patients may get little benefit from the available therapy target of AMPK, mTORC1, glycolysis and FAS pathway.",['(c) 2021.

PCR positivity of their colostrum and the correlations between the ratios of calves with BLV and types of feeding milk were analyzed. In dams with low PVLs, no colostrum or calves were confirmed to have BLV. In dams with middle and high PVLs, 17 out of 25 (68.0%) colostrum were PCR positive, and 10 out of 23 (43.4%) and 13 out of 29 (44.8%) calves with natural suckling and artificial rearing were infected with BLV, respectively.

The first aim was to propose a contour-based estimation of T1 and T2 relaxation times based on the myocardial area, while our second aim was to evaluate native T1, post-gadolinium T1 and T2 relaxation time sensitivity to detect myocardial changes. A total of 84 childhood ALL survivors were stratified in regard to their prognostic risk groups: standard risk (SR), n = 20), high-risk with and without dexrazoxane (HR + DEX, n = 39 and HR, n = 25). Survivors' mean age was of 22.0 +/- 6.9 years, with a mean age at cancer diagnosis of 8.0 +/- 5.2 years. CMR acquisitions were performed on a 3 T MRI system and included an ECG-gated 3(3)3(3)5 MOLLI sequence for T1 mapping and an ECG-gated T2-prepared TrueFISP sequence for T2 mapping. Myocardial contours were semi-automatically segmented using an interactive implementation of cubic Bezier curves. We found excellent repeatability between operators for native T1 (ICC = 0.91), and good repeatability between operators for post-gadolinium T1 (ICC = 0.84) and T2 (ICC = 0.79). Bland and Altman tests demonstrated a strong agreement between our contour-based method and images analyzed using the CVI42 software on the measure of native T1, post-gadolinium T1, and T2. No significant differences between survivors' prognostic risk groups in native T1 were reported, while we observed significant differences between survivors' prognostic risk groups in post-gadolinium T1 and T2. Significant differences were observed between male and female survivors. Differences between groups were also observed in partition coefficients, but no significant differences were observed between male and female survivors. The use of CMR parameters with native T1, post-gadolinium T1, and T2 allowed to show that survivors at a high-risk prognostic were more exposed to doxorubicin-related cardiotoxicity than those who were at a standard risk prognostic or who received dexrazoxane treatments.","['(c) 2021.

They regulate post-transcriptional gene expression by binding to the 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) of messenger RNAs (mRNAs). MitomiRs are miRNAs of nuclear or mitochondrial origin that are localized in mitochondria and have a crucial role in regulation of mitochondrial function and metabolism. In eukaryotes, mitochondria are the major sites of oxidative metabolism of sugars, lipids, amino acids, and other bio-macromolecules. They are also the main sites of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. CONCLUSIONS: In the review, we discuss the role of mitomiRs in mitochondria and introduce currently well studied mitomiRs, their target genes and functions. We also discuss their role in cancer initiation and progression through the regulation of mRNA expression in mitochondria. MitomiRs directly target key molecules such as transporters or enzymes in cell metabolism and regulate several oncogenic signaling pathways. They also play an important role in the Warburg effect, which is vital for cancer cells to maintain their proliferative potential. In addition, we discuss how they indirectly upregulate hexokinase 2 (HK2), an enzyme involved in glucose phosphorylation, and thus may affect energy metabolism in breast cancer cells. In tumor tissues such as breast cancer and head and neck tumors, the expression of one of the mitomiRs (miR-210) correlates with hypoxia gene signatures, suggesting a direct link between mitomiR expression and hypoxia in cancer. The miR-17/92 cluster has been shown to act as a key factor in metabolic reprogramming of tumors by regulating glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism. This cluster is deregulated in B-cell lymphomas, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and T-cell lymphomas, and is particularly overexpressed in several other cancers. Based on the current knowledge, we can conclude that there is a large number of miRNAs present in mitochondria, termed mitomiR, and that they are important regulators of mitochondrial function. Therefore, mitomiRs are important players in the metabolism of cancer cells, which need to be further investigated in order to develop a potential new therapies for cancer.","['(c) 2021 Andrej Rencelj, Nada Gvozdenovic, Maja Cemazar, published by Sciendo.']","['Rencelj, Andrej', 'Gvozdenovic, Nada', 'Cemazar, Maja']","['Rencelj A', 'Gvozdenovic N', 'Cemazar M']","['Institute of Oncology Ljubljana, Department of Experimental Oncology, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Institute of Oncology Ljubljana, Department of Experimental Oncology, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Institute of Oncology Ljubljana, Department of Experimental Oncology, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Primorska, Izola, Slovenia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20211119,Poland,Radiol Oncol,Radiology and oncology,9317213,IM,,2021/11/26 06:00,2021/11/26 06:00,['2021/11/25 07:10'],"['2021/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/25 07:10 [entrez]', '2021/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/26 06:00 [medline]']","['raon-2021-0042 [pii]', '10.2478/raon-2021-0042 [doi]']",epublish,Radiol Oncol. 2021 Nov 19;55(4):379-392. doi: 10.2478/raon-2021-0042.,,,PMC8647792,['NOTNLM'],"['*cancer', '*cancer cell metabolism', '*microRNAs', '*mitochondria', '*mitomiR']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients have a low survival rate and a high recurrence rate, and AML is a highly heterogeneous disease without an effective and specific targeted therapy. AIMS: Therefore, it is urgent to explore new AML markers to enable early diagnosis and find drug targets for individualized treatment. RESULTS: Herein, we demonstrate that O-linked-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT) is significantly upregulated in AML tissues compared with normal tissues. The high level of OGT expression is significantly related to poor overall survival (OS) in AML. Inhibition of OGT can inhibit AML cell proliferation and promote AML cell apoptosis. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that OGT plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AML, and may become a potential biomarker and molecular drug target for precision therapy for AML.","['(c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.']","['He, Na', 'Ma, Daoxin', 'Tan, Yanjie', 'Liu, Min']","['He N', 'Ma D', 'Tan Y', 'Liu M']","['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Resistance Biology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Cell Biology in Universities of Shandong, College of Life Sciences, Shandong Normal University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Resistance Biology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Cell Biology in Universities of Shandong, College of Life Sciences, Shandong Normal University, Jinan, China.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Resistance Biology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Cell Biology in Universities of Shandong, College of Life Sciences, Shandong Normal University, Jinan, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211124,Australia,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol,Asia-Pacific journal of clinical oncology,101241430,IM,,2021/11/26 06:00,2021/11/26 06:00,['2021/11/25 07:08'],"['2021/09/14 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/25 07:08 [entrez]', '2021/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ajco.13685 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol. 2021 Nov 24. doi: 10.1111/ajco.13685.,,['20161201/Taishan Scholars Program of Shandong Province'],,['NOTNLM'],"['O-GlcNAc transferase', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'cell proliferation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the apoptosis-inducing ability of TRAIL is weaker than expected primarily due to cancer cell resistance. As one of the dietary flavonoids, kaempferol, has been shown to be antiproliferative and might have a protective effect against TRAIL resistance, particularly for hematologic malignancies. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we studied the potential of kaempferol to enhance the TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell line K-562, as well as the expression of specific genes with impact on TRAIL signal regulation. Analysis of flowcytometry data showed that treatment with kaempferol did enhance sensitivity of CML cells to pro-apoptotic effects of anti-TRAIL antibody. Although the gene expression levels were heterogeneous, cFLIP, cIAP1 and cIAP2 expression were generally downregulated where co-treatment of kaempferol and TRAIL was employed and these effects appeared to be dose-dependent. We further demonstrated that the expression of death receptors 4 and 5 tended to increase subsequent to the combination treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Consequently, it is reasonable to conclude that sensitization of chronic leukemia cells to TRAIL by kaempferol in vitro should be considered as a way of focusing clinical attention on leukemia therapy.","['(c) 2021.

Endowed with these features, they represent attractive effectors for immuno-therapeutic strategies with a better safety profile and a more favorable anti-tumor efficacy in comparison to conventional alphabeta T cells. Also, remarkable progress has been achieved re-activating exhausted T lymphocytes with inhibitors of co-regulatory receptors e.g., programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT) and of the adenosine pathway (CD39, CD73). Regarding gammadelta T cells, little evidence is available. This study aimed to immunophenotypically characterize gammadelta T cells from patients with diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in comparison to patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and healthy donors (HD). Methods: The frequency, differentiation, activation, and exhaustion status of bone marrow- (BM) derived gammadelta T cells from patients with AML (n = 10) and MM (n = 11) were assessed in comparison to corresponding CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and peripheral blood- (PB) derived gammadelta T cells from HDs (n = 16) using multiparameter flow cytometry. Results: BM-infiltrating Vdelta1 T cells showed an increased terminally differentiated cell population (TEMRAs) in AML and MM in comparison to HDs with an aberrant subpopulation of CD27(-)CD45RA(++) cells. TIGIT, PD-1, TIM-3, and CD39 were more frequently expressed by gammadelta T cells in comparison to the corresponding CD4(+) T cell population, with expression levels that were similar to that on CD8(+) effector cells in both hematologic malignancies. In comparison to Vdelta2 T cells, the increased frequency of PD-1(+)-, TIGIT(+)-, TIM-3(+), and CD39(+) cells was specifically observed on Vdelta1 T cells and related to the TEMRA Vdelta1 population with a significant co-expression of PD-1 and TIM-3 together with TIGIT. Conclusion: Our results revealed that BM-resident gammadelta T cells in AML and MM express TIGIT, PD-1, TIM-3 and CD39. As effector population for autologous and allogeneic strategies, inhibition of co-inhibitory receptors on especially Vdelta1 gammadelta T cells may lead to re-invigoration that could further increase their cytotoxic potential.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Brauneck, Weimer, Schulze zur Wiesch, Weisel, Leypoldt,', 'Vohwinkel, Fritzsche, Bokemeyer, Wellbrock and Fiedler.']","['Brauneck, Franziska', 'Weimer, Pauline', 'Schulze Zur Wiesch, Julian', 'Weisel, Katja', 'Leypoldt, Lisa', 'Vohwinkel, Gabi', 'Fritzsche, Britta', 'Bokemeyer, Carsten', 'Wellbrock, Jasmin', 'Fiedler, Walter']","['Brauneck F', 'Weimer P', 'Schulze Zur Wiesch J', 'Weisel K', 'Leypoldt L', 'Vohwinkel G', 'Fritzsche B', 'Bokemeyer C', 'Wellbrock J', 'Fiedler W']","['Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation With Section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation With Section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Infectious Diseases Unit, I.

As a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, sorafenib is clinically used for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), with its preclinical and clinical activity demonstrated in the treatment of Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) mutant AML. Even though it shows a rosy future in the AML treatment, the short response duration remains a vital problem that leads to treatment failure. Rapid onset of drug resistance is still a thorny problem that we cannot overlook. Although the mechanisms of drug resistance have been studied extensively in the past years, there is still no consensus on the exact reason for resistance and without effective therapeutic regimens established clinically. My previous work reported that sorafenib-resistant FLT3-ITD mutant AML cells displayed mitochondria dysfunction, which rendered cells depending on glycolysis for energy supply. In my present one, we further illustrated that losing the target protein FLT3 and the continuously activated PI3K/Akt signaling pathway may be the reason for drug resistance, with sustained activation of PI3K/AKT signaling responsible for the highly glycolytic activity and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation. PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, can block PI3K/AKT signaling, further inhibit glycolysis to disturb ATP production, and finally induce cell apoptosis. This finding would pave the way to remedy the FLT3-ITD mutant AML patients who failed with FLT3 targeted therapy.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Huang, Zeng, Li, Lu and Lai.']","['Huang, Amin', 'Zeng, Peiting', 'Li, Yinguang', 'Lu, Wenhua', 'Lai, Yaoming']","['Huang A', 'Zeng P', 'Li Y', 'Lu W', 'Lai Y']","['Department of Medical Oncology of the East Division, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the East Division, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Rehabilitation, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211108,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.

It has been reported to exert a variety of anti-cancer properties. In the present study, the potential effects of isoliensinine on cervical cancer Siha, HeLa, Caski and C33A cell lines were investigated by using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), flow cytometry, western blotting and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) to measure cell proliferation, the cell cycle and apoptosis, in addition to elucidating the underlying molecular mechanism. Protein levels of p21, CDK2, Cyclin E, Mcl-1, cleaved Caspase-9, AKT, phosphorylated-AKT, glycogen synthase kinase (Gsk)3alpha, PTEN, and mRNA levels of p21, p15, p27, CDK2, CDK4, Cyclin E, Cyclin D, Gsk3alpha, Gsk3beta and PTEN were measured. Molecular docking assays were used to calculate the strength of binding of isoliensinine to AKT using AutoDock 4.0. Isoliensinine was found to induce cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase by upregulating p21 expression and downregulating CDK2 and cyclin E in breast cancer cells. In addition, in previous research, isoliensinine promoted cell apoptosis by downregulating myeloid-cell leukemia 1 expression and activating caspase-9. Upstream, isoliensinine significantly downregulated AKT (S473) phosphorylation and GSK3alpha expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The AKT inhibitor AKTi-1/2 enhanced the function of isoliensinine on cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through the AKT/GSK3alpha pathway. AutoDock analysis showed that isoliensinine can bind to the AKT protein. These findings suggest that isoliensinine can induce cervical cancer cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by inhibiting the AKT/GSK3alpha pathway, which represents a novel strategy for the treatment of cervical cancer.",['Copyright: (c) Li et al.'],"['Li, Hong-Li', 'Cheng, Yan', 'Zhou, Zi-Wei', 'Long, Hui-Zhi', 'Luo, Hong-Yu', 'Wen, Dan-Dan', 'Cheng, Lin', 'Gao, Li-Chen']","['Li HL', 'Cheng Y', 'Zhou ZW', 'Long HZ', 'Luo HY', 'Wen DD', 'Cheng L', 'Gao LC']","['Department of Pharmacy, Cancer Institute, Phase I Clinical Trial Centre, Changsha Central Hospital Affiliated to University of South China, School of Pharmacy, University of South China, Changsha, Hunan 410000, P.R.

A recently published review by Heiney et al reported inconclusive findings on the effects of a broad range of adherence enhancing interventions. The current systematic review aimed to identify studies that evaluated adherence-enhancing interventions implemented by healthcare professionals and determine their effect on CML patients' medication adherence and clinical outcomes. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed in 5 databases for articles published between 2002 and 2021. Studies that compared adherence enhancing interventions implemented by healthcare professionals with a comparison group were included. Relevant data on study characteristics were extracted. Medication adherence and clinical outcomes between intervention and control arms were compared. Results: Nine studies were included in two randomised controlled trials, four cohort studies, and three before-and-after comparison studies. All the included studies incorporated complex interventions, including intensive education or consultation with pharmacists, nurses or multidisciplinary team, in combination with one or more other strategies such as structured follow-up, written materials or video, psychotherapy, medication reminder or treatment diary, with the overall goal of monitoring and improving TKI adherence. Most (7 out of 9) studies demonstrated significantly better adherence to TKIs in the intervention group than the comparison group. The relative proportion of participants who adhered to TKIs ranged from 1.22 to 2.42. The improvement in the rate of TKI doses taken/received ranged from 1.5% to 7.1%. Only one study showed a significant association between intervention and clinical outcomes, with a 22.6% higher major molecular response rate and improvement in 6 out of 20 subscales of health-related quality-of-life. Conclusion: Complex interventions delivered by healthcare professionals showed improvement in adherence to TKIs in CML patients. Further studies are required to clarify the cost-effectiveness of adherence-enhancing interventions.",['(c) 2021 Tan et al.'],"['Tan, Bee Kim', 'Bee, Ping Chong', 'Chua, Siew Siang', 'Chen, Li-Chia']","['Tan BK', 'Bee PC', 'Chua SS', 'Chen LC']","[""School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, Taylor's University, Subang Jaya, Selangor, 47500, Malaysia."", 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, 50603, Malaysia.', ""School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, Taylor's University, Subang Jaya, Selangor, 47500, Malaysia."", 'Centre for Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety, Division of Pharmacy and Optometry, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester, M13 9PT, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211118,New Zealand,Patient Prefer Adherence,Patient preference and adherence,101475748,,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],2021/11/26 06:00,2021/11/26 06:01,['2021/11/25 06:31'],"['2021/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/25 06:31 [entrez]', '2021/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/26 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/PPA.S269355 [doi]', '269355 [pii]']",epublish,Patient Prefer Adherence. 2021 Nov 18;15:2563-2575. doi: 10.2147/PPA.S269355. eCollection 2021.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-6158-6645'],,PMC8608409,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic myeloid leukemia', 'complex interventions', 'medication adherence', 'systematic review', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, authors developed a laboratory scale dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor which generates atmospheric NTP to study the removal of low-concentration formaldehyde (HCHO), a typical indoor air VOC in the built environment associated with cancer and leukemia, under different processing conditions. Strong ionization NTP was generated between the DBD electrodes by a pulse power zero-voltage switching flyback transformer (ZVS-FBT), which caused ionization of air molecules leading to active species formation to convert HCHO into carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapor (H2O). The impact of key electrical and physical processing parameters i.e. discharge power (P), initial concentration (Cin), flow rate (F), and relative humidity (RH) which affect the formaldehyde removal efficiency (n) were studied to determine optimum conditions. Results show that, the correlation coefficient (R(2)) of removal efficiency dependence on the processing parameters follow the order R(2) (F) = 0.99 > R(2) (RH) = 0.96, > R(2) (Cin) = 0.94 > R(2) (P) = 0.93. The removal efficiency reached 99% under the optimum conditions of P = 0.6 W, Cin = 0.1 ppm, F = 0.2 m(3)/h, and RH = 65% with no secondary pollution.

Currently, fluorescent in situ hybridization probes are used to detect candidate translocations in bone marrow samples from B-ALL patients. Recently Hi-C, a sequencing-based technique originally designed to reconstruct the three-dimensional architecture of the nuclear genome, was shown to effectively recognize structural variants. Here, we demonstrate that Hi-C can be used as a genome-wide assay to detect translocations and other structural variants of potential clinical interest. Structural variants were identified in both bone marrow and peripheral blood samples, including an ETV6-RUNX1 translocation present in one pediatric B-ALL patient.

These clonal changes imply milder haematological symptoms and lower risk of myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukaemia, thanks to already postulated rescue mechanisms. RESULTS: Bone marrow from fourteen patients exhibiting either the i(7)(q10) or the del(20)(q) and coming from two large cohorts of patients, were subjected to chromosome analyses, Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization with informative probes and array-Comparative Genomic Hybridization. One patient with the i(7)(q10) showed a subsequent clonal rearrangement of the normal chromosome 7 across years. Four patients carrying the del(20)(q) evolved further different del(20)(q) independent clones, within a single bone marrow sample, or across sequential samples. One patient with the del(20)(q), developed a parallel different clone with a duplication of chromosome 3 long arm. Eight patients bore the del(20)(q) as the sole chromosomal abnormality. An overall overview of patients with the del(20)(q), also including cases already reported, confirmed that all the deletions were interstitial. The loss of material varied from 1.7 to 26.9 Mb and resulted in the loss of the EIF6 gene in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although the i(7)(q) and the del(20)(q) clones are frequent and clinically benign in Shwachman Diamond-syndrome, in the present work we show that they may rearrange, may be lost and then reconstructed de novo, or may evolve with independent clones across years. These findings unravel a striking selective pressure exerted by SBDS deficiency driving to karyotype instability and to specific clonal abnormalities.",['(c) 2021.

However, the clinical features and prognostic significance of CSF3R mutations in primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients are still unclear. METHODS: 158 newly diagnosed AML patients were retrospectively evaluated in our study. Amplicon-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) and multiplex-nested reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to investigate the 34 genes and 43 fusion genes associated with leukemia. In addition, clinical features, mutation incidence, and survival outcomes were compared between patients with CSF3R mutation and patients with wild-type CSF3R. RESULTS: In our study, CSF3R mutations were found in 7.6% (12/158) cases. The membrane-proximal amino acid substitution T618I (58.3%) was the most frequent mutation. CSF3R mutations were associated with higher WBC counts (P = .035). CEBPA mutation, TET2 mutation, and RUNX1-RUNX1T1 translocation were the most common co-mutations of CSF3R. The CSF3R gene was mutually exclusive with signal transduction genes (P = .029), while positively associated with TET2 mutations (P = .014). CSF3R mutations had no effect on CR1 (P = .935), R (P = .625) and OS (P = .1172). Patients with CSF3R mutations had a worse DFS (P = .0352) than those with wild-type CSF3R.

This subtype is associated with inferior outcomes, compared to other B-cell precursor ALL. SUMMARY: The recognition of BCR/ABL1-like ALL is challenging due to the complexity of underlying genetic alterations. Rearrangements of CRLF2 are the most frequent alteration in BCR/ABL1-like ALL and can be identified by flow cytometry. The identification of BCR/ABL1-like ALL can be achieved with stepwise algorithms or broad-based testing. The main goal of the diagnostic analysis is to detect the underlying genetic alterations, which are critical for the diagnosis and targeted therapy. Key Messages: The aim of the manuscript is to review the available data on BCR/ABL1-like ALL characteristics, diagnostic algorithms, and novel, molecularly targeted therapeutic options.","['(c) 2021 S.

As a single agent, the CDK6 inhibitor palbociclib induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in ATLL models with wild type TP53. ATLL models that had inactivated TP53 genetically were relatively resistant to palbociclib owing to compensatory CDK2 activity, and this resistance could be reversed by APR-246, a small molecule activator of mutant TP53. The CRISPR-Cas9 screen further highlighted the dependence of ATLL cells on mTORC1 signaling. Treatment of ATLL cells with palbociclib in combination with mTORC1 inhibitors was synergistically toxic irrespective of the TP53 status.

Three isoforms exist, Pim-1, -2, and -3 that are highly expressed in hematological cancers, including Pim-1 in Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). Human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-I) is the etiological agent of ATL, a dismal lymphoproliferative disease known as adult T-cell leukemia. The HTLV-I virally encoded oncogene Tax promotes CD4+ T-cell transformation through disruption of DNA repair pathways and activation of survival and cellular proliferation pathways. In this study, we found Tax increases the expression of Pim-1 and Pim-3, while decreasing Pim-2 expression. Furthermore, we discovered that Pim-1, -2, and -3 bind Tax protein to reduce its expression thereby creating a feedback regulatory loop between these two oncogenes. The loss of Tax expression triggered by Pim kinases led to loss in Tax-mediated transactivation of the HTLV-I LTR and reductions in HTLV-I virus replication. Since Tax is also the immunodominant cytotoxic T cell lymphocytes (CTL) target, our data suggest that Pim kinases may play an important role in immune escape of HTLV-1-infected cells. IMPORTANCE The Pim family of protein kinases have established pro-oncogenic functions. They are often up regulated in cancer; especially leukemias and lymphomas. In addition, a role for Pim kinases in control of virus expression and viral latency is important for KSHV and HIV-1. Our data demonstrate that HTLV-I encodes viral genes that promote and maintain Pim kinase activation, which in turn may stimulate T-cell transformation and maintain ATL leukemic cell growth. HTLV-I Tax increases expression of Pim-1 and Pim-3, while decreasing expression of Pim-2. In ATL cells, Pim expression is maintained through extended protein half-life and heat shock protection. In addition, we found that Pim kinases have a new role during HTLV-I infection. Pim-1, -2, and -3 can subvert Tax expression and HTLV-I virus production. This may lead to partial suppression of the host immunogenic responses to Tax and favor immune escape of HTLV-1-infected cells. Therefore, Pim kinases have not only pro-oncogenic roles but also favor persistence of the virus-infected cell.",,"['Bellon, Marcia', 'Nicot, Christophe']","['Bellon M', 'Nicot C']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211124,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,,2021/11/25 06:00,2021/11/25 06:00,['2021/11/24 17:14'],"['2021/11/24 17:14 [entrez]', '2021/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1128/JVI.01960-21 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Virol. 2021 Nov 24:JVI0196021. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01960-21.,['ORCID: 0000-0001-5927-2869'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared with KpWEA1 and KpWEA2, KpWEA3 showed decreased susceptibility to antimicrobials, and KpWEA4-1 and KpWEA4-2 (isolated from a single specimen) showed further-elevated multidrug-resistance (MDR) phenotypes. This study aims to clarify the clonality of the five isolates and their evolutionary processes leading to MDR by comparison of these complete genomes. The genome comparison revealed KpWEA1 was the antecedent of the other four isolates, and KpWEA4-1 and KpWEA4-2 independently emerged from KpWEA3. Increasing levels of MDR were acquired by gradual accumulation of genetic alterations related to outer membrane protein expression: the loss of OmpK35 and upregulation of AcrAB-TolC occurred in KpWEA3 due to ramA overexpression caused by a mutation in ramR; then OmpK36 was lost in KpWEA4-1 and KpWEA4-2 by different mechanisms. KpWEA4-2 further acquired colistin resistance by the deletion of mgrB. In addition, we found that exuR and kdgR, which encode repressors of hexuronate metabolism-related genes, were disrupted in different ways in KpWEA4-1 and KpWEA4-2. The two isolates also possessed different amino acid substitutions in AtpG, which occurred at very close positions. These genetic alterations related to metabolisms may compensate for the deleterious effects of major porin loss. Thus, our present study reveals the evolutionary process of a K. pneumoniae clone leading to MDR and also suggests specific survival strategies in the bacteria that acquired MDR by the genome evolution. IMPORTANCE Within-host evolution is a survival strategy that can occur in many pathogens and is often associated with the emergence of novel antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria. To analyze this process, suitable sets of clinical isolates are required. Here, we analyzed five Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates which were consecutively isolated from a patient and showed a gradual increase in the AMR level. By genome sequencing and other analyses, we show that the first isolate was the antecedent of the later isolates and that they gained increased levels of antimicrobial resistance leading to multidrug resistance (MDR) by stepwise changes in the expression of outer membrane proteins. The isolates showing higher levels of MDR lost major porins but still colonized the patient's gut, suggesting that the deleterious effects of porin loss were compensated for by the mutations in hexuronate metabolism-related genes and atpG, which were commonly detected in the MDR isolates.",,"['Yoshino, Mai', 'Aihara, Masamune', 'Gotoh, Yasuhiro', 'Akimoto, Masaru', 'Tatsuhara, Wakana', 'Kiyosuke, Makiko', 'Matsushima, Yuichi', 'Uchiumi, Takeshi', 'Hayashi, Tetsuya', 'Kang, Dongchon']","['Yoshino M', 'Aihara M', 'Gotoh Y', 'Akimoto M', 'Tatsuhara W', 'Kiyosuke M', 'Matsushima Y', 'Uchiumi T', 'Hayashi T', 'Kang D']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, Kyushu University Hospitalgrid.411248.a, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, Kyushu University Hospitalgrid.411248.a, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Bacteriology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu Universitygrid.411248.agrid.177174.3, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, Kyushu University Hospitalgrid.411248.a, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Health Science, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu Universitygrid.411248.agrid.177174.3, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, Kyushu University Hospitalgrid.411248.a, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu Universitygrid.411248.agrid.177174.3, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Health Science, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu Universitygrid.411248.agrid.177174.3, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Bacteriology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu Universitygrid.411248.agrid.177174.3, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, Kyushu University Hospitalgrid.411248.a, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu Universitygrid.411248.agrid.177174.3, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20211124,United States,mSphere,mSphere,101674533,IM,,2021/11/25 06:00,2021/11/25 06:00,['2021/11/24 12:14'],"['2021/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/25 06:00 [medline]', '2021/11/24 12:14 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mSphere.00734-21 [doi]'],ppublish,mSphere. 2021 Dec 22;6(6):e0073421. doi: 10.1128/mSphere.00734-21.

Administration groups were pretreated with high and low-dose dry dandelion extract (1,000 or 500 g fresh herb dried and then decocted into 120 mL solution, DDE-H and DDE-L); low-, medium- and high-dose dandelion juice (250, 500, 1,000 g/120 mL, DJ-L, DJ-M, and DJ-H); fresh dandelions evaporation juice water (120 mL, DEJW); dry dandelion extract dissolved by pure water (1 kg/120 mL, DDED-PW); dry dandelion extract dissolved by DEJW (120 g/120 mL, DDED-DEJW) by oral gavage for 7 days at the dosage of 0.5 mL solution/10 g body weight; after that, except normal control group, all other groups were intraperitonealy injected with 350 mg/kg APAP to induce liver injury. Twenty hours after APAP administration, serum and liver tissue were collected and serum alanine aminotransferase (AST), aspartate transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (AKP), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were quantified by biochemical kits; tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-2, and IL-1 beta contents in liver tissue were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay kits. Histopathological changes in liver tissues were observed by hematoxylin and eosin staining; TUNEL Assay and Hoechst 33258 staining were applied for cell apoptosis evaluation. The expressions of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2), caspase-9, B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bax and p-JNK were determined by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Pretreatment with fresh dandelion juice (FDJ, including DJ-L, DJ-M, DJ-H, DEJW and DDED-DEJW) significantly decreased the levels of serum ALT, AST, AKP, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta compared with vehicle control group (P<0.05 or P<0.01). Additionally, compared with the vehicle control group, FDJ decreased the levels of hepatic MDA and restored GSH levels and SOD activity in livers (P<0.05 or P<0.01). FDJ inhibited the overexpression of pro-inflammatory factors including cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase in the liver tissues (P<0.05 or P<0.01). Furthermore, Western blot analysis revealed that FDJ pretreatment inhibited activation of apoptotic signaling pathways via decreasing of Bax, and caspase-9 and JNK protein expression, and inhibited activation of JNK pathway (P<0.05 or P<0.01). Liver histopathological observation provided further evidence that FDJ pretreatment significantly inhibited APAP-induced hepatocyte necrosis, inflammatory cell infiltration and congestion. CONCLUSIONS: FDJ pretreatment protects against APAP-induced hepatic injury by activating the Nrf-2/HO-1 pathway and inhibition of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, and the effect of fresh dandelion extracts was superior to dried dandelion extracts in APAP hepatotoxicity model mice.","['(c) 2021.

Here, we identified the long non-coding RNA CDK6-AS1 able to cluster an AML subgroup with peculiar gene signatures linked to hematopoietic cell differentiation and mitochondrial dynamics. CDK6-AS1 silencing triggered hematopoietic commitment in healthy CD34+ cells, whereas in AML cells the pathological undifferentiated state was rescued. This latter phenomenon derived from RUNX1 transcriptional control, responsible for the stemness of hematopoietic precursors and for the block of differentiation in AML. By CDK6-AS1 silencing in vitro, AML mitochondrial mass decreased with augmented pharmacological sensitivity to mitochondria-targeting drugs. In vivo, the combination of tigecycline and cytarabine reduced leukemia progression in the AML-PDX model with high CDK6-AS1 levels, supporting the concept of a mitochondrial vulnerability. Together, these findings uncover CDK6-AS1 as crucial in myeloid differentiation and mitochondrial mass regulation.",['(c) 2021 The Author(s).'],"['Porcu, Elena', 'Benetton, Maddalena', 'Bisio, Valeria', 'Da Ros, Ambra', 'Tregnago, Claudia', 'Borella, Giulia', 'Zanon, Carlo', 'Bordi, Matteo', 'Germano, Giuseppe', 'Manni, Sabrina', 'Campello, Silvia', 'Rao, Dinesh S', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Pigazzi, Martina']","['Porcu E', 'Benetton M', 'Bisio V', 'Da Ros A', 'Tregnago C', 'Borella G', 'Zanon C', 'Bordi M', 'Germano G', 'Manni S', 'Campello S', 'Rao DS', 'Locatelli F', 'Pigazzi M']","[""Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Hematopoietic Cell&Gene Therapy Division of Women's and Children's Health Department, University-Hospital of Padova, Via N.

Observations: A 39-year-old man with acute myeloid leukemia, in a relapsed state on high-dose chemotherapy, experienced profound neutropenia and immunosuppression. The patient reported two weeks of severe bilateral vision loss. The diagnosis of bilateral endogenous endophthalmitis was initially established based on the patient's history, immune status, clinical findings, and confirmed positive vitreous culture.The patient was initially managed with vitreous tap, pars plana vitrectomy with silicone oil injection in the left eye, and vitreous tap and antibiotic injection of the right eye. Eventually, the right eye underwent pars plana vitrectomy as well. Cultures of the vitreous sample grew a filamentous fungus, identified as the Trichoderma species. His blood and urine culture tested negative. The patient was kept on systemic amphotericin B over 52 weeks, and his condition improved dramatically. Three months post phacoemulsification and silicone oil removal, best-corrected visual acuity values were 20/50 in both eyes.

The clinical, genetic and molecular aspects and overall outcomes are well defined worldwide, but not well characterized in our region. Purpose and methods: This is a retrospective single center cohort study on 32 patients, who were identified over 10 years to study the clinical, pathologic and genetic-molecular aspects, and survival outcomes. Results: eAML is rare (1%), occurs at a younger age with male predominance. Central nervous system (CNS) with facial bone invasion is most commonly identified (34.4%). 45.5% were positive for conventional myeloid markers (MPO), CD33, CD117, and 36% positive for CD34 and CD68. 54% with normal karyotype had deleterious mutations on further testing. NGS revealed pathogenic mutations in 76%(N-9/17) and none tested positive for P53, IDH1 or IDH2. At a median follow up time of 43mo (range, 8.6-80mo); 37.5%(N-12) were in complete remission, 62.5%(N-20) relapsed. 28% of relapses were after allotransplant. 31%(N-10) alive and continued in complete remission(CR), and 69%(N-22) of patients have died.Median overall survival (OS) is 18.4 and relapse free survival (RFS) 18.7 months. OS and RFS were significantly better in patients, who attained CR after induction (IC 11.9 mo vs zero; P = 0.0001; IC 12mo vs zero; P = 0.0001) compared to patients with relapsed disease; and in patients who received allo-transplant consolidation with median OS and RFS 42 vs 8.5mo (P = 0.002) and 42months vs 10 mo (P = 0.006). Thus allotransplant may be considered for all eligible patients in first CR. Conclusion: achievement of complete remission after induction therapy is associated with improved outcomes in eAML.

This study aimed to assess the association of XRCC1 gene polymorphisms including Arg194Trp, Arg399Gln, and Arg280His with the risk of development of CML in Sudanese population. Patients and Methods: The present study was conducted on 186 newly diagnosed patients with CML, aged 19-70 years (118 males and 68 females; mean age of 46.15+/-13.91 years) and 186 normal healthy controls (123 males and 63 females; mean age of 44.94+/-8.97 years). Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay was utilized to analyze the XRCC1 (Arg194Trp, Arg399Gln, and Arg280His) gene polymorphisms. Results: The genotypic frequencies of Arg399Gln polymorphism in cases were 131 (70.4%) homozygous Arg/Arg, 46 (24.7%) homozygous Gln/Gln, and 9 (4.8%) heterozygous Arg/Gln as compared to the controls ie, 153 (82.3%), 73 (14.5%), and 6 (3.2%), respectively. The Arg399Gln variant genotypic frequencies significantly differed between the cases and controls (chi (2) = 7.249, P = 0.027). By comparison, no statistically significant difference was observed in the variant genotype frequencies between the cases and controls in terms of Arg194Trp and Arg280His polymorphisms.

This phase 1b study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of chidamide in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP) for treatment-naive PTCL patients. Methods: This study was an open-label, multicenter trial composed of dose escalation and dose expansion. Patients received CHOP for six 21-d cycles and chidamide on d 1, 4, 8 and 11 in each cycle. Four dose levels of chidamide (20, 25, 30 and 35 mg) were evaluated. The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination regimen. Results: A total of 30 patients were evaluated in this study: 15 in the dose-escalation part and 15 in the dose-expansion part. In the dose-escalation study, three patients were enrolled in the 35 mg chidamide cohort. One had dose-limiting toxicity with grade 3 vascular access complications, and one had grade 2 neutropenia with a sustained temperature >38 degrees C. Dose escalation was stopped at this chidamide dose level. The most common (>/=10%) grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs) were leukopenia (90.0%), neutropenia (83.3%), vomiting (13.3%), thrombocytopenia (10.0%) and febrile neutropenia (10.0%). No significant changes in chidamide pharmacokinetic properties were observed before and after combination treatment. The objective response rate for the 28 patients evaluable for preliminary efficacy was 89.3% (25/28), with 16 (57.1%) achieving complete response or unconfirmed complete response. The estimated median progression-free survival was 14.0 months. In summary, we chose chidamide 30 mg as the recommended dose for phase 2. Conclusions: The addition of chidamide to standard CHOP chemotherapy was tolerable with promising preliminary efficacy in previously untreated PTCL patients, which supports further clinical studies with this combination regimen for the frontline treatment of PTCL.",['Copyright (c)2021Chinese Journal of Cancer Research.

This study aimed to investigate the impact of CBT, compared to human leukocyte antigen-matched related donor transplantation (MRDT). This study included 2451 adult patients with non-remission R/R AML who received CBT (1738 patients) or MRDT (713 patients) between January 2009 and December 2018. Five-year progression-free survival (PFS) and the prognostic impact of CBT were evaluated using a propensity score (PS) matching analysis. After PS matching, the patient characteristics were well balanced between the groups. The five-year PFS was 25.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 21.2-29.5%) in the CBT group and 18.1% (95% CI: 14.5-22.0%) in the MRDT group (P = 0.009). The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) was 0.83 (95% CI: 0.69-1.00, P = 0.045); this was due to a more pronounced decrease in the relapse rate (HR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.69-0.89, P < 0.001) than an increase in the NRM (1.42, 1.15-1.76, P = 0.001).

This exploratory study aims at evaluating the usefulness of plasma concentration of circulating mir-146a as a non-invasive biomarker for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Total RNA including miRNA was isolated from 110 plasma samples of patients (n = 66), healthy controls (n = 24) and follow up (n = 20) cases and reverse transcribed. Relative concentrations were assessed using real-time quantitative PCR and fold-change was calculated by 2(-DeltaDeltaCt) method. Finally, relative concentrations were correlated to clinicopathological factors. Patients (n = 66) were analyzed to determine fold expression of miR-146a in plasma samples of ALL. Before chemotherapy, pediatric (n = 42) and adult (n = 24) showed overexpression of miR-146a compared with healthy controls (P < 0.0001). There was no effect of age and gender on mir-146a expression in plasma. mirR-146a expression was independent of clinical and hematological features. Moreover, miR-146a levels in plasma of paired samples (n = 20) after treatment showed significant decrease in expression (P < 0.001). Expression of plasma miR-146a may be utilized as non-invasive marker to diagnose and predict prognosis in pediatric and adult patients with ALL. Moreover predicted targets may be utilized for ALL therapy in future.",['(c) 2021.

A common link in the pathogenesis is the proliferation of fibroblasts and the increase of collagen synthesis, leading to development of common endomyocardial fibrosis. The walls of ventricles become rigid and their inability to relax prevents them from carrying the required amount of blood. The myocardial contractility gradually decreases and leads to ventricular dysfunction and signs of heart failure. CASE REPORT A 29-year-old woman with reduced exercise tolerance, dyspnea, and heart rhythm disorders was admitted to our hospital. Lymphoblastic leukemia had been diagnosed at the age of 8 years, and she underwent 8 courses of polychemotherapy. She had normal heart anatomy. At the current admission, the diagnostic protocol included echocardiography, computed tomography, cardiac catheterization, and angiocardiography. She was diagnosed with restrictive cardiomyopathy with isolated endomyocardial fibrosis of the right ventricle, and moderate tricuspid valve insufficiency NYHA class III. The patient underwent a right-sided bidirectional cavopulmonary connection with tricuspid valve repair. The early postoperative period was uneventful, and SVCp decreased to 14 mmHg. At discharge, the patient's clinical condition had improved and tricuspid regurgitation was minimal.

While CH can be associated with leukemia and some solid tumors, the relationship between CH and lung cancer remains largely unknown. To help clarify this relationship, we analyzed whole-exome sequencing (WES) data from 1,958 lung cancer cases and controls. Potential CH mutations were identified by a set of hierarchical filtering criteria in different exonic regions, and the associations between the number of CH mutations and clinical traits were investigated. Family history of lung cancer (FHLC) may exert diverse influences on the accumulation of CH mutations in different age groups. In younger subjects, FHLC was the strongest risk factor for CH mutations. Association analysis of genome-wide genetic variants identified dozens of genetic loci associated with CH mutations, including a candidate SNP rs2298110, which may promote CH by increasing expression of a potential leukemia promoter gene OTUD3. Hundreds of potentially novel CH mutations were identified, and smoking was found to potentially shape the CH mutational signature. Genetic variants and lung cancer risk factors, especially FHLC, correlated with CH. These analyses improve our understanding of the relationship between lung cancer and CH, and future experimental studies will be necessary to corroborate the uncovered correlations. SIGNIFICANCE: Analysis of whole-exome sequencing data uncovers correlations between clonal hematopoiesis and lung cancer risk factors, identifies genetic variants correlated with clonal hematopoiesis, and highlights hundreds of potential novel clonal hematopoiesis mutations.",['(c)2021 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Hong, Wei', 'Li, Ang', 'Liu, Yanhong', 'Xiao, Xiangjun', 'Christiani, David C', 'Hung, Rayjean J', 'McKay, James', 'Field, John', 'Amos, Christopher I', 'Cheng, Chao']","['Hong W', 'Li A', 'Liu Y', 'Xiao X', 'Christiani DC', 'Hung RJ', 'McKay J', 'Field J', 'Amos CI', 'Cheng C']","['Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'School of Public Health, Harvard University, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Mount Sinai Hospital Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'World Health Organization International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon CEDEX, France.', 'Institute of Systems, Molecular and Integrative Biology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas. chao.cheng@bcm.edu chrisa@bcm.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas. chao.cheng@bcm.edu chrisa@bcm.edu.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211123,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,,2021/11/25 06:00,2021/11/25 06:00,['2021/11/24 05:47'],"['2021/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/08/23 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/25 06:00 [medline]', '2021/11/24 05:47 [entrez]']","['0008-5472.CAN-21-1903 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-21-1903 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Cancer Res. 2021 Nov 23. pii: 0008-5472.CAN-21-1903. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-21-1903.,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8455-2309', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0301-0242', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4486-7496', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3951-6365', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8540-7023', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5002-3417']","['R21 CA227996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 CA148127/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Induction therapy with ATRA is associated with the rare but potentially fatal complication of differentiation syndrome. While the presentation of this syndrome is varied, myopericarditis as a manifestation of differentiation syndrome is often fatal and rarely reported in literature. We present a case of myopericarditis as the sole manifestation of differentiation syndrome in a patient on induction therapy with ATRA and arsenic trioxide for APL. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 62 year old woman with remote history of breast and uterine cancer presented to the hospital for expedited work up of easy bruising and expanding hematomas. She was diagnosed with APL with peripheral blood and bone marrow cytogenetics revealing t (15;17) translocation and initiated on induction therapy with ATRA and ATO as well as steroids for differentiation syndrome prophylaxis. Eighteen days into induction therapy, patient developed pleuritic chest pain, elevated cardiac biomarkers, ECG changes suggestive of pericarditis. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed patchy multifocal sub-epicardial late gadolinium enhancement and elevated T2 signal consistent with acute myopericarditis. Given the timing of symptom onset and lack of other identifiable cause, patient was diagnosed with differentiation syndrome- induced myopericarditis and promptly initiated on high dose steroids with rapid improvement in symptoms, ECG, and cardiac biomarkers. Patient successfully resumed dose-reduced ATRA and arsenic trioxide without complication. CONCLUSION: Myopericarditis can be the sole manifestation of differentiation syndrome and the presentation may be atypical owing to the use of prophylactic steroids as illustrated in our patient's case. A high index of suspicion for differentiation syndrome, multimodality imaging, and prompt input from multidisciplinary providers is crucial for making the timely diagnosis and initiating life-saving treatment.",['(c) 2021.

For example, targeted treatment inside the human body is particularly challenging, and as such, modeling and simulation is utilised to aid planning before a specific treatment is administered. In such approaches, precise treatment, as it is the case in radiotherapy, is used to administer a maximum dose to the infected regions while minimizing the effect on normal tissue. Complicated cancers such as leukemia present even greater challenges due to their presentation in liquid form and not being localised in one area. As such, science has led to the development of targeted drug delivery, where the infected cells can be specifically targeted anywhere in the body. Despite the great prospects and advances of these modeling and simulation tools in the design and delivery of targeted drugs, their use by Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs) researchers and clinicians is still very limited. This paper therefore reviews the modeling and simulation approaches for leukemia treatment using nanoparticles as an example for virtual experimentation. A systematic review from various databases was carried out for studies that involved cancer treatment approaches through modeling and simulation with emphasis to data collected from LMICs. Results indicated that whereas there is an increasing trend in the use of modeling and simulation approaches, their uptake in LMICs is still limited. According to the review data collected, there is a clear need to employ these tools as key approaches for the planning of targeted drug treatment approaches.",,"['Kiwumulo, Henry Fenekansi', 'Muwonge, Haruna', 'Ibingira, Charles', 'Kirabira, John Baptist', 'Ssekitoleko, Robert Tamale']","['Kiwumulo HF', 'Muwonge H', 'Ibingira C', 'Kirabira JB', 'Ssekitoleko RT']","['Department of Medical Physiology, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda.', 'Department of Medical Physiology, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda.', 'Department of Human Anatomy, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda.', 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda.', 'Department of Medical Physiology, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Systematic Review']",,United States,Math Biosci Eng,Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,101197794,IM,,2021/11/25 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2021/11/24 01:00'],"['2021/11/24 01:00 [entrez]', '2021/11/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3934/mbe.2021404 [doi]'],ppublish,Math Biosci Eng. 2021 Sep 17;18(6):8149-8173. doi: 10.3934/mbe.2021404.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['* LMICs', '* Leukemia treatment', '* magnetic strength', '* modeling and simulation', '* nanomedicine', '* targeted drug delivery']",20211210,,,"['*Developing Countries', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/therapy']",,,,,,,,,,

We developed an algorithm-driven classification for these lymphomas by flow cytometry and compared it to the WHO gold standard diagnosis. Overall, 662 samples from 662 patients representing nine disease categories were analyzed at 9 laboratories using the previously published EuroFlow 5-tube-8-color B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disease antibody panel. Expression levels of all 26 markers from the panel were plotted by B-cell entity to construct a univariate, fully standardized diagnostic reference library. For multivariate data analysis we subsequently utilized Canonical Correlation Analysis of 176 training cases to project the multi-dimensional space of all 26 immunophenotypic parameters into 36 two-dimensional plots for each possible pair-wise differential diagnosis. Diagnostic boundaries were fitted according to the distribution of the immunophenotypes of a given differential diagnosis. A diagnostic algorithm based on these projections was developed and subsequently validated using 486 independent cases. Negative predictive values exceeding 92.1% were observed for all disease categories except for follicular lymphoma. Particularly high positive predictive values were returned in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (99.1%), hairy cell leukemia (97.2%), follicular lymphoma (97.2%) and mantle cell lymphoma (95.4%). Burkitt and CD10+ diffuse large B-cell lymphomas were difficult to distinguish by the algorithm. A similar ambiguity was observed between marginal zone, lymphoplasmacytic, and CD10- diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. The specificity of the approach exceeded 98% for all entities.

Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1-R123 (IDH1-R132 H) is related to T-ALL progression. This study explored the role of IDH1-R132H in T-ALL. Molt-4 cells with IDH1-R132H mutation were constructed by retroviral transfection of IDH1-R132H and T-ALL xenotransplantation mouse model was established by injection of Molt-4 cells through the tail vein. Infiltration of the liver, spleen, and bone marrow and the percentage of CD45-positive T-ALL cells in them were detected. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion were evaluated after the intervention of Notch1, PTEN, or PI3K expression. The leukocyte number was increased, the spleen was enlarged, infiltration in bone marrow, spleen, and liver tissue was worsened and the percentage of hCD45-positive T-ALL cells was increased by IDH1-R132H mutation, which promoted T-ALL deterioration. IDH1-R132H mutation promoted proliferation, invasion, and inhibited apoptosis of T-ALL cells, which were reversed by inhibition of Notch1. IDH1-R132H mutation upregulated HES1 expression and downregulated PTEN expression by activating the Notch1 pathway, while inhibition of Notch1 reversed these changes. PTEN inhibited the PI3K/AKT pathway activation. PTEN overexpression reversed IDH1-R132H mutation effect on promoting malignant behaviors of T-ALL cells.

An unintended consequence of this process is the progressive differentiation of CAR T cells over time in culture. Differentiated T cells engraft poorly, which limits their ability to persist and provide sustained tumor control in hematologic as well as solid tumors. Solid tumors include other barriers to CAR T cell therapies, including immune and metabolic checkpoints that suppress effector function and durability. Sialic acids are ubiquitous surface molecules with known immune checkpoint functions. The enzyme C. perfringens neuraminidase (CpNA) removes sialic acid residues from target cells, with good activity at physiologic conditions. In combination with galactose oxidase (GO), NA has been found to stimulate T cell mitogenesis and cytotoxicity in vitro. Here we determine whether CpNA alone and in combination with GO promotes CAR T cell antitumor efficacy. We show that CpNA restrains CAR T cell differentiation during ex vivo culture, giving rise to progeny with enhanced therapeutic potential. CAR T cells expressing CpNA have superior effector function and cytotoxicity in vitro. In a Nalm-6 xenograft model of leukemia, CAR T cells expressing CpNA show enhanced antitumor efficacy. Arming CAR T cells with CpNA also enhanced tumor control in xenograft models of glioblastoma as well as a syngeneic model of melanoma. Given our findings, we hypothesize that charge repulsion via surface glycans is a regulatory parameter influencing differentiation. As T cells engage target cells within tumors and undergo constitutive activation through their CARs, critical thresholds of negative charge may impede cell-cell interactions underlying synapse formation and cytolysis. Removing the dense pool of negative cell-surface charge with CpNA is an effective approach to limit CAR T cell differentiation and enhance overall persistence and efficacy.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s).

Pain may exacerbate these cognitive impairments. This study examined neuropathic pain and neurocognitive outcomes in survivors of childhood ALL treated with contemporary therapy on a clinical trial (NCT00137111). There were 345 survivors (45% female, M = 6.9 years at diagnosis) who completed neurocognitive assessments including measures of sustained attention, learning and memory, and parent ratings of attention during at least one of 4 time points: on-therapy (Induction and Reinduction), end of therapy, and 2 years post-therapy. At-risk performance was defined as a score at least 1SD below the age-adjusted mean. Data on neuropathic pain (events, duration, and severity according NCI Common Toxicity Criteria) and pharmacologic pain management (opioids and gabapentin) were ascertained. Results showed that 135 survivors (39%) experienced neuropathic pain during treatment. Compared with those without pain, survivors with pain had greater memory impairments at end of therapy (California Verbal Learning Test [CVLT]-Total, 24% vs 12%, P = 0.046). Within the pain group, survivors who experienced a greater number of pain events (CVLT-Total = -0.88, P = 0.023) and those who were treated with opioids (versus gabapentin) had poorer learning and memory performance (CVLT-Total = -0.73, P = 0.011; Short Delay = -0.57, P = 0.024; Long Delay = -0.62, P = 0.012; and Learning Slope = -0.45, P = 0.042) across time points. These are considered medium-to-large effects (SD = 0.45-0.88). Neuropathic pain may be a risk factor for learning problems after therapy completion, and treatment for pain with opioids may also adversely affect neurocognitive performance. Therefore, patients who experience pain may require closer monitoring and additional intervention for neurocognitive impairment.",['Copyright (c) 2021 International Association for the Study of Pain.'],"['Partanen, Marita', 'Alberts, Nicole M', 'Conklin, Heather M', 'Krull, Kevin R', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Anghelescu, Doralina A', 'Jacola, Lisa M']","['Partanen M', 'Alberts NM', 'Conklin HM', 'Krull KR', 'Pui CH', 'Anghelescu DA', 'Jacola LM']","[""Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, United States.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210925,United States,Pain,Pain,7508686,IM,,2021/11/24 06:00,2021/11/24 06:00,['2021/11/23 17:17'],"['2021/11/23 17:17 [entrez]', '2021/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002485 [doi]', '00006396-900000000-97870 [pii]']",aheadofprint,Pain. 2021 Sep 25. pii: 00006396-900000000-97870. doi: 10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002485.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Selective engagement of membrane IgM or IgD on CLL cells, each co-expressed by > 90% of cases, leads to distinct signaling events. Since both IgM and IgD carry the same antigen-binding domains, the divergent actions of the receptors are attributed to differences in immunoglobulin (IG) structure or the outcome of signal transduction. We showed that IgM, not IgD, level and organization linked with CLL-cell birth rate and the type and consequences of BCR signaling in humans and mice.

One barrier to the broad clinical application of proteomic profiling is the large amount of biological material required, particularly for phosphoproteomics horizontal line currently on the order of 25 mg wet tissue weight. For hematopoietic cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the sample requirement is >/=10 million peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Across large study cohorts, this requirement will exceed what is obtainable for many individual patients/time points. For this reason, we were interested in the impact of differential peptide loading across multiplex channels on proteomic data quality. To achieve this, we tested a range of channel loading amounts (approximately the material obtainable from 5E5, 1E6, 2.5E6, 5E6, and 1E7 AML patient cells) to assess proteome coverage, quantification precision, and peptide/phosphopeptide detection in experiments utilizing isobaric tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling. As expected, fewer missing values were observed in TMT channels with higher peptide loading amounts compared to lower loadings. Moreover, channels with a lower loading have greater quantitative variability than channels with higher loadings. A statistical analysis showed that decreased loading amounts result in an increase in the type I error rate. We then examined the impact of differential loading on the detection of known differences between distinct AML cell lines. Similar patterns of increased data missingness and higher quantitative variability were observed as loading was decreased resulting in fewer statistical differences; however, we found good agreement in features identified as differential, demonstrating the value of this approach.",,"['Sanford, James A', 'Wang, Yang', 'Hansen, Joshua R', 'Gritsenko, Marina A', 'Weitz, Karl K', 'Sagendorf, Tyler J', 'Tognon, Cristina E', 'Petyuk, Vladislav A', 'Qian, Wei-Jun', 'Liu, Tao', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Rodland, Karin D', 'Piehowski, Paul D']","['Sanford JA', 'Wang Y', 'Hansen JR', 'Gritsenko MA', 'Weitz KK', 'Sagendorf TJ', 'Tognon CE', 'Petyuk VA', 'Qian WJ', 'Liu T', 'Druker BJ', 'Rodland KD', 'Piehowski PD']","['Biological Sciences Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99354, United States.', 'Biological Sciences Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99354, United States.', 'Biological Sciences Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99354, United States.', 'Biological Sciences Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99354, United States.', 'Biological Sciences Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99354, United States.', 'Biological Sciences Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99354, United States.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon 97239, United States.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon 97239, United States.', 'Biological Sciences Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99354, United States.', 'Biological Sciences Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99354, United States.', 'Biological Sciences Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99354, United States.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon 97239, United States.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon 97239, United States.', 'Biological Sciences Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99354, United States.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon 97239, United States.', 'Environmental Molecular Sciences Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99354, United States.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211123,United States,J Am Soc Mass Spectrom,Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry,9010412,IM,,2021/11/24 06:00,2021/11/24 06:00,['2021/11/23 17:10'],"['2021/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/24 06:00 [medline]', '2021/11/23 17:10 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jasms.1c00169 [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Soc Mass Spectrom. 2022 Jan 5;33(1):17-30. doi: 10.1021/jasms.1c00169.

The approach compares long-term survival of two cohorts defined by the availability or non-availability of suitable donors for stem cell transplantation. A patient's cohort membership becomes known only after completed donor search with or without an identified donor. If a patient suffers an event during donor search, stem cell transplantation will no longer be indicated. In such a case, donor search will be ceased and cohort membership will remain unknown. The generalised pseudo-values approach considers donor identification as binary time-dependent covariate and uses inverse-probability-of-censoring weighting to adjust for non-identified donors. The approach leads to time-consuming computations due to multiple redefinitions of the risk set for pseudo-value calculation and an explicit adjustment for waiting-time bias. Here, the problem is looked at from a different angle. By considering the probability that a donor would have been identified after ceasing of donor search, weights for common pseudo-values are defined. This leads to a faster alternative approach as only a single risk set is necessary. Extensive computer simulations show that both, the generalised and the new weighted pseudo-values approach, provide approximately unbiased estimates. Confidence interval coverage is satisfactory for typical clinical scenarios. In situations, where donor identification takes considerably longer than usual, the weighted pseudo-values approach is preferable. Both approaches complement each other as they have different potential in addressing further aspects of the underlying medical question.",,"['Mittlbock, Martina', 'Potschger, Ulrike', 'Heinzl, Harald']","['Mittlbock M', 'Potschger U', 'Heinzl H']","['Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics, and Intelligent Systems, 27271Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', ""Children's Cancer Research Institute, 535811Vienna, Austria."", 'Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics, and Intelligent Systems, 27271Medical University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211123,England,Stat Methods Med Res,Statistical methods in medical research,9212457,IM,,2021/11/24 06:00,2021/11/24 06:00,['2021/11/23 12:14'],"['2021/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/24 06:00 [medline]', '2021/11/23 12:14 [entrez]']",['10.1177/09622802211041756 [doi]'],ppublish,Stat Methods Med Res. 2022 Jan;31(1):76-86. doi: 10.1177/09622802211041756.

In parallel, some studies have demonstrated that cancer cells with global splicing alterations are dependent on the transcriptional products derived from wild-type spliceosome for their survival, which potentially creates a therapeutic vulnerability in cancers with a mutant spliceosome. It has been c. 10 y since the frequent mutations affecting splicing factors were reported in cancers. Based on these surprising findings, there has been a growing interest in targeting altered splicing in the treatment of cancers, which has promoted a wide variety of investigations including genetic, molecular and biological studies addressing how altered splicing promotes oncogenesis and how cancers bearing alterations in splicing can be targeted therapeutically. In this mini-review we present a concise trajectory of what has been elucidated regarding the pathogenesis of cancers with aberrant splicing, as well as the development of therapeutic strategies to target global splicing alterations in cancers.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Over the past decades, there has been a great challenge in the treatment of AML. A combination of gene expression profiling with computational approaches can lead to the identification of hub genes in AML. However, it is important to study the structure of these hub genes considering their importance in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of specific cancer. In this study, we designed an integrated method to analyze the presence of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in selected hub genes of AML. A gene expression profile of AML was obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Further analysis identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in AML. Additionally, the top 15 hub genes following construction and analysis of the PPI network of DEGs were selected. Validation of hub genes revealed that there is a reverse relationship between overexpression of FLT3, PPBP, and PF4 genes and the survival of AML patients. Based on IDRs investigation, FLT3 and PF4 are partially disordered, while PPBP is mostly disordered. Through clustering the network into structural modules, we identified two important modules in the PPI network of DEGs that showed the important position of PPBP in module 1. Based on further analysis of protein flexibility and its important role in biological processes, we suggest that PPBP can be considered as a potential drug target in AML.","['(c) 2021 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Ameri, Mehrdad', 'Alipour, Maedeh', 'Madihi, Mobina', 'Nezafat, Navid']","['Ameri M', 'Alipour M', 'Madihi M', 'Nezafat N']","['Diagnostic Laboratory Sciences and Technology Research Center, School of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Diagnostic Laboratory Sciences and Technology Research Center, School of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Virology, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211123,United States,Biotechnol Appl Biochem,Biotechnology and applied biochemistry,8609465,IM,,2021/11/24 06:00,2021/11/24 06:00,['2021/11/23 09:35'],"['2021/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/24 06:00 [medline]', '2021/11/23 09:35 [entrez]']",['10.1002/bab.2287 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Biotechnol Appl Biochem. 2021 Nov 23. doi: 10.1002/bab.2287.,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8103-2685'],,,['NOTNLM'],"['PPI network', 'acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'hub genes', 'intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The less common NK-cell variant of this disorder poses a diagnostic challenge and its etiologic basis is poorly understood. Here we present the case of an elderly man diagnosed with LGL leukemia after presenting with severe Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia, who had a robust durable response to oral cyclophosphamide. Close to two years after initial diagnosis, he developed a florid Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare (MAI) infection of the lungs. We discuss the clinical and pathologic features of this case, highlighting aspects common to this disorder and areas of clinical uncertainty. We hope to both raise awareness of the risk for pulmonary MAI infection in patients treated with lymphodepleting drugs and to motivate the prospective evaluation of strategies to prevent opportunistic infections in LGL leukemia.","['Copyright (c) 2021, Kojadinovic et al.']","['Kojadinovic, Arsenije', 'Mundi, Prabhjot S']","['Kojadinovic A', 'Mundi PS']","['Internal Medicine, Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, USA.', 'Internal Medicine/Hematology-Oncology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, USA.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20211119,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2021/11/24 06:00,2021/11/24 06:01,['2021/11/23 09:26'],"['2021/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/23 09:26 [entrez]', '2021/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/24 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.19754 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2021 Nov 19;13(11):e19754. doi: 10.7759/cureus.19754. eCollection 2021 Nov.,,,PMC8604561,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic t-cell leukemias', 'large granular lymphocytic leukemia', 'lgl leukemia', 'mycobacterium-avium intracellulare', 'opportunistic infection', 'pulmonary mac']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prognosis and survival depend on several factors that determine tumor behavior and response to therapy. AML has a poor prognosis that depends on several factors: patient's age, gender, body mass index (BMI), baseline white blood cells count, and bone marrow blast (BMB) cell count at the time of diagnosis. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the prognostic role of these factors and their impact on outcomes, and how these prognostic factors may affect AML patients before and after induction chemotherapy. METHODS: The study design is an observational, retrospective record review. We included records of patients diagnosed with primary and secondary AML who received chemotherapy between 2013 and 2019 at King Abdulaziz University in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Data were extracted from medical records, entered into an Excel sheet (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA), and analyzed using SPSS Statistics, version 25 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). RESULTS: Forty-two AML patients who were started on chemotherapy were analyzed. The mean age at diagnosis was 35 +/- 22.2 years; 52.4% were male. The ability to achieve the first remission varied according to age group; the 21-45 age group had the higher ability and survival rate of 75.0%. On the other hand, the mortality incidence was higher (at 70.0%) in both the 11-20 and the 46-70 age groups. A strong negative correlation was observed between age and survival duration after treatment (SDAT) (r = - 0.618, p = 0.004). The death incidence was increased in the BMI ranges that were under and above the normal weight range. SDAT differed significantly between the three groups in favor of the normal-weight patients (p = 0.019). We found that patients with BMB < 5 had the most deaths. There was a significant negative association between BMB and days to achieve the first remission after treatment (p = 0.033). Conclusion: Age, BMI, and BMB are considered effective prognostic factors for AML patients.","['Copyright (c) 2021, Alsulami et al.']","['Alsulami, Hind A', 'Alnashri, Maryam M', 'Bawazir, Alanoud F', 'Alrashid, Laila T', 'Dly, Raghdah A', 'Alharbi, Yusr A', 'Qari, Mohamad H']","['Alsulami HA', 'Alnashri MM', 'Bawazir AF', 'Alrashid LT', 'Dly RA', 'Alharbi YA', 'Qari MH']","['Hematology Department, King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, SAU.', 'Hematology Department, King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, SAU.', 'Hematology Department, King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, SAU.', 'Hematology Department, King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, SAU.', 'Hematology Department, King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, SAU.', 'Hematology Department, King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, SAU.', 'Hematology Department, King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, SAU.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211020,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2021/11/24 06:00,2021/11/24 06:01,['2021/11/23 09:26'],"['2021/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/23 09:26 [entrez]', '2021/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/24 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.18915 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2021 Oct 20;13(10):e18915. doi: 10.7759/cureus.18915. eCollection 2021 Oct.,,,PMC8603085,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia (aml)', 'bone marrow biopsy (bmb)', 'clinical outcome', 'prognosis', 'teaching hospital']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Literature suggests that survival in LMICs is poorer compared with survival in high-income countries (HICs). AIMS: This study evaluates the outcomes of Kenyan children with AML and the impact of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics on outcome. METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective medical records study was performed at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) in Eldoret, Kenya, between January 2010 and December 2018. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, and treatment outcomes were evaluated. Chemotherapy included two ""3 + 7"" induction courses with doxorubicin and cytarabine and two ""3 + 5"" consolidation courses with etoposide and cytarabine. Supportive care included antimicrobial prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole and fluconazole, and blood products, if available. Seventy-three children with AML were included. The median duration of symptoms before admission at MTRH was 1 month. The median time from admission at MTRH to diagnosis was 6 days and to the start of AML treatment 16 days. Out of the 55 children who were started on chemotherapy, 18 (33%) achieved complete remission, of whom 10 (56%) relapsed. The abandonment rate was 22% and the early death rate was 46%. The 2-year probabilities of event-free survival and overall survival were 4% and 7%, respectively. None of the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were significantly associated with outcome. CONCLUSION: Survival of Kenyan children with AML is dismal and considerably lower compared with survival in HICs. Strategies to improve survival should be put in place including better supportive care, optimization of the treatment protocol, and reduction of the abandonment rate and time lag to diagnosis with sooner start of treatment.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

METHODS: We collected peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) samples from de novo AML (AML-DN) patients, patients who achieved complete remission after chemotherapy (AML-CR), and healthy individuals. An eight-color flow cytometry panel was used to identify different NK subsets and their expression of TIGIT, CD57 and KLRG1. RESULTS: Decreased percentage of CD56(dim) CD16(+) NK cells was found only in the PB of AML-DN and AML-CR patients but not in the BM. The expression frequency of TIGIT and KLRG1 was elevated on NK cells from the PB of AML-DN patients, while it was recovered in AML-CR patients. Moreover, a higher percentage of CD57(+) CD56(dim) CD16(+) NK cells, representing a terminally differentiated NK subset with strong cytotoxic capacity but defective replication potential, was detected in the BM of AML-DN patients and predicted sub-optimal survival for patients. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that the NK cell subsets in the PB of AML patients had an exhaustion phenotype, while the BM NK cells had a terminally differentiated phenotype, which correlated with short survival for AML patients.","['(c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.']","['Zeng, Xiangbo', 'Yao, Danlin', 'Liu, Lian', 'Zhang, Yikai', 'Lai, Jing', 'Zhong, Jun', 'Zha, Xianfeng', 'Lu, Yuhong', 'Jin, Zhenyi', 'Chen, Shaohua', 'Li, Yangqiu', 'Xu, Ling']","['Zeng X', 'Yao D', 'Liu L', 'Zhang Y', 'Lai J', 'Zhong J', 'Zha X', 'Lu Y', 'Jin Z', 'Chen S', 'Li Y', 'Xu L']","['Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education; Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine; Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Department of Hematology; First Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education; Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine; Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Department of Hematology; First Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education; Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine; Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Department of Hematology; First Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education; Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine; Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Department of Hematology; First Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Department of Hematology; First Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Department of Hematology; First Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Department of clinical laboratory, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Department of Hematology; First Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education; Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine; Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education; Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine; Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education; Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine; Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Department of Hematology; First Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education; Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine; Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Department of Hematology; First Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510632, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211123,Australia,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol,Asia-Pacific journal of clinical oncology,101241430,IM,,2021/11/24 06:00,2021/11/24 06:00,['2021/11/23 06:56'],"['2021/10/09 00:00 [revised]', '2021/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/23 06:56 [entrez]', '2021/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ajco.13723 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol. 2021 Nov 23. doi: 10.1111/ajco.13723.,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3176-8800', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0974-4036', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7044-7663']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD57', 'KLRG1', 'TIGIT', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'natural killer cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Existing publications describing this finding are limited to small studies and case reports. Our objective was to determine the incidence of hypoglycemia during maintenance chemotherapy and to investigate the association of age, as well as other potential risk factors, with this outcome in pediatric patients with ALL. PROCEDURE: This retrospective cohort study included individuals 1 to 21 years of age with ALL treated with antimetabolite-containing maintenance chemotherapy at a large children's hospital between January 2011 and December 2014. The primary endpoint was time to first documented episode of hypoglycemia during maintenance therapy, defined as single measurement of plasma glucose <60 mg/dL. Cox regression was used to evaluate the association with age and identify other potential risk factors. RESULTS: We identified 126 eligible patients, of whom 63% were documented as White, non-Hispanic, 28% as non-White, non-Hispanic, and 9% as Hispanic. Twenty-eight children (22%) had documented hypoglycemia during maintenance therapy. Younger age at the start of maintenance and hepatotoxicity documented during chemotherapy prior to maintenance initiation were associated with hypoglycemia (adjusted HR age = 0.88; 95% CI, 0.78-0.99; adjusted HR prior hepatotoxicity = 3.50; 95% CI, 1.47-8.36). CONCLUSIONS: Nearly one quarter of children in our cohort had hypoglycemia documented during maintenance chemotherapy. Younger age at maintenance initiation and hepatotoxicity during chemotherapy prior to maintenance initiation emerged as risk factors.

As cell proliferation is disturbed by injury and required for normal brain development, we investigated how a pediatric closed head injury (CHI) would affect the progenitors of the subventricular zone (SVZ). Additionally, we evaluated the contribution of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) using germline LIF heterozygous mice (LIF Het), as LIF is an injury-induced cytokine, known to influence neurogenesis and gliogenesis. CHIs were performed on P20 LIF Het and wild-type (WT) mice. Ki-67 immunostaining and stereology revealed that cell proliferation increased ~250% in injured LIF Het mice compared to the 30% increase observed in injured WT mice at 48-hr post-CHI. OLIG2+ cell proliferation increased in the SVZ and white matter of LIF Het injured mice at 48-hr recovery. Using an 8-color flow cytometry panel, the proliferation of three distinct multipotential progenitors and early oligodendrocyte progenitor cell proliferation was significantly increased in LIF Het injured mice compared to WT injured mice. Supporting its cytostatic function, LIF decreased neurosphere progenitor and oligodendrocyte progenitor cell proliferation compared to controls. In highly enriched mouse oligodendrocyte progenitor cell cultures, LIF increased phospho-protein kinase B after 20 min and increased phospho-S6 ribosomal protein at 20 and 40 min of exposure, which are downstream targets of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. Altogether, our data provide new insights into the regulatory role of LIF in suppressing neural progenitor cell proliferation and, in particular, oligodendrocyte progenitor cell proliferation after a mild TBI.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Frondelli, Michelle J', 'Mather, Marie L', 'Levison, Steven W']","['Frondelli MJ', 'Mather ML', 'Levison SW']","['Department of Pharmacology, Physiology & Neuroscience, New Jersey Medical School, Rutgers University, Newark, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Physiology & Neuroscience, New Jersey Medical School, Rutgers University, Newark, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Physiology & Neuroscience, New Jersey Medical School, Rutgers University, Newark, NJ, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211122,United States,J Neurosci Res,Journal of neuroscience research,7600111,IM,,2021/11/24 06:00,2021/11/24 06:00,['2021/11/23 06:48'],"['2021/09/28 00:00 [revised]', '2021/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/23 06:48 [entrez]', '2021/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jnr.24984 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Neurosci Res. 2021 Nov 22. doi: 10.1002/jnr.24984.,,"['CBIR19Felo14/New Jersey Commission on Brain Injury Research', 'CBIR13IRG0170/New Jersey Commission on Brain Injury Research']",,['NOTNLM'],"['RRID:AB_10366688', 'RRID:AB_10854564', 'RRID:AB_10926202', 'RRID:AB_1500674', 'RRID:AB_1953269', 'RRID:AB_2099233', 'RRID:AB_2315049', 'RRID:AB_2340667', 'RRID:AB_2340696', 'RRID:AB_2340854', 'RRID:AB_2492289', 'RRID:AB_2539705', 'RRID:AB_2733473', 'RRID:AB_2734873', 'RRID:AB_2751913', 'RRID:AB_329827', 'RRID:AB_331355', 'RRID:AB_443209', 'RRID:AB_570666', 'RRID:AB_916156', 'RRID:AB_91789', 'cell proliferation', 'cytokines', 'gliogenesis', 'neurotrauma', 'regenerative medicine']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we tested the hypothesis that metabolic stress induces breast cancer stem-like cell (BCSC) phenotype in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). METHODS: Flow cytometry for GD2 expression, mass spectrometry and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis for metabolomics, bioinformatics, in vitro tumorigenesis and in vivo models were used. RESULTS: Serum/glucose deprivation not only increased stress markers but also enhanced GD2(+) BCSC phenotype and function in TNBC cells. Global metabolomics profiling identified upregulation of glutathione biosynthesis in GD2(high) cells, suggesting a role of glutamine in the BCSC phenotype. Cueing from the upregulation of the glutamine transporters in primary breast tumours, inhibition of glutamine uptake using small-molecule inhibitor V9302 reduced GD2(+) cells by 70-80% and BCSC characteristics in TNBC cells. Mechanistic studies revealed inhibition of the mTOR pathway and induction of ferroptosis by V9302 in TNBC cells. Finally, inhibition of glutamine uptake significantly reduced in vivo tumour growth in a TNBC patient-derived xenograft model using NSG (non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency with a complete null allele of the IL-2 receptor common gamma chain) mice. CONCLUSION: Here, we show metabolic stress results in GD2(+) BCSC phenotype in TNBC and glutamine contributes to GD2(+) phenotype, and targeting the glutamine transporters could complement conventional chemotherapy in TNBC.","['(c) 2021.

FLT3 gene alterations that lead the kinase to assume its permanently active form, such as internal tandem duplication (ITD) and D835Y substitution, are found in 30-40% of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients. Thus, drugs for molecular targeting of FLT3 mutants have been developed for the treatment of AML. Several groups have reported that compared with wild-type FLT3 (FLT3-wt), FLT3 mutants are retained in organelles, resulting in low levels of PM localization of the receptor. However, the precise subcellular localization of mutant FLT3 remains unclear, and the relationship between oncogenic signaling and the mislocalization is not completely understood. In this study, we show that in cell lines established from leukemia patients, endogenous FLT3-ITD but not FLT3-wt clearly accumulates in the perinuclear region. Our co-immunofluorescence assays demonstrate that Golgi markers are co-localized with the perinuclear region, indicating that FLT3-ITD mainly localizes to the Golgi region in AML cells. FLT3-ITD biosynthetically traffics to the Golgi apparatus and remains there in a manner dependent on its tyrosine kinase activity. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as quizartinib (AC220) and midostaurin (PKC412), markedly decrease FLT3-ITD retention and increase PM levels of the mutant. FLT3-ITD activates downstream in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus during its biosynthetic trafficking. Results of our trafficking inhibitor treatment assays show that FLT3-ITD in the ER activates STAT5, whereas that in the Golgi can cause the activation of AKT and ERK. We provide evidence that FLT3-ITD signals from the early secretory compartments before reaching the PM in AML cells.",['(c) 2021.

RESULTS: Compared with NHANES (n=584), survivors (n=164; 44.5% female, median age 28 years [range: 16-38 years]; median 17.4 years [range: 13-22 years] since cancer diagnosis; median doxorubicin dose 300 mg/m2; 30.5% chest radiation) had similar rates of obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, but more pre-hypertension/hypertension (38.4% vs. 30.1%, p=0.044). Survivors had fewer metabolic syndrome features compared with NHANES (2 or more features: 26.7% vs. 55.9%; p<0.001). Survivors were more physically active and smoked tobacco less (both p<0.0001). Therefore, general population cardiovascular risk scores were lower for survivors vs. NHANES. However, with CCSS models, 30.5% of survivors were at moderate risk of ischemic heart disease, and >95% at moderate/high risk for heart failure, with a 9-12% predicted incidence of these conditions by age 50 years. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood cancer survivors exhibited similar or better cardiometabolic and lifestyle profiles compared with NHANES, but nonetheless are at risk for future clinically-significant cardiovascular disease. IMPACT: Further strategies supporting optimal CRF control are warranted in survivors.","['Copyright (c)2021, American Association for Cancer Research.']","['Lipshultz, Emma R', 'Chow, Eric J', 'Doody, David R', 'Armenian, Saro H', 'Asselin, Barbara L', 'Baker, K Scott', 'Bhatia, Smita', 'Constine, Louis S', 'Freyer, David R', 'Kopp, Lisa M', 'Schwartz, Cindy L', 'Lipshultz, Steven E', 'Vrooman, Lynda M']","['Lipshultz ER', 'Chow EJ', 'Doody DR', 'Armenian SH', 'Asselin BL', 'Baker KS', 'Bhatia S', 'Constine LS', 'Freyer DR', 'Kopp LM', 'Schwartz CL', 'Lipshultz SE', 'Vrooman LM']","['University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.', 'Clinical Research and Public Health Sciences Divisions, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.', 'Division of Public Health Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.', 'Population Sciences, City of Hope.', 'Pediatrics, Univ. of Rochester, NY.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.', 'Institute for Cancer Outcomes and Survivorship and Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University of Alabama at Birmingham.', 'Radiation Oncology and Pediatrics, University of Rochester Medical Center.', ""Divisions of Hematology, Oncology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Children's Hospital of Los Angeles."", 'University of Arizona.', ""Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Wisconsin."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University at Buffalo, State University of New York.', 'Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Lynda_Vrooman@dfci.harvard.edu.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211122,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,IM,,2021/11/24 06:00,2021/11/24 06:00,['2021/11/23 05:53'],"['2021/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2021/07/07 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/23 05:53 [entrez]', '2021/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/24 06:00 [medline]']","['1055-9965.EPI-21-0360 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-21-0360 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2021 Nov 22. pii: 1055-9965.EPI-21-0360. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-21-0360.,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7712-961X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2291-6493', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2604-8603', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9709-3415', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7755-5683', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5280-990X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6269-021X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2077-6178']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, morbidity in survivors constitutes a potential increasing burden not limited to secondary health care. Our objectives were to compare health care utilisation, including both primary and secondary health care, between childhood ALL survivors and matched references up to 15 years after curative treatment. Moreover, to increase knowledge on survivors' health service seeking behaviour as time from treatment elapsed. DESIGN AND SETTING: A Danish population-based matched cohort study linking multiple nationwide registries. PARTICIPANTS: 675 cases, diagnosed with childhood (1.0-17.9 years) ALL between 1994 and 2015, and 6750 matched references sampled randomly from the source population (matched on age, gender and geographical region). PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Repeated consultations in general practice and hospital (outpatient and inpatient) estimated as yearly rates from 2.5 years after diagnosis and onwards. We compared cases and references with yearly incidence rate ratios (IRRs) from negative binomial regression models. RESULTS: Survivors of childhood ALL had a mean number of yearly daytime contacts in general practice of 4.75 (95% CI 4.41 to 5.11) the first year, corresponding to an IRR of 1.85 (95% CI 1.71 to 2.00); decreasing to 1.16 (1.01 to 1.34) after 15 years, and without significant impact of gender (p=0.894) or age (p=0.399). For hospital contacts, ALL survivors had a mean number of yearly contacts of 14.21 (13.38-15.08) the first year, corresponding to an IRR of 31.50 (28.29-35.07); decreasing to 2.42 (1.59-3.68) after 15 years. No differences were found across calendar time. CONCLUSIONS: ALL survivors used significantly more health care services across sectors than the reference population. Decreasing use over 15 years illustrated the dynamics of health care needs; this knowledge may inform the future organisation of integrated follow-up programmes.

Some studies have shown that BTKi can also lead to improvements in T cell immunity in patients despite in vitro analyses suggesting an immunosuppressive effect of BTKi on T cell function. METHODS: In this study, we examined both the in vitro effect and long-term in vivo effect of two clinically available BTKi, ibrutinib and zanubrutinib. Additional in vitro assessments were undertaken for a third BTKi, acalabrutinib. Immune subset phenotyping, cytokine secretion, T cell degranulation and proliferation assays were performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from untreated CLL patients, and CLL patients on long-term (> 12 months) BTKi treatment. RESULTS: Similar to prior studies we observed that long-term BTKi treatment normalises lymphocyte subset frequency and reduces PD-1 expression on T cells. We also observed that T cells from patients taken prior to BTKi therapy showed an abnormal hyper-proliferation pattern typical of senescent T cells, which was normalised by long-term BTKi treatment. Furthermore, BTKi therapy resulted in reduced expression of the T cell exhaustion markers PD-1, TIM3 and LAG3 in late generations of T cells undergoing proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these findings indicate that there are critical differences between the in vitro effects of BTKi on T cell function and the effects derived from long-term BTKi exposure in vivo. Overall long-term exposure to BTKi, and particularly ibrutinib, resulted in improved T cell fitness in part due to suppressing the abnormal hyper-proliferation of CLL T cells and the associated development of T cell senescence.",['(c) 2021.

However, the expression pattern and clinical implication of NEDD4L in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains poorly defined. METHODS: We systemically determined NEDD4L expression with its clinical significance in AML by both public data and our research cohort. Moreover, biological functions of NEDD4L in leukemogenesis were further tested by in vitro experiments. RESULTS: By the public data, we identified that low NEDD4L expression was correlated with AML among diverse human cancers. Expression of NEDD4L was remarkably decreased in AML compared with controls, and was confirmed by our research cohort. Clinically, low expression of NEDD4L was correlated with greatly lower age, higher white blood cells, and higher bone marrow/peripheral blood blasts. Moreover, NEDD4L underexpression was positively correlated with normal karyotype, FLT3 and NPM1 mutations, but negatively associated with complex karyotype and TP53 mutations. Importantly, the association between NEDD4L expression and survival was also discovered in cytogenetically normal AML patients. Finally, a number of 1024 RNAs and 91 microRNAs were identified to be linked to NEDD4L expression in AML. Among the negatively correlated microRNAs, miR-10a was also discovered as a microRNA that may directly target NEDD4L. Further functional studies revealed that NEDD4L exhibited anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in leukemic cell line K562. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that NEDD4L underexpression, as a frequent event in AML, was associated with genetic abnormalities and prognosis in AML. Moreover, NEDD4L expression may be involved in leukemogenesis with potential therapeutic target value.",['(c) 2021.

It carries a poor prognosis secondary to poor response to therapy or rapid disease relapse. Currently there are no randomized trials to guide treatment. Therapeutic decisions are often influenced by the presence or absence of a clonal relationship between the underlying CLL/SLL and the new lymphoma given the poor prognosis of patients with clonally related RT. Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) can help to establish clonality while also detecting genomic complexity and clinically relevant genetic variants such as loss of CDKN2A and/or TP53. As a result, CMA has potential prognostic and therapeutic implications. For this study, CMA results from patients with Richter transformation were evaluated in paired CLL/SLL and transformed lymphoma samples.

Several causes have been reported as prognostic factors for AML in children and adults, the most important of which are cytogenetic abnormalities and environmental risk factors. Following the discovery of numerous drugs for AML treatment, leukemic cells sought a way to escape from the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy drugs, leading to treatment failure. Nowadays, comprehensive studies have looked at the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by AML blasts and how the microenvironment of the tumor changes in favor of cancer progression and survival to discover the mechanisms of treatment failure to choose the well-advised treatment. Reports show that malignant cells secrete EVs that transmit messages to adjacent cells and the tumor's microenvironment. By secreting EVs, containing immune-inhibiting cytokines, AML cells inactivate the immune system against malignant cells, thus ensuring their survival. Also, increased secretion of EVs in various malignancies indicates an unfavorable prognostic factor and the possibility of drug resistance. In this study, we briefly reviewed the challenges of treating AML with a glance at the EVs' role in this process. It is hoped that with a deeper understanding of EVs, new therapies will be developed to eliminate the relapse of leukemic cells.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite advances in the treatment of younger patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the prognosis of elderly patients remains poor, with a high frequency of relapse. The cytotoxicity of canthin-6-one alkaloids has been extensively studied in different cell types, including leukemic strains. Among the canthin-6-one analogs tested, 10-methoxycanthin-6-one (Mtx-C) showed the highest cytotoxicity in the malignant AML cells Kasumi-1 and KG-1. Thus, we evaluated the cytotoxicity and cell death mechanisms related to Mtx-C using the EC50 (80 microM for Kasumi-1 and 36 microM for KG-1) treatment for 24 h. Our results identify reactive oxygen species production, mitochondrial depolarization, annexin V-FITC/7-AAD double staining, caspase cleave and upregulation of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis proteins (Bax, Bim, Bik, Puma and phosphorylation of p53) for both cell lineages. However, downregulation of Bcl-2 and the simultaneous execution of the apoptotic and necroptotic programs associated with the phosphorylation of the proteins receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 and mixed lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase occurred only in Kasumi-1 cells. About the lasted events, Kasumi-1 cell death was inhibited by pharmacological agents such as Zvad-FMK and necrostatin-1. The underlying molecular mechanisms of Mtx-C still include participation in the DNA damage and stress-signaling pathways involving p38 and c-Jun N-terminal mitogen-activated protein kinases and interaction with DNA. Thus, Mtx-C represents a promising tool for the development of new antileukemic molecules.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a hematologic malignancy occurring in 15 % of pediatric and 25 % of adult ALL cases. Infiltration and metastasis of leukemic cells to specific organs are consequences of disease relapse and dismal prognosis. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified to function in the migration, invasion and infiltration of tumors by regulating gene expression. Our previous studies showed that CC chemokine receptor 9 (CCR9), which specifically bind to CC chemokine ligand 25 (CCL25), promotes T-ALL infiltration. METHODS: Bioinformatic methods were used to screen LINC00853 in gene expression omnibus (GEO) datasets. RT-qPCR, western bolt and flow cytometry were applied to detect the expression of LINC00853 and CCR9. Transwell and martrigel-transwell were employed to assess the cells migration and invasion abilities. Fluorescence microscope was applied to observed the green fluorescence protein positive (GFP(+)) cells. Lentivirus and adenovirus were packed to construct nc-blank, sh-LINC00853-blank and sh-LINC00853-rescue jurkat cell lines. RESULTS: In this study, we found out the negative correlation of LINC00853 and CCR9 expression. LINC00853 was downregulated while CCR9 was upregulated in GEO datasets, T-ALL cell lines and clinical samples. Moreover, LINC00853 suppressed jurkat cells migration and invasion in vitro and restrained infiltration in liver, spleen, kidney, lung, brain, ovary of nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that LINC00853 restrains T-ALL cell invasion and infiltration by regulating CCR9/CCL25.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd..

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), internal tandem duplications of fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3-ITD) constitutively activate the FLT3 receptor, producing aberrant STAT5 signaling, driving cell survival and proliferation. Understanding STAT5 regulation may aid development of new treatment strategies in STAT5-activated cancers including FLT3-ITD AML. Poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP1), upregulated in FLT3-ITD AML, is primarily known as a DNA repair factor, but also regulates a diverse range of proteins through PARylation. Analysis of STAT5 protein sequence revealed putative PARylation sites and we demonstrate a novel PARP1 interaction and direct PARylation of STAT5 in FLT3-ITD AML. Moreover, PARP1 depletion and PARylation inhibition decreased STAT5 protein expression and activity via increased degradation, suggesting that PARP1 PARylation of STAT5 at least in part potentiates aberrant signaling by stabilizing STAT5 protein in FLT3-ITD AML. Importantly for translational significance, PARPis are cytotoxic in numerous STAT5-activated cancer cells and are synergistic with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in both TKI-sensitive and TKI-resistant FLT3-ITD AML. Therefore, PARPi may have therapeutic benefit in STAT5-activated and therapy-resistant leukemias and solid tumors.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

We conducted a randomized phase II trial of GVAX after HSCT for MDS-EB or relapsed/refractory AML. Myeloblasts were harvested before HSCT to generate the vaccine. Randomization to GVAX vs. placebo (1:1) was stratified by disease, transplant center, and conditioning. GVHD prophylaxis included tacrolimus and methotrexate. GVAX or placebo started between day +30-45 if there was engraftment and no GVHD. Vaccines were administered SC/ID weekly x 3, then q2 wks x 3. Tacrolimus taper began after vaccine completion. 123 patients enrolled, 92 proceeded to HSCT, and 57 (GVAX 30, Placebo 27) received at least 1 vaccination. No CTC grade >/= 3 vaccine related adverse events were reported, but injection site reactions were more common after GVAX (10 vs. 1, p=0.006). With a median follow up of 39 months (range, 9-89), 18-month PFS, OS and relapse incidence were 53% vs 55% (p=0.79), 63% vs. 59% (p= 0.86), and 30% vs. 37% (p=0.51) for GVAX and placebo, respectively. NRM at 18 months was 17% vs. 7.7% (p=0.18), Grade II-IV aGVHD at 12 months 34% vs. 12% (p=0.13), and cGVHD at 3 years 49% vs. 57% for GVAX and placebo, respectively, p=0.26. Reconstitution of T, B, and NK cells were not decreased or enhanced by GVAX. There were no differences in serum MICA/B or other immune biomarkers between GVAX and placebo.

Here, we analyzed the physiological activities of all 17 human T-box genes in early hematopoiesis and in lymphopoiesis including developing and mature B-cells, T-cells, natural killer (NK)-cells and innate lymphoid cells. The resultant expression pattern comprised six genes, namely EOMES, MGA, TBX1, TBX10, TBX19 and TBX21. We termed this gene signature TBX-code which enables discrimination of normal and aberrant activities of T-box genes in lymphoid malignancies. Accordingly, expression analysis of T-box genes in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patients using a public profiling dataset revealed overexpression of EOMES, TBX1, TBX2, TBX3, TBX10, TBX19, TBX21 and TBXT while MGA showed aberrant downregulation. Analysis of T-cell acute lymphoid leukemia patients indicated aberrant overexpression of six T-box genes while no deregulated T-box genes were detected in anaplastic large cell lymphoma patients. As a paradigm we focused on TBX3 which was ectopically activated in about 6% of HL patients analyzed. Normally, TBX3 is expressed in tissues like lung, adrenal gland and retina but not in hematopoiesis. HL cell line KM-H2 expressed enhanced TBX3 levels and was used as an in vitro model to identify upstream regulators and downstream targets in this malignancy. Genomic studies of this cell line showed focal amplification of the TBX3 locus at 12q24 which may underlie its aberrant expression. In addition, promoter analysis and comparative expression profiling of HL cell lines followed by knockdown experiments revealed overexpressed transcription factors E2F4 and FOXC1 and chromatin modulator KDM2B as functional activators. Furthermore, we identified repressed target genes of TBX3 in HL including CDKN2A, NFKBIB and CD19, indicating its respective oncogenic function in proliferation, NFkB-signaling and B-cell differentiation. Taken together, we have revealed a lymphoid TBX-code and used it to identify an aberrant network around deregulated T-box gene TBX3 in HL which promotes hallmark aberrations of this disease. These findings provide a framework for future studies to evaluate deregulated T-box genes in lymphoid malignancies.",,"['Nagel, Stefan', 'Meyer, Corinna']","['Nagel S', 'Meyer C']","['Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211122,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2021/11/23 06:00,2022/01/04 06:00,['2021/11/22 17:21'],"['2021/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/22 17:21 [entrez]', '2021/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0259674 [doi]', 'PONE-D-21-22757 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2021 Nov 22;16(11):e0259674. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0259674. eCollection 2021.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-4431-8988'],,PMC8608327,,,20220103,"['0 (EOMES protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (T-Box Domain Protein 2)', '0 (T-Box Domain Proteins)', '0 (T-box transcription factor TBX21)', '0 (TBX10 protein, human)', '0 (TBX19 protein, human)', '0 (TBX3 protein, human)']",,"['Hodgkin Disease/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/metabolism', 'Lymphopoiesis/physiology', 'T-Box Domain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,

In an initial screen, the compounds exhibited low nanomolar potency against both STK3 and STK4. Crystallization of compound 6 with STK4 revealed two-point hinge binding in the ATP-binding pocket. Further characterization and analysis demonstrated that compound 20 (SBP-3264) specifically inhibited the Hippo signaling pathway in cultured mammalian cells and possessed favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties in mice. We show that genetic knockdown and pharmacological inhibition of STK3 and STK4 suppress the proliferation of AML cells in vitro.

Despite remarkable improvements in diagnosis and treatment, the long-term outcomes for this entity remain unsatisfactory. Emerging evidence suggests that leukaemia, similar to other malignant diseases, employs various mechanisms to evade killing by immune cells. However, the mechanism of immune escape in NPM1-mutated AML remains unknown. In this study, both serum and leukemic cells from patients with NPM1-mutated AML impaired the immune function of CD8+ T cells in a co-culture system. Mechanistically, leukemic cells secreted miR-19a-3p into the tumour microenvironment (TME) via small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), which was controlled by the NPM1-mutated protein/CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)/poly (A)-binding protein cytoplasmic 1 (PABPC1) signalling axis. sEV-related miR-19a-3p was internalized by CD8+ T cells and directly repressed the expression of solute-carrier family 6 member 8 (SLC6A8; a creatine-specific transporter) to inhibit creatine import. Decreased creatine levels can reduce ATP production and impair CD8+ T cell immune function, leading to immune escape by leukemic cells.

Eleven nineteen Lysine rich Leukemia (ELL) and ELL Associated Factors (EAF) family of conserved proteins are required for efficient RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription elongation. Orthologs of these proteins have been identified in different organisms, including fission yeast and humans. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the present study, we have examined the sequence, structural and functional conservation between the fission yeast and human ELL and EAF orthologs. Our computational analysis revealed that these proteins share some sequence characteristics, and were predominantly disordered in both organisms. Our functional complementation assays revealed that both human ELL and EAF proteins could complement the lack of ell1(+) or eaf1(+) in Schizosaccharomyces pombe respectively. Furthermore, our domain mapping experiments demonstrated that both the amino and carboxyl terminal domains of human EAF proteins could functionally complement the S. pombe eaf1 deletion phenotypes. However, only the carboxyl-terminus domain of human ELL was able to partially rescue the phenotypes associated with lack of ell1(+) in S. pombe. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our work adds ELL-EAF to the increasing list of human-yeast complementation gene pairs, wherein the simpler fission yeast can be used to further enhance our understanding of the role of these proteins in transcription elongation and human disease.","['(c) 2021.

Analysis includes evaluation of antigen expression patterns in granulocytes of which, for example, partial lack of CD16 may indicate dysplasia, but presence of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)-type cells should be considered. However, diagnostic bone marrow (BM) samples hamper PNH analysis because immature stages in the granulo-/monocytic compartment lack expression of certain glycophosphatidyl-inositol-anchored proteins. In this prospective study, we evaluated the presence of PNH-type cells in BM next to aberrancies from routine MDS immunophenotyping. METHODS: We combined antibodies defining maturation trajectories with FLAER. Validation of the designed method against routine PNH analysis and parallel analysis of BM and blood samples revealed similar results (granulocytes: Wilcoxon p = 0.25 and p = 0.82, respectively). We analyzed BM samples from 134 MDS, 17 chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, 15 aplastic anemia (AA), 1 PNH, 51 non-clonal cytopenic controls, and 12 normal controls. RESULTS: Most AA/PNH-BM samples showed clear PNH clones: median 1.1% (0%-35%); CD16 loss on mature neutrophils paralleled PNH-clone sizes. In MDS-BM, only 3.7% of cases showed >/=0.1% PNH-type cells, whereas partial CD16 loss was more frequent and abundant. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm that dysplastic features in MDS-BM may point to presence of PNH-type cells, though only few cases displayed FLAER-negative cells. We showed that identification of these cells in the granulocyte compartment of BM specimen is feasible, but-according to international guidelines-results need to be confirmed in peripheral blood.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Among these enzymes, SETD1B (SET domain containing 1b) has been linked to syndromic intellectual disability in human subjects, but its role in the mammalian postnatal brain has not been studied yet. Here, we employ mice deficient for Setd1b in excitatory neurons of the postnatal forebrain, and combine neuron-specific ChIP-seq and RNA-seq approaches to elucidate its role in neuronal gene expression. We observe that Setd1b controls the expression of a set of genes with a broad H3K4me3 peak at their promoters, enriched for neuron-specific genes linked to learning and memory function. Comparative analyses in mice with conditional deletion of Kmt2a and Kmt2b histone methyltransferases show that SETD1B plays a more pronounced and potent role in regulating such genes. Moreover, postnatal loss of Setd1b leads to severe learning impairment, suggesting that SETD1B-dependent regulation of H3K4me levels in postnatal neurons is critical for cognitive function.",['(c) 2021 The Authors Published under the terms of the CC BY NC ND 4.0 license.'],"['Michurina, Alexandra', 'Sakib, M Sadman', 'Kerimoglu, Cemil', 'Kruger, Dennis Manfred', 'Kaurani, Lalit', 'Islam, Md Rezaul', 'Joshi, Parth Devesh', 'Schroder, Sophie', 'Centeno, Tonatiuh Pena', 'Zhou, Jiayin', 'Pradhan, Ranjit', 'Cha, Julia', 'Xu, Xingbo', 'Eichele, Gregor', 'Zeisberg, Elisabeth M', 'Kranz, Andrea', 'Stewart, A Francis', 'Fischer, Andre']","['Michurina A', 'Sakib MS', 'Kerimoglu C', 'Kruger DM', 'Kaurani L', 'Islam MR', 'Joshi PD', 'Schroder S', 'Centeno TP', 'Zhou J', 'Pradhan R', 'Cha J', 'Xu X', 'Eichele G', 'Zeisberg EM', 'Kranz A', 'Stewart AF', 'Fischer A']","['Department for Systems Medicine and Epigenetics, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Gottingen, Germany.', 'Department for Systems Medicine and Epigenetics, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Gottingen, Germany.', 'Department for Systems Medicine and Epigenetics, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Gottingen, Germany.', 'Department for Systems Medicine and Epigenetics, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Gottingen, Germany.', 'Department for Systems Medicine and Epigenetics, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Gottingen, Germany.', 'Department for Systems Medicine and Epigenetics, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Gottingen, Germany.', 'Department for Gene and Behavior, Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Department for Systems Medicine and Epigenetics, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Gottingen, Germany.', 'Department for Systems Medicine and Epigenetics, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Gottingen, Germany.', 'Department for Systems Medicine and Epigenetics, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Gottingen, Germany.', 'Department for Systems Medicine and Epigenetics, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Gottingen, Germany.', 'Department for Systems Medicine and Epigenetics, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Gottingen, Germany.', 'Department of Cardiology and Pneumology, University Medical Center of Gottingen, Georg-August University, Gottingen, Germany.', 'German Centre for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), Partner Site Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Department for Gene and Behavior, Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Department of Cardiology and Pneumology, University Medical Center of Gottingen, Georg-August University, Gottingen, Germany.', 'German Centre for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), Partner Site Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Cluster of Excellence ""Multiscale Bioimaging: from Molecular Machines to Networks of Excitable Cells"" (MBExC), University of Gottingen, Germany.', 'Biotechnology Center, Center for Molecular and Cellular Bioengineering, Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany.', 'Biotechnology Center, Center for Molecular and Cellular Bioengineering, Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany.', 'Max-Planck-Institute for Cell Biology and Genetics, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department for Systems Medicine and Epigenetics, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Gottingen, Germany.', 'Cluster of Excellence ""Multiscale Bioimaging: from Molecular Machines to Networks of Excitable Cells"" (MBExC), University of Gottingen, Germany.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Medical Center Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],['GEO/GSE180326'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20211122,England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,IM,,2021/11/23 06:00,2022/01/13 06:00,['2021/11/22 08:56'],"['2021/10/04 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/13 06:00 [medline]', '2021/11/22 08:56 [entrez]']",['10.15252/embj.2020106459 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 2022 Jan 4;41(1):e106459. doi: 10.15252/embj.2020106459.

However, public debate over the safety of the trivalent MMR vaccine and the resultant drop in vaccination coverage in several countries persists, despite its almost universal use and accepted effectiveness. This is an update of a review published in 2005 and updated in 2012. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness, safety, and long- and short-term adverse effects associated with the trivalent vaccine, containing measles, rubella, mumps strains (MMR), or concurrent administration of MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine (MMR+V), or tetravalent vaccine containing measles, rubella, mumps, and varicella strains (MMRV), given to children aged up to 15 years. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library 2019, Issue 5), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to 2 May 2019), Embase (1974 to 2 May 2019), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (2 May 2019), and ClinicalTrials.gov (2 May 2019). SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), prospective and retrospective cohort studies (PCS/RCS), case-control studies (CCS), interrupted time-series (ITS) studies, case cross-over (CCO) studies, case-only ecological method (COEM) studies, self-controlled case series (SCCS) studies, person-time cohort (PTC) studies, and case-coverage design/screening methods (CCD/SM) studies, assessing any combined MMR or MMRV / MMR+V vaccine given in any dose, preparation or time schedule compared with no intervention or placebo, on healthy children up to 15 years of age. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of the included studies. We grouped studies for quantitative analysis according to study design, vaccine type (MMR, MMRV, MMR+V), virus strain, and study settings. Outcomes of interest were cases of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella, and harms. Certainty of evidence of was rated using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: We included 138 studies (23,480,668 participants). Fifty-one studies (10,248,159 children) assessed vaccine effectiveness and 87 studies (13,232,509 children) assessed the association between vaccines and a variety of harms. We included 74 new studies to this 2019 version of the review. Effectiveness Vaccine effectiveness in preventing measles was 95% after one dose (relative risk (RR) 0.05, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.13; 7 cohort studies; 12,039 children; moderate certainty evidence) and 96% after two doses (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.28; 5 cohort studies; 21,604 children; moderate certainty evidence). The effectiveness in preventing cases among household contacts or preventing transmission to others the children were in contact with after one dose was 81% (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.89; 3 cohort studies; 151 children; low certainty evidence), after two doses 85% (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.75; 3 cohort studies; 378 children; low certainty evidence), and after three doses was 96% (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.23; 2 cohort studies; 151 children; low certainty evidence). The effectiveness (at least one dose) in preventing measles after exposure (post-exposure prophylaxis) was 74% (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.50; 2 cohort studies; 283 children; low certainty evidence). The effectiveness of Jeryl Lynn containing MMR vaccine in preventing mumps was 72% after one dose (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.76; 6 cohort studies; 9915 children; moderate certainty evidence), 86% after two doses (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.35; 5 cohort studies; 7792 children; moderate certainty evidence). Effectiveness in preventing cases among household contacts was 74% (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.49; 3 cohort studies; 1036 children; moderate certainty evidence). Vaccine effectiveness against rubella, using a vaccine with the BRD2 strain which is only used in China, is 89% (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.42; 1 cohort study; 1621 children; moderate certainty evidence). Vaccine effectiveness against varicella (any severity) after two doses in children aged 11 to 22 months is 95% in a 10 years follow-up (rate ratio (rr) 0.05, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.08; 1 RCT; 2279 children; high certainty evidence). Safety There is evidence supporting an association between aseptic meningitis and MMR vaccines containing Urabe and Leningrad-Zagreb mumps strains, but no evidence supporting this association for MMR vaccines containing Jeryl Lynn mumps strains (rr 1.30, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.56; low certainty evidence). The analyses provide evidence supporting an association between MMR/MMR+V/MMRV vaccines (Jeryl Lynn strain) and febrile seizures. Febrile seizures normally occur in 2% to 4% of healthy children at least once before the age of 5. The attributable risk febrile seizures vaccine-induced is estimated to be from 1 per 1700 to 1 per 1150 administered doses. The analyses provide evidence supporting an association between MMR vaccination and idiopathic thrombocytopaenic purpura (ITP). However, the risk of ITP after vaccination is smaller than after natural infection with these viruses. Natural infection of ITP occur in 5 cases per 100,000 (1 case per 20,000) per year. The attributable risk is estimated about 1 case of ITP per 40,000 administered MMR doses. There is no evidence of an association between MMR immunisation and encephalitis or encephalopathy (rate ratio 0.90, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.61; 2 observational studies; 1,071,088 children; low certainty evidence), and autistic spectrum disorders (rate ratio 0.93, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.01; 2 observational studies; 1,194,764 children; moderate certainty). There is insufficient evidence to determine the association between MMR immunisation and inflammatory bowel disease (odds ratio 1.42, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.16; 3 observational studies; 409 cases and 1416 controls; moderate certainty evidence). Additionally, there is no evidence supporting an association between MMR immunisation and cognitive delay, type 1 diabetes, asthma, dermatitis/eczema, hay fever, leukaemia, multiple sclerosis, gait disturbance, and bacterial or viral infections. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Existing evidence on the safety and effectiveness of MMR/MMRV vaccines support their use for mass immunisation. Campaigns aimed at global eradication should assess epidemiological and socioeconomic situations of the countries as well as the capacity to achieve high vaccination coverage. More evidence is needed to assess whether the protective effect of MMR/MMRV could wane with time since immunisation.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The Cochrane Collaboration.

However, sphingolipid metabolism-mediated anti-leukemic actions of resveratrol in Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph + ALL) remain unknown. Therefore, we explored potential mechanisms behind resveratrol-mediated cytotoxicity in SD1 and SUP-B15 Ph + ALL cells in the context of sphingolipid metabolism and apoptosis induction. The anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of resveratrol alone and in combination with SPT inhibitor (myriocin), SK inhibitor (SKI II), GCS inhibitor (PDMP) were determined by MTT cell proliferation assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The effects of resveratrol on PARP cleavage, SPT, SK and GCS protein levels were investigated by Western blot. Resveratrol inhibited proliferation and triggered apoptosis via PARP activation and externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS). Resveratrol increased the expression of SPT whereas it downregulated SK and GCS. Resveratrol's combinations with SKI II and PDMP intensified its anti-leukemic activity by increasing the relocalization of PS while its combination with myriocin suppressed apoptosis. Therefore, resveratrol inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis through modulating SK, GCS and SPT expression, which may be considered as novel biomarkers of resveratrol-induced cytotoxicity in Ph + ALL.",,"['Oguz, Osman', 'Adan, Aysun']","['Oguz O', 'Adan A']","['Program of Bioengineering, Graduate School of Engineering and Science, Abdullah Gul University, Kayseri, Turkey.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Life and Natural Sciences, Abdullah Gul University, Kayseri, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211122,United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,IM,,2021/11/23 06:00,2021/11/23 06:00,['2021/11/22 08:47'],"['2021/11/22 08:47 [entrez]', '2021/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/01635581.2021.2005806 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Nutr Cancer. 2021 Nov 22:1-14. doi: 10.1080/01635581.2021.2005806.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-3747-8580'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Molecular monitoring, particularly with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to measure immunoglobin heavy or kappa chain (Ig) or T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements, offers high sensitivity but accessibility is limited by expertise, cost, and turnaround time. Flow cytometric assays are cheaper and more widely available, and sensitivity is improved with multi-parameter flow cytometry at eight or more colors. METHODS: We developed a 10-color single tube flow cytometry assay. Samples were subject to bulk ammonium chloride lysis to maximize cell yields with a target of 1 x 10(6) events. Once normal maturation patterns were established, patient samples were analyzed in parallel to standard molecular monitoring. RESULTS: Flow cytometry was performed on 114 samples. An informative immunophenotype was identifiable in all 22 patients who had a diagnostic sample. MRD analysis was performed on 87 samples. The median lower limits of detection and quantification were 0.004% (range 0.0005%-0.028%) and 0.01% (range 0.001%-0.07%) respectively. Sixty-five samples had concurrent molecular MRD testing, with good correlation (r = 0.83, p < 0.001). Results were concordant in 52 samples, and discordant in 13 samples, including one case where impending relapse was detected by flow cytometry but not Ig/TCR qPCR. CONCLUSIONS: Our 10-color flow cytometric MRD assay provided adequate sensitivity and good correlation with molecular assays. This technique offers rapid and affordable testing in B-ALL patients, including cases where a suitable molecular assay cannot be developed or has reduced sensitivity.",['(c) 2021 International Clinical Cytometry Society.'],"['Singh, Jasmine', 'Gorniak, Malgorzata', 'Grigoriadis, George', 'Westerman, David', 'McBean, Michelle', 'Venn, Nicola', 'Law, Tamara', 'Sutton, Rosemary', 'Morgan, Sue', 'Fleming, Shaun']","['Singh J', 'Gorniak M', 'Grigoriadis G', 'Westerman D', 'McBean M', 'Venn N', 'Law T', 'Sutton R', 'Morgan S', 'Fleming S']","['Laboratory Haematology, Alfred Pathology, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Laboratory Haematology, Alfred Pathology, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Laboratory Haematology, Alfred Pathology, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Clinical Haematology, Monash Health, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.', 'Pathology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Pathology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', ""Children's Cancer Institute and School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute and School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute and School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", 'Laboratory Haematology, Alfred Pathology, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Laboratory Haematology, Alfred Pathology, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Clinical Haematology, Monash Health, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211121,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

Somatic hypermutation (SHM) of immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) genes are used as a prognostic marker in B-cell malignancies. Clinically, IGHV mutation status is determined by targeted Sanger sequencing which is a resource-intensive and low-throughput procedure. Here, we describe a bioinformatic pipeline, CRIS (Complete Reconstruction of Immunoglobulin IGHV-D-J Sequences) that uses RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets to reconstruct IGHV-D-J sequences and determine IGHV SHM status. Results: CRIS extracts RNA-seq reads aligned to Ig gene loci, performs assembly of Ig transcripts and aligns the resulting contigs to reference Ig sequences to enumerate and classify SHMs in the IGHV gene sequence. CRIS improves on existing tools that infer the B-cell receptor repertoire from RNA-seq data using a portion IGHV gene segment by de novo assembly. We show that the SHM status identified by CRIS using the entire IGHV gene segment is highly concordant with clinical classification in three independent chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient cohorts.

Oncogenic gene fusions resulting from structural DNA rearrangements have been proposed as a unique class of oncogenic drivers and therapeutic targets. Currently approved TKIs mainly focused on a few well-known fusion genes such as anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and ROS proto-oncogene 1 (ROS1). Fusions involving neuregulin 1 gene (NRG1) have been recently described in a small portion of solid tumors as actionable oncogenic drivers, leading to the activation of the erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog (ErbB)-mediated pathway. Therefore, gene fusions containing NRG1 could serve as a therapeutic candidate for ErbB-targeted treatment. In the present study, we report a lung adenocarcinoma patient harboring the CD74-NRG1 fusion, which was identified by next-generation sequencing (NGS). The patient received the irreversible pan-ErbB inhibitor, afatinib, as first-line treatment and showed a significant treatment response with a progression-free survival of 8 months. After progressive disease (PD), the second NGS did not identify novel genetic alterations that emerged after afatinib resistance. Our case supports the use of ErbB-targeted treatment for NRG1 fusion-positive NSCLC. Further studies are warranted to understand treatment effects and acquired resistance of afatinib in NGR1 fusion-positive patients.",['2021 Annals of Translational Medicine.

Bioinformatics-based analysis of high-frequency mutation genes in MDS-related patients is still relatively rare, so we conducted our research to explore whether high-frequency mutation genes in MDS-related patients can play a reference role in clinical guidance and prognosis. Methods: Next generation sequencing (NGS) technology was used to detect 32 mutations in 64 MDS-related patients. We classified the patients' genes and analyzed them by Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis, and then calculated the gene survival curve of high-frequency mutations. Results: We discovered 32 mutant genes such as ASXL1, DNMT3A, KRAS, NRAS, TP53, SF3B1, and SRSF2. The overall survival (OS) of these genes decreased significantly after DNMT3A, ASXL1, RUNX1, and U2AF1 occurred mutation. These genes play a significant role in biological processes, not only in MDS but also in the occurrence and development of other diseases. Through retrospective analysis, genes associated with MDS-related diseases were identified, and their effects on the disease were predicted. Conclusions: Thirty-two mutant genes were determined in MDS and when mutations occur in DNMT3A, ASXL1, RUNX1, and U2AF1, their survival time decreases significantly.

As such, MRD prior to haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a major factor that is independently correlated with outcome. High burden of MRD is negatively correlated with post-transplant survival, as both the risk of leukaemia recurrence and non-relapse mortality increase with greater levels of MRD. Despite growing evidence supporting these findings, controversies still exist. In particular, it is still not clear whether multiparameter flow cytometry and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, which is used to recognise immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements, can be employed interchangeably. Moreover, the higher sensitivity in MRD quantification offered by next-generation sequencing techniques may further refine the ability to stratify transplant-associated risks. While MRD quantification from bone marrow prior to HSCT remains the state of the art, heavily pre-treated patients may benefit from additional staging, such as using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography to detect focal residues of disease. Additionally, the timing of MRD detection (i.e., immediately before administration of the conditioning regimen or weeks before) is a matter of debate. Pre-transplant MRD negativity has previously been associated with superior outcomes; however, in the recent For Omitting Radiation Under Majority age (FORUM) study, pre-HSCT MRD positivity was associated with neither relapse risk nor survival. In this review, we discuss the level of MRD that may require pre-transplant therapy intensification, risking time delay and complications (as well as losing the window for HSCT if disease progression occurs), as opposed to an adapted post-transplant strategy to achieve long-term remission. Indeed, MRD monitoring may be a valuable tool to guide individualised treatment decisions, including tapering of immunosuppression, cellular therapies (such as donor lymphocyte infusions) or additional immunotherapy (such as bispecific T-cell engagers or chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy).","['Copyright (c) 2021 Merli, Ifversen, Truong, Marquart, Buechner, Wolfl and Bader.']","['Merli, Pietro', 'Ifversen, Marianne', 'Truong, Tony H', 'Marquart, Hanne V', 'Buechner, Jochen', 'Wolfl, Matthias', 'Bader, Peter']","['Merli P', 'Ifversen M', 'Truong TH', 'Marquart HV', 'Buechner J', 'Wolfl M', 'Bader P']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Cell and Gene Therapy, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy."", 'Pediatric Stem Cell Transplant and Immune Deficiency, Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', ""Division of Pediatric Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplant, Alberta Children's Hospital, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada."", 'Section for Diagnostic Immunology, Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', ""Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Children's Hospital, Wurzburg University Hospital, Wurzburg, Germany."", 'Division for Stem Cell Transplantation, Immunology and Intensive Care Medicine, Department for Children and Adolescents, Goethe University, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211105,Switzerland,Front Pediatr,Frontiers in pediatrics,101615492,,"['JB has received personal fees, advisory board/steering committee honoraria, and', 'nonfinancial support from Novartis; and advisory board honoraria from Pfizer,', 'Kite, and Janssen.

Intracranial metastases (IM) rarely occur in patients with NB. The present study aimed to review the clinical characteristics of NB patients from a single center presenting with IM. Methods: Two hundred children (aged 3-91 months) with NB admitted to the Fourth Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University between January 2009 and December 2015 were enrolled, and their clinical characteristics were recorded. The patients were divided into two groups based on the presence of IM. Their clinical characteristics, including demographics, clinical features, and laboratory and imaging studies, were retrospectively analyzed. Results: IM occurred in 22 of 200 (11%) neuroblastoma patients, with a median age of 42.5 months (range, 3-91 months), with a male-to-female ratio of 1.4:1. Seven patients had IM at the initial diagnosis. Among the 15 children who did not have IM at initial presentation, the median interval from presentation to the diagnosis of IM was 17.3 months (range, 1-55 months). Compared with the control group, NB patients with IM tended to be asymptomatic at the time of NB diagnosis, which was made incidentally during routine physical examination (5 of 22, 22.7%, p < 0.05). In addition, this group had more primary intra-abdominal sites (18 of 22, 81.8%, p < 0.001) and worse prognosis (5 of 22, 22.7%, p < 0.05). Conclusions: NB patients with IM have insidious onset in the early stage and a lower survival rate, especially patients with primary intra-abdominal lesions. Regular neurological monitoring could improve the rate of early diagnosis and prognosis of NB children with IM. Familiarity with the characteristic findings of NB with IM is necessary to avoid misdiagnosis and initiate necessary interventions.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Liu, Huo, Zhang and Liu.']","['Liu, Ying', 'Huo, Liang', 'Zhang, Jinhua', 'Liu, Ying']","['Liu Y', 'Huo L', 'Zhang J', 'Liu Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211103,Switzerland,Front Pediatr,Frontiers in pediatrics,101615492,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",2021/11/23 06:00,2021/11/23 06:01,['2021/11/22 06:53'],"['2021/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/22 06:53 [entrez]', '2021/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fped.2021.716880 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pediatr. 2021 Nov 3;9:716880. doi: 10.3389/fped.2021.716880. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8596640,['NOTNLM'],"['intracranial metastasis (IM)', 'neuroblastoma', 'neurologic manifestation', 'pediatric', 'prognosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Antigen selection is key to the pathogenesis of CLL, as evidenced by the remarkable skewing of the BcR IG gene repertoire, culminating in BcR IG stereotypy, referring to the existence of subsets of patients with (quasi)identical BcR IG. Notably, certain of these subsets have been found to display distinct, subset-biased biological background, clinical presentation, and outcome, including the response to treatment. This points to BcR IG centrality while also emphasizing the need to dissect the signaling pathways triggered by the distinctive BcR IG expressed by different subsets, particularly those with aggressive clinical behavior. In this mini-review, we discuss the current knowledge on the implicated signaling pathways as well as the recurrent gene mutations in these pathways that characterize major aggressive stereotyped subsets. Special emphasis is given on the intertwining of BcR IG and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling and the molecular characterization of signaling activation, which has revealed novel players implicated in shaping clinical aggressiveness in CLL, e.g., the histone methyltransferase EZH2 and the transcription factor p63.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Gerousi, Laidou, Gemenetzi, Stamatopoulos and Chatzidimitriou.']","['Gerousi, Marina', 'Laidou, Stamatia', 'Gemenetzi, Katerina', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas', 'Chatzidimitriou, Anastasia']","['Gerousi M', 'Laidou S', 'Gemenetzi K', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Chatzidimitriou A']","['Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211103,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,"['KS and AC have received unrestricted grant support from Jannsen Pharmaceutica and', 'Abbvie.

It is well known that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in coding and noncoding genes contribute to the susceptibility to ALL. This study aims to determine whether SNPs in miR-146a, miR-196a-2, miR-499a, and miR-612 genes are associated with the risk to ALL in pediatric Mexican population. Methods: A multicenter case-control study was carried out including patients with de novo diagnosis of ALL and healthy subjects as control group. The DNA samples were obtained from saliva and peripheral blood, and the genotyping of rs2910164, rs12803915, rs11614913, and rs3746444 was performed using the 5'exonuclease technique. Gene-gene interaction was evaluated by the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) software. Results: miR-499a rs3746444 showed significant differences among cases and controls. The rs3746444G allele was found as a risk factor to ALL (OR, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.05-2.5]; p = 0.028). The homozygous GG genotype of rs3746444 confers higher risk to ALL than the AA genotype (OR, 5.3 [95% CI, 1.23-23.4]; p = 0.01). Moreover, GG genotype highly increases the risk to ALL in male group (OR, 17.6 [95% CI, 1.04-298.9]; p = 0.00393). In addition, an association in a gender-dependent manner among SNPs located in miR-146a and miR-196a-2 genes and ALL susceptibility was found. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that SNP located in miR-499a, miR-146a, and miR-196a-2 genes confer risk to ALL in Mexican children. Experimental analysis to decipher the role of these SNPs in human hematopoiesis could improve our understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying the development of ALL.","['Copyright (c) 2021

In addition to DNA damage repair, FA pathway proteins are now known to be critical for maintaining faithful chromosome segregation during mitosis. While impaired DNA damage repair has been studied extensively in FA-associated carcinogenesis in vivo, the oncogenic contribution of mitotic abnormalities secondary to FA pathway deficiency remains incompletely understood. To examine the role of mitotic dysregulation in FA pathway deficient malignancies, we genetically exacerbated the baseline mitotic defect in Fancc-/- mice by introducing heterozygosity of the key spindle assembly checkpoint regulator Mad2. Fancc-/-;Mad2+/- mice were viable, but died from acute myeloid leukemia (AML), thus recapitulating the high risk of myeloid malignancies in FA patients better than Fancc-/-mice. We utilized hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to propagate Fancc-/-; Mad2+/- AML in irradiated healthy mice to model FANCC-deficient AMLs arising in the non-FA population. Compared to cells from Fancc-/- mice, those from Fancc-/-;Mad2+/- mice demonstrated an increase in mitotic errors but equivalent DNA cross-linker hypersensitivity, indicating that the cancer phenotype of Fancc-/-;Mad2+/- mice results from error-prone cell division and not exacerbation of the DNA damage repair defect. We found that FANCC enhances targeting of endogenous MAD2 to prometaphase kinetochores, suggesting a mechanism for how FANCC-dependent regulation of the spindle assembly checkpoint prevents chromosome mis-segregation. Whole-exome sequencing revealed similarities between human FA-associated myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/AML and the AML that developed in Fancc-/-; Mad2+/- mice. Together, these data illuminate the role of mitotic dysregulation in FA-pathway deficient malignancies in vivo, show how FANCC adjusts the spindle assembly checkpoint rheostat by regulating MAD2 kinetochore targeting in cell cycle-dependent manner, and establish two new mouse models for preclinical studies of AML.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Edwards, Mitchell, Abdul-Sater, Chan, Sun, Sheth, He,

High-dimensional analysis algorithms might increase the utility of multicolor flow cytometry for AML diagnosis and follow-up. The objective of the present study was to assess whether a Compass database-guided analysis can be used to achieve rapid and accurate diagnoses. We conducted this study to determine whether this method could be employed to pilote the genetic and molecular tests and to objectively identify different-from-normal (DfN) patterns to improve measurable residual disease follow-up in AML. Three Compass databases were built using Infinicyt 2.0 software, including normal myeloid-committed hematopoietic precursors (n = 20) and AML blasts harboring the most frequent recurrent genetic abnormalities (n = 50). The diagnostic accuracy of the Compass database-guided analysis was evaluated in a prospective validation study (125 suspected AML patients). This method excluded AML associated with the following genetic abnormalities: t(8;21), t(15;17), inv(16), and KMT2A translocation, with 92% sensitivity [95% confidence interval (CI): 78.6%-98.3%] and a 98.5% negative predictive value (95% CI: 90.6%-99.8%). Our data showed that the Compass database-guided analysis could identify phenotypic differences between AML groups, representing a useful tool for the identification of DfN patterns.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Aanei, Veyrat-Masson, Selicean, Marian, Rigollet, Trifa,', 'Tomuleasa, Serban, Cherry, Flandrin-Gresta, Tardy, Guyotat and Campos Catafal.']","['Aanei, Carmen-Mariana', 'Veyrat-Masson, Richard', 'Selicean, Cristina', 'Marian, Mirela', 'Rigollet, Lauren', 'Trifa, Adrian Pavel', 'Tomuleasa, Ciprian', 'Serban, Adrian', 'Cherry, Mohamad', 'Flandrin-Gresta, Pascale', 'Tardy, Emmanuelle Tavernier', 'Guyotat, Denis', 'Campos Catafal, Lydia']","['Aanei CM', 'Veyrat-Masson R', 'Selicean C', 'Marian M', 'Rigollet L', 'Trifa AP', 'Tomuleasa C', 'Serban A', 'Cherry M', 'Flandrin-Gresta P', 'Tardy ET', 'Guyotat D', 'Campos Catafal L']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Saint-Etienne, Saint-Etienne, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Clermont-Ferrand, Clermont-Ferrand, France."", 'Department of Hematology, ""Iuliu Hatieganu"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Oncological Institute ""Prof. Dr. Ion Chiricuta"", Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Oncological Institute ""Prof. Dr. Ion Chiricuta"", Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Saint-Etienne, Saint-Etienne, France."", 'Department of Medical Genetics, ""Iuliu Hatieganu"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Genetics, Oncological Institute ""Prof. Dr. Ion Chiricuta"", Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, ""Iuliu Hatieganu"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Oncological Institute ""Prof. Dr. Ion Chiricuta"", Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Saint-Etienne, Saint-Etienne, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Saint-Etienne, Saint-Etienne, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Saint-Etienne, Saint-Etienne, France."", ""Departement d'Hematologie Clinique, Institut de Cancerologie Lucien Neuwirth, Saint-Priest-en-Jarez, France."", ""Departement d'Hematologie Clinique, Institut de Cancerologie Lucien Neuwirth, Saint-Priest-en-Jarez, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Saint-Etienne, Saint-Etienne, France.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211105,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",2021/11/23 06:00,2021/11/23 06:01,['2021/11/22 06:52'],"['2021/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/22 06:52 [entrez]', '2021/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.746951 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Nov 5;11:746951. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.746951. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8602100,['NOTNLM'],"['Compass database-guided analysis', 'acute myeloid leukemia with recurrent genetic abnormalities', 'different-from-normal (DfN) approach', 'measurable (minimal) residual disease', 'multicolor flow cytometry']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This leads to excessive medullary production of promyelocytic blasts, which are frequently associated with the hemorrhagic complications seen in APL. In contrast, APL-associated thrombosis occurs much less frequently and is an underappreciated life-threatening manifestation of the disease. Most thrombotic events occur during induction chemotherapy with all-transretinoic acid and are rarely seen as the initial presentation on APL. Here we report an exceedingly rare case of a patient with recurrent venous and arterial thrombotic events, including deep vein thrombosis, bilateral segmental pulmonary embolism, an ischemic stroke, splenic infarcts, and renal infarcts, later found to have APL. We aim to discuss the most recent understanding of the pathogenesis of APL-associated thrombosis and to summarize the literature of this rare presentation of APL.","['(c) 2021 The Author(s).

Xanthohumol (XN) is an important natural product of hops (Humulus lupulus L.) and was reported to induce ROS in mitochondria. While in the present study, our data indicate that NADPH oxidase (NOX) is another site. In human acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells, we first identified that cell proliferation was inhibited by XN without affecting viability, and this could be alleviated by the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC); cell cycles were blocked at G1 phase, apoptosis was induced in a dose-dependent manner, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content was upregulated. XN-induced ROS generation was detected by flow cytometry, which can be inhibited by diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI, a NOX inhibitor), while not by N(G)-methyl-L-arginine acetate (L-NMMA, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor). The involvement of NOX in XN-induced ROS generation was further evaluated: immunofluorescence assay indicated subunits assembled in the membrane, and gp91(phox) knockdown with siRNA decreased XN-induced ROS. Human red blood cells (with NOX, without mitochondria) were further selected as a cell model, and the XN-induced ROS and DPI inhibiting effects were found again. In conclusion, our results indicate that XN exhibits antiproliferation effects through ROS-related mechanisms, and NOX is a source of XN-induced ROS. As NOX-sourced ROS are critical for phagocytosis, our findings may contribute to the anti-infection and anti-inflammatory effect of XN.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Chun-Ming Wang et al.'],"['Wang, Chun-Ming', 'Chen, Jun', 'Zhao, Jing', 'Hu, Shan-Shan', 'Zhang, Shu-Qiu', 'Mi, Xiang-Quan', 'Shi, Xiang', 'Cao, Xin-Hui', 'Li, Zhen']","['Wang CM', 'Chen J', 'Zhao J', 'Hu SS', 'Zhang SQ', 'Mi XQ', 'Shi X', 'Cao XH', 'Li Z']","['Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Cell Activities and Stress Adaptations, School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, 730000 Gansu, China.', 'Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Cell Activities and Stress Adaptations, School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, 730000 Gansu, China.', ""Second Hospital of Lanzhou University Dingxi Hospital (Dingxi City People's Hospital) Clinical Laboratory, Dingxi, 743000 Gansu, China."", 'Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Cell Activities and Stress Adaptations, School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, 730000 Gansu, China.', 'Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Cell Activities and Stress Adaptations, School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, 730000 Gansu, China.', 'Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Cell Activities and Stress Adaptations, School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, 730000 Gansu, China.', 'Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Cell Activities and Stress Adaptations, School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, 730000 Gansu, China.', 'Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Cell Activities and Stress Adaptations, School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, 730000 Gansu, China.', 'Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Cell Activities and Stress Adaptations, School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, 730000 Gansu, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211110,United States,Oxid Med Cell Longev,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,101479826,IM,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],2021/11/23 06:00,2021/11/23 06:00,['2021/11/22 06:45'],"['2021/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/18 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/22 06:45 [entrez]', '2021/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2021/9877170 [doi]'],epublish,Oxid Med Cell Longev. 2021 Nov 10;2021:9877170. doi: 10.1155/2021/9877170. eCollection 2021.,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2810-9820', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1260-0583', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8846-9801', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0634-052X']",,PMC8598356,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present a case of an abnormal NIPT result, leading to the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in an asymptomatic pregnant patient. After multiple multidisciplinary meetings and an elaborate shared decision making (SDM) process, a watch and wait strategy was implemented, in contradiction with general treatment recommendations. Following this approach, it was possible to achieve a near term pregnancy before delivery of a healthy baby girl. The patient could subsequently commence treatment of her AML and is still in complete remission after a follow-up of 25 months.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a subtype of this cancer. Early diagnosis of this disease can have a significant impact on the treatment of this disease. Computational intelligence-oriented techniques can be used to help physicians identify and classify ALL rapidly. Materials and Method. In this study, the utilized dataset was collected from a CodaLab competition to classify leukemic cells from normal cells in microscopic images. Two famous deep learning networks, including residual neural network (ResNet-50) and VGG-16 were employed. These two networks are already trained by our assigned parameters, meaning we did not use the stored weights; we adjusted the weights and learning parameters too. Also, a convolutional network with ten convolutional layers and 2 *2 max-pooling layers-with strides 2-was proposed, and six common machine learning techniques were developed to classify acute lymphoblastic leukemia into two classes. Results: The validation accuracies (the mean accuracy of training and test networks for 100 training cycles) of the ResNet-50, VGG-16, and the proposed convolutional network were found to be 81.63%, 84.62%, and 82.10%, respectively. Among applied machine learning methods, the lowest obtained accuracy was related to multilayer perceptron (27.33%) and highest for random forest (81.72%). Conclusion: This study showed that the proposed convolutional neural network has optimal accuracy in the diagnosis of ALL. By comparing various convolutional neural networks and machine learning methods in diagnosing this disease, the convolutional neural network achieved good performance and optimal execution time without latency. This proposed network is less complex than the two pretrained networks and can be employed by pathologists and physicians in clinical systems for leukemia diagnosis.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Sorayya Rezayi et al.'],"['Rezayi, Sorayya', 'Mohammadzadeh, Niloofar', 'Bouraghi, Hamid', 'Saeedi, Soheila', 'Mohammadpour, Ali']","['Rezayi S', 'Mohammadzadeh N', 'Bouraghi H', 'Saeedi S', 'Mohammadpour A']","['Department of Health Information Management and Medical Informatics, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Health Information Management and Medical Informatics, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Health Information Technology, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran.', 'Clinical Research Development Unit of Farshchian Heart Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran.', 'Health Information Management Department, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Health Information Technology, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211111,United States,Comput Intell Neurosci,Computational intelligence and neuroscience,101279357,IM,"['The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the', 'publication of this article.']",2021/11/23 06:00,2021/11/24 06:00,['2021/11/22 06:42'],"['2021/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/06 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/22 06:42 [entrez]', '2021/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2021/5478157 [doi]'],epublish,Comput Intell Neurosci. 2021 Nov 11;2021:5478157. doi: 10.1155/2021/5478157. eCollection 2021.,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7423-8853', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7586-9227', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3842-3554', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1315-794X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8796-8513']",,PMC8601812,,,20211123,,,"['Artificial Intelligence', '*Deep Learning', 'Humans', 'Machine Learning', 'Neural Networks, Computer', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis']",,,,,,,,,,

Regarding cancer, they present a unique pattern of tumors, which has not been fully explained to date. Globally, people with Down syndrome have a similar lifetime risk of developing cancer compared to the general population. However, they have a very increased risk of developing certain tumors (e.g., acute leukemia, germ cell tumors, testicular tumors and retinoblastoma) and, on the contrary, there are some other tumors which appear only exceptionally in this syndrome (e.g., breast cancer, prostate cancer, medulloblastoma, neuroblastoma and Wilms tumor). Various hypotheses have been developed to explain this situation. The genetic imbalance secondary to the presence of an extra chromosome 21 has molecular consequences at several levels, not only in chromosome 21 but also throughout the genome. In this review, we discuss the different proposed mechanisms that protect individuals with trisomy 21 from developing solid tumors: genetic dosage effect, tumor suppressor genes overexpression, disturbed metabolism, impaired neurogenesis and angiogenesis, increased apoptosis, immune system dysregulation, epigenetic aberrations and the effect of different microRNAs, among others. More research into the molecular pathways involved in this unique pattern of malignancies is still needed.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Osuna-Marco, Lopez-Barahona, Lopez-Ibor and Tejera.']","['Osuna-Marco, Marta Pilar', 'Lopez-Barahona, Monica', 'Lopez-Ibor, Blanca', 'Tejera, Agueda Mercedes']","['Osuna-Marco MP', 'Lopez-Barahona M', 'Lopez-Ibor B', 'Tejera AM']","['Biology of Ageing Group, Faculty of Experimental Sciences, Universidad Francisco de Vitoria, Madrid, Spain.', 'Pediatric Oncology and Hematology Unit, HM Hospitals, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro Estudios Biosanitarios, Madrid, Spain.', 'Pediatric Oncology and Hematology Unit, HM Hospitals, Madrid, Spain.', 'Biology of Ageing Group, Faculty of Experimental Sciences, Universidad Francisco de Vitoria, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211105,Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",2021/11/23 06:00,2021/11/23 06:01,['2021/11/22 06:41'],"['2021/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/22 06:41 [entrez]', '2021/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fgene.2021.749480 [doi]', '749480 [pii]']",epublish,Front Genet. 2021 Nov 5;12:749480. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2021.749480. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8602698,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'down syndrome', 'metabolism', 'microRNA', 'trisomy 21', 'tumor suppressor genes']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent investigations have demonstrated that multiple immune components play a central role in regulating hematopoiesis, and dysfunction at the immune cell level significantly contributes to neoplastic disease. Immune cells are acutely sensitive to remodeling by leukemic inflammatory cytokine exposure. Importantly, immune cells are the principal cytokine producers in the hematopoietic system, representing an untapped frontier for clinical interventions. Due to a proinflammatory cytokine environment, dysregulation of immune cell states is a hallmark of hematological disease and neoplasia. Malignant immune adaptations have profound effects on leukemic blast proliferation, disease propagation, and drug-resistance. Conversely, targeting the immune landscape to restore hematopoietic function and limit leukemic expansion may have significant therapeutic value. Despite the fundamental role of the immune microenvironment during the initiation, progression, and treatment response of hematological disease, a detailed examination of how leukemic cytokines alter immune cells to permit, promote, or inhibit leukemia growth is lacking. Here we outline an immune-based model of leukemic transformation and highlight how the profound effect of immune alterations on the trajectory of malignancy. The focus of this review is to summarize current knowledge about the impacts of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines on immune cells subsets, their modes of action, and immunotherapeutic approaches with the potential to improve clinical outcomes for patients suffering from hematological myeloid malignancies.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Camacho, Kuznetsova and Welner.']","['Camacho, Virginia', 'Kuznetsova, Valeriya', 'Welner, Robert S']","['Camacho V', 'Kuznetsova V', 'Welner RS']","[""Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, O'Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, United States."", ""Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, O'Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, United States."", ""Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, O'Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, United States.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211103,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",2021/11/23 06:00,2021/11/23 06:00,['2021/11/22 06:41'],"['2021/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/22 06:41 [entrez]', '2021/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2021.772408 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2021 Nov 3;12:772408. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.772408. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8595317,['NOTNLM'],"['cytokines', 'immune cells', 'inflammation', 'leukemia', 'microenvironment']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study compared the outcomes of stem cell transplantations (SCTs) using haplo and other stem cell sources, namely, matched sibling donors (MSDs), matched unrelated donors (MUDs), and cord blood transplantations (CBTs). Literature searches were conducted of the MEDLINE and Embase databases from inception to December 2020. RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies were examined (17 retrospective and 11 prospective). There were no significant differences in the overall survival of haplo and those of the other stem-cell sources. For haplo versus matched donor (MSD or MUD), the pooled odds ratio (OR) was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.79-1.12; I(2), 22%); while for haplo versus CBT, the OR was 1.24 (95% CI, 0.78-1.96; I(2), 28%). The cumulative relapse incidence was significantly higher for MSD than haplo (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.48-0.99; I(2), 48%). Both grade II-IV acute and long-term graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were significantly higher for haplo than MSD (OR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.15-2.74; I(2), 28%; and OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.00-1.77; I(2), 14%, respectively). The other clinical outcomes did not demonstrate any statistical differences. CONCLUSION: The outcomes of patients treated with haplo-SCT appear comparable with those of the SCTs using other sources. The higher probability of developing GVHD supports the need for a novel method to harness T-cell alloreactivity.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, the classification of SBCLNs remains a challenge, especially in cases where histopathological analysis is unavailable or those with atypical laboratory findings or equivocal pathologic data. In this study, gene expression profiling of 1039 samples from 27 gene expression omnibus (GEO) datasets was first investigated to select highly and differentially expressed genes among SBCLNs. Samples from 57 SBCLN cases and 102 nonmalignant control samples were used to train a classifier using the NanoString platform. The classifier was built by employing a cascade binary classification method based on the random forest algorithm with 35 refined gene signatures. Cases were successively classified as chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, conventional mantle cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, leukemic non-nodal mantle cell lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, and other undetermined. The classifier algorithm was then validated using an independent cohort of 197 patients with SBCLNs. Under the distribution of our validation cohort, the overall sensitivity and specificity of proposed algorithm model were >95%, respectively, for all the cases with tumor cell content greater than 0.72. Combined with additional genetic aberrations including IGH-BCL2 translocation, MYD88 L265P mutation, and BRAF V600E mutation, the optimal sensitivity and specificity were respectively found at 0.88 and 0.98.

Due to its rarity and the lack of feasible novel agents and laboratory prognostic tools, there are limited data on the clinical outcomes of this disease in Asia. To clarify the current treatment status, we performed a multicenter retrospective analysis of patients with CLL in Korea. Methods: The medical records of 192 eligible patients between 2008 and 2019 were reviewed for clinical characteristics, treatment courses, and outcomes. The first-line treatment regimens of the patients included in this analysis were as follows: fludarabine/cyclophosphamide/ rituximab (FCR) (N=117, 52.7%), obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil (GC) (N=30, 13.5%), and chlorambucil monotherapy (N=24, 10.8%). Results: The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 55.6 months, and the average 2-year PFS rate was 80.3%. PFS was not significantly different between the patients receiving FCR and those receiving GC; however, chlorambucil treatment was associated with significantly inferior PFS (P <0.001). The median overall survival was 136.3 months, and the average 5- and 10-year OS rates were 82.0% and 57.4%, respectively. Conclusion: This is one of the largest studies involving Korean patients with CLL.

Herein, a novel and switching electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor was developed for ultrasensitive determination of the fusion gene based on the self-enhanced polyethyleneimine-luminol (PEI-Lum) hydrogels coupled with target-initiated DNAzyme motor. The facilely prepared PEI-Lum hydrogels could not only immobilize enormous luminol but shorten the distance of binary system, thus facilitating the mass and electron transfer efficiency of the sensing interface, so that the enhanced ECL signal was achieved. Moreover, the engineering DNA motor was powered by Mg(2+)-dependent DNAzyme for isothermal DNA signal amplification. As a result, the fabricated ECL biosensor enabled highly sensitive detection of BCR/ABL fusion gene with a broad linear range from 10.0 fM to 10.0 nM and a low detection limit of 3.75 fM (S/N = 3). Significantly, the developed biosensing method provides a potential tool for nucleic acid analysis in clinical diagnosis and a new avenue to design high-efficient ECL nanomaterials.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, the link between hematology and the microbiota (defined as the total assemblage of microorganisms in a mucosal environment)/ microbiome (i.e. the entire ecological habitat, including organisms, their genomes and environmental conditions) is becoming more well-known. Dysbiosis, or a change in the microbiome, has been linked to the development of neoplasms, infections, inflammatory illnesses, and immune-mediated disorders, according to growing data. Microbiota may influence distant tumor microenvironment through a variety of methods, including cytokine release control, dendritic cell activation, and T-cell lymphocyte stimulation. There are numerous major implications to study the microbiome in patients with benign and malignant hematologic disorders. In this review, we investigated the structure and function of the microbiome in patients with benign and malignant hematological diseases. Chemotherapy and immunosuppressive agents used in treatment of these benign and malignant hematological diseases may cause or exacerbate dysbiosis and infectious problems. After understanding the importance of microbiota in hematological diseases, we think that use of probiotics and dietary prebiotic substances targeting microbiota modification aiming to improve hematological disease outcomes should be investigated in future studies.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

However its clinical usefulness is restricted due to its cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Rosa centifolia belongs to family Rosaceae and in Ayurveda it is claimed for use in renal disorders. The main phyto-constituents of the plant are terpenoids, glycosides, flavonoids, tannins, phenolic compounds, pro-antroocyanides, pectin and riboflavin. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the ameliorative role of ethanolic extract of petals of R. centifolia in doxorubicin induced nephrotoxicity in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nephrotoxicity was produced by administration of doxorubicin (2.5 mg/kg b.w., i.p. alternate day) in six equal injections for two weeks to achieve a cumulative concentration of 15 mg/kg. Low (LERC - 100 mg/kg p.o.) and high (HERC - 200 mg/kg p.o.) dosees of ethanolic extract of petals of R. centifolia was administered as a pretreatment prior to doxorubicin administration. The general parameters such as body weight, food and water intake were measured throughout the study period. Serum biomarkers such as blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine and albumin were measured before treatment and at the end of the experiments. Anti-oxidant enzymes such as glutathione (GSH), melonldehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were monitored after the last dose. Nephrotoxicity was assessed through histopathological analysis. RESULTS: The repeated administration of doxorubicin produces several morphological changes including reduction in the body weight as well as decreased food and water consumption. Serum biomarkers such as BUN, serum creatinine were increased and albumin concentration was decreased. The GSH, SOD and CAT concentrations were decreased, whereas MDA concentration was increased. Deteriorating changes in the histological architecture of kidney tissue were observed. In the LERC and HERC pretreated groups following changes were observed in dose dependent manner: increase in body weight, food and water intake (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01), decrease in the BUN (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01) and serum creatinine (p < 0.05 and p < 0.05) concentrations respectively. The significant increase in the albumin (p < 0.01) concentration was observed only in HERC. The pretreatment with LERC and HERC increased the antioxidant enzymes concentrations i.e. GSH (p < 0.01 and p < 0.01), SOD (p < 0.01 and p < 0.01), CAT (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01) and decreased the MDA concentration (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01) respectively. Histopathological studies showed that the pretreatment with low and high doses of ethanolic extract of petals of Rosa centifolia LERC and HERC groups minimized the tubular damage and reduced the inflammation as compared to doxorubicin treated group. CONCLUSION: The biochemical and histopathological data from the present study clearly support the nephroprotective effect of ethanolic extract of petals of R. centifolia, which might be credited to its anti-oxidant property.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors.

Time to hematologic recovery after standard (""7 + 3"") myeloablative chemotherapy can vary considerably among patients, but the factors that drive or predict BM recovery remain incompletely understood. Here, we assessed the composition of innate and adaptive immune subsets in the regenerating BM (day 17) after induction chemotherapy and related it to hematologic recovery in AML. T cells, and in particular the CD4 central memory (CD4CM) T-cell subset, were significantly enriched in the BM after chemotherapy, suggesting the relative chemoresistance of cells providing long-term memory for systemic pathogens. In contrast, B cells and other hematopoietic subsets were depleted. Higher frequencies of the CD4CM T-cell subset were associated with delayed hematopoietic recovery, whereas a high frequency of natural killer (NK) cells was related to faster recovery of neutrophil counts. The NK/CD4CM ratio in the BM after chemotherapy was significantly associated with the time to subsequent neutrophil recovery (Spearman's rho = -0.723, p < 0.001, false discovery rate <0.01). The data provide novel insights into adaptive immune cell recovery after injury and identify the NK/CD4CM index as a putative predictor of hematopoietic recovery in AML.","['Copyright (c) 2021 ISEH -- Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

Coronary atherosclerosis is one of the main causes of death worldwide. We constructed a co-expression network to identify hub genes associated with abnormal coronary endothelial function in early coronary atherosclerosis. In brief, we used the GSE132651 dataset from the gene expression omnibus database. The top 5000 genes with greatest variances were used for weighted gene co-expression network analysis, and the module most strongly correlated with abnormal coronary endothelial function was chosen as key module. Functional enrichment analysis was performed for genes in the key module, a protein-protein interaction network was constructed to find hub genes, and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was also performed. Genes were classified into 7 modules, with the midnightblue module being the one that was most related to abnormal coronary endothelial function and containing genes enriched in DNA replication, cell cycle, nucleotide excision repair, and Human T-cell leukemia virus 1 infection. We identified nine hub genes (HOXC5, PRND, PADI3, RC3H1, DAPP1, SIT1, DRICH1, GPRIN2, and RHO), which differently expressed in abnormal and normal coronary endothelial function samples. GSEA suggested that samples associated with abnormal coronary endothelial function and highly expressed hub genes were linked with immune, coagulation, hypoxia, and angiogenesis processes. These hub genes, their expression pattern, and pathways may be involved in the development of abnormal coronary endothelial function and promotion of early coronary atherosclerosis.",['(c) 2021.

In particular, genetic dependence on the catalytic subunit BRG1/SMARCA4 has been observed in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), yet the feasibility of direct therapeutic targeting of SWI/SNF catalytic activity in leukemia remains unknown. Here, we evaluated the activity of dual BRG1/BRM ATPase inhibitors across a genetically diverse panel of cancer cell lines and observed that hematopoietic cancer cell lines were among the most sensitive compared with other lineages. This result was striking in comparison with data from pooled short hairpin RNA screens, which showed that only a subset of leukemia cell lines display sensitivity to BRG1 knockdown. We demonstrate that combined genetic knockdown of BRG1 and BRM is required to recapitulate the effects of dual inhibitors, suggesting that SWI/SNF dependency in human leukemia extends beyond a predominantly BRG1-driven mechanism. Through gene expression and chromatin accessibility studies, we show that the dual inhibitors act at genomic loci associated with oncogenic transcription factors, and observe a downregulation of leukemic pathway genes, including MYC, a well-established target of BRG1 activity in AML.

A cross-sectional study of patients seeking care through a publicly funded healthcare system.,106748,S0145-2126(21)01749-5 [pii] 10.1016/j.leukres.2021.106748 [doi],"BACKGROUND: It is increasingly appreciated that some patients with cancer will experience financial burden due to their disease but little is known specifically about patients with haematological malignancies. Therefore, this study aimed to measure financial toxicity experienced by patients with haematological malignancies in the context of a publicly funded health care system. METHOD: All current patients diagnosed with leukaemia, lymphoma or multiple myeloma, from two major metropolitan health services in Melbourne, Australia were invited to complete a survey capturing; patient demographics, employment status, income sources, financial coping and insurances, OOP expenses and self-reported financial toxicity using a validated measure. RESULTS: Of the 240 people approached, 113 (47 %) participated and most had leukaemia (62 %). Forty-seven (42 %) participants experienced some degree of financial toxicity using the Comprehensive Score for financial toxicity (COST) instrument. On multivariate linear regression, older age (>65 years, p = 0.007), higher monthly income (>$8000, p = 0.008), not having and being forced into unemployment or early retirement (p < 0.001) remained significantly associated with less financial toxicity. CONCLUSION: Financial toxicity is present in Australian haematology patients and those at higher risk may be patients of working age, those without private health insurance and patients that have been forced to retire early or have become unemployed due to their diagnosis.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s).

STUDY DESIGN: We performed a nationwide registry-based cohort study including all children under 15 years of age diagnosed with cancer in Denmark over a 23-year period (1996-2018). The Danish National Patient Registry (DNPR) was used to identify musculoskeletal diagnoses and associated dates recorded within six months preceding the diagnosis of cancer. We compared characteristics of children with and without a prior musculoskeletal diagnoses using prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) and diagnostic interval as median with interquartile range (IQR). We compared survival using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis adjusting for age, sex, and presence of metastasis at diagnosis. RESULTS: Of 3,895 children with all types of cancer, 264 (7%) had a total of 451 hospital visits with musculoskeletal diagnosis within six months preceding the diagnosis of cancer, however, survival was not affected. The overall median diagnostic interval from first musculoskeletal diagnosis (within 6 months before cancer diagnosis) to cancer diagnosis was 15 days (IQR 7-47). Diagnosis of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, unspecified arthritis, and arthropathy each accounted for 5% of the contacts, primarily in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, bone sarcomas, or neuroblastomas.

Elevated rates of suicidal ideation (SI) are documented among cancer survivors, and a link between neurocognitive deficits and SI is evident, yet the relationship between SI and pediatric cancer-related neurocognitive effects has not yet been studied. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Participants were 166 pediatric cancer patients (57.8% Brain Tumor, 31.3% leukemia, 10.8% other cancers) aged 6-23 (M = 11.57, SD = 3.82; 45.8% female) referred for neuropsychological surveillance. SI prevalence was measured by parent, teacher, or patient endorsement of self-harm related items on informant-report measures (e.g., the Child Behavior Checklist). Executive functioning (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function), ADHD symptoms (ADHD Rating Scale), and performance-based measures were compared between those with SI and those without. RESULTS: 17.5% of pediatric cancer patients experienced SI, of which 44.7% had self-endorsement only, 58.5% parent-endorsement only, 20.6% teacher-endorsement only, and 24.1% had two endorsements. Those with SI had significantly greater impairments in global executive composite scores by both parent- and teacher-report (ps < 0.05). Parents of children with SI endorsed significantly more inattention symptoms (M = 6.10, SD = 15.48) than those without SI (M = 50.56, SD = 8.70; p < 0.01), but hyperactivity symptoms did not differ. Intellectual and executive function performance did not differ between those with and without SI (ps > 0.1).

For molecular insight, loss of miR-31 caused by HTLV-1 induces ORP4L expression in T-cells. ORP4L interacts with PI3Kdelta to promote PI(3,4,5)P3 generation, contributing to AKT hyperactivation, NF-kappaB-dependent p53 inactivation induced pro-oncogenes expression and T-cell leukemogenesis.

These lesions are often reported to appear similar to sarcoidosis in clinical presentation and under light microscopy. However, comprehensive descriptions of the cytomorphologic characteristics of these paraneoplastic granulomas are lacking, and the mechanisms involved in their formation remain ill-defined. Noninfectious dermal granulomatous reactions have also been reported in many primary immunodeficiencies, including common variable immune deficiency and ataxia-telangiectasia. We present a case of noninfectious CD8+ predominant granulomatous dermatitis with ocular involvement occurring in the setting of CLL and marked hypogammaglobulinemia. Based on the analysis of shared factors in patients with primary immunodeficiencies and CLL, we conclude that the presence of pan-humoral immunodeficiency could itself be a risk factor for developing a CD8+ lymphogranulomatous reaction. This report and associated discussion evince that CD8+ predominant granulomatous reactions, distinct from sarcoidosis, may represent a previously unappreciated segment of the paraneoplastic granulomas observed in hematologic malignancies.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Most patients with T-ALL are treated with high-dose multi-agent chemotherapy due to limited targeted therapeutic options. To further investigate its pathogenesis and establish new therapeutic targets, we studied the role of FAPP2, a Golgi protein, that is, highly expressed in T-ALL, in the growth and function of T-ALL. We found that T-ALL cells underwent reduced cell proliferation and sub-G1 accumulation after knocking down of FAPP2 gene using shRNA systems. Instead, FAPP2 downregulation promoted cell autophagy. The level of autophagy markers, LC3/, Beclin1, and ATG5, was markedly increased, whereas that of P62 decreased after FAPP2 knocking down in T-ALL cells. FAPP2 knocking down led to the accumulation of LC3 in the cytoplasm of T-ALL cells as shown by fluorescence microscopy. In addition, the level of PI(4)P and PI(3,4,5)P decreased and phosphorylation of P-AKT and P-mTOR were downregulated in FAPP2 knock-down cells. In summary, our results show that decreased expression of FAPP2 inhibited cell proliferation, resulted in the sub-G1 phase accumulation of T-ALL cells, and enhanced autophagy of T-ALL cells, likely mediated by PI(4)P, PI(3,4,5)P, and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Our results provide a new insight into the pathogenesis and development of potential targeted therapy of T-ALL.",['(c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Yuan, Tian', 'Wang, Jinhuan', 'Shi, Ce', 'Wang, Yi', 'Xia, Bing', 'Xu, Wen', 'Yang, Hongliang', 'Yang, Yaling', 'Ye, Matthew T', 'Khalid, Samah', 'Liang, Yong', 'Tian, Chen', 'You, M James', 'Wang, Yafei']","['Yuan T', 'Wang J', 'Shi C', 'Wang Y', 'Xia B', 'Xu W', 'Yang H', 'Yang Y', 'Ye MT', 'Khalid S', 'Liang Y', 'Tian C', 'You MJ', 'Wang Y']","[""Key Laboratory of Cancer Immunology and Biotherapy, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, China."", 'Department of Oncology, Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Institute of Urology, Tianjin, China.', 'NHC Key Laboratory of Cell Transplantation, First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, China.', ""Key Laboratory of Cancer Immunology and Biotherapy, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Cancer Immunology and Biotherapy, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Cancer Immunology and Biotherapy, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Cancer Immunology and Biotherapy, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, China."", 'NHC Key Laboratory of Cell Transplantation, First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, China.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Taizhou University School of Medicine, Taizhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', ""Key Laboratory of Cancer Immunology and Biotherapy, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, China."", 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', ""Key Laboratory of Cancer Immunology and Biotherapy, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211118,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,IM,,2021/11/20 06:00,2021/11/20 06:00,['2021/11/19 07:09'],"['2021/08/16 00:00 [revised]', '2021/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/20 06:00 [medline]', '2021/11/19 07:09 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2948 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Hematol Oncol. 2021 Nov 18. doi: 10.1002/hon.2948.,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1517-7613', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7111-4318', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0995-990X']","['18JCYBJC91800/Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City', '81670104/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81800148/National Natural Science Foundation of China']",,['NOTNLM'],"['FAPP2', 'PI3K/AKT/mTOR', 'T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'autophagy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HCC cells consume large amounts of glutamine to survive, but can adapt to glutamine depletion in the presence of an exogenous asparagine. L-asparaginase (ASNase) converts glutamine and asparagine to glutamate and aspartate, respectively, and has been used to treat leukemia. Here we examined the effects of ASNase treatment on HCC cells and explored the potential impact of combining ASNase with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor lenvatinib (Len) for HCC treatment. Cell viability and death of HCC cell lines treated with either Len or ASNase alone or with Len and ASNase combined were determined. We assessed mRNA and protein expression levels of glutamine synthetase (GS) and asparagine synthetase (ASNS) by real-time quantitative PCR and immunoblotting. The antitumor effect of the combination therapy relative to Len or ASNase monotherapy was also evaluated in a xenograft tumor mouse model. ASNase treatment inhibited growth of SNU387 and SNU398 HCC cells, which have low GS and high ASNS expression levels, respectively, but did not clearly inhibit growth of the other cell lines. Len plus ASNase combination therapy synergistically inhibited proliferation and induced oxidative stress leading to cell death of some HCC cells lines. However, cell death of Huh7 cells, which express ASCT2, an important glutamine transporter for cancer cells, was not affected by the combination treatment. In a xenograft model, Len combined with ASNase significantly attenuated tumor development relative to mice treated with Len or ASNase alone. ASNase-mediated targeting of two amino acids, glutamine and asparagine, which are indispensable for HCC survival, induces oxidative stress and can be a novel cancer treatment option that exerts a synergistic effect when used in combination with Len.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Okuda, Umemura, Kataoka, Yano, Takahashi, Okishio, Taketani,', 'Seko, Nishikawa, Yamaguchi, Moriguchi, Nakagawa, Liu, Mitsumoto, Kanbara, Shima,', 'Okanoue and Itoh.']","['Okuda, Keiichiro', 'Umemura, Atsushi', 'Kataoka, Seita', 'Yano, Kota', 'Takahashi, Aya', 'Okishio, Shinya', 'Taketani, Hiroyoshi', 'Seko, Yuya', 'Nishikawa, Taichiro', 'Yamaguchi, Kanji', 'Moriguchi, Michihisa', 'Nakagawa, Hayato', 'Liu, Yu', 'Mitsumoto, Yasuhide', 'Kanbara, Yoshihiro', 'Shima, Toshihide', 'Okanoue, Takeshi', 'Itoh, Yoshito']","['Okuda K', 'Umemura A', 'Kataoka S', 'Yano K', 'Takahashi A', 'Okishio S', 'Taketani H', 'Seko Y', 'Nishikawa T', 'Yamaguchi K', 'Moriguchi M', 'Nakagawa H', 'Liu Y', 'Mitsumoto Y', 'Kanbara Y', 'Shima T', 'Okanoue T', 'Itoh Y']","['Molecular Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Molecular Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Molecular Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Molecular Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Molecular Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Molecular Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Molecular Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Molecular Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Molecular Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Molecular Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Molecular Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Molecular Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Saiseikai Suita Hospital, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Saiseikai Suita Hospital, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Saiseikai Suita Hospital, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Saiseikai Suita Hospital, Suita, Japan.', 'Molecular Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211102,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,"['AU received commercial research funding from AbbVie, Inc., and Merck Sharp &', 'Dohme Corp.

Rarely, ALL may be preceded by a period of pancytopenia and bone marrow hypoplasia which spontaneously recovers. This phenomenon, which has not before been described in T-cell ALL, is referred to as transient bone marrow hypoplasia. Case presentation: A 5-year-old boy who presented with high-grade fever and generalised lymphadenopathy, was found to have pancytopenia on peripheral blood count and bone marrow hypoplasia. He was observed over a one-month period during which his bone marrow and peripheral blood counts recovered spontaneously. Symptoms recurred after 4 months and he was found to have blast infiltration of the bone marrow and diagnosed with T-cell ALL. Conclusion: Cases of transient bone marrow hypoplasia or overt aplastic anemia with spontaneous recovery and then followed by B-cell ALL or Acute Myeloid Leukemia have been described previously in the medical literature. This is the first case of transient bone marrow hypoplasia resulting into ALL of T-cell immunophenotype. While marrow hypoplasia preceding ALL remains poorly understood, it suggests an antecedent environmental insult to lymphoid progenitors or a germline abnormality that predisposes to lymphoid dysplasia. This may provide clues to the hitherto unknown pathophysiological process and etiological factors that precede the majority of childhood ALL cases. This case enlightens pediatricians about the existence of such rare cases so as to periodically follow up children with pancytopenia and/or bone marrow hypoplasia for prolonged periods even after apparent recovery.",['(c) 2021 Naturinda E et al.'],"['Naturinda, Ernest', 'George, Paul', 'Ssenyondwa, Joseph', 'Bakulumpagi, Deogratias', 'Lubega, Joseph', 'Wasswa, Peter']","['Naturinda E', 'George P', 'Ssenyondwa J', 'Bakulumpagi D', 'Lubega J', 'Wasswa P']","[""Baylor College of Medicine Children's Foundation Uganda, Kampala, Uganda."", ""Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX.

MKL/MRTF molecules comprise MKL1/MRTFA and MKL2/MRTFB, which possess actin-binding motifs at the N-terminus, and SRF-binding domains and a transcriptional activation domain (TAD) at the C-terminus. Several studies have reported that, in association with actin rearrangement, MKL/MRTF translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it regulates SRF-mediated gene expression and controls cell motility. Therefore, it is important to elucidate the roles of MKL/MRTF in the nervous system with regard to its structural and functional regulation by extracellular stimuli. We demonstrated that MKL/MRTF is highly expressed in the brain, especially the synapses, and is involved in dendritic complexity and dendritic spine maturation. In addition to the positive regulation of dendritic complexity, we identified several MKL/MRTF isoforms that negatively regulate dendritic complexity in cortical neurons. We found that the MKL/MRTF isoforms were expressed differentially during brain development and the impacts of these isoforms on the immediate early genes including Arc/Arg3.1, were different. Here, we review the roles of MKL/MRTF in the nervous system, with a special focus on the MKL/MRTF-mediated fine-tuning of neuronal morphology and gene transcription. In the concluding remarks, we briefly discuss the future perspectives and the possible involvement of MKL/MRTF in neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Tabuchi and Ihara.'],"['Tabuchi, Akiko', 'Ihara, Daisuke']","['Tabuchi A', 'Ihara D']","['Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211102,Switzerland,Front Mol Neurosci,Frontiers in molecular neuroscience,101477914,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",2021/11/20 06:00,2021/11/20 06:01,['2021/11/19 06:53'],"['2021/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/19 06:53 [entrez]', '2021/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fnmol.2021.767842 [doi]'],epublish,Front Mol Neurosci. 2021 Nov 2;14:767842. doi: 10.3389/fnmol.2021.767842. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8593110,['NOTNLM'],"['MKL', 'MRTF', 'SRF', 'dendritic morphology', 'dendritic spine morphology', 'gene expression', 'transcription']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we use single and combinatorial drug response profiling to show that the combined inhibition of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and of the tyrosine kinase BTK with the small molecules venetoclax and ibrutinib efficiently kills DLBCL cells in vitro. High Bcl-2 expression due to either BCL2 amplifications or translocations, in conjunction with chronic active BCR signaling accurately predict responses to dual Bcl-2/BTK inhibition. Orthotopic xenotransplantation and patient-derived xenograft models confirm that the combinatorial is superior to single-agent treatment in reducing the lymphoma burden. Combinatorial treatment further efficiently overcomes both primary and acquired resistance to venetoclax, which we could link to reduced expression of the Bcl-2 family members Bcl-XL and Bcl-2A1 under ibrutinib. We found in a Swiss DLBCL cohort that ~15% of patients are projected to respond to the venetoclax/ibrutinib combination based on their high Bcl-2 expression and nuclear NF-kappaB localization. Our data show that drug sensitivities exposed by drug response profiling can be attributed to specific mutational signatures and immunohistochemical biomarkers, and point to combined Bcl-2/BTK inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy in DLBCL.",['(c) 2021.

We develop an optimized split-TurboID version and show SUMO interaction-dependent labelling of proteins proximal to PML and RANGAP1. SUMO-dependent interactors of PML are involved in transcription, DNA damage, stress response and SUMO modification and are highly enriched in SUMO Interacting Motifs, but may only represent a subset of the total PML proximal proteome. Likewise, SUMO-ID also allow us to identify interactors of SUMOylated SALL1, a less characterized SUMO substrate. Furthermore, using TP53 as a substrate, we identify SUMO1, SUMO2 and Ubiquitin preferential interactors.

The manufacture of CAR-T cells requires the adoption of GMP-compatible methods and it demands the collection of mononuclear cells from the patient (or from the donor), generally through the apheresis procedure, T cell selection, activation, transduction and expansion ex vivo, and finally storage, usually cryopreserved, until the moment of their use. An important aspect is the quality control testing of the final product, for example, the characterization of its identity and purity, tests to detect any contamination by microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, and mycoplasma) and its potency. The product thawing and intravenous infusion do not differ much from what is established for the hematopoietic progenitor cell product. After infusion, it is important to check for the presence and concentration of CAR-T cells in the patient's peripheral blood, as well as to monitor their clinical impact, for instance, the occurrence of short-term, such as cytokine release syndrome and neurological complications, and long-term complications, which require patient follow-up for many years.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Associacao Brasileira de Hematologia, Hemoterapia e Terapia', 'Celular.

However, ALLI presenting as the initial symptom of acute leukemia (AL) is scarce. Here we present a case of ALLI in the setting of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) while systematically reviewing the current literature to withdraw conclusions about the management, prognosis, and treatment for this atypical presentation of AL. Methods: We conducted a systematic electronic research according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis protocol (PRISMA) for articles published from January 1981 up to January 2021 concerning ALLI in the setting of acute leukemia (AL). Patients' baseline characteristics were recorded and nine outcomes of interest were studied. Results: Twenty-six individuals, 16 males with a mean age of 46.3 years (+/-20) were included in this review. The diagnosis included 13 AML patients (50%), 11 acute promyelotic leukemia (APL) (42.3%) and two acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) (7.7%). Treatment varied among nine different regimens. Four patients were treated with chemotherapy alone (15.4%), four with thrombectomy alone (15.4%), and 11 with a combination of chemotherapy and thrombectomy (42.3%). Eight major amputations were recorded (30. 8%). Thirty-day mortality was 35.7%. Forty-eight peripheral thrombotic events were recorded with 12 patients suffering recurrent thrombotic events. Conclusion: ALLI as the presenting symptom of AL is a rare condition that carries significant mortality and amputation rates. Timely diagnosis is crucial concerning short-term survival and limb salvage. APL, despite being the rarest form of AL, represented a significant proportion of the patient population in this review. The role of leukostasis in the disease's progression and the efficacy of leukapheresis as a treatment regimen should be further investigated through case-control studies.",,"['Bontinis, Alkis', 'Bontinis, Vangelis', 'Koutsoumpelis, Andreas', 'Vasileios, Perifanis', 'Georgia, Kaiafa', 'Giannopoulos, Argirios', 'Ktenidis, Kiriakos']","['Bontinis A', 'Bontinis V', 'Koutsoumpelis A', 'Vasileios P', 'Georgia K', 'Giannopoulos A', 'Ktenidis K']","['Department of Vascular Surgery, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, AHEPA University General Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Vascular Surgery, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, AHEPA University General Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Vascular Surgery, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, AHEPA University General Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'First Propaedeutic Department of Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, AHEPA University Hospital, Greece.', 'First Propaedeutic Department of Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, AHEPA University Hospital, Greece.', 'Department of Vascular Surgery, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, AHEPA University General Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Vascular Surgery, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, AHEPA University General Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20211119,Switzerland,Vasa,VASA.

The molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) plays a crucial role in nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)-mediated antiapoptosis in ATL cells, and HSP90 inhibitors are new candidate therapeutics for ATL. Accordingly, we investigated the anti-ATL effects of a novel oral HSP90 inhibitor, TAS-116 (pimitespib), and the mechanisms involved in ex vivo and in vivo preclinical models. TAS-116 achieved IC50 values of less than 0.5 mumol/L in 10 ATL-related cell lines and less than 1 mumol/L in primary peripheral blood cells of nine ATL patients; no toxicity was observed toward CD4(+) lymphocytes from healthy donors, indicating the safety of this agent. Given orally, TAS-116 also showed significant inhibitory effects against tumor cell growth in ATL cell-xenografted mice. Furthermore, gene expression profiling of TAS-116-treated Tax-positive or -negative cell lines and primary ATL cells using DNA microarray and multiple pathway analysis revealed the significant downregulation of the NF-kappaB pathway in Tax-positive cells and cell-cycle arrest in Tax-negative cells and primary ATL cells.

Among 4930 patients (median age 56 years, interquartile range 45-66) with newly diagnosed, intensively treated AML, we have identified IDH1 mutations (mIDH1) in 423 (8.6%) and IDH2 mutations (mIDH2) in 575 (11.7%) patients. Overall, there were no differences in response rates or survival for patients with mIDH1 or mIDH2 compared to patients without mutated IDH1/2. However, distinct clinical and co-mutational phenotypes of the most common subtypes of IDH1/2 mutations could be associated with differences in outcome. IDH1-R132C was associated with significantly increased age, lower white blood cell count (WBC), less frequent co-mutation of NPM1 and FLT3-ITD as well as lower rate of complete remissions and a trend for reduced overall survival (OS) compared to other mIDH1 variants and wtIDH1/2. In our analysis, IDH2-R172K was associated with significantly lower WBC, more karyotype abnormalities, and less frequent co-mutations of NPM1 and/or FLT3-ITD. Among patients within the ELN2017 intermediate- and adverse-risk groups, RFS and OS were significantly better for patients with IDH2-R172K compared to wtIDH, providing evidence that AML with IDH2-R172K could be a distinct entity with a specific co-mutation pattern and favorable outcome. In summary, the presented data from a large cohort of IDH1/2 mutant AML patients indicate novel and clinically relevant findings for the most common IDH-mutation subtypes.",['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society of Hematology.'],"['Middeke, Jan Moritz', 'Metzeler, Klaus H', 'Rollig, Christoph', 'Kramer, Michael', 'Eckardt, Jan-Niklas', 'Stasik, Sebastian', 'Greif, Philipp A', 'Spiekermann, Karsten', 'Rothenberg-Thurley, Maja', 'Krug, Utz', 'Braess, Jan', 'Kraemer, Alwin', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Brummendorf, Tim Henrik', 'Naumann, Ralph', 'Steffen, Bjorn', 'Einsele, Hermann', 'Schaich, Markus', 'Burchert, Andreas', 'Neubauer, Andreas', 'Gorlich, Dennis', 'Sauerland, Cristina M', 'Schaefer-Eckart, Kerstin', 'Schliemann, Christoph', 'Krause, Stefan W', 'Hanel, Mathias', 'Frickhofen, Norbert', 'Noppeney, Richard', 'Kaiser, Ulrich', 'Kaufmann, Martin', 'Kunadt, Desiree', 'Woermann, Bernhard', 'Sockel, Katja', 'von Bonin, Malte', 'Herold, Tobias', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Baldus, Claudia D', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Schetelig, Johannes', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Stolzel, Friedrich', 'Thiede, Christian']","['Middeke JM', 'Metzeler KH', 'Rollig C', 'Kramer M', 'Eckardt JN', 'Stasik S', 'Greif PA', 'Spiekermann K', 'Rothenberg-Thurley M', 'Krug U', 'Braess J', 'Kraemer A', 'Hochhaus A', 'Brummendorf TH', 'Naumann R', 'Steffen B', 'Einsele H', 'Schaich M', 'Burchert A', 'Neubauer A', 'Gorlich D', 'Sauerland CM', 'Schaefer-Eckart K', 'Schliemann C', 'Krause SW', 'Hanel M', 'Frickhofen N', 'Noppeney R', 'Kaiser U', 'Kaufmann M', 'Kunadt D', 'Woermann B', 'Sockel K', 'von Bonin M', 'Herold T', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Platzbecker U', 'Berdel WE', 'Serve H', 'Baldus CD', 'Ehninger G', 'Schetelig J', 'Hiddemann W', 'Bornhauser M', 'Stolzel F', 'Thiede C']","['Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany.', 'Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany, Germany.', 'Universitatsklinikum Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'University of Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'University Hospital Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany.', 'LMU Munich, Germany.', 'LMU Munich, Germany.', 'LMU Munich, Germany.', 'Klinikum Leverkusen, Leverkusen, Germany.', 'Krankenhaus Barmherzige Bruder, Regensburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik, Abteilung Innere Medizin V, Germany.', 'St. Marien-Krankenhaus Siegen, Siegen, Germany.', 'University Hospital Frankfurt a.M., Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Universitatsklinikum Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Rems-Murr-Klinikum Winnenden, Winnenden, Germany.', 'Philipps University Marburg, Marburg, Germany.', 'Philipps University Marburg, and University Hospital Giessen and Marburg, Marburg, Germany.', 'Westfalische Wilhelms-Universitat Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Institut fur Medizinische Informatik und Biomathematik, Universitat Munster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik 5, Klinikum Nurnberg, Paracelsus Medizinische Privatuniversitat, Nurnberg, Nuernberg, Germany.', 'University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Uni-Klinikum Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Hospital Chemnitz, Chemnitz, Germany.', 'University Cancer Center Mainz, Wiesbaden, Germany.', 'UK Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'St. Bernward Krankenhaus, Hildesheim, Germany.', 'Robert Bosch Hospital Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany, Dresden, Germany.', 'Charite University Hospital, Berlin, Germany.', 'University Hospital Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany, Dresden, Germany.', 'Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany, Germany.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Medical Clinic and Policlinic I, Leipzig University Hospital, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Universitaetsklinikum Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'University Hospital, Dresden, Germany.', 'DKMS Clinical Trials Unit, Dresden, Germany, Germany.', 'University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'National Center for Tumor Diseases, Dresden (NCT/UCC);

We analyze the characteristics, treatment patterns and outcomes of sAML adult patients of the Programa Espanol de Tratamientos en Hematologia (PETHEMA) registry. Overall, 6211 (72.9%) were de novo and 2310 (27.1%) sAML, divided into myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS-AML, 44%), MDS/myeloproliferative (MDS/MPN-AML, 10%), MPN-AML (11%), therapy-related (t-AML, 25%), and antecedent neoplasia without prior chemotherapy/radiotherapy (neo-AML, 9%). Compared to de novo, sAML were older (median age 69 years old), had more ECOG >/=2 (35%) or high-risk cytogenetics (40%), less FLT3-ITD (11%) and NPM1 mutations (21%), and received less intensive chemotherapy regimens (38%) (all P<0.001). Median OS was higher in de novo than in sAML (10.9 vs 5.6 months, P<0.001); and shorter in sAML after hematologic disorder (MDS, MDS/MPN or MPN) as compared to t-AML and neo-AML (5.3 vs 6.1 vs 5.7 months, respectively, P=0.04). After intensive chemotherapy, median OS was better among de novo and neo-AML patients (17.2 and 14.6 months). No OS differences were observed after hypomethylating agents according to type of AML. sAML was as an independent adverse prognostic factor for OS. We confirm high prevalence and adverse features of sAML and we establish its independent adverse prognostic value.

The diagnosis of Fanconi anemia is primarily based on the chromosomal breakage but FA gene sequencing is recommended in all patients with a positive chromosome fragility test. Here, we present a 32-year-old man with advanced tonsil squamous cell carcinoma and fatal toxicity after the first cycle of chemotherapy. No anemia was present. A recent variant mutation if the FANCM gene was detected (c1511_1515delGAGTA (pArg504AsnfsTer29)). Homozygous or double heterozygous pathogenic variants have been reported in FANCM and linked to azoospermia and primary ovarian failure without anemia. Alterations in this gene have also been associated with a genetic predisposition for solid tumors (breast and ovarian cancer) and hematological malignancies (B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia).

Drug repurposing can expedite the preclinical development of new therapies, and by nanocarrier encapsulation, the number of potentially viable drug candidates can be further expanded. The anti-psychotic drug chlorpromazine (CPZ) has been identified as a candidate for repurposing for AML therapy. Nanoencapsulation may improve the suitability of CPZ for the treatment of AML by reducing its effect on the central nervous system. Using the emulsion-evaporation technique, we have developed PEGylated PLGA nanoparticles loaded with CPZ for AML therapy. The nanoparticles were characterised to be between 150 and 300 nm by DLS, of spherical morphology by TEM, with a drug loading of at least 6.0% (w/w). After an initial burst release of adsorbed drug, the remaining 80% of the drug was retained in the PLGA nanoparticles for at least 24 h. The CPZ-loaded nanoparticles had equal cytotoxic potential towards AML cells to free CPZ, but acted more slowly, in line with the protracted drug release. Crucially, nanoparticles injected intravenously into zebrafish larvae did not accumulate in the brain, and nanoencapsulation also prevented CPZ from crossing an artificial membrane model. This demonstrates that the purpose for nanoencapsulation of CPZ is fulfilled, namely avoiding effects on the central nervous system while retaining the anti-AML activity of the drug.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors.

Exposure to VOCs can be assessed by measuring their metabolites in urine. Little is known, however, about the temporal variability in urinary VOC metabolite (VOCM) concentrations within- and between-individuals. In this study, we determined the variability in the concentrations of 38 VOCMs in urine samples collected from 19 healthy individuals across a period of 44 days. We also measured seven biomarkers of oxidative stress (lipid, protein and DNA damage) in urine to assess the relationship of VOC exposure to oxidative stress. Seventeen VOCMs had detection frequencies (DFs) of >60% in urine, and we limited further data analysis to those compounds. The creatinine-adjusted geometric mean concentrations of VOCMs ranged from 2.70 mug/g to 327 mug/g in spot and 2.60 mug/g to 551 mug/g in first morning void (FMV) urine samples. Calculation of the intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) for 17 VOCM concentrations to assess their predictability and repeatability in urinary measurements showed ranges of 0.080-0.425 in spot and 0.050-0.749 in FMV urine samples, revealing notable within-individual variability. Our results suggest that taking only single measurements of VOCM concentrations in urine in epidemiological investigations may lead to exposure misclassification. In addition, VOCM concentrations were significantly and positively correlated with oxidative stress biomarkers. This study thus provides important information for formulating sampling strategies in the biomonitoring of VOC exposure in human populations.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we report the prespecified final analysis of overall survival and long-term safety results. METHODS: This open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial enrolled patients from 41 sites in eight countries across Europe and the USA. Patients were 18 years and older with locally advanced or metastatic, well differentiated, somatostatin receptor-positive midgut neuroendocrine tumours (Karnofsky performance status score >/=60) and disease progression on fixed-dose long-acting octreotide. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive web-based response system to intravenous (177)Lu-Dotatate 7.4 GBq (200 mCi) every 8 weeks (four cycles) plus intramuscular long-acting octreotide 30 mg ((177)Lu-Dotatate group) or high-dose long-acting octreotide 60 mg every 4 weeks (control group). The primary endpoint of progression-free survival has been previously reported; here, we report the key secondary endpoint of overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Final overall survival analysis was prespecified to occur either after 158 deaths or 5 years after the last patient was randomised, whichever occurred first. During long-term follow-up, adverse events of special interest were reported in the (177)Lu-Dotatate group only. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01578239. FINDINGS: From Sept 6, 2012, to Jan 14, 2016, 231 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned for treatment. The prespecified final analysis occurred 5 years after the last patient was randomly assigned (when 142 deaths had occurred); median follow-up was 76.3 months (range 0.4-95.0) in the (177)Lu-Dotatate group and 76.5 months (0.1-92.3) in the control group. The secondary endpoint of overall survival was not met: median overall survival was 48.0 months (95% CI 37.4-55.2) in the (177)Lu-Dotatate group and 36.3 months (25.9-51.7) in the control group (HR 0.84 [95% CI 0.60-1.17]; two-sided p=0.30). During long-term follow-up, treatment-related serious adverse events of grade 3 or worse were recorded in three (3%) of 111 patients in the (177)Lu-Dotatate group, but no new treatment-related serious adverse events were reported after the safety analysis cutoff. Two (2%) of 111 patients given (177)Lu-Dotatate developed myelodysplastic syndrome, one of whom died 33 months after randomisation (this person was the only the only reported (177)Lu-Dotatate treatment-related death). No new cases of myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukaemia were reported during long-term follow-up. INTERPRETATION: (177)Lu-Dotatate treatment did not significantly improve median overall survival versus high-dose long-acting octreotide. Despite final overall survival not reaching statistical significance, the 11.7 month difference in median overall survival with (177)Lu-Dotatate treatment versus high-dose long-acting octreotide alone might be considered clinically relevant. No new safety signals were reported during long-term follow-up. FUNDING: Advanced Accelerator Applications, a Novartis company.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Missense mutations of this gene have already been found in patients of CTCL and AITL. The non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) can alter the protein structure as well as its functions. In this study, probable deleterious and disease-related nsSNPs in PLCG1 were identified using SIFT, PROVEAN, PolyPhen-2, PhD-SNP, Pmut, and SNPS&GO tools. Further, their effect on protein stability was checked along with conservation and solvent accessibility analysis by I-mutant 2.0, MUpro, Consurf, and Netsurf 2.0 server. Some SNPs were finalized for structural analysis with PyMol and BIOVIA discovery studio visualizer. Out of the 16 nsSNPs which were found to be deleterious, ten nsSNPs had an effect on protein stability, and six mutations (L411P, R355C, G493D, R1158H, A401V and L455F) were predicted to be highly conserved. Among the six highly conserved mutations, four nsSNPs (R355C, A401V, L411P and L455F) were part of the catalytic domain. L411P, L455F and G493D made significant structural change in the protein structure. Two mutations-Y210C and R1158H had post-translational modification.

These characteristics make treatment of infant AML challenging. While infant AML is a relatively rare disease, it has enormous impact on families, and in terms of life-years-lost and life limiting morbidities. To better understand the mechanisms that drive infant AML, we performed integrative analyses of genome-wide mRNA, miRNA, and DNA-methylation data in diagnosis-stage patient samples. Here, we report the activation of an onco-fetal B-cell developmental gene regulatory network in infant AML. AML in infants is genomically distinct from AML in older children/adults in that it has more structural genomic aberrations and fewer mutations. Differential expression analysis of ~1500 pediatric AML samples revealed a large number of infant-specific genes, many of which are associated with B cell development and function. 18 of these genes form a well-studied B-cell gene regulatory network that includes the epigenetic regulators BRD4 and POU2AF1, and their onco-fetal targets LIN28B and IGF2BP3. All four genes are hypo-methylated in infant AML. Moreover, micro-RNA Let7a-2 is expressed in a mutually exclusive manner with its target and regulator LIN28B. These findings suggest infant AML may respond to bromodomain inhibitors and immune therapies targeting CD19, CD20, CD22, and CD79A.",,"['Bolouri, Hamid', 'Ries, Rhonda', 'Pardo, Laura', 'Hylkema, Tiffany', 'Zhou, Wanding', 'Smith, Jenny L', 'Leonti, Amanda', 'Loken, Michael', 'Farrar, Jason E', 'Triche, Timothy J Jr', 'Meshinchi, Soheil']","['Bolouri H', 'Ries R', 'Pardo L', 'Hylkema T', 'Zhou W', 'Smith JL', 'Leonti A', 'Loken M', 'Farrar JE', 'Triche TJ Jr', 'Meshinchi S']","['Center for Systems Immunology, Benaroya Research Institute, Seattle, WA, United States of America.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, United States of America.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, United States of America.', 'Hematologics Inc., Seattle, WA, United States of America.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, United States of America.', 'Van Andel Research Institute, Grand Rapids, MI, United States of America.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, United States of America.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, United States of America.', 'Hematologics Inc., Seattle, WA, United States of America.', ""Arkansas Children's Research Institute and University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, United States of America."", 'Van Andel Research Institute, Grand Rapids, MI, United States of America.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, United States of America.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20211118,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['ML is an employee of and has equity ownership in Hematologics Inc. and LP is an', 'employee of Hematologics Inc.

Exclusion of candidate donors with CH is controversial since its impact on recipient outcomes and graft alloimmune function is uncertain. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed targeted error-corrected sequencing on samples from 1,727 donors age 40 years or older and assessed the effect of donor CH on recipient clinical outcomes. We measured long-term engraftment of 102 donor clones and cytokine levels in 256 recipients at 3 and 12 months after transplant. RESULTS: CH was present in 22.5% of donors, with DNMT3A (14.6%) and TET2 (5.2%) mutations being most common; 85% of donor clones showed long-term engraftment in recipients after transplantation, including clones with a variant allele fraction < 0.01. DNMT3A-CH with a variant allele fraction >/= 0.01, but not smaller clones, was associated with improved recipient overall (hazard ratio [HR], 0.79; P = .042) and progression-free survival (HR, 0.72; P = .003) after adjustment for significant clinical variables. In patients who received calcineurin-based graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis, donor DNMT3A-CH was associated with reduced relapse (subdistribution HR, 0.59; P = .014), increased chronic graft-versus-host disease (subdistribution HR, 1.36; P = .042), and higher interleukin-12p70 levels in recipients. No recipient of sole DNMT3A or TET2-CH developed donor cell leukemia (DCL). In seven of eight cases, DCL evolved from donor CH with rare TP53 or splicing factor mutations or from donors carrying germline DDX41 mutations. CONCLUSION: Donor CH is closely associated with clinical outcomes in transplant recipients, with differential impact on graft alloimmune function and potential for leukemic transformation related to mutated gene and somatic clonal abundance. Donor DNMT3A-CH is associated with improved recipient survival because of reduced relapse risk and with an augmented network of inflammatory cytokines in recipients. Risk of DCL in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is driven by somatic myelodysplastic syndrome-associated mutations or germline predisposition in donors.",,"['Gibson, Christopher J', 'Kim, Haesook T', 'Zhao, Lin', 'Murdock, H Moses', 'Hambley, Bryan', 'Ogata, Alana', 'Madero-Marroquin, Rafael', 'Wang, Shiyu', 'Green, Lisa', 'Fleharty, Mark', 'Dougan, Tyler', 'Cheng, Chi-An', 'Blumenstiel, Brendan', 'Cibulskis, Carrie', 'Tsuji, Junko', 'Duran, Madeleine', 'Gocke, Christopher D', 'Antin, Joseph H', 'Nikiforow, Sarah', 'DeZern, Amy E', 'Chen, Yi-Bin', 'Ho, Vincent T', 'Jones, Richard J', 'Lennon, Niall J', 'Walt, David R', 'Ritz, Jerome', 'Soiffer, Robert J', 'Gondek, Lukasz P', 'Lindsley, R Coleman']","['Gibson CJ', 'Kim HT', 'Zhao L', 'Murdock HM', 'Hambley B', 'Ogata A', 'Madero-Marroquin R', 'Wang S', 'Green L', 'Fleharty M', 'Dougan T', 'Cheng CA', 'Blumenstiel B', 'Cibulskis C', 'Tsuji J', 'Duran M', 'Gocke CD', 'Antin JH', 'Nikiforow S', 'DeZern AE', 'Chen YB', 'Ho VT', 'Jones RJ', 'Lennon NJ', 'Walt DR', 'Ritz J', 'Soiffer RJ', 'Gondek LP', 'Lindsley RC']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Data Science, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Hematology, Shuguang Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China.', ""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."", 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."", 'Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, Harvard University, Boston, MA.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.', 'Genomics Platform, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA.', 'Genomics Platform, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."", 'Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, Harvard University, Boston, MA.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."", 'Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, Harvard University, Boston, MA.', 'Genomics Platform, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA.', 'Genomics Platform, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA.', 'Genomics Platform, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA.', 'Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.', 'Division of Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.', 'Hematopoietic Cell Transplant and Cell Therapy Program, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.', 'Genomics Platform, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."", 'Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, Harvard University, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20211118,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Alana OgataPatents, Royalties, Other Intellectual Property: AFO reports royalty', ""payments from Brigham and Women's Hospital for the intellectual property of the"", 'SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays that was licensed to Quanterix Inc.

Despite promising clinical results and multiple ongoing trials, preclinical data are lacking and the molecular mechanism of action of ARB against SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that ARB binds to the spike viral fusion glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain as well as its more virulent variants from the United Kingdom (strain B.1.1.7) and South Africa (strain B.1.351). We pinpoint the ARB binding site on the S protein to the S2 membrane fusion domain and use an infection assay with Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) pseudoviruses (PVs) pseudotyped with the S proteins of the Wuhan strain and the new variants to show that this interaction is sufficient for the viral cell entry inhibition by ARB.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence, risk factors, causative pathogens and the impact on survival of IFI in pediatric leukemia patients. Materials and Methods: The hospital records of 307 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, n=238), acute myeloid leukemia (AML, n=51) and relapsed leukemia (n=18) between January 2010 and December 2015 were retrospectively evaluated. Results: A total of 1213 febrile neutropenia episodes were recorded and 127(10.4%) of them were related to IFI. Of 307 children, 121(39.4%) developed IFI. The mean age was found significantly older in the IFI group compared to children without IFI (p<0.001). IFI were defined as possible, probable and proven in 73.2%, 11.9%, and 14.9% of the attacks, respectively. Invasive aspergillosis (81.9%) was the most frequent infection, followed by invasive candidiasis (13.4%) and rare fungal diseases (4.8%). Majority of the IFI attacks both in ALL and AML occurred during the induction phase. In total, the death rate was 24% and IFI related mortality was found 18%. The mortality rate in children with IFI was found significantly higher in children without IFI (p<0.001). Overall and event free survivals at 5 years was also found significantly lower in the IFI group (p<0.001). Relapse (Odds ratio, 8.49) was the most effective risk factor on mortality which was followed by developing an IFI episode (Odds ratio, 3.2) and AML (Odds ratio, 2.33) by multivariate regression analysis. Conclusions: Our data showed that IFI was more common in older children. Although proven and probable IFI episodes were more frequently diagnosed in relapse and AML, children with ALL and AML had a similar frequency of experiencing at least one episode of IFI. Rare fungal diseases were also defined as a major problem. Despite the success in treatment, IFI increased the rate of mortality in children with acute leukemia.",,"['Sezgin Evim, Melike', 'Tufekci, Ozlem', 'Baytan, Birol', 'Oren, Hale', 'Celebi, Solmaz', 'Ener, Beyza', 'Ustun Elmas, Kevser', 'Yilmaz, Sebnem', 'Erdem, Melek', 'Hacimustafaoglu, Mustafa Kemal', 'Gunes, Adalet Meral']","['Sezgin Evim M', 'Tufekci O', 'Baytan B', 'Oren H', 'Celebi S', 'Ener B', 'Ustun Elmas K', 'Yilmaz S', 'Erdem M', 'Hacimustafaoglu MK', 'Gunes AM']","['Uludag University Medical Faculty, Department of Pediatric Hematology, Bursa, Turkey.', 'Dokuz Eylul University Medical Faculty, Department of Pediatric Hematology, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Uludag University Medical Faculty, Department of Pediatric Hematology, Bursa, Turkey.', 'Dokuz Eylul University Medical Faculty, Department of Pediatric Hematology, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Uludag University Medical Faculty, Department of Pediatric Infection Disease, Bursa, Turkey.', 'Uludag University Medical Faculty, Medical Microbiology, Bursa, Turkey.', 'Uludag University Medical Faculty, Department of Pediatrics, Bursa, Turkey.', 'Dokuz Eylul University Medical Faculty, Department of Pediatric Hematology, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Dokuz Eylul University Medical Faculty, Department of Pediatric Hematology, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Uludag University Medical Faculty, Department of Pediatric Infection Disease, Bursa, Turkey.', 'Uludag University Medical Faculty, Department of Pediatric Hematology, Bursa, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211118,Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,IM,,2021/11/19 06:00,2021/11/19 06:00,['2021/11/18 09:27'],"['2021/11/18 09:27 [entrez]', '2021/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4274/tjh.galenos.2021.2021.0203 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Turk J Haematol. 2021 Nov 18. doi: 10.4274/tjh.galenos.2021.2021.0203.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To describe the clinical presentation and outcome of a novel T-cell leukaemia in English bulldogs and determine the frequency of this neoplasm in other breeds. The Clinical Hematopathology database, containing immunophenotyping data from peripheral blood of nearly 11 900 dogs, was queried for the phenotype observed in young English bulldogs: CD45(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) CD5(+) CD3(+) class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-low T-cell leukaemia. Clinical presentation, treatment, and survival data were collected for a subset of cases. Fifty-five English bulldog cases and 64 cases of other breeds were identified. No other breed was represented by >5 cases. Complete medical records were obtained for 50 bulldogs. Median age at diagnosis was 3 years and 76% of cases were male. Median lymphocyte count was 44 286 lymphocytes/mul (range, 1800-317 684/mul) and lymphocytes were described as small to intermediate-sized. Many dogs were thrombocytopenic and had liver and spleen involvement, but not lymphadenopathy. Bulldogs that received multi-agent chemotherapy had longer median survival times (83 days) compared to dogs that received no treatment (6 days) or less aggressive therapy (15 days) (p = .001). Non-bulldogs had similar outcomes. CD4(-) CD8(-) class II MHC-low T-cell leukaemia has an aggressive clinical course and predilection for young English bulldogs.

Bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM MSCs) support leukaemic cells in preventing chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. This encouraged us to investigate leukaemia-BM niche-associated signalling and to identify signalling cascades supporting the interaction of leukaemic cells and BM MSC. Our study demonstrated functional differences between MSCs originating from leukaemic (AML MSCs) and healthy donors (HD MSCs). The direct interaction of leukaemic and AML MSCs was indispensable in influencing AML cell proliferation. We further identified an important role for Notch expression and its activation in AML MSCs contributing to the enhanced proliferation of AML cells. Supporting this observation, overexpression of the intracellular Notch domain (Notch ICN) in AML MSCs enhanced AML cells' proliferation. From a therapeutic point of view, dexamethasone treatment impeded Notch signalling in AML MSCs resulting in reduced AML cell proliferation. Concurrent with our data, Notch inhibitors had only a marginal effect on leukaemic cells alone but strongly influenced Notch signalling in AML MSCs and abrogated their cytoprotective function on AML cells. In vivo, dexamethasone treatment impeded Notch signalling in AML MSCs leading to a reduced number of AML MSCs and improved survival of leukaemic mice. In summary, targeting the interaction of leukaemic cells and AML MSCs using dexamethasone or Notch inhibitors might further improve treatment outcomes in AML patients.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Epigenetics underlies how cells that posses DNA with similar sequences develop into different cell types with different functions in an organism. Earlier epigenetic research has primarily been focused at the chromatin level. However, the number of studies on epigenetic modifications of RNA, such as N(1)methyladenosine, 2'Oribosemethylation, inosine, 5methylcytidine, N(6)methyladenosine (m(6)A) and pseudouridine, has seen an increase. Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a type of RNA species that lacks a 5' cap or 3' poly(A) tail, are abundantly expressed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and may regulate disease progression. circRNAs possess various functions, including microRNA sponging, gene transcription regulation and RNAbinding protein interaction. Furthermore, circRNAs are m(6)A methylated in other types of cancer, such as colorectal and hypopharyngeal squamous cell cancers. Therefore, the critical roles of circRNA epigenetic modifications, particularly m(6)A, and their possible involvement in AML are discussed in the present review.

The present study aimed to identify the underlying mechanism of KIF2A regulation of AML cell function and chemosensitivity. A total of 58 patients with AML and 30 healthy subjects were enrolled for clinical analysis. AML cells (KG1 and Kasumi1) were transfected with KIF2A or control small interfering (si)RNA. PI3K/AKT pathway activator (740 YP) and RhoA overexpression plasmid were added to rescue the effect of KIF2A siRNA. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, chemosensitivity to ADR and AraC, expression levels of mRNA/proteins associated with PI3K/AKT and RhoA/ROCK pathways were measured by Cell Counting Kit8, flow cytometry, reverse transcriptionquantitative PCR and western blotting. KIF2A was overexpressed, and correlated with higher levels of bone marrow blast, poor risk classification, lower treatment response and unfavorable survival profile in patients with AML. KIF2A siRNA inhibited proliferation but enhanced apoptosis and chemosensitivity to ADR and AraC in KG1 and Kasumi1 cells, which also inactivated PI3K/AKT and RhoA/ROCK pathways. Subsequent rescue experiments showed that 740 YP and RhoA overexpression plasmid promoted cell survival and decreased chemosensitivity, which reversed the effect of KIF2A siRNA in KG1 and Kasumi1 cells. KIF2A was correlated with worse clinical features and survival in patients with AML; its knockdown promoted apoptosis and chemosensitivity by inactivating PI3K/AKT and RhoA/ROCK signaling pathways in AML cells.

With high rates of remission, deep and durable responses, and safe toxicity profile, venetoclax in combination therapy has been extremely effective, garnering accelerated approval and becoming standard of care in lymphoid and myeloid malignancies. AREAS COVERED: Preclinical and clinical experience of venetoclax monotherapy and combination therapy in relapsed/refractory and frontline CLL, AML, ALL, high-risk MDS and BPDCN with an emphasis on key clinical trials and efficacy of combination regimens in distinct mutational landscapes. Strategies to mitigate myelosuppression and manage dose adjustments and infectious complications are addressed. EXPERT OPINION: Targeting BCL-2 offers a safe and highly effective adjunct to available therapies in hematologic malignancies. Despite success and frequent utilization of venetoclax, several resistance mechanisms have been elucidated, prompting the development of novel combinatorial strategies. Further, on-target myelosuppression of venetoclax is a key obstacle in clinical practice, requiring diligent monitoring and practice-based knowledge of dose modifications. Despite these limitations, venetoclax has gained tremendous popularity in hematologic-oncology, becoming an integral component of numerous combination regimes, with ongoing plethora of clinical trials encompassing standard chemotherapy, targeted agents and immune-based approaches.",,"['Siddiqui, Maria', 'Konopleva, Marina']","['Siddiqui M', 'Konopleva M']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20220113,England,Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol,Expert review of clinical pharmacology,101278296,IM,,2021/11/19 06:00,2021/11/19 06:00,['2021/11/18 08:43'],"['2021/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/19 06:00 [medline]', '2021/11/18 08:43 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17512433.2021.2008239 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol. 2022 Jan 13:1-16. doi: 10.1080/17512433.2021.2008239.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Venetoclax', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'myelodysplastic syndrome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients on ibrutinib at 420 mg daily for 2 months or with abnormal serum beta2M levels after 6 months or with persistent lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly after 12 months were randomized to receive DEX 40 mg on days 1-4 of a 4-week cycle for six cycles alone (three patients) or with ruxolitinib 15 mg BID on days 1-21 of each cycle (five patients). Ruxolitinib dosing was based on a previous phase I trial. Steroid withdrawal symptoms and significantly decreased serum IgG levels occurred in all patients regardless of their exposure to ruxolitinib. A fatal invasive fungal infection was seen in a patient taking DEX without ruxolitinib. Complete responses anticipated with addition of ruxolitinib were not seen. Gene expression studies suggested ruxolitinib had turned off interferon signaling in CLL cells and turned on genes associated with the activation of NFkappaB by TNF-alpha. Ruxolitinib increased blood levels of TNF-alpha by cycle 3 and decreased the inhibitory cytokine IL-10. These results suggest ruxolitinib releases activating signals for CLL cells that persist in patients on ibrutinib. This inhibitory JAK signaling may contribute to the therapeutic activity of ibrutinib. Thus JAK inhibitors provide no added value with ibrutinib for disease control and should be used with caution in CLL patients. Combining glucocorticoids with ibrutinib may increase the risk of serious infects.,['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Several studies suggest that the poor outcome is due to a small fraction of leukaemic cells that elude treatment and survive in specialised, oxygen (O2 )-deprived niches of the bone marrow. Although several AML drug targets such as FLT3, IDH1/2 and CD33 have been established in recent years, survival rates remain unsatisfactory, which indicates that other, yet unrecognized, mechanisms influence the ability of AML cells to escape cell death and to proliferate in hypoxic environments. Our data illustrates that Carbonic Anhydrases IX and XII (CA IX/XII) are critical for leukaemic cell survival in the O2 -deprived milieu. CA IX and XII function as transmembrane proteins that mediate intracellular pH under low O2 conditions. Because maintaining a neutral pH represents a key survival mechanism for tumour cells in O2 -deprived settings, we sought to elucidate the role of dual CA IX/XII inhibition as a novel strategy to eliminate AML cells under hypoxic conditions. Our findings demonstrate that the dual CA IX/XII inhibitor FC531 may prove to be of value as an adjunct to chemotherapy for the treatment of AML.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

The major source of eQTL data for is the Gene and Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, which is comprised entirely of adults, mainly those > 50 years of age at death. Since gene expression levels differ by developmental stage, it is not clear whether eQTLs derived from adult data sources are best suited for use in young-onset diseases such as pediatric cancers. To fill in this knowledge gap, we performed a large-scale eQTL mapping analysis in the GenCord study with newborn samples and compared it with GTEx. Under matched conditions, we found around 80% of the eQTLs in one study can be replicated in the other. However, among all eQTLs identified in GenCord (GTEx), 584 (1045) showed statistically significant differences in effect sizes in GTEx (GenCord). We further investigated how using fetal eQTL data can facilitate the genetic association study of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. GenCord and GTEx identified the same genetic loci with statistical significance; however, the overall association pattern was only weakly correlated. Our paper demonstrates age-differential eQTLs and shows their potential influence on childhood leukemia research.","['(c) The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press.

Overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 is associated with a lower overall survival rate in AML patients. Venetoclax (ABT199) is a selective inhibitor of Bcl-2 that has a significant effect in AML, but single-drug resistance often occurs due to the high expression of Mcl-1 protein. Studies have confirmed that chidamide can downregulate the expression levels of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 and induce apoptosis. Methods: This study aimed to use AML cell lines and primary cells to study the effects of venetoclax and chidamide combination therapy on AML cell apoptosis, the cell cycle, and changes in related signaling pathways in vitro; establish an AML mouse model to observe the efficacy and survival time of combination therapy in vivo; and analyze the drug effects with multi-omics sequencing technology. The changes in gene and protein expression before and after treatment were examined to clarify the molecular mechanism driving the synergistic effect of the two drugs. Results: (I) Both venetoclax and chidamide promoted apoptosis in AML cell lines and primary cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The effect was further enhanced when the two drugs were combined, and a synergistic effect was observed (combination index <1). (II) At both the mRNA and protein levels, the expression of Mcl-1 was upregulated by venetoclax and downregulated by chidamide, and the expression of Mcl-1 decreased further after combination treatment. (III) Transcriptome sequencing showed that differentially expressed genes in the combination group compared with the venetoclax monotherapy group were mainly enriched in the PI3K-AKT pathway and JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Moreover, qRT-PCR and Western blot confirmed these results. (IV) The combination therapy group exhibited significantly inhibited disease progression and a prolonged survival time among AML mice. Conclusions: Chidamide combined with venetoclax synergistically promoted apoptosis in AML cell lines and primary cells by inhibiting activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway and JAK2/STAT3 pathway.",['2021 Annals of Translational Medicine.

However, the specific expression and prognostic value of B7 members in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains unclear; hence, an investigation using online bioinformatics databases is required. Methods: In this study, we explored the expression of B7 molecules using the ONCOMINE, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis 2 (GEPIA2), and UALCAN databases, while the prognostic value of B7 molecules in AML was analyzed using the LinkedOmics, GEPIA2, UALCAN, and TCGAportal databases. Additionally, genetic alteration and gene co-expression analysis of the B7 family was performed via the cBioPortal and LinkedOmics databases, while functional and pathway enrichment analyses were conducted using the Metascape databases for Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses. Results: The message RNA (mRNA) levels of B7 family members varied in AML patients, and aberrant highly expressed B7 members were correlated with poor prognosis in AML, including B7.1, B7-DC, B7-H3, B7-H5, and B7-H7. B7-H6 acted as a protective molecule for overall survival (OS), while B7-H1 overexpression was inclined to predict poor prognosis. B7 family gene alteration occurred frequently in AML, and the altered B7 group seemed to exhibit a trend towards worse OS. The co-expression genes and relative signaling pathways of the B7 family might be involved in oncogenesis and be associated with prognosis in AML. Conclusions: Our study showed that aberrantly expressed B7 family molecules affected the prognosis of AML patients, and thus, could be promising prognostic biomarkers and new therapeutic targets.",['2021 Annals of Translational Medicine.

Twelve patients previously received haploidentical transplantation, while 8 patients received HLA-matched transplantation. The median relapse time was 12 months (range, 4 to 72). Thirteen patients received autologous CAR T cells, and 7 patients received allogeneic CAR T cells, which were derived from transplant donors. The median infusion dose was 2.9x106/kg (range, 0.33 to 12x106/kg). Nineteen patients were evaluated for efficacy, among which 17 patients (89.5%) achieved MRD negative. The CR rates in the HLA-matched transplantation group and haploidentical transplantation group were 100% (7/7) and 83.3% (10/12), respectively. The median follow-up time was 9.80 months (range, 2.40 to 64.97). Ten patients (50%) died of relapse, 3 patients (15%) died of infection, and 1 patient (5%) died of aGVHD. Fifteen patients (75%) developed CRS, including 3 (20%) grade 1 CRS, 6 (40%) grade 2 CRS, and 6 (40%) grade 3 CRS. Ten patients (50%) developed aGVHD, including 1 (10%) grade I aGVHD, 6 (60%) grade II aGVHD, and 3 (30%) grade III aGVHD. The log rank test showed that CAR T cell origin was correlated with aGVHD occurrence in the haploidentical transplantation group (P = 0.005). The authors' study indicated that the initial efficacy and safety of CAR T cell therapy for patients with post-transplant relapse were satisfactory. However, aGVHD was a concern in patients with a history of haploidentical transplantation occupied with allogeneic CAR T cells, which warrants clinical attention.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Ding, Wang,

Therefore, the feasibility of using CAR-T cells to treat solid tumors is actively evaluated. Currently, multiple basic research projects and clinical trials are being conducted to treat lung cancer with CAR-T cell therapy. Although numerous advances in CAR-T cell therapy have been made in hematological tumors, the technology still entails considerable challenges in treating lung cancer, such as on-target, of-tumor toxicity, paucity of tumor-specific antigen targets, T cell exhaustion in the tumor microenvironment, and low infiltration level of immune cells into solid tumor niches, which are even more complicated than their application in hematological tumors. Thus, progress in the scientific understanding of tumor immunology and improvements in the manufacture of cell products are advancing the clinical translation of these important cellular immunotherapies. This review focused on the latest research progress of CAR-T cell therapy in lung cancer treatment and for the first time, demonstrated the underlying challenges and future engineering strategies for the clinical application of CAR-T cell therapy against lung cancer.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Xiao, Zhang, Zhu, Cui, Lu, Yu and Wu.']","['Xiao, Bu-Fan', 'Zhang, Jing-Tao', 'Zhu, Yu-Ge', 'Cui, Xin-Run', 'Lu, Zhe-Ming', 'Yu, Ben-Tong', 'Wu, Nan']","['Xiao BF', 'Zhang JT', 'Zhu YG', 'Cui XR', 'Lu ZM', 'Yu BT', 'Wu N']","['Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Thoracic Surgery II, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Thoracic Surgery II, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Thoracic Surgery II, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education/Beijing), Laboratory of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Thoracic Surgery II, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211101,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",2021/11/19 06:00,2021/11/19 06:00,['2021/11/18 06:57'],"['2021/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/18 06:57 [entrez]', '2021/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2021.782775 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2021 Nov 1;12:782775. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.782775. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8591168,['NOTNLM'],"['T cell', 'chimeric antigen receptor', 'engineering strategy', 'immunotherapy', 'lung cancer']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Emerging evidence shows that methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2 (MBD2), a DNA methylation reader, often participates in the transcriptional silencing of hypermethylated genes in cancer cells. Nevertheless, the role of MBD2 in AML remains unclear. Herein, by using an MLL-AF9 murine model and a human AML cell line, we observed that loss of MBD2 could delay the initiation and progression of leukemia. MBD2 depletion significantly reduced the leukemia burden by decreasing the proportion of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) and inhibiting leukemia cell proliferation in serial transplantation experiments, thereby allowing leukemic blasts to transition to a more mature state reflecting normal myelopoiesis. Both gene expression analyses and bioinformatic studies revealed that MBD2 negatively modulated genes related to myeloid differentiation, and was necessary to sustain the MLL-AF9 oncogene-induced gene program. We further demonstrated that MBD2 could promote LSC cell cycle progression through epigenetic regulation of CDKN1C transcription probably by binding to its promoter region. Taken together, our data suggest that MBD2 promotes AML development and could be a therapeutic target for myeloid malignancies.",['(c) 2021.

A functional precision medicine tumor board (FPMTB) integrated clinical, molecular, and functional data for application in clinical treatment decisions. Actionable drugs were found for 97% of patients with AML, and the recommendations were clinically implemented in 37 relapsed or refractory patients. We report a 59% objective response rate for the individually tailored therapies, including 13 complete responses, as well as bridging five patients with AML to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Data integration across all cases enabled the identification of drug response biomarkers, such as the association of IL15 overexpression with resistance to FLT3 inhibitors. Integration of molecular profiling and large-scale drug response data across many patients will enable continuous improvement of the FPMTB recommendations, providing a paradigm for individualized implementation of functional precision cancer medicine. SIGNIFICANCE: Oncogenomics data can guide clinical treatment decisions, but often such data are neither actionable nor predictive. Functional ex vivo drug testing contributes significant additional, clinically actionable therapeutic insights for individual patients with AML.

Circular RNAs have drawn great attention in cancer research area and propofol is a widely applied intravenous anesthetic agent. METHODS: In the current study, we explored the function of circular RNA nucleolar and coiled-body phosphoprotein 1 (circNOLC1) in CSCs of breast cancer and the inhibitory impact of propofol on circNOLC1. RESULTS: The expression of circNOLC1 was induced in breast cancer tissues compared with the non-tumor tissues. The silencing of circNOLC1 was able to repress the viability of breast cancer cells. Meanwhile, the numbers of colony formation were suppressed by circNOLC1 knockdown in breast cancer cells. The inhibition of circNOLC1 reduced the invasion and migration ability of breast cancer cells. The mRNA and protein levels of E-cadherin were enhanced but Vimentin levels were reduced by the silencing of circNOLC1. The repression of circNOLC1 decreased the side population (SP) ratio in breast cancer cells. Meanwhile, the sphere formation ability of breast cancer cells was attenuated by the silencing of circNOLC1. The levels of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily G member 2 (ABCG2), c-Myc, B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (Bmi1), and SRY-box transcription factor 2 (Sox2) were repressed by the depletion of circNOLC1 in the cells. Regarding to the mechanism, circNOLC1 functioned as a competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) for microRNA-365a-3p (miR-365a-3p) and the inhibition of miR-365a-3p rescued circNOLC1 depletion-repressed proliferation and cancer stem cell activity of breast cancer. MiR-365a-3p targeted signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in breast cancer cells and circNOLC1 enhanced STAT3 expression by sponging miR-365a-3p. The overexpression of STAT3 could reverse miR-365a-3p or circNOLC1 depletion-inhibited proliferation and cancer stem cell properties of breast cancer. Interestingly, the expression of circNOLC1 and STAT3 was repressed by the treatment of propofol. The enrichment of STAT3 on circNOLC1 promoter was inhibited by propofol. The expression of circNOLC1 was suppressed by the silencing of STAT3 in the cells. The inhibition of circNOLC1 expression by propofol was rescued under the co-treatment of STAT3 overexpression. The overexpression of circNOLC1 rescued propofol-attenuated proliferation and cancer stem cell functions in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, we concluded that circNOLC1 contributes to CSCs properties and progression of breast cancer by targeting miR-365a-3p /STAT3 axis and propofol inhibited circNOLC1 by repressing STAT3 in a feedback mechanism.",['(c) 2021.

Multiple studies reported that microRNA-204 (miR-204) and Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) played important roles in types of cancers. However, the potential molecular regulatory mechanism between miR-204 and HGF in AML remains to be further defined. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) was adopted to detect the expression of miR-204 and HG. Relative protein levels were detected by western blot assay. The viability, cell cycle, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were analyzed by MTT, flow cytometry, and transwell assays. Moreover, the target relationship between miR-204 and HGF was predicted by MiRcode website and confirmed by luciferase reporter, RNA pull-down, and western blot assays. Our data suggested that miR-204 was downregulated in AML serum samples and cells. MiR-204 overexpression repressed cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and induced cell apoptosis in AML cells. HGF was upregulated in AML samples and cells, and HGF knockdown inhibited the malignancy of AML cells. In addition, HGF was directly targeted by miR-204. HGF overexpression reversed the effects of miR-204 mimic on AML cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion. Besides, miR-204 regulated the c-Met signaling by targeting HGF, thereby regulating the downstream protein levels related to cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion in AML cells.

The aim of our study was to investigate expressions of DNA repair genes as new prognostic biomarkers in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: We utilized The Cancer Genome Atlas AML project (TCGA-LAML cohort, 15 acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and 155 non-APL AML) for the expression data of DNA repair genes. For validation, clinical samples (Ewha study group, 9 APL and 72 non-APL AML patients) were analyzed for the expression of 22 DNA repair genes using a custom RT(2) Profiler PCR Array. RESULTS: APL patients presented significantly lower expression of DNA repair genes than non-APL AML patients in both study groups. Among non-APL AML patients, high expression levels of PARP1, XRCC1, and RAD51 were associated with poor overall survival (OS) probability in both study groups. Furthermore, Cox regression analysis showed that increased expression levels of PARP1, XRCC1, RAD51, BRCA1 and MRE11A could be independent risk factors for OS in the Ewha study group. Among non-APL patients of the Ewha study group, the OS probability of DDR-overexpressed group with at least one gene or more showing Z score greater than 1.5 was poorer than that of DDR non-overexpressed group.

This study aims to explore ferroptosis-related prognostic genes that could further accurately stratify AML patients. METHODS: We investigated the prognosis significance of ferroptosis-related genes in AML by Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. With the methylation data of TCGA samples, we looked for methylation sites associated with prognostic genes and compared the correlation between methylation and mRNA expression. R software and 'edgeR' packages were used to identify the DEGs between the high-and-low-risk groups divided by the FRPGs prognosis model and then run GO enrichment, KEGG pathway, and PPI network. RESULTS: We found a prognostic risk model that included AKR1C2 and SOCS1 predicted outcomes in AML patients. Methylation analysis showed that AKR1C2 and SOCS1 are negatively regulated by their methylation, leading to their low expression in AML patients. Besides, both decreased SOCS1 expression and hypermethylation predicted favorable OS and PFS in AML patients. Finally, this prognostic risk model exhibited a close correlation with several clinical features, especially with age (P=0.005), cytogenetic type (P=0.031), risk_cytogenetic (P=0.001), and risk_molecular (P<0.001).

For patients, 18-59 years who were treated with chemotherapy only without upfront hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT), younger age, female, CBF AML, higher income, and private insurance conferred higher 10-year OS. Among patients, 18-59 years treated with chemotherapy and upfront HCT, younger age and private insurance conferred higher 10-year OS.

In this study, we tried to find out if any of these factors has an impact on response to treatment and outcome. METHODOLOGY: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the files of 79 patients being treated in our center for CML with known BCR-ABL1 breakpoints, and patients' management and response assessment was done based on ELN 2013 guidelines. The analysis was performed based on two main groups, obese vs. normal BMI, and then based on BCR-ABL1 transcripts: e13a2 vs. e14a2. Cumulative incidence of MMR, CCyR, and DMR were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier survival curve method, and comparisons between groups were performed by the Log-rank/Gray test methods. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: In the patient-cohort studied, there was no statistically significant difference in molecular response between patients with CML based on body weight or transcript type although patients in the obesity group achieved higher and faster MMR with no statistical significance.",,"['Abdulla, Mohammad A J', 'Chandra, Prem', 'Akiki, Susanna El', 'Aldapt, Mahmood B', 'Sardar, Sundus', 'Chapra, Ammar', 'Nashwan, Abdulqadir J', 'Sorio, Claudio', 'Tomasello, Luisa', 'Boni, Christian', 'Yassin, Mohamed A']","['Abdulla MAJ', 'Chandra P', 'Akiki SE', 'Aldapt MB', 'Sardar S', 'Chapra A', 'Nashwan AJ', 'Sorio C', 'Tomasello L', 'Boni C', 'Yassin MA']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Hematology Section, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, 36977Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Medical Research Center, Biostatistics Section, 36977Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, 36977Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Hematology Section, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, 36977Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, 36977Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, 36977Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Nursing, Hazm Mebaireek General Hospital, 36977Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Hematology Section, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, 36977Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer Control,Cancer control : journal of the Moffitt Cancer Center,9438457,IM,,2021/11/19 06:00,2021/11/19 06:00,['2021/11/18 05:39'],"['2021/11/18 05:39 [entrez]', '2021/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/10732748211038429 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Control. 2021 Jan-Dec;28:10732748211038429. doi: 10.1177/10732748211038429.,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1144-8076'],,PMC8619745,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1 transcript', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'obesity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These older adults fare extremely poorly with existing treatment strategies and very few studies have undertaken a comprehensive genetic and genomic characterisation to improve prognosis in this age group. We performed cytogenetic, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array and next generation sequencing (NGS) analyses on samples from 210 patients aged >/=60 years from the UKALL14 and UKALL60+ clinical trials. BCR-ABL1 positive disease was present in 26% (55/210) of patients, followed by low hypodiploidy/near triploidy in 13% (28/210). Cytogenetically cryptic rearrangements in CRLF2, ZNF384 and MEF2D were detected in 5%, 1% and 1% of patients respectively. Copy number abnormalities were common and deletions in ALL driver genes were seen in 77% of cases. IKZF1 deletion was present in 51% (40/78) of samples tested and the IKZF1plus profile identified in over a third (28/77) of BCP-ALL cases.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of a patient with spontaneous remission of AML, MLL-AF9 rearrangement, and abnormal liver function in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, and the relevant pieces of literature were summarized. Results: The patient experienced lung infection, fever, and liver dysfunction and was treated with anti-infection and blood transfusion. After complete response (CR) , the patient remained in CR with mild, indirect bilirubin elevation at 35 months of follow-up. Additionally, 56 cases of adult AML (non-acute promyelocytic leukemia) were reported in the literature from 1990 to June 2021. The cases were checked by bone marrow aspiration, and our patients were summarized and analyzed.

Methods: This retrospective analysis included one hundred and ten patients with Binet A CLL, initially diagnosed in the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (Pukou CLL center) from June 2009 to January 2020. Risk stratification was conducted according to IPS-E, CLL-IPI, CLL1-PM, and Barcelona-Brno prognostic models. Results: Among 110 patients with Binet A CLL patients, the median age was 58 (25-84) years. The median follow-up time was 35 (4-189) months, and 57 (51.8%) patients met the indication for treatment due to symptomatic disease progression during follow-up. Log-rank analysis of nine variables was conducted involving age, Rai stage, absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) , lymph node size, lymphocyte doubling time (LDT) , beta(2)-Microglobulin, IGHV status, TP53, and Del (11q) . Additionally, Rai -, ALC>15x10(9)/L, palpable lymph node size >/=1cm, beta(2)-Microglobulin>3.5 mg/L, unmutated IGHV, TP53 mutation or deletion, and 11q deletion were independent risk factors of TTFT. Predictive value of each model was assessed by Harrel C-index and Akaike information criterion (AIC) with CLL1-PM (C-index=0.736, AIC=777) , followed by CLL-IPI (C-index=0.722, AIC=933) , IPS-E (C-index=0.683, AIC=1004) , and Barcelona-Brno prognostic model (C-index=0.663, AIC=986) . Conclusion: All four prognostic models effectively predicted TTFT. IPS-E might be an ideal model to guide clinical surveillance because of its easy accessibility and low expenses in routine clinical practice. Therefore, for patients receiving fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) examination at diagnosis, CLL-IPI or CLL1-PM could be applied to evaluate their prognosis more comprehensively.",,"['Sha, Y Q', 'Shen, H', 'Wu, W', 'Xia, Y', 'Miao, Y', 'Cao, L', 'Wang, L', 'Fan, L', 'Xu, W', 'Li, J Y', 'Zhu, H Y']","['Sha YQ', 'Shen H', 'Wu W', 'Xia Y', 'Miao Y', 'Cao L', 'Wang L', 'Fan L', 'Xu W', 'Li JY', 'Zhu HY']","['Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China Pukou CLL Center, Pukou Division of Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 211800, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China Pukou CLL Center, Pukou Division of Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 211800, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China Pukou CLL Center, Pukou Division of Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 211800, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China Pukou CLL Center, Pukou Division of Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 211800, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China Pukou CLL Center, Pukou Division of Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 211800, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China Pukou CLL Center, Pukou Division of Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 211800, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China Pukou CLL Center, Pukou Division of Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 211800, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China Pukou CLL Center, Pukou Division of Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 211800, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China Pukou CLL Center, Pukou Division of Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 211800, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China Pukou CLL Center, Pukou Division of Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 211800, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China Pukou CLL Center, Pukou Division of Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 211800, China.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,IM,,2021/11/18 06:00,2021/11/20 06:00,['2021/11/17 21:14'],"['2021/11/17 21:14 [entrez]', '2021/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2021.10.007 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2021 Oct 14;42(10):834-839. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2021.10.007.,,"['82170166, 81970146/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81720108002/National Science Foundation of China International Cooperation and', 'Exchange Program', '2018ZX09734007/National Science and Technology Major Project', 'WSN-001/Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province, 2019']",PMC8607014,['NOTNLM'],"['Leukemia, lymphocytic, chronic', 'Prognosis']",20211119,,,"['Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",,,,,,,,,,

The genetic mutation lineage of patients with AML-MRC and the molecular mutation affecting the transplantation prognosis was discussed. Methods: The clinical data of 75 patients with AML-MRC who underwent allo-HACT from 2006 to 2020 were retrospectively analyzed for clinical characteristics, survival, relapse-related indicators, and risk factors affecting transplantation prognosis. Additionally, the clinical characteristics and prognosis of multilineage dysplasia (M) group, history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or myelodysplastic syndrome/myelodysplastic proliferative tumor (MDS/MPN) (H) group, and MDS related cytogenetic abnormalities (C) group were compared. The bone marrow of 43 patients underwent targeting second-generation sequencing (137 genes) . Results: 1 in circleThere were 41 males and 34 females with a median age of 41 (18-56) years, a median follow-up time of 35 (95%CI 30-49) months, and a median survival time (OS) of 78 (95%CI 23-) months. Three-year OS and event-free survival (EFS) were 57.1% (95%CI 45.6%-71.4%) and 52.0% (95%CI 40.8%-66.1%) . Also, the three-year cumulative recurrence rate (CIR) and transplant-related mortality rate (TRM) were 26.8% (95%CI 16.6%-30.0%) and 22.7% (95%CI 13.2%-33.8%) , respectively. Furthermore, multivariate analysis revealed that pre-transplant non-CR1 status was an independent risk factor for OS and EFS. Other independent risk factors for OS included abnormal karyotype of -5/5q- chromosome and the absence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) after transplantation. 2 in circleAmong the 75 patients, 59 (78.7%) were in group H, 20 had received demethylation drugs before turning to AML and nine cases (12.0%) in group C and seven cases (9.3%) in group M. There was no significant difference in the three-year OS and EFS among the three groups[group M vs H vs C: OS: 71.4% (95%CI 44.7%-100.0%) vs 55.0% (95%CI 41.8%-72.5%) vs 55.6% (95%CI 31.0%-99.7%) , P=0.700; EFS: 71.4% (95%CI 44.7%-100.0%) vs 46.5% (95%CI 34.0%-63.8%) vs 55.6% (95%CI 31.0%-99.7%) , P=0.600]. Compared with primary and secondary AML-MRC, there was no statistically significant difference in the three-year OS and EFS[61.9% (95%CI 41.9%-91.4%) vs 55.0% (95%CI 41.8%-72.5%) , P=0.600; 61.9% (95%CI 41.9%-91.4%) vs 46.5% (95%CI 34.0%-63.8%) , P=0.400]. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the time to AML between patients who received demethylation treatment before (20 cases) and those who did not (39 cases) [195 (16-937) d vs 162 (9-3167) d, P=0.804]. Moreover, there were no statistically significant differences in the three-year OS and EFS between the two groups (P=0.400, P=0.700) . 3 in circle NGS test was performed on bone marrow samples of 43 patients (57.3%) , and 73 mutation types were found. Additionally, U2AF1 had the highest mutation incidence (11 cases, 25.6%) , and more than 10% were found: RUNX1 (ten cases, 23.3%) , NRAS (ten cases, 23.3%) , ASXL1 (six cases, 14.0%) , PTPN11 (five cases, 11.6%) , TET2 (five cases, 11.6%) . Univariate analysis showed U2AF1[P=0.875, HR=1.110 (95%CI 0.295-4.195) ], RUNX1[P=0.685, HR=0.728 (95%CI 0.157-3.375) ], NRAS[P=0.919, HR=0.923 (95%CI 0.196-4.334) ] mutation did not affect OS. Conclusion: Chromosome abnormality of -5/5q-, cGVHD, and non-CR1 status before transplantation were independent risk factors for OS in patients with allo-HSCT and AML-MRC. Additionally, the MHC subgroup classification was not a factor affecting the prognosis of transplantation.

SUMMARY ANSWER: We observed similar fertility outcomes in both male and female childhood ALL survivors compared with the general population, with the exception of a higher proportion of miscarriages among partners of male survivors. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Survival after childhood ALL is currently >90% and fertility impairments are among the main concerns of the long-term survivors. Few studies have focused on the fertility issues within this selected population and the existing data are difficult to interpret due to the different treatment regimens received by the patients, the small sample sizes and the unavailability of control data in many studies. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Childhood ALL patients enrolled in European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) studies between 1971 and 1998 in France and Belgium, <18 years old at diagnosis and alive and >/=18 years at follow-up were eligible. Among 1418 eligible survivors, 507 (35.8%) participated (277 females, 230 males). Controls from the general population matched one to one by age, province, level of urbanization and sex could be identified for 503 survivors. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Survivors and controls were invited to fill out a questionnaire including information about their menstrual cycles (for females), intention to have children, having children, use of medical help to become pregnant and occurrence of negative pregnancy outcomes (birth defect, miscarriage, medical abortion or stillbirth). The results were analysed separately for females and males. The association between age at diagnosis and fertility outcomes, adjusted by age at follow-up, study and country were investigated using logistic regression. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The median time since diagnosis was 20.1 years and the median age at follow-up was 25 years. There were 144 survivors (97 females, 47 males) who wanted to have children. Among these, craniospinal radiotheraphy (CRT) and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) were administered to 18% and 4%, respectively. Of these who tried to have children, 75% of females and 69% of males succeeded, compared with 72% and 61% of the controls, respectively. These differences were not statistically significant (P = 0.73 for females and P = 0.50 for males). Overall, fertility outcomes were comparable between survivors and controls, except that a higher proportion of miscarriages occurred in partners of male survivors (28.1% versus 5.9%, P = 0.021). Among female survivors, an older age at diagnosis (10-17 years) was associated with a greater risk of pregnancy problems (adjusted OR 5.61, P = 0.046). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The interpretation of the incidence of miscarriage among the partners of male survivors is limited by the lack of data regarding the males' partners and by a possibly higher tendency to recall and disclose fertility issues among male survivors compared with male controls. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Fertility outcomes were similar in childhood ALL survivors and controls, and the low proportion of patients treated with CRT or HSCT might explain this. Further studies should confirm the higher proportion of miscarriages in partners of male survivors.

We hypothesized that the oral Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax could sensitize RS to chemoimmunotherapy and improve outcomes. We conducted a single-arm, investigator-sponsored, phase 2 trial of venetoclax plus dose-adjusted rituximab, etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin (VR-EPOCH) to determine the rate of complete response (CR). Patients received R-EPOCH for 1 cycle, then after count recovery, accelerated daily venetoclax ramp-up to 400 mg, then VR-EPOCH for up to 5 more 21-day cycles. Responders received venetoclax maintenance or cellular therapy off-study. Twenty-six patients were treated, and 13 of 26 (50%) achieved CR, with 11 achieving undetectable bone marrow minimal residual disease for CLL. Three additional patients achieved partial response (overall response rate 62%). Median progression-free survival was 10.1 months, and median overall survival was 19.6 months. Hematologic toxicity included grade >/=3 neutropenia (65%) and thrombocytopenia (50%), with febrile neutropenia in 38%. No patients experienced tumor lysis syndrome with daily venetoclax ramp-up.

However, treatment failure after initial response approaches 50%. In allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, optimal fludarabine exposure improves immune reconstitution, resulting in lower nonrelapse mortality and increased survival. We hypothesized that optimal fludarabine exposure in lymphodepleting chemotherapy prior to CAR T-cell therapy would improve outcomes. In a retrospective analysis of relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients undergoing CAR T-cell (tisagenlecleucel) infusion after cyclophosphamide/fludarabine lymphodepleting chemotherapy, we estimated the fludarabine exposure as area-under-the-curve (AUC;mg*hr/L) using a validated population-pharmacokinetic model. Fludarabine exposure was related to overall survival (OS), cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), and a composite endpoint (loss of B-cell aplasia (BCA) or relapse). Eligible patients (n=152) had a median age of 12.5 years (range <1-26), response rate of 86% (131/152), 12-month OS of 75.1% (95%-CI: 67.6-82.6%), and 12-month CIR of 36.4% (95%-CI: 27.5-45.2%). Optimal fludarabine-exposure was determined as an AUC>/=13.8mg*hr/L. In multivariable analyses patients with an AUC<13.8mg*hr/L had a 2.5-fold higher CIR (HR=2.45 [1.34-4.48]; P=0.005) and a twofold higher risk of relapse or loss of BCA (HR=1.96 [1.19-3.23]; P=0.01) compared to those with optimal fludarabine exposure. High preinfusion disease burden was also associated with an increased risk of relapse (HR=2.66 [1.45-4.87]; P=0.001) and death (HR=4.77 [2.10-10.9]; p<0.001).

The clinical features of DOS are variable but include overgrowth (tall stature and/or obesity) and intellectual disability. DNMT3A is essential for de novo DNA methylation and plays an important role in hematopoiesis. Somatic mutations in DNMT3A are among the most common initiating mutations in normal karyotype acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and in elderly people with clonal hematopoiesis. The natural history of DOS has not been fully explored since the first description of this rare condition in 2014. Because of the association of somatic DNMT3A mutations and leukemia development, we assessed information from the ~200 known DOS patients world-wide and were able to document eight with hematologic malignancies. Based on this prevalence, we suggest DOS is a cancer predisposition syndrome, especially for hematologic malignancies. Using recommendations from an expert panel, we suggest DOS patients should be prospectively monitored for hematologic malignancies, which may allow for early intervention and permit its natural history to be better defined.",['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society of Hematology.'],"['Ferris, Margaret A', 'Smith, Amanda M', 'Heath, Sharon E', 'Duncavage, Eric J', 'Oberley, Matthew J', 'Freyer, David', 'Wynn, Robert', 'Douzgou, Sofia', 'Maris, John M', 'Reilly, Anne F', 'Wu, Melinda', 'Choo, Florence', 'Fiets, Roel B', 'Koene, Saskia', 'Spencer, David H', 'Miller, Chrstopher A', 'Shinawi, Marwan', 'Ley, Timothy J']","['Ferris MA', 'Smith AM', 'Heath SE', 'Duncavage EJ', 'Oberley MJ', 'Freyer D', 'Wynn R', 'Douzgou S', 'Maris JM', 'Reilly AF', 'Wu M', 'Choo F', 'Fiets RB', 'Koene S', 'Spencer DH', 'Miller CA', 'Shinawi M', 'Ley TJ']","['Washington University in St. Louis, Saint Louis, Missouri, United States.', 'Washington University in St Louis, St Louis, Missouri, United States.', 'Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri, United States.', 'Washington University in St Louis, St Louis, Missouri, United States.', 'Caris Life Sciences, Phoenix, California, United States.', 'Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, United States.', ""Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, Manchester, United Kingdom."", ""Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine, St Mary's Hospital, Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester Academic Health Sciences Centre and Division of Evolution, Infection and Genomics, School of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, United Kingdom."", ""University of PA School of Medicine/The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States."", ""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States."", 'Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon, United States.', 'Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon, United States.', 'Amphia Hospital, Breda, Netherlands.', 'Leiden University Medical Center, Leidin, Netherlands.', 'Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States.', 'Washington University in St Louis, Saint Louis, Missouri, United States.', 'Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States.', 'Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri, United States.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211117,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,2021/11/18 06:00,2021/11/18 06:00,['2021/11/17 17:27'],"['2021/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/18 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/17 17:27 [entrez]', '2021/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(21)01883-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2021014052 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Blood. 2021 Nov 17. pii: S0006-4971(21)01883-8. doi: 10.1182/blood.2021014052.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-8716-6745', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6419-2513', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5280-990X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8890-7544', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8088-7929', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0523-7600', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7904-8271', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9876-744X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5314-3043', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4266-6700', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1329-4100', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9913-0520']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phosphatases are widely suppressed in cancers but have not been traditionally associated with differentiation. Herein, we identified that the silencing of Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) directly contributes to differentiation block in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Gene expression and mass cytometric profiling reveal that PP2A activation modulates cell cycle and transcriptional regulators that program terminal myeloid differentiation. Using a novel pharmacological agent OSU-2S in parallel with genetic approaches, we discovered that PP2A enforces c-Myc and p21 dependent terminal differentiation, proliferation arrest and apoptosis in AML. Finally, we demonstrate that PP2A activation decreases leukemia initiating stem cells, increases leukemic blast maturation, and improves overall survival in murine Tet2-/-Flt3ITD/WT and human AML models in-vivo.

Here, we comprehensively evaluated the clinical utility of various cardiovascular parameters, including ankle-brachial blood pressure index (ABI), cardiac ankle vascular index (CAVI), and carotid ultrasonography and electrocardiogram measurements, for monitoring and predicting CAEs in 74 patients with CML receiving TKIs. Based on concordance statistics, the predictive value of established risk factor models was significantly improved by addition of both ABI and CAVI, as follows: model 1 (hypertension, smoking history, and dyslipidemia), 0.680 versus 0.817 (p = 0.041); model 2 (hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus), 0.685 vs. 0.830 (p = 0.047); and model 3 (age, hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes mellitus) 0.737 versus 0.818 (p = 0.044).

There are few reports of its prevalence in Latin America. AIM: This study evaluated the frequency and clinical and biological characteristics of Ph-like ALL in a pediatric cancer center in Colombia. METHODS: The Ph-like genetic profile was analyzed by a low-density array (LDA). Samples from patients with Ph-like ALL were analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization for cytokine receptor like factor 2 (CRLF2) and ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase (ABL1) rearrangements. Copy number variations were assessed by multiplex ligation probe amplification. RESULTS: Data from 121 patients were analyzed. Fifteen patients (12.4%) had Ph-like ALL, and these patients had significantly higher leukocyte counts at diagnosis and higher levels of minimal residual disease on days 15 and 33 of induction than patients without the Ph-like subtype. There were no significant differences in sex, age, or response to prednisone at day 8 between the two groups. CRLF2 rearrangements were identified in eight patients, and ABL1 rearrangements were identified in two patients. Other genetic alterations alone or in combination were identified in 77% of patients, including deletions in cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2 A/B (46.2%), IKAROS family zinc finger 1 (38.3%), and paired box 5 (30.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Ph-like ALL had a 12.4% prevalence in our cohort of patients with pediatric ALL.

This study investigated mRNA and membrane protein expression of two B7-H3 isoforms in AML cell lines and de novo patients by using RT-PCR and flow cytometry, and analyzed the B7-H3 promoter methylation state by utilizing RQ-MSP. 4Ig was the dominant isoform. 2Ig mRNA expression rate and abundance were elevated in AML in comparison with controls (P = 0.000 and 0.000), while no significant difference in 4Ig (P = 0.802, P = 0.398). Membrane protein levels of B7-H3 isoforms in AML was higher than controls, detected by total B7-H3 expression rate (P = 0.002), total B7-H3 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) ratio of blast cells and lymphocytes (MFI ratio) (P = 0.000), and 4Ig B7-H3 MFI ratio (P = 0.005). Compared with 2Ig(low) group, 2Ig(high) patients had older age, lower NPM1 mutation, higher FLT3-ITD mutation, and declining complete remission (CR) rates (P = 0.026, 0.012, 0.047, and 0.028). In B7-H3(high) group, there was a trend toward older age, M4 and M5, worse karyotype, and lower CR rates, although with no marked difference (P > 0.05). The overall survival (OS) of 2Ig(high) and B7-H3(high) groups were shorter than that of 2Ig(low) and B7-H3(low) groups in the whole and non-M3 AML cohorts (P = 0.006 and 0.046; P = 0.003 and 0.032). Besides, an unmethylated B7-H3 promoter was identified. In conclusion, 2Ig mRNA and total B7-H3 membrane protein tended to have potential diagnostic value for AML.

Leukaemic evolution and transformation from myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) may be associated with increased numbers of mutations in the genes associated with myeloid neoplasm and the prognosis in such patients is invariably dismal. Targeting of intracellular enzymes associated with integral cellular function has advanced understanding and promises improvements in treatments. CASE: We report impressive prolonged response to therapy in a case of secondary AML, arising from essential thrombocythaemia (ET). The trial agent, the oral lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 (LSD1) inhibitor Bomedemstat (IMG-7289) was well tolerated. In addition to suppressing the malignant clone, these blasts showed differentiation to monocytes morphologically as well as by surface markers seen on flow cytometry. Bomedemstat has efficacy in the treatment of myelofibrosis and may have a special role in treatment of specific AML subtypes, including secondary leukaemias arising from MPN as seen. CONCLUSION: We report a case of an older adult with secondary AML transformed from ET, with a remarkable response to LSD1 inhibition with Bomedemstat, with prolonged reduction in blasts demonstrating differentiation to monocytes.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.

BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia need long-term, potentially lifelong therapy to control the disease, which affects their quality of life. There is a need for exploring potentially changeable factors to develop interventions. Little is known about the effects of illness uncertainty and self-perceived burden on quality of life in this population. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. METHODS: A convenience sample of 248 patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia was recruited from four university hospitals from February to August 2020. Participants were assessed with the Mishel Uncertainty in Illness Scale, Self-Perceived Burden Scale, and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire. The STROBE checklist was used to report the results. RESULTS: Illness uncertainty and self-perceived burden were negatively associated with quality of life in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia. Self-perceived burden partially mediated the relationship between illness uncertainty and quality of life. The indirect effect was -0.101, accounting for 22.9% of the total effect. CONCLUSION: The findings revealed the relationship between illness uncertainty, self-perceived burden and quality of life in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia. Self-perceived burden exerted a mediating role between illness uncertainty and quality of life in this population.

However, not all blood cancer patients respond favorably, serious side effects have been reported, and the treatment of solid tumors has been a challenge. An imaging tool for visualizing the variety of CAR-T cell products in use and being explored could provide important patient-specific data on CAR-T cell location to inform on potential success or failure of treatment as well as off-target toxicities. Fluorine-19 ((19)F) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows for the noninvasive detection of (19)F perfluorocarbon (PFC) labeled cells. Our objective was to visualize PFC-labeled (PFC +) CAR-T cells in a mouse model of leukemia using clinical field strength (3 Tesla) (19)F MRI and compare the cytotoxicity of PFC + versus unlabeled CAR-T cells. PROCEDURES: NSG mice (n = 17) received subcutaneous injections of CD19 + human B cell leukemia cells (NALM6) expressing firefly luciferase in their left hind flank (1 x 10(6)). Twenty-one days later, each mouse received an intratumoral injection of 10 x 10(6) PFC + CD19-targeted CAR-T cells (n = 6), unlabeled CD19-targeted CAR-T cells (n = 3), PFC + untransduced T cells (n = 5), or an equivalent volume of saline (n = 3). (19)F MRI was performed on mice treated with PFC + CAR-T cells days 1, 3, and 7 post-treatment. Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) was performed on all mice days - 1, 5, 10, and 14 post-treatment to monitor tumor response. RESULTS: PFC + CAR-T cells were successfully detected in tumors using (19)F MRI on days 1, 3, and 7 post-injection. In vivo BLI data revealed that mice treated with PFC + or PFC - CAR-T cells had significantly lower tumor burden by day 14 compared to untreated mice and mice treated with PFC + untransduced T cells (p < 0.05). Importantly, mice treated with PFC + CAR-T cells showed equivalent cytotoxicity compared to mice receiving PFC - CAR-T cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies demonstrate that clinical field strength (19)F MRI can be used to visualize PFC + CAR-T cells for up to 7 days post-intratumoral injection. Importantly, PFC labeling did not significantly affect in vivo CAR-T cell cytotoxicity. These imaging tools may have broad applications for tracking emerging CAR-T cell therapies in preclinical models and may eventually be useful for the detection of CAR-T cells in patients where localized injection of CAR-T cells is being pursued.",['(c) 2021.

Decitabine inhibits DNA methyltransferases, causing DNA hypomethylation, and limiting the transcription of tumor suppressor genes, leading to gene silencing. Decitabine is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed de novo or secondary AML who are not eligible for standard induction chemotherapy. The initial authorization in 2012 was based on the results of the open-label, randomized, multicenter phase 3 DACO-016 trial, and supported by data from the supportive phase 2 open-label DACO-017 trial. Compared with standard care, decitabine significantly improved overall survival, event-free survival, progression-free survival, and response rate. Decitabine was generally well tolerated, offering a valuable treatment option in patients with AML irrespective of age, especially for patients achieving a complete response. Several observational ""real-life"" studies confirmed these results. In contrast to standard chemotherapy, the presence of adverse-risk karyotypes or TP53 mutations does not negatively impact sensitivity to hypomethylating therapy albeit with lower durability. Data suggest a potential positive effect of decitabine in patients with monosomal karyotype-positive AML. For the time being, decitabine is an appropriate option as monotherapy for patients with AML who are unfit to receive more intensive combination therapies, but emerging data suggest that decitabine-based doublet or triplet combinations may be future treatment options for patients with AML.",['(c) 2021.

The purpose of this paper is to summarize the self-management strategies used by young adults (18-39 years old) who have received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant for leukemia or lymphoma. A narrative review conducted in the CINAHL, MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases returned 11 papers. An analysis of these data shows that young adults use self-management strategies, including managing their emotions, turning to spiritual beliefs, seeking support from others and changing their behaviours.

The first patient (Pt1) was treated at 4.7 years old, and the second patient (Pt2), who had previously received T cell gene therapy (TCGT), was treated at 13 years old. More than 10 years after SCGT, T cells showed a higher vector copy number (VCN) than other lineages. Moreover, the VCN increased with differentiation toward memory T and B cells. The distribution of vector-marked cells reflected variable levels of ADA requirements in hematopoietic subpopulations. Although neither patient developed leukemia, clonal expansion of SCGT-derived clones was observed in both patients. The use of retroviral vectors yielded clonal dominance of vector-marked clones, irrespective of the lack of leukemic changes. Vector integration sites common to all hematopoietic lineages suggested the engraftment of gene-marked progenitors in Pt1, who showed severe osteoblast (OB) insufficiency compared to Pt2, which might cause a reduction in the stem/progenitor cells in the bone marrow (BM). The impaired BM microenvironment due to metabolic abnormalities may create space for the engraftment of vector-marked cells in ADA-SCID, despite the lack of preconditioning.",['(c) 2021 The Authors.'],"['Uchiyama, Toru', 'Takahashi, Sirirat', 'Nakabayashi, Kazuhiko', 'Okamura, Kohji', 'Edasawa, Kaori', 'Yamada, Masafumi', 'Watanabe, Nobuyuki', 'Mochizuki, Emi', 'Yasuda, Toru', 'Miura, Akane', 'Kato, Motohiro', 'Tomizawa, Daisuke', 'Otsu, Makoto', 'Ariga, Tadashi', 'Onodera, Masafumi']","['Uchiyama T', 'Takahashi S', 'Nakabayashi K', 'Okamura K', 'Edasawa K', 'Yamada M', 'Watanabe N', 'Mochizuki E', 'Yasuda T', 'Miura A', 'Kato M', 'Tomizawa D', 'Otsu M', 'Ariga T', 'Onodera M']","['Department of Human Genetics, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Human Genetics, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Maternal-Fetal Biology, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of System Biomedicine, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Human Genetics, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Human Genetics, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Human Genetics, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Human Genetics, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Human Genetics, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', ""Children's Cancer Center, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Department of Transfusion and Cell Transplantation, Kitasato University School of Medicine, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Human Genetics, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211016,United States,Mol Ther Methods Clin Dev,Molecular therapy.

Previous reports of such cases have focused mainly on clinical diagnosis and characteristics, so the mechanism remains unclear, and therapy options have been poorly explored. CASE SUMMARY: Here, we report two cases of synchronous AML and CLL. Flow cytometry revealed two distinct abnormal cell populations (myeloblasts and lymphoid cells) according to scatter characteristics. CD5-positive B cell lymphoma with myeloid leukemia invasion was observed on lymph node biopsy. Chemotherapy regimens indicated for both AML and CLL were used in our patients, and our patients achieved complete response after chemotherapy. Next-generation sequencing of 88 genes was performed. CONCLUSION: We conclude that early mutation and dysregulation at the hematopoietic stem cell stage and the accumulation of multiple rearrangements may cause the concurrence of CLL and AML. The treatment of infection and combination therapy aimed at the CLL component are significant in the management of patients with concurrent CLL and AML.","['(c)The Author(s) 2021.

A retrospective chart review of all cases over 10 years at the Moffitt Cancer Center showed a total of three patients with E. meningosepticum infection. The first patient (history of multiple myeloma) underwent endoscopy complicated by aspiration pneumonia and positive blood culture for E. meningosepticum infection. The second patient (current acute myelogenous leukemia) had neutropenic fever in the setting of a recent chest port infection. Blood culture from the chest port showed E. meningosepticum. The third patient (history of esophageal adenocarcinoma and acute myelogenous leukemia) had a history of recent pneumonia and cellulitis who presented with recurrent neutropenic fever. Blood culture was positive for E. meningosepticum. E. meningosepticum bacteremia has a high 28-day mortality rate (41%).

ECD patients harbor recurrent mutations of genes associated with the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway, particularly, the BRAF(V600E) mutation. Following our previous finding that miR-15a-5p is the most prominently downregulated microRNA in ECD patients compared to healthy individuals, we elucidated its role in ECD pathogenesis. Bioinformatics analysis followed by a luciferase assay showed that chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) is a target gene regulated by miRNA-15a-5p. This was confirmed in 24/34 ECD patients that had low expression of miR-15a-5p concurrent with upregulated CXCL10. Overexpression of miR-15a-5p in cell lines harboring BRAF or RAS mutations (Ba/F3, KG-1a and OCI-AML3) resulted in CXCL10 downregulation, followed by LIN28a and p-ERK signaling downregulation and let-7 family upregulation. Overexpression of miR-15a-5p inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis by decreasing Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl levels. Analysis of sequential samples from 7 ECD patients treated with MAPK inhibitors (vemurafenib/cobimetinib) for 4 months showed miR-15a-5p upregulation and CXCL10 downregulation. Our findings suggest that miR-15a-5p is a tumor suppressor in ECD through the CXCL10-ERK-LIN28a-let7 axis, highlighting another layer of post-transcriptional regulation in this disease. Upregulation of miR-15a-5p in ECD patients may have a potential therapeutic role.",['(c) 2021.

Growing evidence has shown that TKIs also enhance immunity. Since gamma-delta T (gammadeltaT) cells possess the potent anticancer capability, here we investigated the potential involvement of gammadeltaT cells in TKI treatments for CML. We characterized gammadeltaT cells isolated from chronic-phase CML patients before and during TKI treatments. gammadeltaT expression increased significantly in CML patients who achieved major molecular response (MMR) and deep molecular response (DMR). Their Vdelta2 subset of gammadeltaT also expanded, and increased expression of activating molecules, namely IFN-gamma, perforin, and CD107a, as well as gammadeltaT cytotoxicity. Mechanistically, TKIs augmented the efflux of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) from CML cells, which stimulated IFN-gamma production and gammadeltaT expansion. Notably, the size of the IFN-gamma(+) naive gammadeltaT population in TKI-treated CML patients was strongly correlated with their rates to reach DMR and with the duration on DMR. Statistical analysis suggests that a cutoff of 7.5% IFN-gamma(+) naive subpopulation of gammadeltaT in CML patients could serve as a determinant for MR(4.0) sustainability. Our results highlight gammadeltaT cells as a positive regulator for TKI responses in CML patients.",['(c) 2021.

Here, we describe the outcome and prognostic factors for 167 infants with KMT2A-germline ALL enrolled in the Interfant-06 study. METHODS: Univariate analysis on prognostic factors (age, white blood cell count at diagnosis, prednisolone response and CD10 expression) was performed on KMT2A-germline infants in complete remission at the end of induction (EOI; n = 163). Bone marrow minimal residual disease (MRD) was measured in 73 patients by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction at various time points (EOI, n = 68; end of consolidation, n = 56; and before OCTADAD, n = 57). MRD results were classified as negative, intermediate (<5 *10(-4)), and high (>/=5 *10(-4)). RESULTS: The 6-year event-free and overall survival was 73.9% (standard error [SE] = 3.6) and 87.2% (SE = 2.7). Relapses occurred early, within 36 months from diagnosis in 28 of 31 (90%) infants. Treatment-related mortality was 3.6%. Age <6 months was a favourable prognostic factor with a 6-year disease-free survival (DFS) of 91% (SE = 9.0) compared with 71.7% (SE = 4.2) in infants >6 months of age (P = 0.04). Patients with high EOI MRD >/=5 x 10(-4) had a worse outcome (6-year DFS 61.4% [SE = 12.4], n = 16), compared with patients with undetectable EOI MRD (6-year DFS 87.9% [SE = 6.6], n = 28) or intermediate EOI MRD <5 x 10(-4) (6-year DFS 76.4% [SE = 11.3], n = 24; P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: We conclude that young age at diagnosis and low EOI MRD seem favourable prognostic factors in infants with KMT2A-germline ALL and should be considered for risk stratification in future clinical trials.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors.

Studying the role and mechanism through which miRNAs regulate various cancer processes is very critical in cancer treatment, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes the diverse roles of miRNAs in ALL and provides new perspectives in miRNA-based therapeutic strategies. EXPERT OPINION: MiRNAs belong to a kind of endogenous non-coding small RNA with the length of 19 ~ 25 nucleotides. They inhibit the expression of target genes and participate in almost all essential physiological processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and inflammatory responses. Many miRNAs are abnormally expressed in tumor cells, suggesting that they might be related to the occurrence and development of tumor. ALL is a common hematological malignancy in children.

Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent, non-apoptotic form of regulated cell death which plays an important role in various human cancers. Nevertheless, the prognostic significance and functions of ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) in AML have not received sufficient attention. The aim of this article was to evaluate the association between FRGs levels and AML prognosis using publicly available RNA-sequencing datasets. The univariate Cox regression analysis identified 20 FRGs that correlate with patient overall survival. The LASSO Cox regression model was used to construct a prognostic 12-gene risk model using a TCGA cohort, and internal and external validation proved the signature efficient. The 12-FRGs signature was then used to assign patients into high- and low-risk groups, with the former exhibiting markedly reduced overall survival, compared to the low-risk group. ROC curve analysis verified the predictive ability of the risk model. Functional analysis showed that immune status and drug sensitivity differed between the 2 risk groups. In summary, FRGs is a promising candidate biomarker and therapeutic target for AML.",,"['Huang, Xianbo', 'Zhou, De', 'Ye, Xiujin', 'Jin, Jie']","['Huang X', 'Zhou', 'Ye X', 'Jin J']","['Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211116,Bosnia and Herzegovina,Bosn J Basic Med Sci,Bosnian journal of basic medical sciences,101200947,IM,,2021/11/17 06:00,2021/11/17 06:00,['2021/11/16 17:11'],"['2021/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/17 06:00 [medline]', '2021/11/16 17:11 [entrez]']",['10.17305/bjbms.2021.6274 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Bosn J Basic Med Sci. 2021 Nov 16. doi: 10.17305/bjbms.2021.6274.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Few cases of PNGD have been associated with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), a malignant hematopoietic disorder with features in between those of a myeloproliferative neoplasm and myelodysplastic syndrome. We present a patient with a generalized papular skin reaction involving the neck, chest, and shoulders with histomorphological features on the spectrum of PNGD. Subsequent laboratory workup demonstrated a persistent mild monocytosis, raising concern for CMML. The diagnosis was ultimately confirmed with a bone marrow biopsy and associated mutational analysis through next-generation sequencing which identified deleterious variants in SRSF2, IDH2, and ASXL1. The findings in this case strengthen the previously made association between PNGD and SRSF2-mutated CMML and may help better define a unique recognizable clinical-histopathological-molecular subtype for dermatopathologists.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Herein, we develop a mass cytometry-based strategy for unbiased mining of cell subsets that potentially contribute to cancer recurrence through panoramic examination of the immunophenotypic features and multidrug resistance characteristics. The incorporation of metal tags enables multiplexed information of single cells to be interrogated based on metal fingerprint. Using acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) as a showcase, we show overexpressed multidrug resistance biomarkers, i. e., BCRP, Bcl-2, MRP1, and P-gp in B-ALL cells compared with healthy control, and a positive correlation among different multidrug resistance biomarkers. Different cell subsets with multidrug resistance are well-defined, featured with CD34(+) CD38(+) CD10(-) and CD34(+) CD38(+/int) CD10(+) . Importantly, we uncovered that CD34 expression level is positively correlated to multidrug resistance, indicative of a higher potential of immature cells to induce B-ALL relapse. In addition, the cell subsets positively expressing CD73 and CD304 (CD34(+) CD10(+) CD304(+) ; CD34(+) CD38(+/int) CD10(+) CD73(+) ) also overexpress multidrug resistance biomarkers, suggesting that they may serve as additional new biomarkers for B-ALL stratification and prognosis. Our data provide the first evidence that highly expressed multidrug resistance biomarkers in certain cell subpopulations with specific immunophenotypes may potentially induce B-ALL recurrence.

In the present study, we focused on EMILIN-1 (Elastin-MIcrofibriL-INterfacer-1), an alternative VLA-4 ligand whose role has been so far reported only in non-hematological settings, by investigating: i) the distribution of EMILIN-1 in CLL-involved tissues; ii) the capability of EMILIN-1 to operate, via its globular C1q (gC1q) domain, as additional adhesion ligand in CLL; iii) the functional meaning of EMILIN-1 gC1q/VLA-4 interactions in CLL. EMILIN-1 is widely present in the CLL-involved areas of bone marrow biopsies (BMBs) without difference between CD49d negative and positive cases, displaying at least three different expression patterns: ""fibrillar"", ""dot-like"" and ""mixed"". The lack in CLL-BMB of neutrophil elastase, whose proteolytic activity degrades EMILIN-1 and impairs EMILIN-1 function, suggests full functional EMILIN-1 in CLL independently of its expression pattern. Functionally, EMILIN-1 gC1q domain promotes adhesion of CLL cells through specific interaction with VLA-4, and releases pro-survival signals for CLL cells, as demonstrated by enhanced ERK and AKT phosphorylation and impairment of in-vitro-induced apoptosis.

Site-specific mutations were introduced in defined regions of DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1 in CD34(+) progenitor cells that were subsequently analyzed in short-term as well as long-term in vitro culture assays to assess self-renewal and differentiation capacities. Colony-forming unit (CFU) assays revealed enhanced self-renewal of TET2 mutated (TET2(mut)) cells, whereas ASXL1(mut) as well as DNMT3A(mut) cells did not reveal significant changes in short-term culture. Strikingly, enhanced colony formation could be detected in long-term culture experiments in all mutants, indicating increased self-renewal capacities. While we could also demonstrate preferential clonal expansion of distinct cell clones for all mutants, the clonal composition after long-term culture revealed a mutation-specific impact on HSPCs. Thus, by using primary umbilical cord blood cells, we were able to investigate epigenetic driver mutations without confounding factors like age or a complex mutational landscape, and our findings provide evidence for a direct impact of clonal hematopoiesis-associated mutations on self-renewal and clonal composition of human stem and progenitor cells.",['(c) 2021.

We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of SALL4 and BMI-1 in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: This prospective cohort study was carried out on 60 children with ALL as the patient group and 60 age- and sex-matched children as the control group. We evaluated the expression pattern of both SALL4 and BMI-1 genes in the peripheral blood using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in children with ALL at initial diagnosis before chemotherapy. We followed up with the patient group for 2 years for relapse or death. RESULTS: Both SALL4 and BMI-1 were overexpressed in ALL children compared to the control group. Moreover, the expression of SALL4 and BMI-1 in patients with relapse was significantly higher than those with complete remission. The best cut-off of SALL4 and BMI-1 to predict relapse were >2.21 and 0.55 yielding sensitivity of 92.3% and 84.6%, respectively. Patients with overexpression of SALL4 and BMI-1 had significantly shorter overall and disease-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: SALL4 and BMI-1 could be useful prognostic markers in children with ALL to predict relapse.","['(c) 2021.

Although NUSAP1 acts as an oncogene involved in the progression of several cancers, the exact role of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remains elusive. Herein, we first discovered obvious overexpression of NUSAP1 in CLL associated with poor prognosis. Next, the NUSAP1 level was modulated by transfecting CLL cells with lentivirus. Silencing NUSAP1 inhibited the cell proliferation, promoted cell apoptosis and G0/G1 phase arrest. Mechanistically, high expression of NUSAP1 strengthened DNA damage repairing with RAD51 engagement. Our results also indicated that NUSAP1 knockdown suppressed the growth CLL cells in vivo. We further confirmed that NUSAP1 reduction enhanced the sensitivity of CLL cells to fludarabine or ibrutinib. Overall, our research investigates the mechanism by which NUSAP1 enhances chemoresistance via DNA damage repair (DDR) signaling by stabilizing RAD51 in CLL cells. Hence, NUSAP1 may be expected to be a perspective target for the treatment of CLL with chemotherapy resistance.",['(c) 2021.

This study aimed to assess the radiation dose delivered to patients from common diagnostic nuclear medicine examinations and estimate the risk of exposure-induced death (REID). In addition, the frequency of nuclear medicine procedures were evaluated from 2015-2018. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data were collected from adult patients who had undergone cardiac, skeletal, renal, lacrimal, and thyroid imaging. For each patient, the effective dose was calculated using dose conversion factors, and REID was estimated using PCXMC. The frequency of examinations between 2015 and 2018 was obtained from the hospital information system (HIS). RESULTS: The highest estimated effective dose was attributed to the scans of myocardial stress (8.09 +/- 1.28 mSv), myocardial rest (5.59 +/- 1.27 mSv), and thyroid imaging (3.93 +/- 0.55 mSv). In addition, cardiac stress examination had the highest REID values for solid cancers (212.5 +/- 67.5) and bone scans had the highest REID values for leukemia (11.5 +/- 2.5). A large increase in the number of myocardial perfusion scans was a significant contributor to an increase in collective effective dose from 23.37 man-Sv in 2015 to 49.47 man-Sv in 2018, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 26%. CONCLUSION: Although the annual frequency and per capita effective dose of nuclear medicine procedures in Yazd Province increased continuously, they were comparably lower than those reported for other countries. Despite this, the cancer risks of nuclear medicine scans at the individual level are negligible (around 0.01% excess fatal cancer risk), yet the increasing tendency for these examinations could be of concern.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

This is not the case for the EQ-5D youth versions. The study aim was to compare the measurement properties and responsiveness of EQ-5D-Y-3L and EQ-5D-Y-5L in paediatric patients. METHODS: A sample of patients 8-16 years old with different diseases and a wide range of disease severity was asked to complete EQ-5D-Y-3L, EQ-5D-Y-5L, PedsQL Generic Core Scale, and selected, appropriate disease-specific instruments, three times. EQ-5D-Y-3L and EQ-5D-Y-5L were compared in terms of: feasibility, (re-)distribution properties, discriminatory power, convergent validity, test-retest reliability, and responsiveness. RESULTS: 286 participating patients suffered from one of the following diseases: major beta-thalassemia, haemophilia, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, acute illness. Missing responses were comparable between versions of the EQ-5D-Y, suggesting comparable feasibility. The number of patients in the best health state (level profile 11111) was equal in both EQ-5D-Y versions. The projection of EQ-5D-Y-3L scores onto EQ-5D-Y-5L for all dimensions showed that the two additional levels in EQ-5D-Y-5L slightly improved the accuracy of patients in reporting their problems, especially if severe. Convergent validity with PedsQL and disease-specific measures showed that the two EQ-5D-Y versions performed about equally. Test-retest reliability (EQ-5D-Y-3L 0.78 vs EQ-5D-Y-5L 0.84), and sensitivity for detecting health changes, were both better in EQ-5D-Y-5L. CONCLUSIONS: Extending the number of levels did not give clear superiority to EQ-5D-Y-5L over EQ-5D-Y-3L based on the criteria assessed in this study. However, increasing the number of levels benefitted EQ-5D-Y performance in the measurement of moderate to severe problems and especially in longitudinal study designs.",['(c) 2021.

However, deregulation of apoptosis has been proposed as a common hallmark of TH and TC. BH3 profiling can be utilized to study the readiness of living cancer cells to undergo apoptosis and their dependency on pro-survival BCL-2 family proteins. METHODS: We screened a cohort of 62 TH and TC patient samples for expression of BCL-2 family proteins and used the TC cell line 1889c and native TH for dynamic BH3 profiling and treatment with BH3 mimetics. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical overexpression of MCL-1 and BCL-xL was a strong prognostic marker of TH and TC, and BH3 profiling indicated a strong dependency on MCL-1 and BCL-xL in TH. Single inhibition of MCL-1 resulted in increased binding of BIM to BCL-xL as an escape mechanism that the combined inhibition of both factors could overcome. Indeed, the inhibition of MCL-1 and BCL-xL in combination induced apoptosis in a caspase-dependent manner in untreated and MCL-1-resistant 1889c cells. CONCLUSION: TH and TC are exquisitely dependent on the pro-survival factors MCL-1 and BCL-xL, making them ideal candidates for co-inhibition by BH3 mimetics. Since TH show a heterogeneous dependency on BCL-2 family proteins, upfront BH3 profiling could select patients and tailor the optimal therapy with the least possible toxicity.",['(c) 2021.

This study aims to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying IM resistance in CML treatment. 108 CML patients were recruited and grouped according to their sensitivity to IM as the responder group (N = 66) and the non-responder group (N = 42). Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed to evaluate the expression of candidate circular RNAs (circRNAs), microRNA (miRNAs) and messenger RNA (mRNAs). No significant difference was noted regarding demographic and clinicopathological characteristics between the responder group and the non-responder group. The expression of circ_0080145, circ_0051886 and ABL1 mRNA was significantly increased, while the expression of miR-203 and miR-637 was decreased in the non-responder group as compared with the responders. By using in-silicon analysis, it was predicted that circ_0080145 and circ_0051886 targeted miR-203 and miR-637 respectively, and ABL1 was found to be shared direct target gene of miR-203 and miR-637. Ectopic over-expression of circ_0080145 and circ_0051886 respectively reduced the expression of miR-203 and miR-637. The expression of ABL1 mRNA/protein was most upregulated in culture cells co-transfected with circ_0080145 and circ_0051886 as compared with those cells individually transfected. This study established the signaling pathways of circ_0080145/miR-203/ABL1 and circ 0051886/miR-637/ABL1.

The resulting glycosides were transformed into ribo-, 2'-deoxy- and arabinofuranosyl nucleosides through a chemical transformation of the 2'-substituent. The additive Pummerer reaction of the glycal S-oxide gave 1,2-di-O-acetyl-3,5-O-DTBS-4-thioribofuranose. The utility of the DTBS-protected 4-thioribofuranose has been demonstrated by the preparation of 4'-thio analogues of pyrimidine- and purine-4'-thioribonucleosides on the basis of the Vorbruggen glycosidation. Synthesis of 4'-thio-counterpart of C-nucleoside antibiotic tiazofurin has also been carried out. alpha-Face selective hydroboration of 1-C-aryl- or 1-C-heteroaryl-glycals obtained by cross-coupling of 1-tributylstannylglycal has furnished the respective beta-anomer of 4'-thio-C-ribonucleosides including 4'-thio analogue of nucleoside antibiotic pseudouridine and 9-deazaadenosine. On the basis of lithiation chemistry, 1-C- and 2-C-carbon-carbon-substituted 3,5-O-(1,1,3,3-tetraisopropyldisiloxane-1,3- diyl) (TIPDS)- 4-thiofuranoid glycal were synthesized. These glycals enabled us to prepare 1'-C- and 2'-beta-C-carbon-substituted 2'-deoxy-4'-thionucleosides which include thio-counterpart of antitumor nucleoside antibiotic angustmycin C. Furthermore, 1'-C-methyl-4'-thiothymidine emerged as potent inhibitor of angiogenesis. In addition, 1'-C-methyl-4'-thiothymidine exhibited inhibitory activity against thymidine kinase deficient mutant of herpes virus more potent than that of ganciclovir. Among the 4'-substituted 4'-thiothymidines, the 4'-C-cyano- and 4'-C-ethynyl derivatives inhibited replication of HIV variant resistant to 3TC (HIVM184V) as potent as to those of the HIV-1IIIB. In terms of the value of selectivity index (SI), 4'-C-cyano-4'-thiothymidine showed 3-fold selective index (SI) than that of the corresponding thymidine derivative. Furthermore, 4'-C-ethynyl-2'-deoxy-4'-thioguanosine has a 20-fold better value (>18,200) than that of 2'-deoxyguanosine counterpart (933). Furthermore,4'-azido-4'-thiothymidine was emerged as selective and potent anti-EBV agent. In terms of antineoplastic activity, 4'-azido- and 4'-C-fluoromethyl-2'-deoxy-4'-thiocytidine inhibited proliferation of human B-cell (CCRF-SB) and T-cell leukemia (Molt-4) cell lines although the parent compound 2'-deoxy-4'-thiocytidine did not show any cytotoxicity up to 100 microM. These facts concerning the biological activities suggested that replacement of the furanose oxygen with sulfur atom is a promising approach for development of less toxic antiviral and antineoplastic nucleoside antimetabolites. 4'-Thionucleoside has also superior biological properties as monomer for oligonucleotides (ONs) therapeutics. Therefore, this review provides a wide range of potential monomer for antisense ON and siRNA.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Haraguchi, Kazuhiro', 'Kumamoto, Hiroki', 'Tanaka, Hiromichi']","['Haraguchi K', 'Kumamoto H', 'Tanaka H']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nihon Pharmaceutical University,10281 Komuro, Inamachi, Kita-adachi-gun, Saitama 362-0806.

All patients receiving their first HCT, from 2011-2019, were included and received CloFluBu. Primary endpoint was Event Free Survival (EFS). Secondary endpoints were Overall Survival (OS), Graft-versus-Host-Disease (GvHD)-Relapse-Free Survival (GRFS), Treatment Related Mortality (TRM), Cumulative Incidence of Relapse (CIR), acute and chronic GvHD, and veno-occlusive disease (VOD). Cox Proportional Hazard- and Fine and Gray competing-risk models were used for data analysis. 155 Children were included; 60 acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), 69 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 26 other malignancies (mostly MDS-EB). Median age was 9.7 (0.5-18.6) years. Estimated 2-yr EFS was 72.0% +/- 6.0 in ALL, and 62.4% +/- 6.0 in AML patients. TRM in the whole cohort was 11.0% +/- 2.6, incidence of aGvHD III-IV at 6 months was 12.3% +/- 2.7, extensive chronic GvHD at 2-yr was 6.4% +/- 2.1.

Although an association between EBL and mutations in the bovine tumor suppressor gene TP53 (bTP53) has been suggested, the substantive incidence rate of bTP53 mutations in EBL cattle is still unclear. In this study, we investigated the complete sequence (exons 2-11) of bTP53 in tissue and peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) samples obtained from 154 EBL cattle and 117 cattle without EBL (non-EBL cattle) to elucidate the correlation between bTP53 mutations and EBL. The detection frequencies of non-synonymous (NS) and deletion mutations in bTP53 in EBL cattle were significantly higher than those in non-EBL cattle in both tissue and PBL samples (p < 0.05). Among these mutations in EBL cattle, 73.7 % (42/54) were homologous to those of human TP53 (hTP53), which were previously detected in various tumors. It has been reported that 95.2 % (40/42) of these hTP53 mutations induced complete or partial loss of the transactivating function of its encoding protein, P53. Moreover, the BLV proviral load in tissue samples was significantly higher in cattle harboring bTP53 NS and deletion mutations than in cattle without these mutations in both EBL and BLV-infected non-EBL cattle (p < 0.05). Although the activity of the mutant variants of bP53 must be further investigated, our findings revealed that bTP53 mutations are involved in tumorigenesis in BLV-infected cells and EBL-associated carcinogenesis.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

MTX is given at lethal doses and then is followed by rescue treatment with folinic acid (FA). Despite FA rescue, many patients suffer severe toxicity. The pharmacokinetics of FA rescue have not been sufficiently studied. However, optimization of FA rescue could potentially increase anti-tumor effects, whilst decreasing organ toxicity. Here, we describe our efforts to establish and optimize a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous determination of five essential components of the folate cycle, as well as MTX and its two metabolites. The method was applied to 6 individual patients receiving HDMTX, with 3 or 4 measurements for each patient. The method allows analysis of samples that were initially frozen. This notion, together with the test results in the 6 pilot patients, shows the feasibility of this method to study MTX and FA pharmacokinetics during HDMTX treatment. The method has the potential to optimize HDMTX and FA rescue treatment in individual patients.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The ability to accurately characterize t(4;12) is critical as myeloid neoplasms with PDGFRA rearrangements may be amenable to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. Herein, we describe a 60-year-old male with newly diagnosed AML and t(4;12)(q12;p13) by conventional chromosome studies. While the ETV6 break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe set demonstrated a balanced ETV6 gene rearrangement, the FIP1L1/CHIC2/PDGFRA tri-color and PDGFRA break-apart FISH probe sets could not resolve the ETV6 gene fusion partner. Mate-pair sequencing (MPseq), a next-generation sequencing assay, was subsequently performed and identified an ETV6 gene rearrangement (at 12p13) that involved an intergenic chromosomal region at 4q12, located between the CHIC2 and PDGFRA gene regions. Having excluded involvement by the PDGFRA gene region, the patient will not be considered for TKI therapy at any point during his medical management. The accurate characterization of structural rearrangements by NGS-based technologies, as demonstrated in this case, highlights the clinical relevance and potential impact on patient medical management of modern cytogenetic techniques.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

As CML stem/progenitor cells (LSPCs) are poised to cycle and differentiate, LSPCs must balance conservation and differentiation to avoid exhaustion, similar to normal hematopoiesis under stress. Since BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) eliminate differentiating cells, but spare BCR-ABL1-independent LSPCs, understanding the mechanisms that regulate LSPC differentiation may inform strategies to eliminate LSPCs. Upon performing a meta-analysis of published CML transcriptomes, we discovered that low expression of the MS4A3 transmembrane protein is a universal characteristic of LSPC quiescence, BCR-ABL1 independence, and transformation to blast phase. Several mechanisms are involved in suppressing MS4A3, including aberrant methylation and a MECOM-C/EBPepsilon axis. Contrary to previous reports, we find that MS4A3 does not function as a G1/S phase inhibitor, but promotes endocytosis of common beta chain (betac) cytokine receptors upon GM-CSF/IL-3 stimulation, enhancing downstream signaling and cellular differentiation. This suggests that LSPCs downregulate MS4A3 to evade betac cytokine-induced differentiation and maintain a more primitive, TKI-insensitive state. Accordingly, knockdown or deletion of MS4A3/Ms4a3 promotes TKI resistance and survival of CML cells ex vivo and enhance leukemogenesis in vivo, while targeted delivery of exogenous MS4A3 protein promotes differentiation. These data support a model in which MS4A3 governs response to differentiating myeloid cytokines, providing a unifying mechanism for the differentiation block characteristic of CML quiescence and blast phase CML. Promoting MS4A3 re-expression or delivery of ectopic MS4A3 may help eliminating LSPCs in vivo.",['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society of Hematology.'],"['Zhao, Helong', 'Pomicter, Anthony D', 'Eiring, Anna M', 'Franzini, Anca', 'Ahmann, Jonathan', 'Hwang, Jae-Yeon', 'Senina, Anna V', 'Helton, Bret', 'Iyer, Siddharth M', 'Yan, Dongqing', 'Khorashad, Jamshid S', 'Zabriskie, Matthew S', 'Agarwal, Anupriya', 'Redwine, Hannah M', 'Bowler, Amber D', 'Clair, Phillip M', 'McWeeney, Shannon K', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Tyner, Jeffrey W', 'Stirewalt, Derek L', 'Oehler, Vivian G', 'Varambally, Sooryanarayana', 'Berrett, Kristofer C', 'Vahrenkamp, Jeffrey M', 'Gertz, Jason', 'Varley, Katherine E', 'Radich, Jerald', 'Deininger, Michael W']","['Zhao H', 'Pomicter AD', 'Eiring AM', 'Franzini A', 'Ahmann J', 'Hwang JY', 'Senina AV', 'Helton B', 'Iyer SM', 'Yan D', 'Khorashad JS', 'Zabriskie MS', 'Agarwal A', 'Redwine HM', 'Bowler AD', 'Clair PM', 'McWeeney SK', 'Druker BJ', 'Tyner JW', 'Stirewalt DL', 'Oehler VG', 'Varambally S', 'Berrett KC', 'Vahrenkamp JM', 'Gertz J', 'Varley KE', 'Radich J', 'Deininger MW']","['Versiti Blood Research Institute, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States.', 'The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States.', 'Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso, El Paso, Texas, United States.', 'University of Utah College of Pharmacy, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States.', 'The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States.', 'University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky, United States.', 'The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry, Seattle, Washington, United States.', 'University of Utah, Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States.', 'University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah.', 'University of Utah, Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States.', 'Oregon Health & Science University, The Knight Cancer Institute, Portland, Oregon, United States.', 'The University of Utah, Midvale, Utah, United States.', 'University of Utah, United States.', 'University of Utah, Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States.', 'Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon, United States.', 'Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon, United States.', 'Oregon Health & Science University School of Medicine, Portland, Oregon, United States.', 'Fred Hutchnison Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, United States.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, United States.', 'University of Alabama Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States.', 'University of Utah, Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States.', 'University of Utah, Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States.', 'University of Utah, Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States.', 'University of Utah, Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, United States.', 'Versiti Blood Research Institute, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211115,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,2021/11/16 06:00,2021/11/16 06:00,['2021/11/15 17:25'],"['2021/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/27 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/15 17:25 [entrez]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(21)01880-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2021011802 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Blood. 2021 Nov 15. pii: S0006-4971(21)01880-2. doi: 10.1182/blood.2021011802.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-3977-0841', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6533-9150', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0359-5399', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4240-3484', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9439-2839', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8331-8206', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2277-1127', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2987-1331']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is increasing evidence that linking quantitative time-course information to disease outcomes can improve the predictions for patient-specific treatment responses. We designed a synthetic experiment simulating response kinetics of 5,000 patients to compare different computational methods with respect to their ability to accurately predict relapse for chronic and acute myeloid leukemia treatment. Technically, we used clinical reference data to first fit a model and then generate de novo model simulations of individual patients' time courses for which we can systematically tune data quality (i.e. measurement error) and quantity (i.e. number of measurements). Based hereon, we compared the prediction accuracy of three different computational methods, namely mechanistic models, generalized linear models, and deep neural networks that have been fitted to the reference data. Reaching prediction accuracies between 60 and close to 100%, our results indicate that data quality has a higher impact on prediction accuracy than the specific choice of the particular method. We further show that adapted treatment and measurement schemes can considerably improve the prediction accuracy by 10 to 20%.

Because ATRX-protein interactions impart functions, such as histone deposition, we used proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID) to identify proximal associations for ATRX. The proteomic screen captured known interactors, such as DAXX, NBS1, and PML, but also identified a range of new associating proteins. To gauge the scope of their roles, we examined three novel ATRX-associating proteins that likely differed in function, and for which little data were available. We found CCDC71 to associate with ATRX, but also HP1 and NAP1, suggesting a role in chromatin maintenance. Contrastingly, FAM207A associated with proteins involved in ribosome biosynthesis and localized to the nucleolus. ATRX proximal associations with the SLF2 DNA damage response factor help inhibit telomere exchanges. We further screened for the proteomic changes at telomeres when ATRX, SLF2, or both proteins were deleted. The loss caused important changes in the abundance of chromatin remodelling, DNA replication, and DNA repair factors at telomeres. Interestingly, several of these have previously been implicated in alternative lengthening of telomeres.

In this study, we show that female Kdm6aflox/flox mice (with allele inactivation initiated by Vav1-Cre in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) have a sex-specific phenotype that emerges with aging, with features resembling a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Female Kdm6a-knockout (KO) mice have an age-dependent expansion of their HSPCs with aberrant self-renewal, but they did not differentiate normally into downstream progeny. These mice became mildly anemic and thrombocytopenic, but did not develop overt leukemia, or die from these cytopenias.

The procedure is quick and well tolerated and can be facilitated by ultrasound guidance. METHODS: This article describes the authors' experience in using serial FNA to harvest cellular material during 4 clinical trials of immunotherapy by in situ vaccination in patients with low-grade lymphoma. RESULTS: Two hundred ninety-six FNA samples were collected from 44 patients over a span of approximately 6 weeks for each patient. Samples were sufficient in quantity and quality to be analyzed by flow cytometry and/or single-cell messenger RNA sequencing. FNA samples yielded an average of 12 x 10(6) cells with a mean cellular viability of 86%. Material collected from the tumor lymph nodes differed significantly in the proportions and phenotypes of cellular populations in comparison with matched peripheral blood samples. A comparison of flow cytometry results obtained by FNA directly from the patient and by FNA performed ex vivo and a dissociation of the same lymph node after surgical excision confirmed that FNA sampling of the patient accurately represented the tumor and the microenvironment. An analysis of the FNA samples from immunotherapy-treated target lymph nodes versus nodes from nontreated tumor sites provided insight into the impact of specific immunotherapy regimens. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest study describing the use of serial FNA sampling to harvest cellular material during immunotherapy clinical trials.

Notch signaling is thus a promising drug target for oncotherapy, and the development of Notch signaling inhibitors is eagerly awaited. Notch inhibitory activity-guided fractionation of a Spilanthes acmella extract led to the identification of five sesquiterpene lactones: tagitinin A (1), 1beta,2alpha-epoxytagitinin C (2), tagitinin C (3), orizabin (4), and 2alpha-hydroxytirotundin (5). 1beta,2alpha-Epoxytagitinin C (2) exhibited Notch signaling inhibition, with an IC50 of 25.6 muM, and was further evaluated for its activity against HPB-ALL, a Notch-activated leukemia cell line. Compound 2 showed potent cytotoxicity against HPB-ALL (IC50 1.7 muM) and arrested the cell cycle at the G2/M phase, but did not induce apoptotic cell death. Notch inhibitory mechanism analysis suggested that compound 2 transcriptionally suppresses Notch1 mRNA. In addition, we found that oxidative stress induction is critical for Notch signaling inhibition and the cytotoxicity of compound 2. This is the first mechanism of small molecule Notch inhibition. Our results demonstrate that 1beta,2alpha-epoxytagitinin C (2) is a potential anti-leukemia agent and further investigation of this compound is warranted.",['(c) 2021.

We found that an initial diagnosis of lymphoma in the skin is a very rare occurrence for systemic B-cell lymphomas, comprising < 0.3% of cases overall. Follicular lymphoma was the most likely to be diagnosed in the skin (1.47%), followed by marginal zone lymphoma (MZL, 0.5%), mantle cell lymphoma (0.4%), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL, 0.23%), Burkitt lymphoma (0.23%), Hodgkin lymphoma (0.04%), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (0.006%). While indolent systemic lymphomas (MZL and FL) presenting initially in the skin have a better prognosis than those presenting at other sites, the more aggressive systemic DLBCL presenting in the skin does not demonstrate improved prognosis.","['(c) 2021.

METHODS: All published cases of 3 primary hematologic malignancies in breast, without systemic involvement, were identified, with follow-ups solicited from authors. Treatment approaches were analyzed to highlight the most effective. RESULTS: Similar histologic features and biology among primary tumors of leukemia, lymphoma, plasmacytoma, and solid breast cancer was revealed. Review of treatments: tumor-directed, chemotherapy, or combination showed the benefit of tumor removal, and use of systemic agents in adjunct, not primary, treatment. Optimal assessment is limited by few cases of PET/CT verifying limited tumor extent. The common biology observed and cases of long survival after tumor/stroma eradication point to the complicity of organ microenvironment in the chemoresistance and treatment failure commonly observed in patients. CONCLUSIONS: The interaction of an organ microenvironment, particularly its adipocytes, with malignant cells, results in similar histologic changes, metastatic potential, and chemoresistance in 3 hematologic malignancies and solid cancers. Improved survival in hematologic malignancies could result from adopting PET/CT to find tumor and its extent, eradicating tumor, and elucidating common therapeutic targets.",['(c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Here, we identified an inflammatory cytokine-regulated transfer RNA-derived (tRNA-derived) fragment, tRF-21-VBY9PYKHD (tRF-21), as a tumor suppressor in PDAC progression. We found that the biogenesis of tRF-21 could be inhibited by leukemia inhibitory factor and IL-6 via the splicing factor SRSF5. Reduced tRF-21 promoted AKT2/1-mediated heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (hnRNP L) phosphorylation, enhancing hnRNP L to interact with dead-box helicase 17 (DDX17) to form an alternative splicing complex. The provoked hnRNP L-DDX17 activity preferentially spliced Caspase 9 and mH2A1 pre-mRNAs to form Caspase 9b and mH2A1.2, promoting PDAC cell malignant phenotypes. The tRF-21 levels were significantly lower in PDACs than in normal tissues, and patients with low tRF-21 levels had a poor prognosis.

Bioactive secondary metabolites have played a crucial role in the drug development and discovery process; mainly anticancer and antibiotic molecules are extensively enriched with molecules of natural origin. Anthocyanins are water-soluble secondary metabolites found in most species in the plant domain especially flowers, fruits, and tubers. These natural vacuolar pigments belong to the chemical class of phenolic moieties which are responsible for the shiny orange, red, blue, pink, and violet colors in the fruits, flowers, and vegetables. Chemically, anthocyanins comprise a core structure in the form of flavylium cation or 2-phenylbenzopyrylium and these natural colorants are polyhydroxy and polymethoxy analouges of this flavylium cation and can have sugar moieties or acylated groups linked at different positions. Currently, these molecules have raised a growing interest because of their wide range of colors, innocuous, beneficial health effects, and commercial application of these compounds in functional foods, nutraceuticals, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. However, interest in anthocyanin derivatives has noticeably enhanced in recent years due to their higher stability, improved bioavailability in biological matrices, and better use in food matrices and cosmetic products. Due to the enormous potential of natural anthocyanins and their derivatives this review tries to cover syntheses of anthocyanins and their analogues, chemical derivatization of anthocyanins, and anticancer activities such as breast, colorectal, leukemia, lung, prostate, and skin cancer of anthocyanins efficiently.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Majhi, Sasadhar']",['Majhi S'],"['Department of Chemistry (UG & PG Dept.), Triveni Devi Bhalotia College, Kazi Nazrul University, Raniganj, West Bengal-713347.

LIF stimulated growth of BCE while it inhibited, as previously reported, bovine aortic EC (BAE) growth. The JAK-STAT3 pathway mediated LIF actions in both BCE and BAE cells, but a caspase-independent proapoptotic signal mediated by cathepsins was triggered in BAE but not in BCE. LIF administration directly promoted activation of STAT3 and increased blood vessel density in mouse eyes. LIF also had protective effects on the choriocapillaris in a model of oxidative retinal injury.

We demonstrate that CD93 CAR T cells engineered from a novel humanized CD93-specific binder potently kill AML in vitro and in vivo but spare hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC). No toxicity is seen in murine models, but CD93 is expressed on human endothelial cells, and CD93 CAR T cells recognize and kill endothelial cell lines. We identify other AML CAR T-cell targets with overlapping expression on endothelial cells, especially in the context of proinflammatory cytokines. To address the challenge of endothelial-specific cross-reactivity, we provide proof of concept for NOT-gated CD93 CAR T cells that circumvent endothelial cell toxicity in a relevant model system. We also identify candidates for combinatorial targeting by profiling the transcriptome of AML and endothelial cells at baseline and after exposure to proinflammatory cytokines. Significance: CD93 CAR T cells eliminate AML and spare HSPCs but exert on-target, off-tumor toxicity to endothelial cells. We show coexpression of other AML targets on endothelial cells, introduce a novel NOT-gated strategy to mitigate endothelial toxicity, and demonstrate use of high-dimensional transcriptomic profiling for rational design of combinatorial immunotherapies.See related commentary by Velasquez and Gottschalk, p. 559.

We modeled the development of resistance to the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib in the activated B-cell (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, which relies on chronic active BCR signaling for survival. The primary mode of resistance was epigenetic, driven in part by the transcription factor TCF4. The resultant phenotypic shift altered BCR signaling such that the GTPase RAC2 substituted for BTK in the activation of phospholipase Cgamma2, thereby sustaining NF-kappaB activity. The interaction of RAC2 with phospholipase Cgamma2 was also increased in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells from patients with persistent or progressive disease on BTK inhibitor treatment. We identified clinically available drugs that can treat epigenetic ibrutinib resistance, suggesting combination therapeutic strategies. Significance: In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, we show that primary resistance to BTK inhibitors is due to epigenetic rather than genetic changes that circumvent the BTK blockade. We also observed this resistance mechanism in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, suggesting that epigenetic alterations may contribute more to BTK inhibitor resistance than currently thought.See related commentary by Pasqualucci, p. 555.

We conducted a phase II study of high-dose cytarabine followed by pembrolizumab 200 mg i.v. on day 14 to examine whether PD-1 inhibition improves clinical responses in relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML. Overall responders could receive pembrolizumab maintenance up to 2 years. Among 37 patients enrolled, the overall response rate, composite complete remission (CRc) rate (primary endpoint), and median overall survival (OS) were 46%, 38%, and 11.1 months, respectively. Patients with refractory/early relapse and those receiving treatment as first salvage had encouraging outcomes (median OS, 13.2 and 11.3 months, respectively). Grade >/=3 immune-related adverse events were rare (14%) and self-limiting. Patients who achieved CRc had a higher frequency of progenitor exhausted CD8(+) T cells expressing TCF-1 in the bone marrow prior to treatment. A multifaceted correlative approach of genomic, transcriptomic, and immunophenotypic profiling offers insights on molecular correlates of response and resistance to pembrolizumab. Significance: Immune-checkpoint blockade with pembrolizumab was tolerable and feasible after high-dose cytarabine in R/R AML, with encouraging clinical activity, particularly in refractory AML and those receiving treatment as first salvage regimen. Further study of pembrolizumab and other immune-checkpoint blockade strategies after cytotoxic chemotherapy is warranted in AML.See related commentary by Wei et al., p. 551.

Although gene-expression profiling can differentiate subsets of pediatric AML, its clinical utility in risk stratification remains limited. Here, we evaluate gene expression, pathogenic somatic mutations, and outcome in a cohort of 435 pediatric patients with a spectrum of pediatric myeloid-related acute leukemias for biological subtype discovery. This analysis revealed 63 patients with varying immunophenotypes that span a T-lineage and myeloid continuum designated as acute myeloid/T-lymphoblastic leukemia (AMTL). Within AMTL, two patient subgroups distinguished by FLT3-ITD and PRC2 mutations have different outcomes, demonstrating the impact of mutational composition on survival. Across the cohort, variability in outcomes of patients within isomutational subsets is influenced by transcriptional identity and the presence of a stem cell-like gene-expression signature. Integration of gene expression and somatic mutations leads to improved risk stratification. Significance: Immunophenotype and somatic mutations play a significant role in treatment approach and risk stratification of acute leukemia. We conducted an integrated genomic analysis of pediatric myeloid malignancies and found that a combination of genetic and transcriptional readouts was superior to immunophenotype and genomic mutations in identifying biological subtypes and predicting outcomes.

We analyzed anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG Ab (spike Ab) titers and neutralizing Ab among 217 recipients of cellular treatments (allo-HCT, n = 149; auto-HCT, n = 61; CAR T-cell therapy, n = 7). At 3 months after vaccination, 188 patients (87%) had positive spike Ab levels and 139 (77%) had positive neutralization activity compared with 100% for both in 54 concurrent healthy controls. Time from cellular therapy to vaccination and immune recovery post-cellular therapy were associated with response. Vaccination against COVID-19 is an important component of post-cellular therapy care, and predictors of quantitative and qualitative response are critical in informing clinical decisions about optimal timing of vaccines and the requirement for booster doses. Significance: Identifying predictors of response to vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in patients following cellular therapy is critical to managing this highly vulnerable patient population. To date, this is the most comprehensive study evaluating quantitative and qualitative responses to vaccination, providing parameters most predictive of response and potentially informing booster vaccination strategies.See related article by Chung et al., p. 568.

In a study of 551 hematologic malignancy patients with leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma, anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG titers and neutralizing activity were measured at 1 and 3 months from initial vaccination. Compared with healthy controls, patients with hematologic malignancy had attenuated antibody titers at 1 and 3 months. Furthermore, patients with hematologic malignancy had markedly diminished neutralizing capacity of 26.3% at 1 month and 43.6% at 3 months, despite positive seroconversion rates of 51.5% and 68.9% at the respective time points. Healthy controls had 93.2% and 100% neutralizing capacity at 1 and 3 months, respectively. Patients with leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma on observation had uniformly blunted responses. Treatment with Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors, venetoclax, phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors, anti-CD19/CD20-directed therapies, and anti-CD38/B-cell maturation antigen-directed therapies substantially hindered responses, but single-agent immunomodulatory agents did not. Significance: Patients with hematologic malignancy have compromised COVID-19 vaccine responses at baseline that are further suppressed by active therapy, with many patients having insufficient neutralizing capacity despite positive antibody titers. Refining vaccine response parameters is critical to guiding clinical care, including the indication for booster vaccines, for this vulnerable population.See related article by Tamari et al., p. 577.

Most patients with optimal responses to TKIs can have a normal life expectancy. Treatment-free remission (TFR) after discontinuing TKI has increasingly become a new goal for CML treatment.

Each of these disorders are unique and present their own challenges with regards to treatment. Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is considered the most aggressive myeloid malignancy, only potentially curable with intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy with or without allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In comparison, patients diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have a high rate of long-term survival. However, drug resistance and relapse are major issues in both these diseases. A growing body of evidence suggests that Interferons (IFNs) may be a useful therapy for myeloid malignancies, particularly in circumstances where patients are resistant to existing front-line therapies and have risk of relapse following haematopoietic stem cell transplant. IFNs are a major class of cytokines which are known to play an integral role in the non-specific immune response. IFN therapy has potential as a combination therapy in AML patients to reduce the impact of minimal residual disease on relapse. Alongside this, IFNs can potentially sensitize leukaemic cells to TKIs in resistant CML patients. There is evidence also that IFNs have a therapeutic role in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) such as polycythaemia vera (PV) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF), where they can restore polyclonality in patients. Novel formulations have improved the clinical effectiveness of IFNs. Low dose pegylated IFN formulations improve pharmacokinetics and improve patient tolerance to therapies, thereby minimizing the risk of haematological toxicities. Herein, we will discuss recent developments and the current understanding of the molecular and clinical implications of Type I IFNs for the treatment of myeloid malignancies.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Healy, Dahal, Jones, Floisand and Woolley.']","['Healy, Fiona M', 'Dahal, Lekh N', 'Jones, Jack R E', 'Floisand, Yngvar', 'Woolley, John F']","['Healy FM', 'Dahal LN', 'Jones JRE', 'Floisand Y', 'Woolley JF']","['Department of Pharmacology & Therapeutics, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Pharmacology & Therapeutics, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Pharmacology & Therapeutics, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Molecular & Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.', 'The Clatterbridge Cancer Centre NHS Foundation Trust, Liverpool, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Pharmacology & Therapeutics, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211029,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",2021/11/16 06:00,2021/11/16 06:01,['2021/11/15 07:08'],"['2021/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/15 07:08 [entrez]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/16 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.769628 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Oct 29;11:769628. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.769628. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8586418,['NOTNLM'],"['interferon', 'interferon alfa', 'interferon beta', 'myeloid malignancies', 'myeloid neoplasia', 'type I interferon (IFN) signaling']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Advances in transplantation techniques, such as donor selection, conditioning regimen modification, and graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis, have successfully improved the outcomes of AML patients receiving haplo-SCT and extended the haploidentical transplant indictions for AML. Presently, treating de novo AML, secondary AML, therapy-related AML and refractory and relapsed AML with haplo-SCT can achieve comparable outcomes to those of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donor transplantation (MSDT), unrelated donor transplantation or umbilical cord blood transplantation. For some subgroups of AML subjects, such as patients with positive pretransplantation minimal/measurable residual disease, recent studies suggest that haplo-SCT might be superior to MSDT in decreasing relapse and improving survival. Unfortunately, for patients with AML after haplo-SCT, relapse and infections remain the causes of death that restrict further improvement in clinical outcomes. In this review, we discuss the recent advances and challenges in haplo-SCT for AML treatment, mainly focusing on unmanipulated haplo-SCT protocols. We provide an outlook on future prospects and suggest that relapse prophylaxis, intervention, and treatment, as well as infection prevention and therapy, are areas of active research in AML patients who receive haploidentical allografts.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Chang, Zhao and Huang.']","['Chang, Ying-Jun', 'Zhao, Xiang-Yu', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun']","['Chang YJ', 'Zhao XY', 'Huang XJ']","[""Peking University Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China."", 'National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Peking University, Beijing, China.', ""Peking University Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China."", 'National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Peking University, Beijing, China.', ""Peking University Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China."", 'National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Peking University, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211028,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",2021/11/16 06:00,2021/11/16 06:01,['2021/11/15 07:08'],"['2021/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/15 07:08 [entrez]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/16 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.758512 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Oct 28;11:758512. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.758512. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8581046,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'graft-versus-leukemia-effect', 'haploidentical stem cell transplantation', 'infection', 'relapse']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ferroptosis is a unique regulated cell death (RCD) mode characterized by excess accumulation of iron-dependent lipid peroxide and reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared with other well-known programmed cell death modes. It has been currently recognized that ferroptosis plays a rather important role in the occurrence, development, and treatment of traumatic brain injury, stroke, acute kidney injury, liver damage, ischemia-reperfusion injury, tumor, etc. Of note, ferroptosis may be explained by the expression of various molecules and signaling components, among which iron, lipid, and amino acid metabolism are the key regulatory mechanisms of ferroptosis. Meanwhile, tumor cells of hematological malignancies, such as leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma (MM), are identified to be sensitive to ferroptosis. Targeting potential regulatory factors in the ferroptosis pathway may promote or inhibit the disease progression of these malignancies. In this review, a systematic summary was conducted on the key molecular mechanisms of ferroptosis and the current potential relationships of ferroptosis with leukemia, lymphoma, and MM. It is expected to provide novel potential therapeutic approaches and targets for hematological malignancies.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Zhao, Huang and Peng.']","['Zhao, Yan', 'Huang, Zineng', 'Peng, Hongling']","['Zhao Y', 'Huang Z', 'Peng H']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Hunan Key Laboratory of Basic and Applied Hematology, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Hunan Key Laboratory of Basic and Applied Hematology, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Hunan Key Laboratory of Basic and Applied Hematology, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Hunan Key Laboratory of Tumor Models and Individualized Medicine, Changsha, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211027,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",2021/11/16 06:00,2021/11/16 06:01,['2021/11/15 07:08'],"['2021/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/15 07:08 [entrez]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/16 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.743006 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Oct 27;11:743006. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.743006. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8582018,['NOTNLM'],"['GSH', 'ferroptosis', 'iron metabolism', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'reactive oxygen species', 'regulated cell death']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both drugs have demonstrated clinical efficacy and safety profiles superior to chemoimmunotherapy regimens in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Mounting preclinical and clinical evidence indicates that both ibrutinib and acalabrutinib are versatile and have direct effects on many immune cell subsets as well as other cell types beyond B cells. The versatility and immunomodulatory effects of both drugs have been exploited to expand their therapeutic potential in a wide variety of human diseases. Over 470 clinical trials are currently registered at ClinicalTrials.gov to test the efficacy of ibrutinib or acalabrutinib not only in almost every type of B cell malignancies, but also in hematological malignancies of myeloid cells and T cells, solid tumors, chronic graft versus host disease (cGHVD), autoimmune diseases, allergy and COVID-19 (http:www.clinicaltrials.gov). In this review, we present brief discussions of the clinical trials and relevant key preclinical evidence of ibrutinib and acalabrutinib as monotherapies or as part of combination therapies for the treatment of human diseases beyond B cell malignancies. Adding to the proven efficacy of ibrutinib for cGVHD, preliminary results of clinical trials have shown promising efficacy of ibrutinib or acalabrutinib for certain T cell malignancies, allergies and severe COVID-19. However, both BTK inhibitors have no or limited efficacy for refractory or recurrent solid tumors. These clinical data together with additional pending results from ongoing trials will provide valuable information to guide the design and improvement of future trials, including optimization of combination regimens and dosing sequences as well as better patient stratification and more efficient delivery strategies. Such information will further advance the precise implementation of BTK inhibitors into the clinical toolbox for the treatment of different human diseases.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Zhu, Jung, Victor, Arceo, Gokhale and Xie.']","['Zhu, Sining', 'Jung, Jaeyong', 'Victor, Eton', 'Arceo, Johann', 'Gokhale, Samantha', 'Xie, Ping']","['Zhu S', 'Jung J', 'Victor E', 'Arceo J', 'Gokhale S', 'Xie P']","['Department of Cell Biology and Neuroscience, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, United States.', 'Graduate Program in Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, United States.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Neuroscience, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, United States.', 'Graduate Program in Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, United States.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Neuroscience, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, United States.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Neuroscience, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, United States.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Neuroscience, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, United States.', 'Graduate Program in Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, United States.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Neuroscience, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, United States.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, United States.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211028,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",2021/11/16 06:00,2021/11/16 06:01,['2021/11/15 07:08'],"['2021/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/15 07:08 [entrez]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/16 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.737943 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Oct 28;11:737943. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.737943. eCollection 2021.,,"['P30 CA072720/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA158402/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI128264/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC8585514,['NOTNLM'],"['BTK', 'COVID-19', 'acalabrutinib', 'cancers', 'ibrutinib', 'immune responses', 'immunomodulation', 'inflammation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, to date, data in pediatric patients with malignant diseases other than acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are sparse or lacking. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study of 98 pediatric patients was conducted to analyze the incidence of hyponatremia in a Caucasian cohort of newly diagnosed ALL. For comparison, we further examined five other pediatric oncological cohorts (Hodgkin's disease, Ewing sarcoma, Wilms tumor, benign glioma of the CNS, Langerhans cell histiocytosis) that receive alkaloids in their induction regimes. Results: We found a high incidence of hyponatremia (14.7%) in our ALL cohort with a trend toward male patients of elementary school age. None of the affected patients showed neurological symptoms. By comparison, patients from other malignancy groups did not show significant hyponatremia, regardless of their comparable therapy with alkaloids. We here show a noticeable coincidence of hyponatremia and hypertriglyceridemia in ALL patients, indicating a possible role of L-asparaginase-related hypertriglyceridemia in the development of severe hyponatremia in such patients. Conclusion: We report a higher incidence of hyponatremia following vincristine therapy in Caucasian children with ALL than published before. This hyponatremia could not be demonstrated in other oncologic cohorts treated with alkaloids. L-Asparaginase-induced hypertriglyceridemia may play a role in the certainly multifactorial development of hyponatremia in childhood leukemia.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Salvador, Salvador, Willeit, Kuntner, Haid, Muller, Kropshofer', 'and Crazzolara.']","['Salvador, Christina', 'Salvador, Robert', 'Willeit, Peter', 'Kuntner, Christine', 'Haid, Alexandra', 'Muller, Thomas', 'Kropshofer, Gabriele', 'Crazzolara, Roman']","['Salvador C', 'Salvador R', 'Willeit P', 'Kuntner C', 'Haid A', 'Muller T', 'Kropshofer G', 'Crazzolara R']","['Department of Pediatrics I, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Medical University Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'HTLinn, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Medical University Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Information Technology Management, Medical University Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Competence Center for Clinical Studies, Medical University Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Pediatrics I, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Medical University Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Pediatrics I, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Medical University Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Pediatrics I, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Medical University Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211029,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",2021/11/16 06:00,2021/11/16 06:01,['2021/11/15 07:08'],"['2021/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/15 07:08 [entrez]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/16 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2021.708875 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2021 Oct 29;11:708875. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.708875. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8586428,['NOTNLM'],"['alkaloids', 'children', 'hyponatremia', 'leukemia', 'triglycerides', 'vincristine']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While some patients respond well to chemotherapy, we describe here a subgroup with distinct molecular features that has very poor prognosis under chemotherapy. The classification of AML relies substantially on cytogenetics, but most cytogenetic abnormalities do not offer targets for development of targeted therapeutics. Therefore, it is important to create a detailed molecular characterization of the subgroup most in need of new targeted therapeutics. Methods: We used a multi-omics approach to identify a molecular subgroup with the worst response to chemotherapy, and to identify promising drug targets specifically for this AML subgroup. Results: Multi-omics clustering analysis resulted in three primary clusters among 166 AML adult cancer cases in TCGA data. One of these clusters, which we label as the high-risk molecular subgroup (HRMS), consisted of cases that responded very poorly to standard chemotherapy, with only about 10% survival to 2 years. The gene TP53 was mutated in most cases in this subgroup but not in all of them. The top six genes over-expressed in the HRMS subgroup included E2F4, CD34, CD109, MN1, MMLT3, and CD200. Multi-omics pathway analysis using RNA and CNA expression data identified in the HRMS subgroup over-activated pathways related to immune function, cell proliferation, and DNA damage. Conclusion: A distinct subgroup of AML patients are not successfully treated with chemotherapy, and urgently need targeted therapeutics based on the molecular features of this subgroup. Potential drug targets include over-expressed genes E2F4, and MN1, as well as mutations in TP53, and several over-activated molecular pathways.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Nguyen, Pepper, Nguyen, Fan, Hu, Chen, Yan and Meerzaman.']","['Nguyen, Trinh', 'Pepper, John W', 'Nguyen, Cu', 'Fan, Yu', 'Hu, Ying', 'Chen, Qingrong', 'Yan, Chunhua', 'Meerzaman, Daoud']","['Nguyen T', 'Pepper JW', 'Nguyen C', 'Fan Y', 'Hu Y', 'Chen Q', 'Yan C', 'Meerzaman D']","['Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD, United States.', 'Division of Cancer Prevention, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD, United States.', 'Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD, United States.', 'Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD, United States.', 'Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD, United States.', 'Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD, United States.', 'Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD, United States.', 'Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD, United States.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211029,Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",2021/11/16 06:00,2021/11/16 06:01,['2021/11/15 06:59'],"['2021/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/15 06:59 [entrez]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fgene.2021.777094 [doi]', '777094 [pii]']",epublish,Front Genet. 2021 Oct 29;12:777094. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2021.777094. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8585788,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'intrinsic subtypes', 'multi-omics', 'targeted therapeutics', 'unsupervised clustering']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the routine clinical features are not sufficient to accurately predict the prognosis of AML. The expression of hypoxia-related genes was associated with survival outcomes of a variety of hematologic and lymphoid neoplasms. We established an 18-gene signature-based hypoxia-related prognosis model (HPM) and a complex model that consisted of the HPM and clinical risk factors using machine learning methods. Both two models were able to effectively predict the survival of AML patients, which might contribute to improving risk classification. Differentially expressed genes analysis, Gene Ontology (GO) categories, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were performed to reveal the underlying functions and pathways implicated in AML development. To explore hypoxia-related changes in the bone marrow immune microenvironment, we used CIBERSORT to calculate and compare the proportion of 22 immune cells between the two groups with high and low hypoxia-risk scores. Enrichment analysis and immune cell composition analysis indicated that the biological processes and molecular functions of drug metabolism, angiogenesis, and immune cell infiltration of bone marrow play a role in the occurrence and development of AML, which might help us to evaluate several hypoxia-related metabolic and immune targets for AML therapy.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Zhong, Wu, Bu, Li, Cai, Du, Gao and Ping.']","['Zhong, Jinman', 'Wu, Hang', 'Bu, Xiaoyin', 'Li, Weiru', 'Cai, Shengchun', 'Du, Meixue', 'Gao, Ya', 'Ping, Baohong']","['Zhong J', 'Wu H', 'Bu X', 'Li W', 'Cai S', 'Du M', 'Gao Y', 'Ping B']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Huiqiao, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211026,Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",2021/11/16 06:00,2021/11/16 06:01,['2021/11/15 06:59'],"['2021/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/15 06:59 [entrez]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fgene.2021.727392 [doi]', '727392 [pii]']",epublish,Front Genet. 2021 Oct 26;12:727392. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2021.727392. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8578022,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'bone marrow microenvironment', 'hypoxia', 'immunity', 'metabolism', 'prognostic model']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the function of prognosis-related signature genes in AML remains unclear. Methods: In the current study, transcriptome sequencing was performed on 15 clinical samples, differentially expressed RNAs were identified using R software. The potential interactions network was constructed by using the common genes between target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs with transcriptome sequencing results. Functional and pathway enrichment analysis was performed to identify candidate gene-mediated aberrant signaling pathways. Hub genes were identified by the cytohubba plugin in Cytoscape software, which then expanded the potential interactions regulatory module for hub genes. TCGA-LAML clinical data were used for the prognostic analysis of the hub genes in the regulatory network, and GVSA analysis was used to identify the immune signature of prognosis-related hub genes. qRT-PCR was used to verify the expression of hub genes in independent clinical samples. Results: We obtained 1,610 differentially expressed lncRNAs, 233 differentially expressed miRNAs, and 2,217 differentially expressed mRNAs from transcriptome sequencing. The potential interactions network is constructed by 12 lncRNAs, 25 miRNAs, and 692 mRNAs. Subsequently, a sub-network including 15 miRNAs as well as 12 lncRNAs was created based on the expanded regulatory modules of 25 key genes. The prognostic analysis results show that CCL5 and lncRNA UCA1 was a significant impact on the prognosis of AML. Besides, we found three potential interactions networks such as lncRNA UCA1/hsa-miR-16-5p/COL4A5, lncRNA UCA1/hsa-miR-16-5p/SPARC, and lncRNA SNORA27/hsa-miR-17-5p/CCL5 may play an important role in AML. Furthermore, the evaluation of the immune infiltration shows that CCL5 is positively correlated with various immune signatures, and lncRNA UCA1 is negatively correlated with the immune signatures. Finally, the result of qRT-PCR showed that CCL5 is down-regulated and lncRNA UCA1 is up-regulated in AML samples separately. Conclusions: In conclusion, we propose that CCL5 and lncRNA UCA1 could be recognized biomarkers for predicting survival prognosis based on constructing competing endogenous RNAs in AML, which will provide us novel insight into developing novel prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic for AML.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Wang, Uddin, Hao, Chen, Xiang, Xiong and Wu.']","['Wang, Jie', 'Uddin, Md Nazim', 'Hao, Jian-Ping', 'Chen, Rong', 'Xiang, Yun-Xia', 'Xiong, Dai-Qin', 'Wu, Yun']","['Wang J', 'Uddin MN', 'Hao JP', 'Chen R', 'Xiang YX', 'Xiong DQ', 'Wu Y']","['Department of Pharmacy, First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi, China.', 'School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', 'School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Institute of Food Science and Technology, Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (BCSIR), Dhaka, Bangladesh.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi, China.', 'Department of General Medicine, First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211029,Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",2021/11/16 06:00,2021/11/16 06:01,['2021/11/15 06:59'],"['2021/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/15 06:59 [entrez]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fgene.2021.723001 [doi]', '723001 [pii]']",epublish,Front Genet. 2021 Oct 29;12:723001. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2021.723001. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8585857,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Competing endogenous RNA', 'bioinformatics', 'prognosis-related genes', 'transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike T cell-based therapies, NK cells harbor an innate capacity to eliminate malignant cells without prior sensitization and can be adoptively transferred between individuals without the need for extensive HLA matching. A wide variety of therapeutic NK cell sources are currently being investigated clinically, including allogeneic donor-derived NK cells, stem cell-derived NK cells and NK cell lines. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that not all NK cells are endowed with the same antitumor potential. Despite advances in techniques to enhance NK cell cytotoxicity and persistence, the initial identification and utilization of highly functional NK cells remains essential to ensure the future success of adoptive NK cell therapies. Indeed, little consideration has been given to the identification and selection of donors who harbor NK cells with potent antitumor activity. In this regard, there is currently no standard donor selection criteria for adoptive NK cell therapy. Here, we review our current understanding of the factors which govern NK cell functional fate, and propose a paradigm shift away from traditional phenotypic characterization of NK cell subsets towards a functional profile based on molecular and metabolic characteristics. We also discuss previous selection models for NK cell-based immunotherapies and highlight important considerations for the selection of optimal NK cell donors for future adoptive cell therapies.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Barnes, Trew, de Jong and Foley.']","['Barnes, Samantha A', 'Trew, Isabella', 'de Jong, Emma', 'Foley, Bree']","['Barnes SA', 'Trew I', 'de Jong E', 'Foley B']","['Telethon Kids Institute, The University of Western Australia, Nedlands, WA, Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Western Australia, Crawley, WA, Australia.', 'Telethon Kids Institute, The University of Western Australia, Nedlands, WA, Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Western Australia, Crawley, WA, Australia.', 'Telethon Kids Institute, The University of Western Australia, Nedlands, WA, Australia.', 'Telethon Kids Institute, The University of Western Australia, Nedlands, WA, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211027,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",2021/11/16 06:00,2021/11/16 06:00,['2021/11/15 06:58'],"['2021/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/15 06:58 [entrez]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2021.765705 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2021 Oct 27;12:765705. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.765705. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8578927,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer immunotherapy', 'cell metabolism', 'donor selection', 'epigenetics', 'natural killer cells', 'phenotype', 'transcriptomics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With several FDA approvals, CAR-T therapy is recognized as an alternative treatment option for particular patients with certain conditions of B-ALL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, or multiple myeloma. However, CAR-T therapy for B-ALL can be surrounded by challenges such as various adverse events including the life-threatening cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity, B-cell aplasia-associated hypogammaglobulinemia and agammaglobulinemia, and the alloreactivity of allogeneic CAR-Ts. Furthermore, recent advances such as improvements in media design, the reduction of ex vivo culturing duration, and other phenotype-determining factors can still create room for a more effective CAR-T therapy in R/R B-ALL. Herein, we review preclinical and clinical strategies with a focus on novel studies aiming to address the mentioned hurdles and stepping further towards a milestone in CAR-T therapy of B-ALL.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Safarzadeh Kozani, Safarzadeh Kozani and Rahbarizadeh.']","['Safarzadeh Kozani, Pouya', 'Safarzadeh Kozani, Pooria', 'Rahbarizadeh, Fatemeh']","['Safarzadeh Kozani P', 'Safarzadeh Kozani P', 'Rahbarizadeh F']","['Department of Medical Biotechnology, Faculty of Paramedicine, Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Rasht, Iran.', 'Student Research Committee, Medical Biotechnology Research Center, School of Nursing, Midwifery, and Paramedicine, Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Rasht, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Research and Development Center of Biotechnology, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211028,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",2021/11/16 06:00,2021/11/16 06:00,['2021/11/15 06:58'],"['2021/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/15 06:58 [entrez]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2021.765097 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2021 Oct 28;12:765097. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.765097. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8581403,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'adoptive cell therapy', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'chimeric antigen receptor', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'neurotoxicity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is no consensus on treatment strategy post CAR-T cell therapy. In this retrospective study of humanized CD19-targeted CAR-T cell (hCART19s) therapy for R/R B-ALL, we analyzed the patients treated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) or received a second hCART19s infusion, and summarized their efficacy and safety. We retrospectively studied 28 R/R B-ALL patients treated with hCART19s in the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University from 2016 to 2020. After the first hCART19s infusion, 10 patients received allo-HSCT (CART+HSCT group), 7 patients received a second hCART19s infusion (CART2 group), and 11 patients did not receive HSCT or a second hCART19s infusion (CART1 group). The safety, efficacy, and long-term survival were analyzed. Of the 28 patients who received hCART19s treatment, 1 patient could not be evaluated for efficacy, and 25 (92.6%) achieved complete remission (CR) with 20 (74.7%) achieving minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity. Seven (25%) patients experienced grade 3-4 CRS, and one died from grade 5 CRS. No patient experienced >/=3 grade ICANS. The incidence of second CR is higher in the CART+HSCT group compared to the CART2 group (100% vs. 42.9%, p=0.015). The median follow-up time was 1,240 days (range: 709-1,770). Significantly longer overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) were achieved in the CART+HSCT group (median OS and LFS: not reached, p=0.006 and 0.001, respectively) compared to the CART2 group (median OS: 482; median LFS: 189) and the CART1 group (median OS: 236; median LFS: 35). In the CART+HSCT group, the incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) was 30% (3/10), and transplantation-related mortality was 30% (3/10). No chronic GVHD occurred.

However, interventions for EF impairments are scarce. Thus, the aims of this study were to (1) explore the feasibility and acceptability of the cognitive rehabilitation program Goal Management Training (GMT) and (2) examine whether GMT is associated with positive outcomes across cases of ALL survivors with EF complaints. Four participants (median age 31.5 years) underwent nine GMT modules in a total of five group sessions. Rehabilitation was focused on compensatory strategies to improve real-life EFs. Participants were evaluated at 2-week and 6-month follow-ups. Evaluation of feasibility and acceptability included adherence, a semi structured interview, self-reports, and safety. Additionally, therapists' experience with implementation was evaluated. Outcome measures included self-reports and neurocognitive tests of attention, EF, and processing speed. All participants completed GMT and rated the intervention as useful, suitable, and satisfactory. The reliable change index showed improved daily life EFs (two participants) and neurocognitive performance (three participants) at 6-month follow-up. Additionally, all participants improved on a ""real-life"" task involving EF. A future randomized controlled trial is recommended.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Egset, Weider, Stubberud, Hjemdal, Ruud, Hjort, Eilertsen,', 'Sund, Rokke and Reinfjell.']","['Egset, Kaja Solland', 'Weider, Siri', 'Stubberud, Jan', 'Hjemdal, Odin', 'Ruud, Ellen', 'Hjort, Magnus Aassved', 'Eilertsen, Mary-Elizabeth Bradley', 'Sund, Anne Mari', 'Rokke, Magnhild Eitrem', 'Reinfjell, Trude']","['Egset KS', 'Weider S', 'Stubberud J', 'Hjemdal O', 'Ruud E', 'Hjort MA', 'Eilertsen MB', 'Sund AM', 'Rokke ME', 'Reinfjell T']","['Department of Psychology, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.', 'Department of Psychology, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.', 'Department of Psychology, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Research, Lovisenberg Diakonale Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Psychology, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.', 'Department of Pediatric Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.', ""Children's Clinic, St. Olavs Hospital, Trondheim University Hospital, Trondheim, Norway."", 'Department of Public Health and Nursing, Center for Health Promotion Research, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.', 'Regional Centre for Child and Youth Mental Health and Child Welfare, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.', 'Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.', 'Department of Psychology, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211028,Switzerland,Front Psychol,Frontiers in psychology,101550902,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",2021/11/16 06:00,2021/11/16 06:01,['2021/11/15 06:57'],"['2021/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/15 06:57 [entrez]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/16 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fpsyg.2021.724960 [doi]'],epublish,Front Psychol. 2021 Oct 28;12:724960. doi: 10.3389/fpsyg.2021.724960. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8581253,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'adult survivor', 'childhood cancer', 'executive functions', 'late effects', 'rehabilitation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While imatinib is known as the first-line treatment of CML, in some cases other TKIs including dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib may be preferred. Dasatinib, a second-generation TKI, inhibits multiple family kinases including BCR-ABL, SRC family kinases, receptor kinases, and TEC family kinases. It is effective against most imatinib-resistant cases except T315I mutation. Despite the superiority of dasatinib in its hematologic and cytogenetic responses in CML compared to imatinib, its potentially harmful pulmonary complications including pleural effusion (PE) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) may limit its use.

METHODS: In this observational study, we utilized a large nationwide registry of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Japan. Patients' baseline characteristics and outcomes were compared according to the immunosuppressed states of the patients. The impact of different therapeutic agents on the clinical courses of the patients was evaluated. RESULTS: Data of 14,760 patients were included, and 887 (5.9%) were immunosuppressed. The immunosuppressed state of the patient resulted from solid tumor (43.3%, n = 384), chemotherapy within 3 months (15.6%, n = 138), collagen disease (16.9%, n = 150), use of immunosuppressive agents (16.0%, n = 142), and metastatic solid tumor (13.5%, n = 120). Immunosuppressed patients were older and had a higher severity of illness at admission and during hospitalization than non-immunosuppressed patients. The mortality rates for major diseases causing immunosuppression were as follows: solid tumor, 12.5% (48/384; P < 0.001; relative risk [RR], 3.41); metastatic solid tumor, 31.7% (38/120; P < 0.001; RR, 8.43); leukemia, 23.1% (9/39; P < 0.001; RR, 5.87); lymphoma, 33.3% (20/60; P < 0.001; RR, 8.63); and collagen disease, 15.3% (23/150; P < 0.001; RR 3.97). Underlying diseases with high mortality rates were not necessarily associated with high rates of invasive supportive care. CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of immunosuppressed COVID-19 inpatients varied according to the different immunosuppressed states. Multiple factors, including the severity of the underlying diseases, might have affected their invasive supportive care indications.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association', 'for Infectious Diseases.

A Markov state transition model was conducted. Model transition, adverse-effect probabilities, utility data and medical costs were obtained from clinical trials and literature. Measurements included medications, follow-ups, adverse events, allogeneic stem cell transplantation and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Univariable and Bayesian multivariable probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted using Monte Carlo simulations. Dasatinib resulted in an ICER of $79,086/QALY compared to nilotinib. Ponatinib yielded an ICER of $176,278/QALY and $141,563/QALY compared to dasatinib and nilotinib, respectively. Dasatinib was the optimal treatment at a $100,000/QALY threshold. The probability (36%-40%) for ponatinib or dasatinib optimal treatment was associated with thresholds of $160,000-$180,000/QALY.

Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, the only approved agents at present, have brought many clinical benefits to patients, with prolongation of survival also demonstrated for ruxolitinib. However, these agents have clear limitations. Optimal management of anemia in MF remains a major unmet need. Neither ruxolitinib nor fedratinib is recommended for use in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, i.e. platelets <50 x 10(9)/L, who have a particularly poor prognosis. The search for the optimal partner for JAK inhibitors to address some of the shortcomings of these agents (e.g. limited ability to improve bone marrow fibrosis, cytopenias and induce molecular responses) and achieve meaningful 'disease modification' continues. This has led to the development of a number of rational, preclinically synergistic combinations for use either upfront or in the setting of sub-optimal response to JAK inhibition. Finally, the outlook for patients whose disease progresses on JAK inhibitor therapy continues to be grim, and agents with alternative mechanisms of action may be needed in this setting. In this article, we use a case-based approach to illustrate challenges commonly encountered in clinical practice and our management of the same. Fortunately, there has been enormous growth in drug development efforts in the MF space in the last few years, some of which appear poised to bear fruit in the very near future.",,"['Bose, Prithviraj', 'Mesa, Ruben A']","['Bose P', 'Mesa RA']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Mays Cancer Center, UT Health San Antonio MD Anderson, San Antonio, TX, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211115,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,,2021/11/16 06:00,2021/11/16 06:00,['2021/11/15 05:35'],"['2021/11/15 05:35 [entrez]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/10428194.2021.1999443 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Leuk Lymphoma. 2021 Nov 15:1-15. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2021.1999443.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-4343-5712', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5880-7972']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Myelofibrosis', 'clinical trials', 'fedratinib', 'imetelstat', 'luspatercept', 'momelotinib', 'navitoclax', 'pacritinib', 'pelabresib', 'ruxolitinib']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most common ophthalmic side effects are eyelid edema and periorbital edema. Other side effects which occur at rates of <1% include blepharitis, blurred vision, conjunctival hemorrhage, conjunctivitis, retinal hemorrhage, etc. An uncommon case is here reported of a 51-year-old male with chronic myeloid leukemia who developed vitreous hemorrhage due to imatinib after 9 months of treatment. CASE REPORT: A 51-year-old male with leukocytosis detected in the blood test examination was referred to the Hematology Department. The bone marrow biopsy result was compatible with chronic myeloid leukemia. Imatinib treatment (400 mg/day) was started. In the ninth month of imatinib treatment, the patient complained of a sudden decrease in vision. Vitreous hemorrhage was detected in the left eye and the patient underwent surgery. Vitreous hemorrhage recurred 1 month after the operation. On the fourth day after the discontinuation of imatinib treatment, the patient's ophthalmic complaints improved significantly. The Naranjo algorithm was applied and a score of 9 was detected. The vitreous hemorrhage of the patient was attributed to imatinib, and so the treatment of the patient was switched to bosutinib. DISCUSSION: Imatinib is an oral signal inhibitor that targets tyrosine kinase for BCR/ABL, platelet-derived growth factor, stem cell factor, and c-kit (CD117). The conjunctiva and sclera have a large amount of c-kit positive mast cells which are inhibited by imatinib. The inhibition of c-kit positive mast cells by imatinib may be responsible for further exposure of the conjunctival mucosa to injuries.",,"['Yilmaz, Fatma', 'Albayrak, Murat', 'Tiglioglu, Pinar', 'Tiglioglu, Mesut', 'Saglam, Bugra', 'Reis Aras, Merih', 'Maral, Senem', 'Afacan Ozturk, Hacer Berna']","['Yilmaz F', 'Albayrak M', 'Tiglioglu P', 'Tiglioglu M', 'Saglam B', 'Reis Aras M', 'Maral S', 'Afacan Ozturk HB']","['University of Health Sciences, 146992Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Training and Research Hospital, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey.', 'University of Health Sciences, 146992Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Training and Research Hospital, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey.', 'University of Health Sciences, 146992Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Training and Research Hospital, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey.', 'University of Health Sciences, 146992Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Training and Research Hospital, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey.', 'University of Health Sciences, 146992Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Training and Research Hospital, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey.', 'University of Health Sciences, 146992Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Training and Research Hospital, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey.', 'University of Health Sciences, 146992Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Training and Research Hospital, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey.', 'University of Health Sciences, 146992Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Training and Research Hospital, Department of Hematology, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211113,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,IM,,2021/11/16 06:00,2021/11/16 06:00,['2021/11/15 05:34'],"['2021/11/15 05:34 [entrez]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/10781552211060730 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2021 Nov 13:10781552211060730. doi: 10.1177/10781552211060730.,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6112-3950', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4111-2004', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8342-990X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9161-5582', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4766-1861', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9386-7604']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Imatinib', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'vitreous hemorrhage']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we aimed to explore putative mechanisms of microRNA-155-5p (miR-155-5p) involvement in childhood ALL (cALL) via interactions with casitas B-lineage lymphoma (CBL), interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), and cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6). Bioinformatic analysis was performed initially to identify differentially expressed genes in cALL. The expression levels of miR-155-5p, CBL, IRF4, and CDK6 in peripheral blood lymphocytes from clinical ALL samples were determined using RT-qPCR and Western blot assays. A dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was used to ascertain a possible targeting relationship between miR-155-5p and CBL, CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry were used to measure cell activity and apoptosis of ALL cells. Co-IP was performed to investigate the interaction between CBL and IRF4 and the ubiquitination level of IRF4. Furthermore, in vivo validation was performed inducing xenograft tumor models with ALL cells in nude mice. As indicated by bioinformatic analysis, miR-155-5p and CDK6 were upregulated and CBL was downregulated in ALL. miR-155-5p was found to target CBL to inhibit CBL expression. miR-155-5p promoted the proliferation of ALL cells and inhibited their apoptosis by inhibiting the expression of CBL, which otherwise degraded IRF4 protein through ubiquitination, leading to inhibited CDK6 expression. Collectively, the results show that miR-155-5p can promote the development of cALL via the regulation on CBL-mediated IRF4/CDK6 axis.","['(c) 2021.

Defining the best treatment option remains controversial especially when choosing between intensive chemotherapy and hypomethylating agents. We set up a multicentric European database collecting data of 3 700 newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia patients >/=70 years. The primary objective was to compare overall survival in patients selected for intensive chemotherapy (n = 1199) or hypomethylating agents (n = 1073). With a median follow-up of 49.5 months, the median overall survival was 10.9 (95% CI: 9.7-11.6) and 9.2 months (95% CI: 8.3-10.2) with chemotherapy and hypomethylating agents, respectively. Complete remission or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery was 56.1% and 19.7% with chemotherapy and hypomethylating agents, respectively (P < 0.0001). Treatment effect on overall survival was time-dependent. The Royston and Parmar model showed that patients treated with hypomethylating agents had a significantly lower risk of death before 1.5 months of follow-up; no significant difference between 1.5 and 4.0 months, whereas patients treated with intensive chemotherapy had a significantly better overall survival from four months after start of therapy.

We studied 123 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed AML undergoing high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT)/autologous HCT in CR1. In relapsing patients afterwards, we analyzed salvage treatments and outcomes focusing particularly on salvage allogeneic HCT. Of 123 patients, 64 (52%) relapsed after autologous HCT. Subsequently, 13 (21%) received palliative therapy, whereas 51 (79%) proceeded to salvage therapy with a curative intent. Of the 47 patients with a curative intent and who did not proceed directly to allogeneic HCT, 23 (49%) achieved CR2 or had ongoing hematologic CR1 despite molecular relapse. Finally, 30 patients (47%) received allogeneic HCT with estimated 3-year leukemia-free and overall survival rates of 33% and 43%.

Most cases fall within the WHO unclassifiable myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN-U) category. The uniformly dismal outcomes warrant better understanding of this entity. We undertook a multi-institutional retrospective study of 92 adult MDS/MPN-U cases from eight institutions. Twenty-nine (32%) patients had isolated i(17q) [MDS/MPN-i(17q)]. Compared to MDS/MPN without i(17q), MDS/MPN-i(17q) patients were significantly younger, had lower platelet and absolute neutrophil counts, and higher frequency of splenomegaly and circulating blasts. MDS/MPN-i(17q) cases showed frequent bilobed neutrophils (75% vs. 23%; P = 0.03), hypolobated megakaryocytes (62% vs. 20%; P = 0.06), and a higher frequency of SETBP1 (69% vs. 5%; P = 0.002) and SRSF2 (63% vs. 5%; P = 0.006) mutations that were frequently co-existent (44% vs. 0%; P = 0.01). TP53 mutations were rare. The mutation profile of MDS/MPN-U-i(17q) was similar to other myeloid neoplasms with i(17q) including atypical chronic myeloid leukemia, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis, myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia, with frequent concomitant SETBP1/SRSF2 mutations observed across all the diagnostic entities. Over a median follow-up of 52 months, patients with MDS/MPN-i(17q) showed a shorter median overall survival (11 vs. 28 months; P < 0.001). The presence of i(17q) retained independent poor prognostic value in multivariable Cox-regression analysis [HR 3.686 (1.17-11.6); P = 0.026] along with splenomegaly. We suggest that MDS/MPN-i(17q) warrants recognition as a distinct subtype within the MDS/MPN-U category based on its unique clinico-biologic features and uniformly poor prognosis.","['(c) 2021.

Therefore, the selection of optimal T cells, cell manufacturing, and therapeutic T cell engineering are essential for the development of effective adoptive T cell therapies for AML. Autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have been in clinical trials to treat solid malignancies. Herein, we assessed whether TILs can be isolated from the bone marrow (BM) of AML patients, expanded ex vivo and utilized as a novel therapeutic strategy for AML. To this end, firstly we analyzed the immunophenotypes of a series of primary BM samples from AML patients (N = 10) by flow cytometry. We observed a variable amount of CD3+ TILs (range approximately 2.3- approximately 32.6% of mononuclear cells) among BM samples. We then developed a novel protocol that produced a three-log ex vivo expansion of TILs isolated from AML patient BM (N = 10) and peripheral blood (PB) (N = 10), including from patients with a low number of CD3+ T cells, within 3, 4 weeks. Further, we identified previously described naive T cells (CCR7+CD95-/or CD62L+CD45RA+) in AML BM and PB samples, which seemed to be required for a successful TILs ex vivo expansion. Finally, we showed that the expanded TILs could: (1) cause cytotoxicity to autologous AML blasts ex vivo (90.6% in control without T cell treatment vs. 1.89% in experimental groups with PB derived T cells and 1.77% in experimental groups with BM derived TILs, p < 0.01), (2) be genetically engineered to express CYP27B1 gene, and (3) infiltrate the BM and reside in close proximity to pre-injected autologous AML blasts of engrafted immunodeficiency mice. Altogether, these results provide a rationale for further studies of the therapeutic use of TILs in AML.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

Results of a phase III randomized trial of nonmyeloablative transplantation for adults with high-risk hematologic malignancies with 2 umbilical cord blood (UCB) units (n = 183) or HLA-haploidentical relative bone marrow (Haplo-BM; n = 154) revealed a 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) of 41% after Haplo-BM transplantation and 35% after 2-unit UCB transplantation (P = .41), with overall survival (OS) of 57% and 46%, respectively (P = .04). We sought to examine the generalizability of BMT CTN 1101 to a contemporaneous cohort beyond the trial's prespecified 2-year outcomes. All transplantations were performed between June 2012 and June 2018 in the United States. We hypothesized that the results of a rigorous phase III randomized trial would be generalizable. Changes in graft selection for HLA-haploidentical relative transplantation during the trial period allowed comparison of outcomes after transplantation with Haplo-BM with those after haploidentical peripheral blood (Haplo-PB). The trial's broad eligibility criteria were applied to the data source of the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research to select nontrial subjects. Extended follow-up of trial subjects was obtained from this data source. Three separate analyses were performed: (1) trial subjects beyond the trial's 2-year endpoint; (2) comparison of trial subjects with a contemporaneous cohort of nontrial subjects (195 2-unit UCB, 358 Haplo-BM, and 403 Haplo-PB); and (3) comparison of nontrial subjects by donor and graft type. Multivariate analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazards models for comparison of outcomes by treatment groups. With longer follow-up of the trial cohorts, 5-year PFS (37% versus 29%; P = .08) and OS (42% versus 36%; P = .06) were not significantly different between the treatment groups. We then compared the trial results with outcomes of comparable real-world transplantations. Five-year OS did not differ between trial and nontrial 2-unit UCB transplantations (36% versus 41%; P = .48) or between trial and nontrial Haplo-BM transplantations (42% versus 47%; P = .80), confirming generalizability. The randomized trial did not accrue as planned and therefore lacked the statistical power to detect a 15% difference in PFS. With substantially larger numbers of nontrial Haplo-BM transplantations, 5-year survival was higher after nontrial Haplo-BM compared with trial 2-unit UCB (47% versus 36%; P = .012). Nontrial patients who underwent Haplo-PB transplantation had higher 5-year survival (54%) compared with trial Haplo-BM (hazard ratio [HR], 0.76; P = .044) and nontrial Haplo-BM (HR, 0.78; P = .026). Similarly, survival was better after Haplo-PB compared with trial UCB (HR, 0.57; P < .0001) and nontrial UCB (HR, 0.63; P = .0002).

Previous single-center studies using in silico algorithms to quantitively measure HLA disparity have shown an association of the number of HLA molecular mismatches with relapse protection and/or increased risk of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in haplo-HSCT. However, inconsistent results from small studies have made it difficult to understand the full clinical impact of molecular mismatch in haplo-HSCT. In this study, we investigated the potential of the HLA class I and II mismatched eplet (ME) score measured by HLAMatchmaker, as well as ME load at a specific locus to predict outcomes in a registry-based cohort of haplo-HSCT recipients. We analyzed data from 1287 patients who underwent their first haplo-HSCT for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome between 2013 and 2017, as entered in the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research database. ME load at each HLA locus and total class I and II were scored using the HLAMatchmaker module incorporated in HLA Fusion software v4.3, which identifies predicted eplets based on the crystalized HLA molecule models and identifies ME by comparing donor and recipient eplets. In the study cohort, ME scores derived from total HLA class I or class II loci or individual HLA loci were not associated with overall survival, disease-free survival, nonrelapse mortality, relapse, acute GVHD, or chronic GVHD (P < .01). An unexpected strong association was identified between total class II ME load in the GVH direction and slower neutrophil engraftment (hazard ratio [HR], 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 0.91; P < .0001) and platelet engraftment (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.88; P < .0001). This was likely attributable to ME load at the HLA-DRB1 locus, which was similarly associated with slower neutrophil engraftment (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.73 to 0.92; P = .001) and slower platelet engraftment (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.84; P < .0001). Additional analyses suggested that this effect is attributable to a match versus a mismatch in the graft-versus-host direction and not to ME load, as a dose effect was not identified. These findings contradict those of previous relatively small studies reporting an association between ME load, as quantified by HLAMatchmaker, and haplo-HSCT outcomes. This study failed to demonstrate the predictive value of ME from HLA molecules for major clinical outcomes, and other molecular mismatch algorithms in haplo-HSCT settings should be tested.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.', 'All rights reserved.']","['Zou, Jun', 'Wang, Tao', 'He, Meilun', 'Bolon, Yung-Tsi', 'Gadalla, Shahinaz M', 'Marsh, Steven G E', 'Kuxhausen, Michelle', 'Gale, Robert Peter', 'Sharma, Akshay', 'Assal, Amer', 'Prestidge, Tim', 'Aljurf, Mahmoud', 'Cerny, Jan', 'Paczesny, Sophie', 'Spellman, Stephen R', 'Lee, Stephanie J', 'Ciurea, Stefan O']","['Zou J', 'Wang T', 'He M', 'Bolon YT', 'Gadalla SM', 'Marsh SGE', 'Kuxhausen M', 'Gale RP', 'Sharma A', 'Assal A', 'Prestidge T', 'Aljurf M', 'Cerny J', 'Paczesny S', 'Spellman SR', 'Lee SJ', 'Ciurea SO']","['Division of Pathology/Laboratory Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.

In this report, we identified a thiourea derivative compound, 147B3, that inhibits the infection of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in fibroblasts and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in Vero cells at a 50% effective concentration of 0.5 muM and 1.9 muM, respectively. Characterization of the compound provided the following clues regarding its mode of action. 1) Time-of-addition and block-release assays showed that 147B3 behaved similarly to ganciclovir. 2) 147B3 reduced the expression of early and late but not immediate-early gene products and the accumulation of viral genomic DNA in both HCMV-infected and HSV-1-infected cells. 3) 147B3 inhibited the HCMV IE2-dependent activation of viral early gene promoters. 4) Four HSV-1 clones resistant to 147B3 were isolated and next-generation sequencing analysis of their genome DNA revealed that all of them had a mutation(s) in the infected cell protein 4 (ICP4) gene, which encodes a viral transcriptional factor. 5) Although 147B3 did not reduce the amount of ICP4 in an immunoblotting analysis, it changed the localization of the ICP4 from the speckles in the nuclei to diffused dots in the cytoplasm. 6) 147B3 did not affect the localization of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies.

Here we show that imatinib binds to a secondary, allosteric site located in the myristoyl pocket of Abl to function as an activator of the kinase activity. Abl transitions between an assembled, inhibited state and an extended, activated state. The equilibrium is regulated by the conformation of the alphaIota helix, which is located nearby the allosteric pocket. Imatinib binding to the allosteric pocket elicits an alphaIota helix conformation that is not compatible with the assembled state, thereby promoting the extended state and stimulating the kinase activity. Although in wild-type Abl the catalytic pocket has a much higher affinity for imatinib than the allosteric pocket does, the two binding affinities are comparable in Abl variants carrying imatinib-resistant mutations in the catalytic site. A previously isolated imatinib-resistant mutation in patients appears to be mediating its function by increasing the affinity of imatinib for the allosteric pocket, providing a hitherto unknown mechanism of drug resistance. Our results highlight the benefit of combining imatinib with allosteric inhibitors to maximize their inhibitory effect on Bcr-Abl.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

In fit patients, fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) has the advantage of achieving undetectable measurable residual disease (MRD) with time-limited treatment and prolonged treatment-free remissions with a plateau on the PFS curve, but have several limitations, most notably the inferior PFS and survival outcomes for patients with unmutated IGHV compared to ibrutinib + rituximab seen in the E1912 study and a risk for long-term toxicities such as therapy-related myeloid neoplasms. Given the nonoverlapping toxicity profile with CIT and its efficacy in patients with high risk genomics, ibrutinib is a potentially useful agent to combine with CIT, with the aim of achieving deep and durable remissions, with time-limited treatment. Three recent phase 2 studies have combined ibrutinib with chemoimmunotherapy, utilizing different approaches in terms of patient selection, sequencing and duration of therapy and choice of monoclonal antibody.

GILT is widely conserved even in plants and fungi as well as animals. The thiolreductase active site of mammalian GILT is composed of a CXXC amino acid motif, whereas the C-terminal cysteine residue is changed to serine in arthropods including shrimps, crabs, and flies. GILT from Penaeus monodon (PmGILT) also has the CXXS motif instead of the CXXC active site. We demonstrate here that a human GILT mutant (GILT C75S) with the CXXS motif and PmGILT significantly inhibit amphotropic murine leukemia virus vector infection in human cells without alterning its expression level and lysosomal localization, showing that the C-terminal cysteine residue of the active site is not required for the antiviral activity. We have reported that human GILT suppresses HIV-1 particle production by digestion of disulfide bonds on CD63. However, GILT C75S mutant and PmGILT did not digest CD63 disulfide bonds, and had no effect on HIV-1 virion production, suggesting that they do not have thiolreductase activity. Taken together, this study found that antiviral activity, but not thiolreductase activity, is conserved in arthropod GILT proteins. This finding provides a new insight that the common function of GILT is antiviral activity in many animals.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

To promote the participation of farmers in BLV infection control in Japan, it is important to provide estimates of the economic losses caused by this infection. We hypothesized that decreased immune function due to BLV infection would increase visceral abnormalities, in turn reducing carcass weight. We employed mediation analysis to estimate the annual economic loss due to carcass weight reduction caused by BLV infection. Culled Holstein cows from 12 commercial dairy farms in the Nemuro and Kushiro regions of Hokkaido, Japan, were traced. Information on age and the last delivery day were collected. A non-infected culled cow was defined as a cow from which BLV provirus was not detected. A high-proviral-load (H-PVL) cow was defined as a cow whose PVL titer was above 2465 copies/50 ng DNA or 56,765 copies/10(5) cells. A BLV-infected cow with PVL titer lower than the thresholds was categorized as low-proviral load (L-PVL). Post-mortem examination results for culled cows were collected from a meat inspection center. The hypothesis was tested by three models, using data from 222 culled dairy cows. Model 1, a generalized linear mixed-effects model, selected carcass weight as an outcome variable, BLV status and the potential confounders (lactation stage and age) as explanatory variables, and herd as a random effect. Model 2 additionally included the number of abnormal findings in the post-mortem examination (AFPE) as an explanatory variable. Model 3 applied a Bayesian generalized linear mixed model, which employed a mediator separately modeled for AFPE, to estimate the amount of direct, indirect, and total carcass weight loss with adjustment for known confounding factors. Compared to the mean carcass weight for the non-infected culled cows, the carcass weight for H-PVL culled cows was significantly decreased by 30.4 kg on average. For each increase of one in the number of AFPE, the mean carcass weight was decreased by 8.6 kg. Only the indirect effect of BLV H-PVL status on carcass weight loss through AFPE was significant, accounting for 21.6 % of the total effect on carcass weight reduction. In 2017, 73,650 culled dairy cows were slaughtered in Hokkaido, and the economic loss due to carcass weight loss caused by BLV infection that year was estimated to be US $1,391,649. In summary, unlike L-PVL cows, H-PVL status was associated with carcass weight reduction, which was partially mediated by an increase in the number of visceral abnormalities.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors.

Patients who achieve a remission after refractory or relapsed disease as well as elderly patients have a very high rate of relapse even if they achieve a complete remission. A phase 3 randomized ECOG-ACRIN-led intergroup study was conducted to determine whether post-remission therapy with the farnesyl transferase inhibitor, tipifarnib (R115777), improved the disease-free survival (DFS) of adult patients with AML in complete remission (CR), at high risk for relapse. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adult patients with AML in remission after salvage therapy and/or over age 60 in first remission were enrolled in this study. They were randomly assigned to treatment with tipifarnib or observation (control). The primary objective was to compare the disease-free survival (DFS) between the two arms based on intention to treat, which includes all randomized patients. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-four patients were enrolled on the study. Median DFS was 8.9 vs 5.3 months, for tipifarnib vs observation (one-sided p = 0.026) and did not cross the pre-specified boundary to call the study positive. For the 134 eligible patients, median DFS was 10.8 vs 5.3 months for those randomized to tipifarnib vs observation (one-sided p = 0.008). Moreover in an ad hoc evaluation of all women (n = 71) median DFS was 12.1 vs 3.9 months for tipifarnib vs observation (one-sided p = 0.0004) while median OS was 26.5 vs 8.4 months respectively (one-sided p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study was not able to demonstrate a benefit to tipifarnib as maintenance therapy in patients with AML in remission. While subsets of patients may indeed benefit, additional studies would be needed to elucidate that benefit which is unlikely given that other seemingly better options have since become available.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The influence of underlying disease on rituximab pharmacokinetics has never been investigated for several cancer and non-cancer diseases simultaneously. This study aimed at assessing this influence using an integrated semi-mechanistic model accounting for target-mediated elimination of rituximab. METHODS: Rituximab concentration-time data from five studies previously published in patients with CLL, DLBCL, FL, RA, and AAV were described using a two-compartment model with irreversible binding of rituximab to its target antigen. Both underlying disease and target antigen measurements were assessed as covariates. RESULTS: Central volume of distribution was [95% confidence interval] 1.7-fold [1.6-1.9] higher in DLBCL than in RA, FL, and CLL, and it was 1.8-fold [1.6-2.1] higher in RA, FL, and CLL than in AAV. First-order elimination rate constants were 1.8-fold [1.7-2.0] and 1.3-fold [1.2-1.5] higher in RA, DLBCL, and FL than in CLL and AAV, respectively. Baseline latent antigen level (L0) was 54-fold [30-94], 20-fold [11-36], and 29-fold [14-64] higher in CLL, DLBCL, and FL, respectively, than in RA and AAV. In lymphoma, L0 increased with baseline total metabolic tumor volume (p = 6.10(-7)). In CLL, the second-order target-mediated elimination rate constant (kdeg) increased with baseline CD20 count on circulating B cells (CD20cir, p = 0.0081). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show for the first time that rituximab pharmacokinetics is strongly influenced by underlying disease and disease activity. Notably, neoplasms are associated with higher antigen amounts that result in decreased exposure to rituximab compared to inflammatory diseases. Our model might be used to estimate unbound target amounts in upcoming studies.","['(c) 2021.

Patients with MPN have shortened survival and an inherent risk for leukemic evolution. Prognostically relevant clinical and genetic parameters have been incorporated into mutation-enhanced scoring systems (MIPSS70-plus version 2.0, MIPSS-ET/PV). In the current review, we describe clinical and pathological features along with prognostic significance of MPN with monocytosis. RECENT FINDINGS: Monocytosis, defined by an absolute monocyte count (AMC) >/= 1 x 10 (9)/L, is a typical manifestation of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) but is also associated with 21% and 17% of PV and PMF patients, respectively. Recent studies on the subject have reported that MPN patients with monocytosis are older and present with concomitant leukocytosis. In regard to PV, patients with monocytosis harbor unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities including +8, 7/7q, i(17q), 5/5q-,12p-, inv(3), or 11q23 rearrangement and SRSF2 mutations, whereas PMF patients with monocytosis had significant thrombocytopenia, higher circulating blasts, higher symptom burden, and ASXL1 mutations. Moreover, presence of monocytosis predicted inferior survival in both PV and PMF. Monocytosis in MPN is associated with a distinct clinical and genetic profile and may serve as a marker of aggressive disease biology.","['(c) 2021.

We investigated its expression profile in neuroblastoma (NB), its association with NB clinical outcomes, and its influence in the regulation of cancer stem cells' (CSCs) stemness maintenance. RNA-Seq data mining (22 independent study cohorts, total n = 3836) indicated that high CD73 can predict good NB prognosis. CD73 expression (immunohistochemistry) gauged in an NB patient cohort (n = 87) showed a positive correlation with longer overall survival (OS, P = 0.0239) and relapse-free survival (RFS, P = 0.0242). Similarly, high CD73 correlated with longer OS and RFS in advanced disease stages, MYCN non-amplified (MYCN-na), and Stage-4-MYCN-na subsets. Despite no definite association in children < 2 years old (2Y), high CD73 correlated with longer OS (P = 0.0294) and RFS (P = 0.0315) in children > 2Y. Consistently, high CD73 was associated with better OS in MYCN-na, high-risk, and stage-4 subsets of children > 2Y. Multivariate analysis identified CD73 as an independent (P = 0.001) prognostic factor for NB. Silencing CD73 in patient-derived (stage 4, progressive disease) CHLA-171 and CHLA-172 cells revealed cell-line-independent activation of 58 CSC stemness maintenance molecules (QPCR profiling). Overexpressing CD73 in CHLA-20 and CHLA-90 cells with low CD73 and silencing in CHLA-171 and CHLA-172 cells with high CD73 showed that CD73 regulates epithelial to mesenchymal transition (E-Cadherin, N-Cadherin, Vimentin), stemness maintenance (Sox2, Nanog, Oct3/4), self-renewal capacity (Notch), and differentiation inhibition (leukemia inhibitory factor, LIF) proteins (confocal-immunofluorescence). These results demonstrate that high CD73 can predict good prognosis in NB, and further suggest that CD73 regulates stemness maintenance in cells that defy clinical therapy.","['(c) 2021.

PROCEDURES: Subjects (N = 408) were children and adolescents born in the health systems and enrolled for at least 120 days after the date of the first leukemia ICD-9-CM code or tumor registry diagnosis. The gold standard was the health system tumor registry and/or medical record review. We calculated positive predictive value (PPV) and sensitivity by number of ICD-9-CM codes received in the 120-day period following and including the first code. We evaluated whether adding chemotherapy and/or bone marrow biopsy/aspiration procedure codes improved PPV and/or sensitivity. RESULTS: Requiring receipt of one or more codes resulted in 99% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI]: 98-100%) but poor PPV (70%; 95% CI: 66-75%). Receipt of two or more codes improved PPV to 90% (95% CI: 86-93%) with 96% sensitivity (95% CI: 93-98%). Requiring at least four codes maximized PPV (95%; 95% CI: 92-98%) without sacrificing sensitivity (93%; 95% CI: 89-95%). Across health plans, PPV for four codes ranged from 84-100% and sensitivity ranged from 83-95%. Including at least one code for a bone marrow procedure or chemotherapy treatment had minimal impact on PPV or sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: The use of diagnosis codes from the electronic health record has high PPV and sensitivity for identifying leukemia in children and adolescents if more than one code is required.",['(c) 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Weinmann, Sheila', 'Francisco, Melanie C', 'Kwan, Marilyn L', 'Bowles, Erin J A', 'Rahm, Alanna Kulchak', 'Greenlee, Robert T', 'Stout, Natasha K', 'Pole, Jason D', 'Kushi, Lawrence H', 'Smith-Bindman, Rebecca', 'Miglioretti, Diana L']","['Weinmann S', 'Francisco MC', 'Kwan ML', 'Bowles EJA', 'Rahm AK', 'Greenlee RT', 'Stout NK', 'Pole JD', 'Kushi LH', 'Smith-Bindman R', 'Miglioretti DL']","['Center for Health Research, Kaiser Permanente Northwest, Portland, Oregon, USA.', 'Center for Integrated Health Research, Kaiser Permanente Hawaii, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA.', 'Center for Health Research, Kaiser Permanente Northwest, Portland, Oregon, USA.', 'Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, California, USA.', 'Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute, Kaiser Permanente Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Center for Health Research, Genomic Medicine Institute, Geisinger Health System, Danville, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Marshfield Clinic Research Institute, Marshfield Clinic Health System, Marshfield, Wisconsin, USA.', 'Department of Population Medicine, Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'ICES, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Centre for Health Services Research, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, California, USA.', 'Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, California, USA.', 'The Philip R.

The progression of MDS to severe cytopenias and/or overt leukemia is associated with the accumulation of additional cytogenetic abnormalities, suggesting clonal evolution. The impact of these accumulated abnormalities on myeloid maturation and the severity of the disease is poorly understood. METHODS: Bone marrow specimens from 16 patients with cytogenetic abnormalities were flow cytometrically sorted into three myeloid populations: progenitors, immature myeloid cells, and mature myeloid cells. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was performed on each to determine the distribution of chromosomal abnormalities during myeloid maturation. RESULTS: Our findings revealed three distinct distributions of cytogenetic abnormalities across myeloid maturation, each of which corresponded to specific cytogenetic abnormalities. Group 1 had continuous distribution across all maturational stages and contained patients with a single cytogenetic aberration associated with good-to-intermediate prognosis; Group 2 had accumulation of abnormalities in immature cells and contained patients with high-risk monosomy 7; and Group 3 had abnormalities defining the founding clone equally distributed across maturational stages while subclonal abnormalities were enriched in progenitor cells and contained patients with multiple, non-monosomy 7, abnormalities with evidence of clonal evolution. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that low-risk abnormalities (e.g., del(20q) and trisomy 8) occurring in the founding clone display a markedly different disease etiology, with respect to myeloid maturation, than monosomy 7 or abnormalities acquired in subclones, which result in a disruption of myeloid cell maturation in MDS.",['(c) 2021 International Clinical Cytometry Society.'],"['Cutler, Jevon A', 'Pugsley, Haley R', 'Bennington, Richard', 'Fritschle, Wayne', 'Hartmann, Luise', 'Zaidi, Nigar', 'Menssen, Andrew J', 'Singleton, Timothy P', 'Xu, Dongbin', 'Loken, Michael R', 'Wells, Denise A', 'Brodersen, Lisa Eidenschink', 'Zehentner, Barbara K']","['Cutler JA', 'Pugsley HR', 'Bennington R', 'Fritschle W', 'Hartmann L', 'Zaidi N', 'Menssen AJ', 'Singleton TP', 'Xu D', 'Loken MR', 'Wells DA', 'Brodersen LE', 'Zehentner BK']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Luminex Corporation, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Hematologics Inc., Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Hematologics Inc., Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Hematologics Inc., Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Hematologics Inc., Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Hematologics Inc., Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Hematologics Inc., Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Hematologics Inc., Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Hematologics Inc., Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Hematologics Inc., Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Hematologics Inc., Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Hematologics Inc., Seattle, Washington, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211113,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

Although acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has a lower risk of IFI than does AML, the incidences of IFI in both AML and ALL in the era of antimold prophylaxis should be re-evaluated. We analyzed adults with AML or ALL who had undergone induction, re-induction, or consolidation chemotherapy from January 2017 to December 2019 at Seoul National University Hospital. Their clinical characteristics during each chemotherapy episode were reviewed, and cases with proven or probable diagnoses were regarded as positive for IFI. Of 552 episodes (393 in AML and 159 in ALL), 40 (7.2%) were IFI events. Of the IFI episodes, 8.1% (12/148) and 5.9% (13/220) (P = 0.856) occurred in cases of ALL without antimold prophylaxis and AML with antimold prophylaxis, respectively. After adjusting for clinical factors, a lack of antimold prophylaxis (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 3.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.35-9.22; P = 0.010) and a longer duration of neutropenia (per one day, aOR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04; P = 0.001) were independently associated with IFI. In conclusion, the incidence of IFI in ALL without antimold prophylaxis was not lower than that in AML. A lack of antimold prophylaxis and prolonged neutropenia were independent risk factors for IFI. Clinicians should be on guard for detecting IFI in patients with ALL, especially those with risk factors.",['(c) 2021.

Although apoptosis is a cell-autonomous process, apoptotic cells communicate with their environment in different ways. Here we describe a mechanism whereby cells under apoptotic stress can promote survival of neighbouring cells. We find that upon apoptotic stress, cells release the growth factor FGF2, leading to MEK-ERK-dependent transcriptional upregulation of pro-survival BCL-2 proteins in a non-cell autonomous manner. This transient upregulation of pro-survival BCL-2 proteins protects neighbouring cells from apoptosis. Accordingly, we find in certain cancer types a correlation between FGF-signalling, BCL-2 expression and worse prognosis. In vivo, upregulation of MCL-1 occurs in an FGF-dependent manner during skin repair, which regulates healing dynamics. Importantly, either co-treatment with FGF-receptor inhibitors or removal of apoptotic stress restores apoptotic sensitivity to cytotoxic therapy and delays wound healing. These data reveal a pathway by which cells under apoptotic stress can increase resistance to cell death in surrounding cells. Beyond mediating cytotoxic drug resistance, this process also provides a potential link between tissue damage and repair.",['(c) 2021.

However, the therapeutic efficacy of statins in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has not yet been demonstrated. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the outcomes of 408 CML patients who underwent imatinib therapy. The deep molecular response rates in patients treated with the statin/TKI combination were significantly higher than those in patients treated with TKI alone (p = 0.0016). The statin/TKI combination exerted potent cytotoxic effects against wild-type and ABL1 mutant CML, BaF3, and K562/T315I mutant cells. Furthermore, the statin/TKI combination additively inhibited the colony-forming capacity of murine CML-KLS(+) cells in vitro. In addition, we examined the additive growth-inhibitory effects of the statin/tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) combination against CML patient-derived CD34(+) cells. The growth-inhibitory effects of the statin/imatinib combination against CD34(+)/CML primary cells were higher than those against CD34(+)/Norm cells (p = 0.005), suggesting that the combination of rosuvastatin and imatinib exerted growth-inhibitory effects against CML CD34(+) cells, but not against normal CD34(+) cells. Furthermore, results from RNA sequencing of control and statin-treated cells suggested that statins inhibited c-Myc-mediated and hematopoietic cell differentiation pathways. Thus, statins can be potentially repurposed to improve treatment outcomes in CML patients when combined with TKI therapy.",,"['Jang, Hyeok-Jae', 'Woo, Young-Min', 'Naka, Kazuhito', 'Park, Jong-Ho', 'Han, Ho-Jae', 'Kim, Hee-Jin', 'Kim, Sun-Hee', 'Ahn, Jae-Sook', 'Kim, Taehyung', 'Kimura, Shinya', 'Zarabi, Sarah', 'Lipton, Jeffrey H', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Jung, Chul-Won', 'Kim, Hyeoung-Joon', 'Kim, Jong-Won', 'Kim, Dennis Dong Hwan']","['Jang HJ', 'Woo YM', 'Naka K', 'Park JH', 'Han HJ', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim SH', 'Ahn JS', 'Kim T', 'Kimura S', 'Zarabi S', 'Lipton JH', 'Minden MD', 'Jung CW', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim JW', 'Kim DDH']","['Department of Health Sciences and Technology, Samsung Advanced Institute for Health Sciences and Technology, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul 06351, Korea.', 'Department of Health Sciences and Technology, Samsung Advanced Institute for Health Sciences and Technology, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul 06351, Korea.', 'Department of Stem Cell Biology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan.', 'Clinical Genomics Center, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul 06351, Korea.', 'Department of Health Sciences and Technology, Samsung Advanced Institute for Health Sciences and Technology, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul 06351, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Genetics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul 06351, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Genetics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul 06351, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Chonnam National University School of Medicine, Hwasun 58128, Korea.', 'Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 2E4, Canada.', 'The Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 3E1, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Oncology & Hematology, Saga University School of Medicine, Saga 840-8502, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology & Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON M5G 2M9, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Oncology & Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON M5G 2M9, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Oncology & Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON M5G 2M9, Canada.', 'Ontario Cancer Institute, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON M5G 2M9, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul 06351, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Chonnam National University School of Medicine, Hwasun 58128, Korea.', 'Department of Health Sciences and Technology, Samsung Advanced Institute for Health Sciences and Technology, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul 06351, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Genetics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul 06351, Korea.', 'Department of Medical Oncology & Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON M5G 2M9, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211104,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,2021/11/14 06:00,2021/11/14 06:01,['2021/11/13 01:15'],"['2021/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/29 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/13 01:15 [entrez]', '2021/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/14 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13215543 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13215543 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Nov 4;13(21). pii: cancers13215543. doi: 10.3390/cancers13215543.,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-4875-6627', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6646-6004']",['NRF-2019R1A2C2002177/National Research Foundation of Korea'],PMC8582667,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'combination therapy', 'drug resistance', 'statin', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is the receptor for two CC chemokine ligands, CCL17 and CCL22. Originally, the expression of CCR4 was described as highly selective for helper T type 2 (Th2) cells. Later, its expression was extended to other T cell subsets such as regulatory T (Treg) cells and Th17 cells. CCR4 has long been regarded as a potential therapeutic target for allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis and bronchial asthma. Furthermore, the findings showing that CCR4 is strongly expressed by T cell malignancies such as adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and cutaneous T cell lymphomas (CTCLs) have led to the development and clinical application of the fully humanized and glyco-engineered monoclonal anti-CCR4 Mogamulizumab in refractory/relapsed ATLL and CTCLs with remarkable successes. However, Mogamulizumab often induces severe adverse events in the skin possibly because of its efficient depletion of Treg cells. In particular, treatment with Mogamulizumab prior to allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), the only curative option of these T cell malignancies, often leads to severe glucocorticoid-refractory graft-versus-host diseases. The efficient depletion of Treg cells by Mogamulizumab has also led to its clinical trials in advanced solid tumors singly or in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) are the most common and are considered an AIDS-defining cancer (ADC). Although Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is not considered an ADC, its incidence is also increased in PLWH. Among all HIV-related lymphomas (HRL), the prevalence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is high. It has been shown that EBV is involved in different lymphomagenic mechanisms mediated by some of its proteins, contributing to the development of different lymphoma subtypes. Additionally, cooperation between both HIV and EBV can lead to the proliferation of aberrant B-cells, thereby being an additional lymphomagenic mechanism in EBV-associated HRL. Despite the close relationship between EBV and HRL, the impact of EBV on clinical aspects has not been extensively studied. These lymphomas are treated with the same therapeutic regimens as the general population in combination with cART. Nevertheless, new therapeutic strategies targeting EBV are promising for these lymphomas. In this article, the different types of HRL are extensively reviewed, focusing on the influence of EBV on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and pathological characteristics of each lymphoma subtype.

Indeed, chemotherapy still has to take into account the possibility that leukemia-initiating cells may have a distinct chemosensitivity profile compared to the bulk of the tumor, and therefore are spared by the current treatment, causing the relapse of the disease. Therefore, the identification of the cell-of-origin of leukemia remains a longstanding question and an exciting challenge in cancer research of the last few decades. With a particular focus on acute lymphoblastic leukemia, we present in this review the previous and current concepts exploring the phenotypic, genetic and functional heterogeneity in patients. We also discuss the benefits of using engineered mouse models to explore the early steps of leukemia development and to identify the biological mechanisms driving the emergence of leukemia-initiating cells.

We performed retrospective review of clinicopathologic and genomic information of 107 patients with TP53-mutated MDS. We assessed each mutation according to the phenotypic annotation of TP53 mutations (PHANTM) and analyzed the associations between predicted TP53 mutant function, represented by the PHANTM combined phenotype score, and overall survival (OS) using the log rank test and Cox regression. Our results indicated that patients with PHANTM combined phenotype score above the median (>1) had significantly shorter OS compared to those with scores below the median (median OS: 10.59 and 16.51 months, respectively, p = 0.025). This relationship remained significant in multivariable analysis (HR (95%CI): 1.62 (1.01-2.58), p = 0.044) and identified to have an independent prognostic influence, accounting for known risk such as IPSS-R and other standard risk variables.

PPM1D-expressing mice developed tumors phenotypically and genetically similar to tumors in mice with dysfunctional p53. T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma was the most frequent cancer observed in these mice (55%) followed by adenocarcinomas (24%), leukemia (12%) and other solid tumors including neuroblastoma. Characterization of T-cell lymphomas in mice overexpressing PPM1D demonstrates Pten-deletion and p53-accumulation similar to mice with p53 loss-of-function. Also, Notch1 mutations which are recurrently observed in T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-ALL) were frequently detected in PPM1D-transgenic mice.

B-cell precursor ALLs (BCP-ALLs) are derived from the progenitors of B lymphocytes. Traditionally, risk factors stratifying therapy in ALL patients included age at diagnosis, initial leukocytosis, and the response to chemotherapy. Currently, treatment intensity is modified according to the presence of specific gene alterations in the leukemic genome. Raman imaging is a promising diagnostic tool, which enables the molecular characterization of cells and differentiation of subtypes of leukemia in clinical samples. This study aimed to characterize and distinguish cells isolated from the bone marrow of patients suffering from three subtypes of BCP-ALL, defined by gene rearrangements, i.e., BCR-ABL1&nbsp;(Philadelphia-positive, t(9;22)), TEL-AML1 (t(12;21)) and TCF3-PBX1 (t(1;19)), using single-cell Raman imaging combined with multivariate statistical analysis. Spectra collected from clinical samples were compared with single-cell spectra of B-cells collected from healthy donors, constituting the control group. We demonstrated that Raman spectra of normal B cells strongly differ from spectra of their malignant counterparts, especially in the intensity of bands, which can be assigned to nucleic acids.

Aberrant expression of the embryonal and lymphatic TCL1 family of oncogenes, i.e., the paradigmatic TCL1A, but also TML1 or MTCP1, is causally implicated in T- and B-lymphocyte transformation. TCL1A also carries prognostic information in these particular T-cell and B-cell tumors. More recently, the TCL1A oncogene has been observed also in epithelial tumors as part of oncofetal stemness signatures. Although the concepts on the modes of TCL1A dysregulation in lymphatic neoplasms and solid tumors are still incomplete, there are recent advances in defining the mechanisms of its (de)regulation. This review presents a comprehensive overview of TCL1A expression in tumors and the current understanding of its (dys)regulation via genomic aberrations, epigenetic modifications, or deregulation of TCL1A-targeting micro RNAs. We also summarize triggers that act through such transcriptional and translational regulation, i.e., altered signals by the tumor microenvironment. A refined mechanistic understanding of these modes of dysregulations together with improved concepts of TCL1A-associated malignant transformation can benefit future approaches to specifically interfere in TCL1A-initiated or -driven tumorigenesis.",,"['Stachelscheid, Johanna', 'Jiang, Qu', 'Herling, Marco']","['Stachelscheid J', 'Jiang Q', 'Herling M']","['Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology (CIO), Aachen-Bonn-Cologne-Duesseldorf, Excellence Cluster for Cellular Stress Response and Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne, 50931 Cologne, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology (CIO), Aachen-Bonn-Cologne-Duesseldorf, Excellence Cluster for Cellular Stress Response and Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne, 50931 Cologne, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology (CIO), Aachen-Bonn-Cologne-Duesseldorf, Excellence Cluster for Cellular Stress Response and Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne, 50931 Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Cellular Therapy, and Hemostaseology, University of Leipzig, 04103 Leipzig, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211029,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,2021/11/14 06:00,2021/11/14 06:01,['2021/11/13 01:15'],"['2021/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/26 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/13 01:15 [entrez]', '2021/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/14 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13215455 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13215455 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Oct 29;13(21). pii: cancers13215455. doi: 10.3390/cancers13215455.,['ORCID: 0000-0001-8517-7750'],"['70112788/German Cancer Aid', '[2017]3109/China Scholarship Council']",PMC8582492,['NOTNLM'],"['BPDCN', 'CLL', 'T-PLL', 'TCL1 oncogenes', 'kinase signaling', 'lymphoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite its clinical efficacy, relapses occur, and outcomes after ibrutinib failure are poor. Although BTK and PLCgamma2 mutations have been found to be associated with ibrutinib resistance in a fair percentage of CLL patients, no information on resistance mechanisms is available in patients lacking these mutations. The heat shock protein of 70 kDa (HSP70) and its transcription factor heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) play a role in mediating the survival and progression of CLL, as well as taking part in drug resistance in various cancers. We demonstrated that resveratrol and related phenols were able to induce apoptosis in vitro in leukemic cells from CLL untreated patients by acting on the HSP70/HSF1 axis. The same was achieved in cells recovered from 13 CLL patients failing in vivo ibrutinib treatment. HSP70 and HSF1 levels decreased following in vitro treatment, correlating to apoptosis induction. We suggest an involvement of HSP70/HSF1 axis in controlling resistance to ibrutinib in CLL cells, since their inhibition is effective in inducing in vitro apoptosis in cells from ibrutinib refractory patients. The targeting of HSP70/HSF1 axis could represent a novel rational therapeutic strategy for CLL, also for relapsing patients.",,"['Frezzato, Federica', 'Visentin, Andrea', 'Severin, Filippo', 'Pizzo, Serena', 'Ruggeri, Edoardo', 'Mouawad, Nayla', 'Martinello, Leonardo', 'Pagnin, Elisa', 'Trimarco, Valentina', 'Tonini, Alessia', 'Carraro, Samuela', 'Pravato, Stefano', 'Imbergamo, Silvia', 'Manni, Sabrina', 'Piazza, Francesco', 'Brunati, Anna Maria', 'Facco, Monica', 'Trentin, Livio']","['Frezzato F', 'Visentin A', 'Severin F', 'Pizzo S', 'Ruggeri E', 'Mouawad N', 'Martinello L', 'Pagnin E', 'Trimarco V', 'Tonini A', 'Carraro S', 'Pravato S', 'Imbergamo S', 'Manni S', 'Piazza F', 'Brunati AM', 'Facco M', 'Trentin L']","['Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Myeloma and Lymphoma Pathobiology, Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), 35129 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Myeloma and Lymphoma Pathobiology, Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), 35129 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Myeloma and Lymphoma Pathobiology, Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), 35129 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Myeloma and Lymphoma Pathobiology, Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), 35129 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Myeloma and Lymphoma Pathobiology, Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), 35129 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Padua University, 35121 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Myeloma and Lymphoma Pathobiology, Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), 35129 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua University School of Medicine, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Myeloma and Lymphoma Pathobiology, Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), 35129 Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211029,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,2021/11/14 06:00,2021/11/14 06:01,['2021/11/13 01:15'],"['2021/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/05 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/13 01:15 [entrez]', '2021/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/14 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13215453 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13215453 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Oct 29;13(21). pii: cancers13215453. doi: 10.3390/cancers13215453.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-7093-2493', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0271-7200', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8712-9656', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9439-4121', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0877-1099', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9535-0526', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4748-2601', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6804-0680', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2831-623X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0100-5789', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1222-6149']","['IG-25024/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro', 'N/A/Associazione Italiana Contro le Leucemie - Linfomi e Mieloma', '#IBR-I-17-GBL-009-V01/Janssen Research and Development', 'AV Fellowships/Ricerca per Credere nella Vita (RCV);

With the emergence of molecular techniques, such as next generation sequencing (NGS), a more sensitive assessment of molecular MRD markers is available. In recent years, the detection of MRD by molecular assays and its association with AML relapse and survival has been explored and verified in multiple studies. Although most studies show that the presence of MRD leads to a worse clinical outcome, molecular-based methods face several challenges including limited sensitivity/specificity, and a difficult distinction between mutations that are representative of AML rather than clonal hematopoiesis.

Among all the options, CAR (Chimeric antigen receptor)-based therapy has arisen as a new opportunity for refractory or relapsed hematological cancer patients. CARs were designed to be used along with T lymphocytes, creating CAR-T cells, but they are presenting such encouraging results that they are already in use as drugs. Nonetheless, their side-effects and the fact that it is not possible to infuse an allogenic CAR-T product without causing graft-versus-host-disease, have meant using a different cell source to solve these problems, such as Natural Killer (NK) cells.

We previously demonstrated that HP-beta-CyD disrupted cholesterol homeostasis, and inhibited the proliferation of leukemia cells by inducing apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest. Recently developed drug delivery systems using folic acid (FA) and folic acid receptors (FR) are currently being used in cancer treatment. To confer tumor cell-selectivity to HP-beta-CyD, we synthesized folate-appended HP-beta-CyD (FA-HP-beta-CyD) and evaluated the potential of FA-HP-beta-CyD as an anticancer agent using chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells in vitro and in vivo. FA-HP-beta-CyD inhibited the growth of FR-expressing cells but not that of FR-negative cells. FA-HP-beta-CyD had stronger anti-leukemia and cell-binding activities than HP-beta-CyD in CML cells. Unlike HP-beta-CyD, FA-HP-beta-CyD entered CML cells through endocytosis and induced both apoptosis and autophagy via mitophagy. FA-HP-beta-CyD increased the inhibitory effects of the ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors imatinib mesylate and ponatinib, which are commonly used in CML. In vivo experiments in a BCR-ABL leukemia mouse model showed that FA-HP-beta-CyD was more effective than HP-beta-CyD at a ten-fold lower dose.

The epidemiology of cancers linked to direct carcinogens (e.g., response to immunosuppression) differs from those cancers linked with indirect infectious interactions.

Most patients with AML respond to chemotherapy, but relapses often occur and infer a very poor prognosis. Thirty to thirty-five percent of AMLs carry a four base pair insertion in the nucleophosmin 1 gene (NPM1) with a C-terminal alternative reading frame of 11 amino acids. We previously identified various neopeptides from the alternative reading frame of mutant NPM1 (dNPM1) on primary AML and isolated an HLA-A*02:01-restricted T-cell receptor (TCR) that enables human T-cells to kill AML cells upon retroviral gene transfer. Here, we isolated T-cells recognizing the dNPM1 peptide AVEEVSLRK presented in HLA-A*11:01. The TCR cloned from a T-cell clone recognizing HLA-A*11:01+ primary AML cells conferred in vitro recognition and lysis of AML upon transfer to CD8 cells, but failed to induce an anti-tumor effect in immunodeficient NSG mice engrafted with dNPM1 OCI-AML3 cells. In conclusion, our data show that AVEEVSLRK is a dNPM1 neoantigen on HLA-A*11:01+ primary AMLs. CD8 cells transduced with an HLA-A*11:01-restricted TCR for dNPM1 were reactive against AML in vitro.

The non-mobile pericentromeric repetitive elements SST1 are hypomethylated in about 17% of human colorectal cancers (CRC) with some 5-7% exhibiting strong age-independent demethylation. We studied the frequency of genome doubling, a common event in solid tumors linked to aneuploidy, in randomly selected single cell clones of near-diploid LS174T human CRC cells differing in their level of SST1 demethylation. Near-diploid LS174T cells underwent frequent genome-doubling events generating near-tetraploid clones with lower levels of SST1 methylation. In primary CRC, strong SST1 hypomethylation was significantly associated with global genomic hypomethylation and mutations in TP53. This work uncovers the association of the naturally occurring demethylation of the SST1 pericentromeric repeat with the onset of spontaneous tetraploidization in human CRC cells in culture and with TP53 mutations in primary CRCs.

Recently, the contribution of further players, such as stromal and immune bone marrow (BM) microenvironment components, to AML onset and progression has been pointed out. In particular, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) steadily remodel the leukemic niche, not only favoring leukemic cell growth and development but also tuning their responsiveness to treatments. The list of mechanisms driven by MSCs to promote a leukemia drug-resistant phenotype has progressively expanded. Moreover, the relative proportion and the activation status of immune cells in the BM leukemic microenvironment may vary by influencing their reactivity against leukemic cells. In that, the capacity of the stroma to re-program immune cells, thus promoting and/or hampering therapeutic efficacy, is emerging as a crucial aspect in AML biology, adding an extra layer of complexity. Current treatments for AML have mainly focused on eradicating leukemia cells, with little consideration for the leukemia-damaged BM niche. Increasing evidence on the contribution of stromal and immune cells in response to therapy underscores the need to hold the mutual interplay, which takes place in the BM. A careful dissection of these interactions will help provide novel applications for drugs already under experimentation and open a wide array of opportunities for new drug discovery.",,"['Ciciarello, Marilena', 'Corradi, Giulia', 'Forte, Dorian', 'Cavo, Michele', 'Curti, Antonio']","['Ciciarello M', 'Corradi G', 'Forte D', 'Cavo M', 'Curti A']","['Istituto di Ematologia ""Seragnoli"", Via Massarenti 9, 40138 Bologna, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina Specialistica, Diagnostica e Sperimentale, Universita di Bologna, 40138 Bologna, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina Specialistica, Diagnostica e Sperimentale, Universita di Bologna, 40138 Bologna, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina Specialistica, Diagnostica e Sperimentale, Universita di Bologna, 40138 Bologna, Italy.', 'IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna, Istituto di Ematologia ""Seragnoli"", 40138 Bologna, Italy.', 'IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna, Istituto di Ematologia ""Seragnoli"", 40138 Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211022,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,2021/11/14 06:00,2021/11/14 06:01,['2021/11/13 01:14'],"['2021/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/20 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/13 01:14 [entrez]', '2021/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/14 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13215319 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13215319 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Oct 22;13(21). pii: cancers13215319. doi: 10.3390/cancers13215319.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-4744-507X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8443-605X']",,PMC8582363,['NOTNLM'],"['bone marrow microenvironment', 'chemotherapy resistance', 'hematology', 'immune microenvironment', 'mesenchymal stromal cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined whether myeloblasts could educate MPhis to adopt a protumoral orientation supporting myeloblast survival and resistance to therapy. Flow cytometry analyses demonstrated that M2-like CD163(+) MPhis are abundantly present, at diagnosis, in the bone marrow of AML patients. We showed that myeloblasts, or their conditioned medium, polarize monocytes to M2-like CD163(+) MPhis, induce the secretion of many protumoral factors, and promote myeloblast survival and proliferation as long as close intercellular contacts are maintained. Importantly, pharmacologic inhibition of the CSF1 receptor (CSF1R), in the presence of GM-CSF, reprogrammed MPhi polarization to an M1-like orientation, induced the secretion of soluble factors with antitumoral activities, reduced protumoral agonists, and promoted the apoptosis of myeloblasts interacting with MPhis. Furthermore, myeloblasts, which became resistant to venetoclax or midostaurin during their interplay with protumoral CD163(+) MPhis, regained sensitivity to these targeted therapies following CSF1R inhibition in the presence of GM-CSF. These data reveal a crucial role of CD163(+) MPhi interactions with myeloblasts that promote myeloblast survival and identify CSF1R inhibition as a novel target for AML therapy.",,"['Smirnova, Tatiana', 'Spertini, Caroline', 'Spertini, Olivier']","['Smirnova T', 'Spertini C', 'Spertini O']","['Service and Central Laboratory of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois, University of Lausanne, 1011 Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Service and Central Laboratory of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois, University of Lausanne, 1011 Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Service and Central Laboratory of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois, University of Lausanne, 1011 Lausanne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211021,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,2021/11/14 06:00,2021/11/14 06:01,['2021/11/13 01:14'],"['2021/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/04 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/13 01:14 [entrez]', '2021/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/14 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers13215289 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers13215289 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Oct 21;13(21). pii: cancers13215289. doi: 10.3390/cancers13215289.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-1669-9421'],"[""not applicable/Fond'Action contre le cancer"", 'not applicable/Fondation Dr Henri Dubois-Ferriere Dinu Lipatti']",PMC8582394,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'CD163', 'CSF1 receptor', 'GM-CSF', 'M-CSF', 'cytokines', 'drug resistance', 'macrophages', 'microenvironment', 'orientation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with a higher leukemia burden as determined by a higher total WBC, higher percentage of blasts in bone marrow, or higher percentage of blasts in peripheral blood (by hematopathology or immunophenotyping) did not have a higher incidence of CRS. There was an age difference between patients who did versus patients who did not develop CRS (72.9 +/- 1.6 years (Median 73.5 years) vs. 63.3 +/- 2.3 years (Median: 65.0 years), which was borderline significant (p = 0.04). Premedication with steroids did not eliminate the risk of CRS. Cytokine profiling in patients who developed CRS after APVO436 infusion indicates that the predominant cytokine in this inflammatory cytokine response was IL-6. APVO436-associated CRS was generally manageable with tocilizumab with or without dexamethasone. Notably, the development of CRS after APVO436 therapy did not appear to be associated with a response.

In this work, Gemcitabine magnetic nanoparticles were prepared using Fe3O4 and chitosan as the primary ingredients. Optimization was accomplished by Box-Behnken Design and factor interactions were evaluated. The desirability function approach was made to enhance the formulation concerning particle size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential. Based on this, optimized magnetic nanoparticles (O-MNP) were formulated with 300 mg of Fe3O4, 297.7 mg of chitosan, and a sonication time of 2.4 h, which can achieve the prerequisites of the target formulation. All other in vitro parameters were found to be following the requirement. In vitro cytotoxic studies for O-MNP were performed using cell cultures of breast cancer (MCF-7), leukemia (THP-1), prostate cancer (PC-3), and lung cancer (A549).

Patients completed a structured interview including a health literacy assessment, a Brief Medication Questionnaire, two single-item self-report adherence questions, and the Medications Adherence Reasons Scale. Of the 86 participants, 88.4% were white; 55.8% male; mean age, 58.7 years; and 22.1% had limited health literacy. Nonadherence (missing at least one dose in the last week) was reported by 18.6% of participants and associated (p < 0.003) with less-than-excellent perceived ability to take CML medications (16.3%). Black participants reported more difficulty taking CML medications than white participants (28.6% vs. 8.3%, p = 0.053). Among all participants, 43.0% reported their CML medicine was ineffective and 24.4% that taking CML pills was somewhat to very hard. The most common reasons for missing a dose were simply missed it (24.4%) and side effects (18.6%). Most patients perceived their ability to take CML medication was good to excellent, yet nearly one in five reported missing at least one dose in the last week.

Protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) are among the enzymes which, if mutated, play a critical role in carcinogenesis. The best-studied rearrangement, which enhances PTK activity and causes atypical proliferation, is BCR-ABL1. Abnormal expression of PTKs has proven to play a significant role in the development of various malignancies, such as chronic myelogenous leukaemia, brain tumours, neuroblastoma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumours. The use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is an outstanding example of successful target therapy. TKIs have been effectively applied in the adult oncology setting, but there is a need to establish TKIs' importance in paediatric patients. Many years of research have allowed a significant improvement in the outcome of childhood cancers. However, there are still groups of patients who have a poor prognosis, where the intensification of chemotherapy could even cause death. TKIs are designed to target specific PTKs, which lead to the limitation of severe adverse effects and increase overall survival. These advances will hopefully allow new therapeutic approaches in paediatric haemato-oncology to emerge. In this review, we present an analysis of the current data on tyrosine kinase inhibitors in childhood cancers.",,"['Kaczmarska, Agnieszka', 'Sliwa, Patrycja', 'Lejman, Monika', 'Zawitkowska, Joanna']","['Kaczmarska A', 'Sliwa P', 'Lejman M', 'Zawitkowska J']","['Student Scientific Society, Laboratory of Genetic Diagnostics, Medical University of Lublin, Gebali 6, 20-093 Lublin, Poland.', 'Student Scientific Society, Laboratory of Genetic Diagnostics, Medical University of Lublin, Gebali 6, 20-093 Lublin, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Genetic Diagnostics, Medical University of Lublin, Gebali 6, 20-093 Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Transplantology, Medical University of Lublin, Gebali 6, 20-093 Lublin, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211108,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,,2021/11/14 06:00,2022/01/12 06:00,['2021/11/13 01:06'],"['2021/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2021/11/01 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/13 01:06 [entrez]', '2021/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/12 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms222112089 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms222112089 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Nov 8;22(21). pii: ijms222112089. doi: 10.3390/ijms222112089.,['ORCID: 0000-0001-7207-156X'],,PMC8584725,['NOTNLM'],"['TKIs', 'paediatric oncology', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",20220111,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,"['Child', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction']",,,,,,,,,,

Several blood cell types, including macrophages, dendritic cells, and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), express NLRP3, where it has been implicated in various physiological and pathological processes. For example, NLRP3 participates in the development and expansion of HSPCs, and their release from bone marrow into the peripheral blood has been implicated in certain hematological disorders including various types of leukemia. In addition, accumulating evidence indicates that activation of NLRP3 plays a pivotal role in the development of transplant complications in patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) including graft versus host disease, severe infections, and transplant-related mortality. The majority of these complications are triggered by the severe tissue damage derived from the conditioning regimens utilized in HSCT which, in turn, activates NLRP3 and, ultimately, promotes the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta and IL-18. Here, we summarize the implications of NLRP3 in HSCT with an emphasis on the involvement of this inflammasome component in transplant complications.",,"['Espinoza, J Luis', 'Kamio, Kosuke', 'Lam, Vu Quang', 'Takami, Akiyoshi']","['Espinoza JL', 'Kamio K', 'Lam VQ', 'Takami A']","['Faculty of Health Sciences, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa 920-0942, Japan.', 'Faculty of Health Sciences, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa 920-0942, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Aichi Medical University School of Medicine, Nagakute 480-1195, Japan.', 'Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Center, Aichi Medical University Hospital, Nagakute 480-1195, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Aichi Medical University School of Medicine, Nagakute 480-1195, Japan.', 'Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Center, Aichi Medical University Hospital, Nagakute 480-1195, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211031,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,,2021/11/14 06:00,2021/12/17 06:00,['2021/11/13 01:05'],"['2021/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/28 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/13 01:05 [entrez]', '2021/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms222111845 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms222111845 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Oct 31;22(21). pii: ijms222111845. doi: 10.3390/ijms222111845.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-1794-6666', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5440-1120', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1822-9976']",,PMC8584591,['NOTNLM'],"['NLRP3 genotypes', 'bone marrow transplantation', 'inflammasome', 'transplant outcomes', 'transplant related mortality']",20211216,"['0 (IL1B protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-18)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein)', '0 (NLRP3 protein, human)']",,"['Animals', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-18/metabolism', 'Interleukin-1beta/metabolism', 'Leukemia/metabolism/therapy', 'NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",,,,,,,,,,

The study involved established cell lines originating from various hematopoietic malignancies: CLBL-1, GL-1, CLB70 and CNK-89, immortalized noncancerous cell lines: MDCK and NIH-3T3 and canine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The cytotoxic activity of BITC, apoptosis induction, caspase activity and ROS generation were evaluated by flow cytometry. H2AX phosphorylation was assessed by western blot. The study showed that the compound was especially active against B lymphocyte-derived malignant cells. Their death resulted from caspase-dependent apoptosis. BITC induced ROS accumulation, and glutathione precursor N-acetyl-l-cysteine reversed the effect of the compound, thus proving the role of oxidative stress in BITC activity.

Here, we present the novel finding of a germline stop-gain variant (p.Q199*) in the shelterin complex gene POT1, which was identified in a child with acute myeloid leukemia. We show that the cells overexpressing the mutated POT1 display increased DNA damage and chromosomal instabilities compared to the wildtype counterpart.

T-cell engagers (TCEs), a subclass of bsAbs, work on a similar mechanism as CAR-T cell therapy without the need of previous T-cell manipulation. Currently, several anti-CD20xCD3 TCEs have demonstrated promising efficacy across different lymphoma subtypes with slightly better outcomes in the indolent subset. Anti-CD19xCD3 TCEs are being developed as well but only blinatumomab has been evaluated in clinical trials yet. The results are not so impressive as those with anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy. Antibody-drug conjugates targeting different B-cell antigens (CD30, CD79b, CD19) seem to be effective in combination with mAbs, standard chemoimmunotherapy, or immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Recently, we established an NKL-code that describes the physiological expression pattern of eleven NKL homeobox genes in the course of hematopoiesis, allowing evaluation of aberrantly activated NKL genes in leukemia/lymphoma. Here, we identify ectopic expression of NKL homeobox gene NKX2-4 in an erythroblastic acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line OCI-M2 and describe investigation of its activating factors and target genes. Comparative expression profiling data of AML cell lines revealed in OCI-M2 an aberrantly activated program for endothelial development including master factor ETV2 and the additional endothelial signature genes HEY1, IRF6, and SOX7. Corresponding siRNA-mediated knockdown experiments showed their role in activating NKX2-4 expression. Furthermore, the ETV2 locus at 19p13 was genomically amplified, possibly underlying its aberrant expression. Target gene analyses of NKX2-4 revealed activated ETV2, HEY1, and SIX5 and suppressed FLI1. Comparative expression profiling analysis of public datasets for AML patients and primary megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor cells showed conspicuous similarities to NKX2-4 activating factors and the target genes we identified, supporting the clinical relevance of our findings and developmental disturbance by NKX2-4. Finally, identification and target gene analysis of aberrantly expressed NKX2-3 in AML patients and a megakaryoblastic AML cell line ELF-153 showed activation of FLI1, contrasting with OCI-M2. FLI1 encodes a master factor for myelopoiesis, driving megakaryocytic differentiation and suppressing erythroid differentiation, thus representing a basic developmental target of these homeo-oncogenes. Taken together, we have identified aberrantly activated NKL homeobox genes NKX2-3 and NKX2-4 in AML, deregulating genes involved in megakaryocytic and erythroid differentiation processes, and thereby contributing to the formation of specific AML subtypes.",,"['Nagel, Stefan', 'Pommerenke, Claudia', 'Meyer, Corinna', 'MacLeod, Roderick A F']","['Nagel S', 'Pommerenke C', 'Meyer C', 'MacLeod RAF']","['Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ, German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, 38124 Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ, German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, 38124 Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ, German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, 38124 Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ, German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, 38124 Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211022,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,,2021/11/14 06:00,2021/12/30 06:00,['2021/11/13 01:03'],"['2021/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/13 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/13 01:03 [entrez]', '2021/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/30 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms222111434 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms222111434 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Oct 22;22(21). pii: ijms222111434. doi: 10.3390/ijms222111434.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-9448-416X'],,PMC8583893,['NOTNLM'],"['HOX-code', 'NKL-code', 'TALE-code', 'TBX-code']",20211229,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (ETV2 protein, human)', '0 (HEY1 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (IRF6 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (NKX2-3 protein, human)', '0 (NKX2-4 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (SOX7 protein, human)', '0 (SOXF Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1)']",,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Endothelium/cytology', 'Erythroid Cells/*cytology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'SOXF Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,

Despite the numerous studies conducted on platelet function and on the role of plasma factors, an accurate and reliable method to dynamically quantify the hypercoagulability states of these conditions is not yet part of clinical practice. Starting from our experience, and after having sifted through the literature, we propose an in-depth narrative report on the contribution of the clonal platelets of MPNs-rich in tissue factor (TF)-in promoting a perpetual procoagulant mechanism. The whole process results in an unbalanced generation of thrombin and is self-maintained by Protease Activated Receptors (PARs). We chose to define this model as a ""circulating wound"", as it indisputably links the coagulation, inflammation, and fibrotic progression of the disease, in analogy with what happens in some solid tumours. The platelet contribution to thrombin generation results in triggering a vicious circle supported by the PARs/TGF-beta axis. PAR antagonists could therefore be a good option for target therapy, both to contain the risk of vascular events and to slow the progression of the disease towards end-stage forms. Both the new and old strategies, however, will require tools capable of measuring procoagulant or prohaemorrhagic states in a more extensive and dynamic way to favour a less empirical management of MPNs and their potential clinical complications.",,"['Lucchesi, Alessandro', 'Napolitano, Roberta', 'Bochicchio, Maria Teresa', 'Giordano, Giulio', 'Napolitano, Mariasanta']","['Lucchesi A', 'Napolitano R', 'Bochicchio MT', 'Giordano G', 'Napolitano M']","['Hematology Unit, IRCCS Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio dei Tumori (IRST) ""Dino Amadori"", 47014 Meldola, Italy.', 'Biosciences Laboratory, IRCCS Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio dei Tumori (IRST) ""Dino Amadori"", 47014 Meldola, Italy.', 'Biosciences Laboratory, IRCCS Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio dei Tumori (IRST) ""Dino Amadori"", 47014 Meldola, Italy.', 'Internal Medicine Division, Hematology Service, Regional Hospital ""A.

Based on the evidence available to date, frontline chemoimmunotherapy has an increasingly narrowing application, being eligible for candidacy only in elderly fit patients without or with minimal geriatric syndromes. On the other hand, treatment with BCR inhibitors, monotherapy, or in combination with anti-CD20 antibodies (e.g., obinutuzumab), must be preferred both for frontline and relapsed CLL not only in unfit patients, but also in fit patients with unmutated IGHV or harboring del(17p) and/or TP53 mutations/deletions. Second-generation inhibitors (e.g., acalabrutinib, zanubrutinib, pirtobrutinib) are novel compounds that, due to their better safety profile and different specificity, will help physicians overcome some of the safety issues and treatment resistances.

BCL-2 was expressed in 81 patients (72%), more frequently in those with unfavorable cytogenetic-molecular risk.

To find new candidate variations for AP, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS). METHODS: In all, 1,004,623 single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) were analyzed in 51 pediatric ALL patients with AP (cases) and 1388 patients without AP (controls). Replication used independent patients. RESULTS: The top-ranked SNV (rs4148513) was located within the ABCC4 gene (odds ratio (OR) 84.1; p = 1.04 x 10(-14)). Independent replication of our 20 top SNVs was not supportive of initial results, partly because rare variants were neither present in cases nor present in controls. However, results of combined analysis (GWAS and replication cohorts) remained significant (e.g., rs4148513; OR = 47.2; p = 7.31 x 10(-9)). Subsequently, we sequenced the entire ABCC4 gene and its close relative, the cystic fibrosis associated CFTR gene, a strong AP candidate gene, in 48 cases and 47 controls. Six AP-associated variants in ABCC4 and one variant in CFTR were detected. Replication confirmed the six ABCC4 variants but not the CFTR variant. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variation within the ABCC4 gene was associated with AP during the treatment of ALL. No association of AP with CFTR was observed.

Therapeutic response to FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy is dismal, and many patients relapse even after allogenic stem cell transplantation. Despite the introduction of more selective FLT3 inhibitors, remissions are short-lived, and patients show progressive disease after an initial response. Acquisition of resistance-conferring genetic mutations and growth factor signaling are two principal mechanisms that drive relapse. FLT3 inhibitors targeting both escape mechanisms could lead to a more profound and lasting clinical responses. Here we show that the JAK2 inhibitor, momelotinib, is an equipotent type-1 FLT3 inhibitor. Momelotinib showed potent inhibitory activity on both mouse and human cells expressing FLT3-ITD, including clinically relevant resistant mutations within the activation loop at residues, D835, D839, and Y842. Additionally, momelotinib efficiently suppressed the resistance mediated by FLT3 ligand (FL) and hematopoietic cytokine activated JAK2 signaling. Interestingly, unlike gilteritinib, momelotinib inhibits the expression of MYC in leukemic cells. Consequently, concomitant inhibition of FLT3 and downregulation of MYC by momelotinib treatment showed better efficacy in suppressing the leukemia in a preclinical murine model of AML. Altogether, these data provide evidence that momelotinib is an effective type-1 dual JAK2/FLT3 inhibitor and may offer an alternative to gilteritinib. Its ability to impede the resistance conferred by growth factor signaling and activation loop mutants suggests that momelotinib treatment could provide a deeper and durable response; thus, warrants its clinical evaluation.",['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society of Hematology.'],"['Azhar, Mohammad', 'Kincaid, Zachary', 'Kesarwani, Meenu', 'Ahmed, Arhama', 'Wunderlich, Mark', 'Latif, Tahir', 'Starczynowski, Daniel', 'Azam, Mohammad']","['Azhar M', 'Kincaid Z', 'Kesarwani M', 'Ahmed A', 'Wunderlich M', 'Latif T', 'Starczynowski D', 'Azam M']","[""Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States."", ""Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States."", 'Cincinnati Chidrens Hospital Medical center.', ""Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States."", ""Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States."", 'UC COM, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States.', ""Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States."", ""Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211112,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,IM,,2021/11/13 06:00,2021/11/13 06:00,['2021/11/12 20:33'],"['2021/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/08 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/12 20:33 [entrez]', '2021/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['477957 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2021004611 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Blood Adv. 2021 Nov 12. pii: 477957. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2021004611.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-2166-5146'],['R50 CA211404/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The general downregulation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) argues for a role of DNA demethylation in MDS beyond TET2 mutations, which albeit frequent, do not convey any prognostic significance. We investigated TETs expression to identify factors which can modulate the impact of mutations and thus 5-hmC levels on clinical phenotypes and prognosis of MDS patients. DNA/RNA-sequencing and 5-hmC data were collected from 1665 patients with MDS and 91 controls. Irrespective of mutations, a significant fraction of MDS patients exhibited lower TET2 expression, whereas 5-hmC levels were not uniformly decreased. In searching for factors explaining compensatory mechanisms, we discovered that TET3 was upregulated in MDS and inversely correlated with TET2 expression in wild-type cases. Although TET2 was reduced across all age groups, TET3 levels were increased in a likely feedback mechanism induced by TET2 dysfunction. This inverse relationship of TET2 and TET3 expression also corresponded to the expression of L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase, involved in agonist/antagonist substrate metabolism. Importantly, elevated TET3 levels influenced the clinical phenotype of TET2 deficiency whereby the lack of compensation by TET3 (low TET3 expression) was associated with poor outcomes of TET2 mutant carriers.","['(c) 2022 by The American Society of Hematology.

In this article, we summarize the structural characteristics of CAR constructs and discuss clinical factors known to be related to relapse following CAR-T cell treatment. By better understanding the mechanistic basis for such disease recurrence, it will be possible to fully realize the potential of this potent therapeutic modality in the future. This review will focus on current activate strategies aimed at overcoming known limitations to CAR-T cell therapy in an effort to improve hematologic malignancies patient outcomes.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Cellular immunity plays an important role in CML disease control. We conducted a randomized, non-blinded phase II trial of adjuvant immunotherapy with TKIs to facilitate TKI discontinuation. METHODS: TKI-treated patients with CP-CML were randomized to receive the K562/GM-CSF vaccine (vaccine) OR Interferon-alpha + Sargramostim (IFN). If UMRD was achieved, then all treatment was stopped. Patients who did not achieve UMRD within one year, had a molecular relapse, or discontinued therapy for toxicity could crossover. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients were randomized to IFN (n = 18) or vaccine (n = 16), and 21 patients crossed over (IFNvaccine: n = 9, vaccineIFN, n = 12). TKIs at enrollment included imatinib (n = 31), nilotinib (n = 2), and dasatinib (n = 1). No patients discontinued vaccine due to side effects, while 33 % of IFN-treated patients discontinued treatment. More patients randomized to IFN (47.4 %, 95 % CI: 16.7-66.7 %) versus vaccine (25.0 %, 95 % CI: 0.5-43.5 %) achieved UMRD within one year. Seven patients randomized to IFN discontinued treatment with 28.6 % (95 % CI: 8.9-92.2 %) sustaining treatment-free remission (TFR) at 1 year, while three patients randomized to vaccine discontinued treatment with none sustaining TFR. Including crossover, there was a cumulative discontinuation success rate of 36.4 % (95 % CI: 16.6 %-79.5 %) after adjuvant IFN. Patients who sustained TFR received a median of 29 months of imatinib prior to discontinuation. CONCLUSION: Adjuvant IFN led to durable TFRs with limited prior TKI exposure with comparable success to prior discontinuation trials, but many patients stopped IFN early.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the ability of radiation therapy to influence drug accumulation in the extracellular bone marrow tissue is unknown, due in part to a lack of methodology. This study developed longitudinal quantitative multiphoton microscopy (L-QMPM) to characterize the bone marrow vasculature (BMV) and drug accumulation in the extracellular bone marrow tissue before and after radiation therapy in mice bearing leukemia. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We developed a longitudinal window implant for L-QMPM imaging of the calvarium BMV before, 2 days after, and 5 days after total body irradiation (TBI). Live time-lapsed images of a fluorescent drug surrogate were used to obtain measurements, including tissue wash-in slope (WIStissue) to measure extracellular drug accumulation. We performed L-QMPM imaging on healthy C57BL/6 (WT) mice, as well as mice bearing acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). RESULTS: Implants had no effects on calvarium dose, and parameters for wild-type untreated mice were stable during imaging. We observed decreased vessel diameter, vessel blood flow, and WIStissue with the onset of AML and ALL. Two to 10 Gy TBI increased WIStissue and vessel diameter 2 days after radiation therapy in all 3 groups of mice and increased single-vessel blood flow in mice bearing ALL and AML. Increased WIStissue was observed 5 days after 10 Gy TBI or 4 Gy split-dose TBI (2 treatments of 2 Gy spaced 3 days apart). CONCLUSIONS: L-QMPM provides stable functional assessments of the BMV. Nonmyeloablative and myeloablative TBI increases extracellular drug accumulation in the leukemic bone marrow 2 to 5 days posttreatment, likely through improved blood perfusion and drug exchange from the BMV to the extravascular tissue. Our data show that neo-adjuvant TBI at doses from 2 Gy to 10 Gy conditions the BMV to improve drug transport to the bone marrow.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The inefficient clearance of tumor cells and radiation-induced toxicity to normal tissues is attributed to relapse and morbidity in a significant fraction of patients. Developing biomarkers that indicate an individual's physiological response to radiation will allow personalized treatment and follow-up. We investigated the utility of circulating microRNA150-5p (miR150) for evaluation of radiation dose response. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Age-, sex-, and strain-matched wild type and miR150 null (knockout, KO) mice were subjected to TBI and evaluated for the impact of circulating miR150 expression on survival and hematologic endpoints. Dose- and time-dependent changes of the miR150 level in bone marrow were assessed using flow cytometry. The functional roles of miR150 in cellular response to radiation were evaluated using apoptosis assay. miR150 expression in leukemic cell lines and in blood collected from leukemia patients with diverse outcomes was evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: Absence of miR150 in mice conferred resistance to radiation injury and resulted in accelerated recovery of lymphoid and myeloid cells after ablative or partially ablative TBI in mice. Overexpression of miR150 resulted in a higher percentage of cells at G2/M phases of cell cycle, which is associated with increased sensitivity and susceptibility to apoptotic cell death after radiation. Levels of circulating miR150 were found to be decreased after radiation in leukemia patients and exhibited an inverse correlation with recurrence. CONCLUSION: The current study demonstrates the utility of an miR150-based blood test for rapid evaluation of the efficiency of marrow ablation and recovery after radiation and HSCT. The internally controlled blood test may provide near real-time evaluation of functional marrow that will allow optimal dosing based on an individual's physiologic response to radiation.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Venetoclax is an effective Bcl-2 selective inhibitor approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of AML in patients who are 75 years and older or who have comorbidities. However, resistance to venetoclax limits its clinical efficacy. Mcl-1 has been identified as one determinant of resistance to venetoclax treatment. In this study, we investigate the Mcl-1 inhibitor S63845 in combination with venetoclax in AML cells. We found that S63845 synergizes with venetoclax in AML cell lines and primary patient samples. Bak/Bax double knockdown and treatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK revealed that the combination induces intrinsic apoptosis in AML cells. Inhibition of Mcl-1 using another Mcl-1 selective inhibitor, AZD5991, also synergistically enhanced apoptosis induced by venetoclax in a caspase-dependent manner. Importantly, S63845 in combination with venetoclax can effectively combat AML cells with acquired resistance to the standard chemotherapy drug cytarabine. In light of these facts, the combined inhibition of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 shows promise against AML cells, including relapse/refractory AML.","['Copyright (c) 2021 ISEH -- Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

Classic MCL cases are composed of a monotonous population of small- to medium-sized lymphocytes with irregular nuclear contours that are positive for cyclin D1 and SOX11 and negative for CD23 and CD200. By contrast, occasional MCL cases express CD23 and CD200 but lack SOX11 and morphologically and immunophenotypically resemble chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), termed as CLL-like MCL in this study. These neoplasms pose a diagnostic challenge and are easy to be diagnosed as CLL in daily practice. We studied 14 cases of CLL-like MCL to define their clinicopathologic features and compared them with 33 traditional CLL cases. There were 8 men and 6 women with a median age of 62 years (range, 44-80). Compared with CLL, patients with CLL-like MCL have lower levels of peripheral blood and bone marrow involvement and more frequently had mutated IGHV. Immunophenotypically, CLL-like MCL often showed moderate to bright expression of B-cell antigens and surface immunoglobulin light chain, dim and partial expression of CD23 and CD200, infrequent CD43 positivity, and lack of LEF1. The overall survival of patients with CLL-like MCL was similar to that of CLL patients. In conclusion, CD23+, CD200+, and SOX11-negative MCL closely resemble CLL, both clinically and pathologically, including a similar indolent clinical course. They may pose a diagnostic challenge.

Participants received three intramuscular doses of either quadrivalent HPV vaccine (HPV4; enrolments on or before March 1, 2016) or nonavalent HPV vaccine (HPV9; enrolments after March 1, 2016) over 6 months (on day 1, at month 2, and at month 6). We also obtained data from published clinical trials assessing safety and immunogenicity of HPV4 and HPV9 in 9-26-year-olds from the general population, as a comparator group. The primary endpoint was antibody response against HPV types 16 and 18 at month 7 in the per-protocol population. A response was deemed non-inferior if the lower bound of the multiplicity-adjusted 95% CI was greater than 0.5 for the ratio of anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 geometric mean titres (GMTs) in survivors of cancer versus the general population. Responses were examined separately in male and female participants by age group (ie, 9-15 years and 16-26 years). Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one vaccine dose and for whom safety data were available. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01492582. This trial is now completed. FINDINGS: Between Feb 18, 2013, and June 22, 2018, we enrolled 453 survivors of cancer, of whom 436 received one or more vaccine doses: 203 (47%) participants had survived leukaemia, 185 (42%) were female, and 280 (64%) were non-Hispanic white. Mean age at first dose was 15.6 years (SD 4.6). 378 (83%) of 453 participants had evaluable immunogenicity data; main reasons for exclusion from per-protocol analysis were to loss to follow-up, patient reasons, and medical reasons. Data were also obtained from 26 486 general population controls. The ratio of mean GMT for anti-HPV types 16 and 18 in survivors of cancer versus the general population was more than 1 for all subgroups (ie, aged 9-15 years, aged 16-26 years, male, and female groups) in both vaccine cohorts (ranging from 1.64 [95% CI 1.12-2.18] for anti-HPV type 16 in female participants aged 9-15 years who received HPV9, to 4.77 [2.48-7.18] for anti-HPV type 18 in male participants aged 16-26 years who received HPV4). Non-inferiority criteria were met within each age and sex subgroup, except against HPV type 18 in female participants aged 16-26 years receiving HPV9 (4.30 [0.00-9.05]). Adverse events were reported by 237 (54%) of 435 participants; injection site pain was most common (174 [40%] participants). One serious adverse event (ie, erythema nodosum) was possibly related to vaccine (HPV9; 16-26 year female cohort). INTERPRETATION: Immunogenicity and safety of HPV vaccine three-dose series in survivors of cancer is similar to that in the general population, providing evidence for use in this clinically vulnerable population.

Our aim was to examine whether fructose diet affects inflammation and insulin signaling in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of Mif knockout mice (MIF-KO), and their possible link to neural plasticity and behavior. We analyzed nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and glucocorticoid signaling, expression of F4/80, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, TLR-4, MyD88, arginase 1 (Arg-1), mannose receptor (Mrc-1), and leukemia inhibitory factor (Lif) to assess inflammation in the PFC of C57/BL6J and MIF-KO mice consuming 20% fructose solution for 9 weeks. Insulin receptor (IR), IRS-1 serine phosphorylations (307 and 1101) and activity of PKCalpha, Akt, GSK-3beta and AMPKalpha were used to analyze insulin signaling. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) mRNA levels, together with synapthophysin and PSD-95 protein level and calcium calmodulin-dependent kinase 2 (CaMKII) activity, were used as plasticity markers. Behavior was examined in elevated plus maze, light dark box and novel object recognition test. The results showed concomitant increase of Tnf-alpha, Tlr-4, MyD88 and M2 microglia markers (Arg-1, Mrc-1, Lif) in the PFC of MIF-KO, paralleled with unchanged glucocorticoid and insulin signaling. Increase of BDNF and IGF-1 was paralleled with increased CaMKII activity, decreased PSD-95 protein level, anxiogenic behavior, and impaired memory in MIF-KO mice. Fructose feeding restored these parameters in the PFC to the control level and mitigated behavioral changes, suggesting that ameliorating effects of fructose on neuroinflammation and behavior depend on the presence of MIF.",['(c) 2021 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.'],"['Vrataric, Milos', 'Senk, Vladimir', 'Bursac, Biljana', 'Gligorovska, Ljupka', 'Ignjatovic, Djurdjica', 'Kovacevic, Sanja', 'Velickovic, Natasa', 'Djordjevic, Ana']","['Vrataric M', 'Senk V', 'Bursac B', 'Gligorovska L', 'Ignjatovic D', 'Kovacevic S', 'Velickovic N', 'Djordjevic A']","['Department of Biochemistry, Institute for Biological Research ""Sinisa Stankovic""- National Institute of Republic of Serbia, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Institute for Biological Research ""Sinisa Stankovic""- National Institute of Republic of Serbia, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Institute for Biological Research ""Sinisa Stankovic""- National Institute of Republic of Serbia, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Institute for Biological Research ""Sinisa Stankovic""- National Institute of Republic of Serbia, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Institute for Biological Research ""Sinisa Stankovic""- National Institute of Republic of Serbia, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Institute for Biological Research ""Sinisa Stankovic""- National Institute of Republic of Serbia, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Institute for Biological Research ""Sinisa Stankovic""- National Institute of Republic of Serbia, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Institute for Biological Research ""Sinisa Stankovic""- National Institute of Republic of Serbia, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211112,Netherlands,Biofactors,"BioFactors (Oxford, England)",8807441,IM,,2021/11/13 06:00,2021/11/13 06:00,['2021/11/12 17:18'],"['2021/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/12 17:18 [entrez]', '2021/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/biof.1802 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Biofactors. 2021 Nov 12. doi: 10.1002/biof.1802.,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7042-1631'],"['451-03-9/2021-14/200007/Ministarstvo Prosvete, Nauke i Tehnoloskog Razvoja']",,['NOTNLM'],"['behavior', 'fructose', 'inflammation', 'insulin resistance', 'macrophage migration inhibitory factor', 'neural plasticity', 'prefrontal cortex']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immune cells from the adaptive compartment are involved in disease manifestation but whether innate cell functions participate in disease occurrence has not been evaluated. In this study, we analyzed innate cell responses at steady state and after blood cell stimulation using an agonist of the toll-like receptor (TLR)7/8-signaling pathway in blood samples from HTLV-1-infected volunteers, including asymptomatic carriers and HAM/TSP patients. We observed a lower response of IFNalpha+ DCs and monocytes in HAM/TSP compared to asymptomatic carriers, as a potential consequence of corticosteroid treatments. In contrast, a higher frequency of monocytes producing MIP-1alpha and pDC producing IL-12 was detected in HAM/TSP blood samples, together with higher IFNgamma responsiveness of NK cells, suggesting an increased sensitivity to inflammatory response in HAM/TSP patients compared to asymptomatic carriers. This sustained inflammatory responsiveness could be linked or be at the origin of the neuroinflammatory status in HAM/TSP patients.

There are limited data regarding the impact of prior blinatumomab exposure on subsequent CD19-CAR outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective review of children and young adults with relapsed or refractory ALL who received CD19-CAR between 2012 and 2019. Primary objectives addressed 6-month relapse-free survival (RFS) and event-free survival (EFS), stratified by blinatumomab use. Secondary objectives included comparison of longer-term survival outcomes, complete remission rates, CD19 modulation, and identification of factors associated with EFS. RESULTS: Of 420 patients (median age, 12.7 years; interquartile range, 7.1-17.5) treated with commercial tisagenlecleucel or one of three investigational CD19-CAR constructs, 77 (18.3%) received prior blinatumomab. Blinatumomab-exposed patients more frequently harbored KMT2A rearrangements and underwent a prior stem-cell transplant than blinatumomab-naive patients. Among patients evaluable for CD19-CAR response (n = 412), blinatumomab nonresponders had lower complete remission rates to CD19-CAR (20 of 31, 64.5%) than blinatumomab responders (39 of 42, 92.9%) or blinatumomab-naive patients (317 of 339, 93.5%), P < .0001. Following CD19-CAR, blinatumomab nonresponders had worse 6-month EFS (27.3%; 95% CI, 13.6 to 43.0) compared with blinatumomab responders (66.9%; 95% CI, 50.6 to 78.9; P < .0001) or blinatumomab-naive patients (72.6%; 95% CI, 67.5 to 77; P < .0001) and worse RFS. High-disease burden independently associated with inferior EFS. CD19-dim or partial expression (preinfusion) was more frequently seen in blinatumomab-exposed patients (13.3% v 6.5%; P = .06) and associated with lower EFS and RFS. CONCLUSION: With the largest series to date in pediatric CD19-CAR, and, to our knowledge, the first to study the impact of sequential CD19 targeting, we demonstrate that blinatumomab nonresponse and high-disease burden were independently associated with worse RFS and EFS, identifying important indicators of long-term outcomes following CD19-CAR.",,"['Myers, Regina M', 'Taraseviciute, Agne',

These financial implications have been well characterised quantitatively in common cancers. However, less is known about the lived experience of financial stress, particularly outside the United States and in rarer cancers. This study aimed to explore the perceived financial impact of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)-a rare haematological malignancy where patients may be particularly vulnerable to financial stress due to the lengthy, specialised and centralised care. The findings provide insight into the patients' lived experience of the personal financial impact of the disease. This Australian qualitative study was undertaken with 11 adults in remission from AML and recruited from their treating hospital. Semi-structured interviews were transcribed, and data were managed using NVivo. Themes were identified through inductive and deductive analysis using open, axial and thematic coding. Four themes were identified: burden of AML-attributable costs (e.g. out-of-pocket parking and medication expenses); accommodating the AML-impact on paid work (e.g. early retirement and modifying job tasks); the consequence of financial strain from AML (e.g. using savings and accessing Government welfare) and concerns about the future and future familial financial burden (e.g. securing finances and worry about depleting financial resources). A reduction in or stopping work was perceived as the most burdensome to their current and future finances. The findings demonstrate people with AML experience financial difficulty even within a publically funded healthcare system. Opportunities exist for health services to alleviate some financial burden through reducing or abolishing parking fees for oncology patients and ensuring adequate access to social workers to facilitate access to Government welfare. Improving patients' financial difficulties contributes to improved quality of life, which is congruent to cancer survivorship.",['(c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Parker, Catriona', 'Berkovic, Danielle', 'Wei, Andrew', 'Zomer, Ella', 'Liew, Danny', 'Ayton, Darshini']","['Parker C', 'Berkovic D', 'Wei A', 'Zomer E', 'Liew D', 'Ayton D']","['School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Malignant Haematology, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology and General Medicine, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211112,England,Health Soc Care Community,Health & social care in the community,9306359,IM,,2021/11/13 06:00,2021/11/13 06:00,['2021/11/12 08:47'],"['2021/08/31 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/11 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/12 08:47 [entrez]', '2021/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/hsc.13642 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Health Soc Care Community. 2021 Nov 12. doi: 10.1111/hsc.13642.,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6500-3075', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9967-6451', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2754-2024']",['Monash University'],,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukaemia', 'direct costs', 'employment', 'expenses', 'financial impact', 'indirect costs', 'qualitative']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oral manifestations of CLL are infrequent and rarely reported in literature. We report a new case of a 67-year old man who presented with the complaints of tooth mobility and gingival swelling. Extra-oral examination was remarkable for cutaneous pallor and bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy involving the submandibular, and deep cervical lymph nodes on both sides of the neck. Complete blood count revealed normal red blood cell count (4.25 x 106/mul), normal platelet count (136 x 103/mul) and increased white blood cell count (25.3 x 103/mul). Differential white blood cell count showed marked lymphocytosis (88%), and blood film revealed the presence of leukocytosis, with small mature-looking lymphocytes, and mild thrombocytopenia.

Variation between ethnic groups is an epidemiological aspect of ALL. Higher incidence rates have been observed in Latin American patients and ALL in Latinos carries a dismal prognosis. The cell of origin in ALL is derived from immature cells of either the B or T lineage. Most reported data among Latinos either exclusively looks at B cell precursor ALL or do not distinguish between subtypes. We used the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to delineate the differences in incidence rates of B-ALL and T-ALL across ethnic groups in the United States. Data from SEER-18 was used to compare incidence rates of T-ALL and B-ALL. Due to the utilization of cytogenetics and subsequent changes in ICD coding over the years examined the most recent data reported from 2002 to 2017. We compared rates in Non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs), Latinos, Blacks and Asian-Pacific Islanders (API). Age-adjusted incidence rates per 100,000 person-years were calculated.

The application of targeted immunotherapy to patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been limited in particular by the lack of a tumor-specific target antigen. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO), an ADC targeting CD33, is the only approved immunotherapeutic agent in AML. In our study, we introduce a CD33-directed third-generation CAR T-cell product (3G.CAR33-T) for the treatment of patients with AML. 3G.CAR33-T cells could be expanded up to the end-of-culture, that is, 17 days after transduction, and displayed significant cytokine secretion and robust cytotoxic activity when incubated with CD33-positive cells including cell lines, drug-resistant cells, primary blasts as well as normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). When compared to second-generation CAR33-T cells, 3G.CAR33-T cells exhibited higher viability, increased proliferation and stronger cytotoxicity. Also, GO exerted strong antileukemia activity against CD33-positive AML cells. Upon genomic deletion of CD33 in HSPCs, 3G.CAR33-T cells and GO preferentially killed wildtype leukemia cells, while sparing CD33-deficient HSPCs. Our data provide evidence for the applicability of CD33-targeted immunotherapies in AML and its potential implementation in CD33 genome-edited stem cell transplantation approaches.","['(c) 2021 The Authors.

Our investigations indicate that upregulation of fatty acid synthase (FASN) and de novo lipogenesis, commonly observed in many cancers, are associated with nucleotide metabolic dysfunction in lymphoma. The results from our experiments showed that ribonucleotide and deoxyribonucleotide pool depletion, suppression of global RNA/DNA synthesis, and cell cycle inhibition occurred in the presence of FASN inhibition. Subsequently, we observed that FASN inhibition caused metabolic blockade in the rate-limiting step of the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway (oxPPP) catalyzed by phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGDH). Furthermore, we determined that FASN inhibitor treatment resulted in NADPH accumulation and inhibition of PGDH enzyme activity. NADPH is a cofactor utilized by FASN, also a known allosteric inhibitor of PGDH. Through cell-free enzyme assays consisting of FASN and PGDH, we delineated that the PGDH-catalyzed ribulose-5-phosphate synthesis is enhanced in the presence of FASN and is suppressed by increasing concentrations of NADPH. Additionally, we observed that FASN and PGDH were colocalized in the cytosol. The results from these experiments led us to conclude that NADP-NADPH turnover and the reciprocal stimulation of FASN and PGDH catalysis are involved in promoting oxPPP and nucleotide biosynthesis in lymphoma. Finally, a transcriptomic analysis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 624) revealed the increased expression of genes associated with metabolic functions interlinked with oxPPP, while the expression of genes participating in oxPPP remained unaltered. Together we conclude that FASN-PGDH enzymatic interactions are involved in enabling oxPPP and nucleotide metabolic dysfunction in lymphoma tumors.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Ravi, Beheshti, Abermil, Lansigan, Kinlaw, Matthan, Mokhtar,', 'Passero, Puliti, David, Dolnikowski, Su, Chen, Bijan, Varshney, Kim, Dave,', 'Rudolph and Evens.']","['Ravi, Dashnamoorthy', 'Beheshti, Afshin', 'Abermil, Nassera', 'Lansigan, Frederick', 'Kinlaw, William', 'Matthan, Nirupa R', 'Mokhtar, Maisarah', 'Passero, Frank C Jr', 'Puliti, Patrick', 'David, Kevin A', 'Dolnikowski, Gregory G', 'Su, Xiaoyang', 'Chen, Ying', 'Bijan, Mahboubi', 'Varshney, Rohan R', 'Kim, Baek', 'Dave, Sandeep S', 'Rudolph, Michael C', 'Evens, Andrew M']","['Ravi D', 'Beheshti A', 'Abermil N', 'Lansigan F', 'Kinlaw W', 'Matthan NR', 'Mokhtar M', 'Passero FC Jr', 'Puliti P', 'David KA', 'Dolnikowski GG', 'Su X', 'Chen Y', 'Bijan M', 'Varshney RR', 'Kim B', 'Dave SS', 'Rudolph MC', 'Evens AM']","['Division of Blood Disorders, Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, United States.', 'Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, United States.', 'KBR, Space Biosciences Division, National Aeronautical and Space Administration, Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA, United States.', ""Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Saint-Antoine, Service d'Hematologie Biologique, Paris, France."", 'Department of Medicine, Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, NH, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Lebanon, NH, United States.', 'Jean Mayer United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging, Tufts University, Boston, MA, United States.', 'Division of Blood Disorders, Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY, United States.', 'Division of Blood Disorders, Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, NH, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, NH, United States.', 'Division of Blood Disorders, Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, United States.', 'Jean Mayer United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging, Tufts University, Boston, MA, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, United States.', 'Metabolomics Core, Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, United States.', 'Bioinformatics Core, Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, United States.', 'Harold Hamm Diabetes Center, The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma, OK, United States.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, United States.', ""Center for Drug Discovery, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, GA, United States."", 'Department of Medicine, Duke Cancer Institute, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States.', 'Harold Hamm Diabetes Center, The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma, OK, United States.', 'Division of Blood Disorders, Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, United States.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211026,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,"['AE: Advisory board (with honorarium): Bayer, Seattle Genetics, Affimed, Verastem,', 'Pharmacyclics, Research to Practice, and Physician Education Resource.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia consists of an expansion of B-cells with a mixed immature and ""antigen-experienced"" phenotype, with either a mutated (M-CLL) or unmutated (U-CLL) tumor BCR, associated with distinct patient outcomes. Here, we investigated the hydropathy index of the BCR of 138 CLL patients and its association with the IGHV mutational status and patient outcome. Overall, two clearly distinct subgroups of M-CLL patients emerged, based on a neutral (mean hydropathy index of -0.1) vs. negatively charged BCR (mean hydropathy index of -1.1) with molecular features closer to those of B-cell precursors and peripheral/mature B-cells, respectively. Despite that M-CLL with neutral HCDR3 did not show traits associated with a mature B-cell repertoire, important differences in IGHV gene usage of tumor cells and patient outcome were observed in this subgroup of patients once compared to both U-CLL and M-CLL with negatively charged HCDR3 sequences. Compared to M-CLL with negatively charged HCDR3 sequences, M-CLL with neutral HCDR3 sequences showed predominance of men, more advanced stages of the disease, and a greater frequency of genetic alterations-e.g., del(17p)-together with a higher rate of disease progression and shorter time to therapy (TTT), independently of other prognostic factors. Our data suggest that the hydropathy index of the HCDR3 sequences of CLL cells allows the identification of a subgroup of M-CLL with intermediate prognostic features between U-CLL and the more favorable subgroup of M-CLL with a negatively charged BCR.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Rodriguez-Caballero, Fuentes Herrero, Oliva Ariza, Criado,', 'Alcoceba, Prieto, Perez Caro, Garcia-Montero, Gonzalez

The study group consisted of 267 patients. DNA content and immunophenotype were assessed in the bone marrow before treatment using multicolor flow cytometry (FC). DNA aneuploidy was detected in 50/267 (19%) patients. High hyperdiploidy was found to be associated with lower leukocyte count (p = 0.006) and common ALL immunophenotype. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that high hyperdiploid BCP-ALL patients showed significantly higher expression of CD9, CD20, CD22, CD58, CD66c, CD86 and CD123 antigens as compared to other groups of ploidy. In contrast, CD45 showed decreased expression. The percentage of leukemic blasts at diagnosis was lower in high hyperdiploid BCP-ALL cases than in diploid (79% vs. 85.7%, p = 0.001). The difference in minimal residual disease (MRD) levels on day 15 and 33 of induction therapy between analyzed groups was not significant. This study showed that high hyperdiploidy is associated with lower WBC count and specific immunological phenotype. Flow cytometric evaluation of expression of selected antigens can be used for fast identification of markers of aneuploidy in pediatric BCP-ALL, before genetic tests results are available.

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an aggressive and life-threatening syndrome of overactivation of the immune system. We present a case of a 20-month-old boy who was referred to an oncology clinic because of HLH suspicion. In the preceding time, our patient suffered from a severe form of chickenpox with prolonged fever. Tests including myelogram, cerebrospinal fluid, and magnetic resonance (MR) of the brain gave a diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia from B lymphocyte precursors, without occupying the central nervous system. To exclude inherited HLH in our patient, next-generation sequencing was performed, which revealed a heterozygous missense mutation in exon 15 of the PSTPIP1 gene (c.1213C>T, R405C).

Our patient may be evidence that autoinflammatory diseases caused by PSTPIP1 gene mutations are not limited to the classical pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne (PAPA) phenotype but may have a different clinical presentation, and the spectrum of the PSTPIP1-associated inflammatory diseases (PAID) syndrome is more extensive than previously thought.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Termedia.'],"['Gowin, Ewelina', 'Babol-Pokora, Katarzyna', 'Januszkiewicz-Lewandowska, Danuta']","['Gowin E', 'Babol-Pokora K', 'Januszkiewicz-Lewandowska D']","['Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Lodz University of Medical Sciences, Lodz, Poland.', 'Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20210714,Poland,Cent Eur J Immunol,Central-European journal of immunology,9702239,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],2021/11/13 06:00,2021/11/13 06:01,['2021/11/12 06:59'],"['2020/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/12 06:59 [entrez]', '2021/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/13 06:01 [medline]']","['10.5114/ceji.2021.107030 [doi]', '44428 [pii]']",ppublish,Cent Eur J Immunol. 2021;46(2):270-274. doi: 10.5114/ceji.2021.107030.

The factors predisposing to ALL remain mostly unknown. Natural killer (NK) cells are a component of innate immunity. Their role is to eliminate cells that were infected with viruses or underwent a neoplastic transformation. The activity of NK cells is regulated by their activating and inhibitory receptors, inter alia killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs). The available data about a link between the incidence of ALL and KIR genotype are highly inconclusive, and further research is needed to explain whether such a relationship truly exists. The aim of this study was to analyze KIR genotype and haplotype combinations in children treated for ALL. Material and methods: The study included 49 children diagnosed with ALL at 1.2-19.8 years of age. The control group was composed of 43 healthy subjects aged between 1.2 and 21.9 years. DNA was isolated using QIAamp DNA Mini kits. KIR genotypes were identified by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with sequence-specific primers (SSPs). The analysis also included KIR haplotype combinations: AA, AB and BB. Results: Patients with ALL and controls did not differ significantly in the frequencies of individual KIR genes and haplotypes. However, the overall frequency of all 6 activating KIR genes in patients with ALL was significantly higher than in the controls (24.5% vs. 4.7%, p = 0.019). Conclusions: The findings presented here imply that individual KIR genes do not play a significant role in the pathogenesis of ALL. Nevertheless, a higher number of activating KIR genes may constitute a risk factor for this malignancy.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Termedia.'],"['Koltan, Sylwia', 'Koltan, Andrzej', 'Soszynska, Krystyna', 'Matiakowska, Karolina', 'Morgut-Klimkowska, Malgorzata', 'Grzesk, Elzbieta', 'Grzesk, Grzegorz', 'Dabrowska, Anna', 'Urbanczyk, Anna', 'Konieczek, Joanna', 'Styczynski, Jan', 'Haus, Olga', 'Wysocki, Mariusz']","['Koltan S', 'Koltan A', 'Soszynska K', 'Matiakowska K', 'Morgut-Klimkowska M', 'Grzesk E', 'Grzesk G', 'Dabrowska A', 'Urbanczyk A', 'Konieczek J', 'Styczynski J', 'Haus O', 'Wysocki M']","['Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Genetics, 10th Military Research Hospital and Polyclinic Independent Public Healthcare Centre in Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department and Chair of Clinical Genetics, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Poland.', 'Department and Chair of Clinical Genetics, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Poland.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Therapy, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Poland.', 'Department and Chair of Clinical Genetics, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Poland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20210807,Poland,Cent Eur J Immunol,Central-European journal of immunology,9702239,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],2021/11/13 06:00,2021/11/13 06:01,['2021/11/12 06:59'],"['2019/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/12 06:59 [entrez]', '2021/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/13 06:01 [medline]']","['10.5114/ceji.2021.108178 [doi]', '44846 [pii]']",ppublish,Cent Eur J Immunol. 2021;46(2):210-216. doi: 10.5114/ceji.2021.108178.

Numerous studies claim that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are important regulators in AML progression. This study intended to explore the role of circNPM1 in AML development and drug chemoresistance. The expression of circNPM1 and miR-345-5p was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cellular activities, including cell growth, apoptosis, cell cycle, migration and invasion, were monitored using colony formation assay, flow cytometry assay and transwell assay, respectively. The relationship between miR-345-5p and circNPM1 or Frizzled-5 (FZD5) was predicted by the bioinformatics tool starBase and validated by dual-luciferase reporter assay or RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. CircNPM1 was abundantly expressed in serum samples from AML patients and AML cell lines. CircNPM1 silence or miR-345-5p restoration repressed colony formation, cell migration and invasion, contributed to cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, and weakened Adriamycin (ADM) resistance of AML cells. MiR-345-5p was a target of circNPM1 and was downregulated in AML serum and cells. MiR-345-5p deficiency reversed the effects of circNPM1 silence. Further, FZD5 was targeted by miR-345-5p, and circNPM1 regulated FZD5 expression by adsorbing miR-345-5p. FZD5 overexpression could block the function of miR-345-5p restoration. CircNPM1 might be a vital regulator for ADM chemoresistance in AML cells, which partly depended on the role of the miR-345-5p/FZD5 axis.

This study retrospectively reviewed outcomes of 25,423 patients (16,744 MGUS, 6194 MM, 2955 AL amyloidosis). Overall, 2.7% of patients reported having a family member with a PCD (defined as MGUS, MM, or AL amyloidosis). Family history was documented in 94% of MGUS, 92% of MM, and 88% of AL amyloidosis patients. The overall survival was consistently longer in patients with versus without familial PCD (crude hazard ratios: 0.52, 95% CI 0.40-0.67, p < 0.001 for MGUS patients; 0.68, 95% CI 0.57-0.79, p < 0.001 for MM patients; 0.60, 95% CI 0.43-0.84, p = 0.003 for AL patients). This association remained consistent when adjusting for baseline patient and disease characteristics. In MGUS patients, the risk of progression to MM, AL amyloidosis, or a lymphoproliferative disorder was higher in patients with familial PCD when accounting for death as a competing risk (cause-specific HR 1.9, 95% 1.3-2.7, p < 0.001).

Cereblon (CRBN) is a common direct target of thalidomide and related compounds and works as a Cullin Ring 4 E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL4) with DDB1, CUL4, and ROC1. The substrate specificity of CRL4(CRBN) is modulated by thalidomide-related compounds. While lenalidomide is approved for the treatment of several diseases including multiple myeloma, 5q- syndrome, mantle cell lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma, pomalidomide is approved only for the treatment of lenalidomide-resistant multiple myeloma. Here we show that PLZF/ZBTB16 and its fusion proteins are pomalidomide-dependent neosubstrates of CRL4(CRBN). PLZF joins to RARalpha or potentially other partner genes, and the translocation causes leukemias, such as acute promyelocytic leukemia and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We demonstrate that pomalidomide treatment induces PLZF-RARalpha degradation, resulting in antiproliferation of leukemic cells expressing PLZF-RARalpha.

In this study, nested recombinase polymerase amplification (nRPA) was developed for exogenous FeLV DNA provirus detection, and reverse transcriptase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) was developed for the detection of FeLV RNA. The approaches were validated using 108 cats with clinicopathologic abnormalities due to FeLV infection, and from 14 healthy cats in a vaccination plan. The nRPA and RT-RPA assays could rapidly amplify the FeLV template, and produced high sensitivity and specificity.

AML infiltration induces a significant release of inflammatory cytokines in the human bone marrow niche which accelerates leukemogenesis. As the transmembrane glycoprotein CD38 has been shown to regulate cytokine release, we assessed the anti-leukemic potential of CD38 inhibition in AML. CD38 expression in AML cells proved to depend on microenvironmental cues and could be significantly enforced through addition of tretinoin. In fact, the anti-CD38 antibody daratumumab showed significant cytostatic efficacy in a 3D in vitro triple-culture model of AML, but with modest cell-autonomous cytotoxic activity and independent of CD38 expression level. In line with a predominantly microenvironment-mediated activity of daratumumab in AML, CD38 inhibition significantly induced antibody-dependent phagocytosis and showed interference with AML cell trafficking in vivo in a xenograft transplantation model, but overall lacked robust anti-leukemic effects.",['(c) 2021.

One module contains several elements of the glycerolipid biosynthesis pathway and operates exclusively in a subset of acute myeloid leukemia cell lines. The proliferation suppressor activity of genes involved in the synthesis of saturated fatty acids, coupled with a more severe loss of fitness phenotype for genes in the desaturation pathway, suggests that these cells operate at the limit of their carrying capacity for saturated fatty acids, which we confirm biochemically.

AML differentiation therapies trigger leukemia maturation and can induce remission, but relapse is prevalent and its cellular origin is unclear. Here we describe high resolution analysis of differentiation therapy response and relapse in a mouse AML model. Triggering leukemia differentiation in this model invariably produces two phenotypically distinct mature myeloid lineages in vivo. Leukemia-derived neutrophils dominate the initial wave of leukemia differentiation but clear rapidly and do not contribute to residual disease. In contrast, a therapy-induced population of mature AML-derived eosinophil-like cells persists during remission, often in extramedullary organs. Using genetic approaches we show that restricting therapy-induced leukemia maturation to the short-lived neutrophil lineage markedly reduces relapse rates and can yield cure. These results indicate that relapse can originate from therapy-resistant mature AML cells, and suggest differentiation therapy combined with targeted eradication of mature leukemia-derived lineages may improve disease outcome.",['(c) 2021.

Lymphoma, melanoma, leukemia, and carcinomas of the lung, esophagus, and breast are the most prevalent causes of these metastases, although they can originate from any malignant tumor. Here we report a case of triple-negative breast cancer with cardiac metastasis mimicking myxoma. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 39-year-old woman presented at the emergency department with shortness of breath. Vital signs were hypotension and tachypnea. There were coarse crackles at the bases of both lungs. Electrocardiography results showed a normal sinus rhythm. Chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly with signs of pulmonary edema. Echocardiography revealed a large left atrial (LA) mass protruding to the mitral valve and attached to the interatrial septum during diastole. The patient was diagnosed with cardiogenic shock, acute kidney injury, elevated liver enzymes, and an LA mass. Surgical excision through median sternotomy was planned. Intraoperatively, an LA mass was found. The histopathology evaluation showed an LA mass with invasive ductal carcinoma of metastatic breast tumors. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) confirmed the diagnosis of triple-negative breast cancer that had metastasized to the heart. Postoperative echocardiography confirmed complete excision of the tumor. DISCUSSION: Breast cancer that has metastasized to the heart is uncommon. This patient was referred to the surgical oncology section for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer with cardiac metastasis. CONCLUSION: A heart mass should be suspected of having metastasized if the patient has a history of malignancy, even if it occurred several years earlier.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors.

Available FLT3 inhibitors (FLT3i) preferentially target inactive or active conformations of FLT3. Moreover, they co-target kinases for normal hematopoiesis, are vulnerable to therapy-associated tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) FLT3 mutants, or lack low nanomolar activity. We show that the tyrosine kinase inhibitor marbotinib suppresses the phosphorylation of FLT3-ITD and the growth of permanent and primary AML cells with FLT3-ITD. This also applies to leukemic cells carrying FLT3-ITD/TKD mutants that confer resistance to clinically used FLT3i. Marbotinib shows high selectivity for FLT3 and alters signaling, reminiscent of genetic elimination of FLT3-ITD. Molecular docking shows that marbotinib fits in opposite orientations into inactive and active conformations of FLT3. The water-soluble marbotinib-carbamate significantly prolongs survival of mice with FLT3-driven leukemia. Marbotinib is a nanomolar next-generation FLT3i that represents a hybrid inhibitory principle.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

However, previous evidence has shown its presence in other species of livestock as well as in humans, suggesting that other species can be accidental hosts of the virus. In viral infections, receptors that are common to different animal species are proposed to be involved in cross-species infections. For BLV, AP3D1 has been proposed to be its receptor, and this protein is conserved in most mammalian species. In Colombia, BLV has been reported in cattle with high prevalence rates, but there has been no evidence of BLV infections in other animal species. In this study, we tested for the virus in sheep (n = 44) and buffaloes (n = 61) from different regions of Colombia by nested PCR, using peripheral blood samples collected from the animals. BLV was found in 25.7% of the animals tested (12 buffaloes and 15 sheep), and the results were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. In addition, to gain more information about the capacity of the virus to infect these species, the predicted interactions of AP3D1 of sheep and buffaloes with the BLV-gp51 protein were analyzed in silico. Conserved amino acids in the binding domains of the proteins were identified. The detection of BLV in sheep and buffaloes suggests circulation of the virus in multiple species, which could be involved in dissemination of the virus in mixed livestock production settings. Due to the presence of the virus in multiple species and the high prevalence rates observed, integrated prevention and control strategies in the livestock industry should be considered to decrease the spread of BLV.","['(c) 2021.

However, it is unclear whether similar regimens are safe and beneficial for the treatment of high-risk APL or pediatric patients with standard-risk APL. Objective: To assess whether treatment with an ATRA and arsenic trioxide-based regimen is safe and allows for the elimination or substantial reduction of chemotherapy use among pediatric patients with standard-risk or high-risk APL, respectively. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Children's Oncology Group AAML1331 study is a nonrandomized, noninferiority trial that examined survival outcomes among 154 pediatric patients with APL compared with a historical control group of patients with APL from the AAML0631 study. Patients aged 1 to 21 years were enrolled at 85 pediatric oncology centers (members of the Children's Oncology Group) in Australia, Canada, and the US from June 29, 2015, to May 7, 2019, with follow-up until October 31, 2020. All patients had newly diagnosed APL and were stratified into standard-risk APL (white blood cell count <10000/muL) and high-risk APL (white blood cell count >/=10000/muL) cohorts. Interventions: All patients received ATRA and arsenic trioxide continuously during induction therapy and intermittently during 4 consolidation cycles. Patients with high-risk APL received 4 doses of idarubicin during induction therapy only. The duration of therapy was approximately 9 months, and no maintenance therapy was administered. Main Outcomes and Measures: Event-free survival (EFS) at 2 years after diagnosis. Results: Among 154 patients (median age, 14.4 years [range, 1.1-21.7 years]; 81 male participants [52.6%]) included in the analysis, 98 patients (63.6%) had standard-risk APL, and 56 patients (36.4%) had high-risk APL. The median follow-up duration was 24.7 months (range, 0-49.5 months) for patients with standard-risk APL and 22.8 months (range, 0-47.7 months) for patients with high-risk APL. Patients with standard-risk APL had a 2-year EFS rate of 98.0% and an overall survival rate of 99.0%; adverse events included 1 early death during induction therapy and 1 relapse. Patients with high-risk APL had a 2-year EFS rate of 96.4% and an overall survival rate of 100%; adverse events included 2 relapses and 0 deaths. These outcomes met predefined noninferiority criteria (noninferiority margin of 10% among those with standard-risk APL and 14.5% among those with high-risk APL). Conclusions and Relevance: In this nonrandomized, noninferiority trial, pediatric patients with standard-risk APL who received treatment with a chemotherapy-free ATRA and arsenic trioxide regimen experienced positive outcomes. Patients with high-risk APL also had positive outcomes when treated with a novel ATRA and arsenic trioxide-based regimen that included 4 doses of idarubicin during induction therapy only and no maintenance therapy. The 2-year EFS estimates were noninferior to the historical comparator group, and advantages of the regimen included shorter treatment duration, lower exposure to anthracycline and intrathecal chemotherapy, and fewer days hospitalized.

METHODS: We searched the Pubmed, Embase, and Web of Science databases and limited the date range for the studies from January 2010 to August 2020. A hazard ratio (HR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was employed to assess overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS), and an odds ratio (OR) with a 95% CI was used to evaluate the ratio of non-relapsed mortality (NRM) and non-relapsed survival (NRS). All analyses were conducted with Stata software 16.0 and Revman 5.3. RESULTS: Fifteen studies, totaling 959 patients, were included in our analysis. Among those patients, 473 underwent allo-HSCT, and 486 received TKI plus chemotherapy. The pooled results showed no difference in OS between outcomes for patients receiving TKI plus chemotherapy and those treated with allo-HSCT (HR = 0.76, 95% CI [0.51-1.12], p = 0.16). Patients undergoing allo-HSCT did better than those receiving TKI plus chemotherapy regarding RFS (HR = 0.48, 95% CI [0.37-0.63], p = 0.00), and NRS (OR = 2.64, 95% CI [1.25-5.57], p = 0.00). The NRM rate of the TKI plus chemotherapy group was significantly lower than the allo-HSCT group (OR = 2.33, 95% CI [1.51-3.59], p = 0.00). CONCLUSION: TKI combined with chemotherapy can be considered a post-remission treatment option for adult Ph+ ALL patients who are ineligible for allo-HSCT.

However, its function in the infiltrating immune cells in breast cancer has not been explored. Our study aimed to analyze the expression of MKL1 in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer dataset. The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlations between MKL1 expression, infiltrating immune cells, and immune control genes. Enriched signaling pathways and drug sensitivity analyses were also performed. Our results indicate that high MKL1 expression could predict better survival in breast cancer patients. MKL1 expression was associated with the expression and function of different immune cells, including T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, neutrophils and dendritic cells (DCs). The chromatin modifying enzymes, cellular senescence, epigenetic regulation of gene expression, estrogen-dependent gene expression, and chromosome maintenance were differentially enriched in MKL1 low expression phenotype. Patients in the high MKL1 expression group showed sensitivity to paclitaxel, while those in the low expression group showed potential sensitivity for cisplatin and docetaxel.

This study aimed to develop and validate the clinical utility of a complementary DNA (cDNA) analysis in parallel with the conventional genomic DNA (gDNA) Sanger sequencing (Ss), as an initial screening test for GATA1 mutations. METHODS: GATA1 mutations were evaluated using both gDNA and cDNA in 14 DS patients using Ss and fragment analysis (FA), respectively. RESULTS: The detection sensitivity of conventional gDNA sequencing was limited in low blast percentage TAM (LBP-TAM); however, cDNA-based Ss readily detected all the pathognomonic GATA1 mutations. The cDNA-based FA readily detected GATA1 frameshift mutation with a reliable sensitivity ranging from 0.005% to 0.01% of clonal cells. CONCLUSIONS: GATA1 mutations are heterogeneous; therefore, we would like to propose a dual cDNA and gDNA analysis as a standard diagnostic approach, especially for LBP-TAM. cDNA-based FA promises an excellent sensitivity for detecting frameshift GATA1 mutations in the longitudinal clonal evolution towards AMKL without using a patient specific primer.",['(c) 2021 John Wiley & Sons

In this prospective observational study, we investigated the impact of cancer type, disease activity, and treatment in 877 unvaccinated UK patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and active haematological cancer. The primary end-point was all-cause mortality. In a multivariate analysis adjusted for age, sex and comorbidities, the highest mortality was in patients with acute leukaemia [odds ratio (OR) = 1.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-2.72, P = 0.017] and myeloma (OR 1.3, 95% CI 0.96-1.76, P = 0.08).

We found no association between recent cytotoxic chemotherapy or anti-CD19/anti-CD20 treatment and increased risk of death within the limitations of the cohort size.

This study aimed to determine the relationship between MTHFR genetic polymorphism and elimination and toxicities of methotrexate (MTX). To do that, the study enrolled 145 patients diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, who received chemotherapy following the Chinese Children's Cancer Group Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (CCCG-ALL)-2015 protocol (clinical trial number: ChiCTR-IPR-14005706). We analyzed the effects of MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms on MTX elimination and toxicities. Patients with the MTHFR C677T TT genotype could tolerate a significantly higher MTX dose than those with the CC/CT genotype. However, patients with C677T TT genotypes had an increased risk of hypokalemia (1.369 to CC and 1.409 to CT types). The MTX infusion rate in patients with the MTHFR A1298C AC genotype was slightly lower than that in those with CC or AA genotypes. Patients with the A1298C AA genotype had a 1.405-fold higher risk of hepatotoxicity than those with the AC genotype (P > 0.05). There was no significant difference between the prevalence of other toxicities among MTHFR C677T or A1298C genotypes (P > 0.05). Neither MTHFR C677T nor A1298C polymorphisms were significantly associated with delayed MTX clearance. To conclude, MTHFR polymorphisms were not good predictors of MTX-related toxicities.","['(c) 2021 Yaqing Shen et al., published by De Gruyter.']","['Shen, Yaqing', 'Wang, Zhujun', 'Zhou, Fen', 'Jin, Runming']","['Shen Y', 'Wang Z', 'Zhou F', 'Jin R']","['Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, 430022, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, 430022, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, 430022, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, 430022, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211106,Poland,Open Life Sci,Open life sciences,101669614,,['Conflict of interest: The authors state no conflict of interest.'],2021/11/12 06:00,2021/11/12 06:01,['2021/11/11 07:03'],"['2021/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/15 00:00 [revised]', '2021/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/11 07:03 [entrez]', '2021/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1515/biol-2021-0121 [doi]', 'biol-2021-0121 [pii]']",epublish,Open Life Sci. 2021 Nov 6;16(1):1203-1212. doi: 10.1515/biol-2021-0121. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8572804,['NOTNLM'],"['CCCG-ALL-2015', 'anticancer drug', 'drug toxicity', 'single nucleotide polymorphism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In treating acute myeloid leukemia (AML), FLT3 gene F691L mutation shows universal resistance to all currently available FLT3 inhibitors. However, there is no particular detection method for FLT3-F691L. Commonly-used first-generation sequencing (FGS) approaches have low sensitivity, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) is time-consuming. Herein, we developed an accurate and sensitive FLT3-F691L diagnostic method by CRISPR detection. Briefly, the FLT3-691 region is amplified by recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and detected by L691-crRNA induced Cas12a reaction, and finally the result can be directly observed under a blue lamp or analyzed by a fluorescence reader. Confirmed by the tests on diluted plasmids and 120 AML patient samples, this method can achieve a sensitivity of 0.1% and complete the whole diagnosis process within 40 min. Potentially, this method will play an important role in point-of-care applications and guidance of AML treatment.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Liu, Chen, Huang, Ma, Huang, Wang and Zhou.']","['Liu, Yin', 'Chen, Yanling', 'Huang, Shisheng', 'Ma, Xiaodong', 'Huang, Xingxu', 'Wang, Xinjie', 'Zhou, Fuling']","['Liu Y', 'Chen Y', 'Huang S', 'Ma X', 'Huang X', 'Wang X', 'Zhou F']","['Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Brain, Cognition and Education Sciences, Institute for Brain Research and Rehabilitation, South China Normal University, Ministry of Education, Guangzhou, China.', 'School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Brain, Cognition and Education Sciences, Institute for Brain Research and Rehabilitation, South China Normal University, Ministry of Education, Guangzhou, China.', 'Shenzhen Branch, Guangdong Laboratory of Lingnan Modern Agriculture, Genome Analysis Laboratory of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Agricultural Genomics Institute at Shenzhen, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciencesn, Shenzhen, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211025,Switzerland,Front Mol Biosci,Frontiers in molecular biosciences,101653173,,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",2021/11/12 06:00,2021/11/12 06:01,['2021/11/11 07:01'],"['2021/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/11 07:01 [entrez]', '2021/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3389/fmolb.2021.753276 [doi]', '753276 [pii]']",epublish,Front Mol Biosci. 2021 Oct 25;8:753276. doi: 10.3389/fmolb.2021.753276. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8574994,['NOTNLM'],"['CRISPR detection', 'F691L mutation', 'FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'drug resistance']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variant of GFI1 (GFI1-36N: serine replaced by asparagine at position 36), has a prevalence of 5-7% among healthy Caucasians and 10-15% in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) predisposing GFI-36N carriers to these diseases. Since GFI1 is implicated in B cell maturation and plasma cell (PC) development, we examined its prevalence in patients with multiple myeloma (MM), a haematological malignancy characterized by expansion of clonal PCs. Strikingly, as in MDS and AML, we found that the GFI1-36N had a higher prevalence among MM patients compared to the controls. In subgroup analyses, GFI1-36N correlates to a shorter overall survival of MM patients characterized by the presence of t(4;14) translocation and gain of 1q21 (</=3 copies). MM patients carrying gain of 1q21 (>/=3 copies) demonstrated poor progression free survival. Furthermore, gene expression analysis implicated a role for GFI1-36N in epigenetic regulation and metabolism, potentially promoting the initiation and progression of MM.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Khandanpour, Eisfeld, Nimmagadda, Raab, Weinhold, Seckinger,', 'Hose, Jauch, Forsti, Hemminki, Hielscher, Hummel, Lenz, Goldschmidt and Huhn.']","['Khandanpour, Cyrus', 'Eisfeld, Christine', 'Nimmagadda, Subbaiah Chary', 'Raab, Marc S', 'Weinhold, Niels', 'Seckinger, Anja', 'Hose, Dirk', 'Jauch, Anna', 'Forsti, Asta', 'Hemminki, Kari', 'Hielscher, Thomas', 'Hummel, Manuela', 'Lenz, Georg', 'Goldschmidt, Hartmut', 'Huhn, Stefanie']","['Khandanpour C', 'Eisfeld C', 'Nimmagadda SC', 'Raab MS', 'Weinhold N', 'Seckinger A', 'Hose D', 'Jauch A', 'Forsti A', 'Hemminki K', 'Hielscher T', 'Hummel M', 'Lenz G', 'Goldschmidt H', 'Huhn S']","['Department of Medicine A, Hematology, Oncology and Pneumology, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology, Oncology and Pneumology, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology, Oncology and Pneumology, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Immunology, Myeloma Center Brussels & Laboratory for Myeloma research, Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Jette, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology and Immunology, Myeloma Center Brussels & Laboratory for Myeloma research, Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Jette, Belgium.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, University Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', ""Hopp Children's Cancer Center (KiTZ), Heidelberg, Germany."", 'Division of Pediatric Neurooncology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Biomedical Center in Pilsen, Charles University in Prague, Pilsen, Czechia.', 'Division of Biostatistics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Biostatistics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Penzberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology, Oncology and Pneumology, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'National Centre of Tumor Diseases, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211025,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,"['Author MH was employed by company Roche Diagnostics GmbH.

It has several reported medical benefits, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. The present study investigated the anti-leukemic effects and the molecular mechanism of punicalagin on NB4 and MOLT-4 leukemic cell lines. Methods: Leukemic cells were treated with punicalagin and cell viability was determined using MTS assay. Apoptosis and autophagy were analyzed by flow cytometry using Annexin V-FITC/PI and anti-LC3/FITC antibodies staining, respectively. Apoptotic and autophagic mRNA expression were determined using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. STITCH bioinformatics tools were used to predict the interaction between punicalagin and its proposed target proteins. Results: Results indicated that punicalagin decreased NB4 and MOLT-4 cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. Punicalagin, in combination with daunorubicin, exhibited synergistic cytotoxic effects. Punicalagin induced apoptosis through the upregulation of caspase-3/-8/-9, Bax and the downregulation of Bcl-2 expression. Punicalagin also promoted autophagy via the downregulation of mTOR and the upregulation of ULK1 expression. Cyclooxygenase-2 and toll-like receptor 4 were found to be involved in punicalagin-induced cell death in punicalagin-targeted protein interactions. Conclusions: These results suggest that punicalagin exerts cytotoxic activities by suppressing proliferation and promoting apoptosis and autophagy by activating the caspase cascade, altering Bax and Bcl-2, and regulating autophagy via mTOR/ULK1 signaling.",['(c)2021 Subkorn et al.'],"['Subkorn, Paweena', 'Norkaew, Chosita', 'Deesrisak, Kamolchanok', 'Tanyong, Dalina']","['Subkorn P', 'Norkaew C', 'Deesrisak K', 'Tanyong D']","['Department of Clinical Microscopy, Faculty of Medical Technology, Mahidol University, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand.', 'Department of Clinical Microscopy, Faculty of Medical Technology, Mahidol University, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand.', 'Department of Clinical Microscopy, Faculty of Medical Technology, Mahidol University, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand.', 'Department of Clinical Microscopy, Faculty of Medical Technology, Mahidol University, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211102,United States,PeerJ,PeerJ,101603425,,['The authors declare there are no competing interests.'],2021/11/12 06:00,2021/11/12 06:01,['2021/11/11 06:57'],"['2021/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/11 06:57 [entrez]', '2021/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7717/peerj.12303 [doi]', '12303 [pii]']",epublish,PeerJ. 2021 Nov 2;9:e12303. doi: 10.7717/peerj.12303. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8570173,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Autophagy', 'Leukemia', 'Pomegranate', 'Punicalagin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cell type distribution plays a major role but requires manual analysis of different cell types in microscopy images. Aims: Automated analysis of bone marrow samples requires detection and classification of different cell types. In this work, we propose and compare algorithms for cell localization, which is a key component in automated bone marrow analysis. Settings and Design: We research fully supervised detection architectures but also propose and evaluate several techniques utilizing weak annotations in a segmentation network. We further incorporate typical cell-like artifacts into our analysis. Whole slide microscopy images are acquired from the human bone marrow samples and annotated by expert hematologists. Subjects and Methods: We adapt and evaluate state-of-the-art detection networks. We further propose to utilize the popular U-Net for cell detection by applying suitable preprocessing steps to the annotations. Statistical Analysis Used: Evaluations are performed on a held-out dataset using multiple metrics based on the two different matching algorithms. Results: The results show that the detection of cells in hematopoietic images using state-of-the-art detection networks yields very accurate results. U-Net-based methods are able to slightly improve detection results using adequate preprocessing - despite artifacts and weak annotations. Conclusions: In this work, we propose, U-Net-based cell detection methods and compare with state-of-the-art detection methods for the localization of hematopoietic cells in high-resolution bone marrow images.

Galectin-9 is a tandem-repeat type galectin expressed in various tumor cells. It seems that the connection between galectin-9 and T cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 receptor acts as a negative regulator of cancer cells proliferation. Experimental approach: In this research, the effects of galectin-9 were investigated using MTS cell proliferation colorimetric, colony-forming, annexin V-FITC/PI, and caspase-3 assays in the Jurkat and KE-37 cell lines of ALL. Furthermore, the western blotting technique was used to evaluate the levels of apoptotic proteins such as Bax and Bcl-2 in these cell lines. Findings/Results: Our results indicated that galectin-9 can considerably reduce the cell growth and colony formation ability of both Jurkat and KE-37 cell lines in a concentration-dependent manner. Besides, galectin-9 induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner in ALL cells by a mechanism associated with Bax/Bcl-2 expression and activation of the caspase-3 activation. Conclusion and implications: Galectin-9 inhibited the growth and proliferation of cell lines with increased programmed cell death, therefore it can be considered as a potential factor in the progression of ALL therapeutics that needs more research in this context.",['Copyright: (c) 2021 Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences.'],"['Zargar Balajam, Narges', 'Shabani, Mahdi', 'Aghaei, Mahmoud']","['Zargar Balajam N', 'Shabani M', 'Aghaei M']","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Isfahan Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, I.R.

Immunodeficiency in these patients has an intense impact on their risk of infection, in turn increasing morbidity and mortality even years after treatment completion. However, these patients with increased risk of severe infectious diseases could be treated with adequate vaccination coverage, but the vaccines' administration can be associated with a decreased immune response and an augmented risk of adverse reactions. Probably, immunogenicity of the inactivated is analogous to that of healthy subjects at the moment of vaccination, but it undertakes a gradual weakening over time. However, the dispensation of live attenuated viral vaccines is controversial because of the risk of the activation of vaccine viruses. A particular immunization schedule should be employed according to the clinical and immunological condition of each of these patients to guarantee a constant immune response without any risks to the patients' health.","['Copyright (c) 2021 Allegra, Tonacci, Musolino, Pioggia and Gangemi.']","['Allegra, Alessandro', 'Tonacci, Alessandro', 'Musolino, Caterina', 'Pioggia, Giovanni', 'Gangemi, Sebastiano']","['Allegra A', 'Tonacci A', 'Musolino C', 'Pioggia G', 'Gangemi S']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Human Pathology in Adulthood and Childhood ""Gaetano Barresi"", University of Messina, Messina, Italy.', 'Clinical Physiology Institute, National Research Council of Italy (IFC-CNR), Pisa, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Human Pathology in Adulthood and Childhood ""Gaetano Barresi"", University of Messina, Messina, Italy.', 'Institute for Biomedical Research and Innovation (IRIB), National Research Council of Italy (CNR), Messina, Italy.', 'School of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Messina, Messina, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20211025,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,IM,"['The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any', 'commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential', 'conflict of interest.']",2021/11/12 06:00,2021/12/24 06:00,['2021/11/11 06:53'],"['2021/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2021/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/11/11 06:53 [entrez]', '2021/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2021.738915 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2021 Oct 25;12:738915. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.738915. eCollection 2021.,,,PMC8573331,['NOTNLM'],"['*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*immunodeficiency', '*infection', '*multiple myeloma', '*vaccination']",20211222,['0 (Vaccines)'],,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunogenicity, Vaccine', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/epidemiology/*immunology/therapy', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/epidemiology/*immunology/therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/epidemiology/*immunology/therapy', 'Opportunistic Infections/epidemiology/*immunology/prevention & control', 'Risk Factors', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Efficacy', 'Vaccines/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",,,,,,,,,,

Method : This cross-sectional study design was performed at Dr. Soetomo Hospital, Surabaya, Indonesia, from August to October 2019. It included ALL children, aged 4-18 years, undergoing the 2013 or 2018 ALL Indonesian Protocol of Chemotherapy, with a cumulative vincristine dose >/= 12 mg / m2. VIPN diagnosis is based on complaints, the Total Neuropathy Score Pediatric Vincristine (TNS-PV), and nerve conduction studies (NCS). The examined risk factors were sex, age, ALL classification, nutritional status, impaired liver function, and cumulative vincristine dose. Results : There were 52 ALL children : median age 7 years, 59.6% boys, 59.6% ALL standard risk, 44.2% experienced impaired liver function at initial ALL diagnosis. Based on a single parameter for diagnosis, 26.9% had VIPN based on complaints, 76.9% had it based on the TNS-PV, and 100% had it based on NCS. VIPN was diagnosed in 25% of children, with predominantly motor impairment and located in lower extremities. Impaired liver function is a risk factor for VIPN in ALL children (p = 0.046, prevalence ratio (PR) 2.84). Conclusion : Impaired liver function is a significant risk factor for VIPN in ALL children.

A large number of clinical trials in AML, MDS, and other hematologic malignancies have assessed hypomethylating agents (HMAs), used alone or in combination with other drugs, in the frontline, maintenance, relapsed/refractory, and peritransplant settings. Effective maintenance therapy has long been a goal for patients with AML in remission. Previous large, randomized clinical trials of maintenance with HMAs or other agents had not shown meaningful improvement in overall survival. Oral azacitidine (Oral-AZA [CC-486]) is approved in the United States, Canada, and European Union for treatment of adult patients with AML in first complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) following intensive induction chemotherapy who are ineligible for hematopoietic cell transplant. Regulatory approvals of Oral-AZA were based on outcomes from the randomized, phase III QUAZAR AML-001 trial, which showed a median overall survival advantage of 9.9 months with Oral-AZA versus placebo. Oral-AZA allows convenient extended AZA dosing for 14 days per 28-day treatment cycle, which is not feasible with injectable AZA. Focusing on AML and MDS, this report reviews the rationale for the use of orally bioavailable AZA and its potential use in all-oral combination therapy regimens; the unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of Oral-AZA compared with injectable AZA; the clinical safety and efficacy of Oral-AZA maintenance therapy in patients with AML in first remission and for treatment of patients with active MDS; and ongoing Oral-AZA clinical trials.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Authors.

Safe and effective antifungal medications used for prophylaxis and treatment are pivotal in their management. Posaconazole is a promising triazole antifungal agent. AREAS COVERED: The authors discuss the pharmacological properties of posaconazole, including pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, safety and tolerability profile, together with efficacy data for prophylaxis and treatment as well as its use in special populations based on current literature. EXPERT OPINION: Posaconazole has a favorable safety and tolerability profile; however, caution is advised when co-administered with agents that are CYP3A4 inhibitors, because their concentration may significantly increase, and their levels should be closely monitored. It has an extended spectrum of activity against yeasts and filamentous fungi. It is successfully used as prophylaxis for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and post-hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). It is the first line treatment for oropharyngeal candidiasis and is also used as a salvage treatment for refractory IFDs. Currently available formulations include the oral suspension, delayed-release tablets and solution for intravenous infusion, all with different PK/PD properties and indications. Its use in children and adolescents is currently being examined in Phase-II clinical trials.",,"['Panagopoulou, Paraskevi', 'Roilides, Emmanuel']","['Panagopoulou P', 'Roilides E']","['4th Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, and Papageorgiou General Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Infectious Diseases Unit, 3rd Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, and Hippokration General Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Basic and Translational Research Unit, Special Unit for Biomedical Research and Education, School of Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211110,England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,IM,,2021/11/12 06:00,2021/11/12 06:00,['2021/11/11 05:36'],"['2021/11/11 05:36 [entrez]', '2021/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/14656566.2021.1996562 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2021 Nov 10:1-25. doi: 10.1080/14656566.2021.1996562.,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Posaconazole', 'aspergillosis', 'azoles', 'candidiasis', 'efficacy', 'invasive fungal diseases', 'prophylaxis', 'rare fungi', 'review', 'safety', 'therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this retrospective study, we have analyzed the prognostic impact of the early response in 1008 newly diagnosed AML patients, who were treated at our institution with intensive chemotherapy followed by consolidation chemotherapy and/or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). We found that early blast persistence has an independent negative prognostic impact on overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) and relapsefree survival (RFS). This negative prognostic impact may only be overcome in patients showing at least a partial remission at the early BM assessment and who subsequently achieve blast clearance by additional induction chemotherapy prior to consolidation therapy with allo-HSCT. In accordance, we propose that the time slope of remission is an additional leukemia-related dynamic parameter that reflects chemosensitivity and thus may inform postinduction therapy decision-making. In addition to patient-related factors, European LeukemiaNet (ELN) risk group, measurable residual disease (MRD) monitoring and donor availability, this may particularly apply to ELN intermediate risk patients, in whom a decision between consolidation chemotherapy and allo-HSCT remains challenging in many cases.",,"['Ihlow, Jana', 'Gross, Sophia', 'Busack, Leonie', 'Florcken, Anne', 'Jesse, Julia', 'Schwarz, Michaela', 'Neuendorff, Nina Rosa', 'Brunneck, Ann-Christin von', 'Anagnostopoulos, Ioannis', 'Turkmen, Seval', 'Blau, Igor Wolfgang', 'Burmeister, Thomas', 'Horst, David', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Westermann, Jorg']","['Ihlow J', 'Gross S', 'Busack L', 'Florcken A', 'Jesse J', 'Schwarz M', 'Neuendorff NR', 'Brunneck AV', 'Anagnostopoulos I', 'Turkmen S', 'Blau IW', 'Burmeister T', 'Horst D', 'Bullinger L', 'Westermann J']","['Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitat Berlin and Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Campus Virchow Clinic, Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353 Berlin, Germany;

Hematopoietic myeloid progenitors replenish more than 25 billion terminally differentiated neutrophils every day under homeostatic conditions and can increase this output in response to stress or infection. At what point along the spectrum of maturation do progenitors lose capacity for self-renewal and become irreversibly committed to differentiation? Using a system of conditional myeloid development that can be toggled between self-renewal and differentiation, we interrogate determinants of this ""point of no return"" in differentiation commitment. Irreversible commitment is due primarily to loss of open regulatory site access and disruption of a positive feedback transcription factor activation loop. Restoration of the transcription factor feedback loop extends the window of cell plasticity and alters the point of no return. These findings demonstrate how the chromatin state enforces and perpetuates cell fate and identify potential avenues for manipulating cell identity.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

We model T cell dynamics by integrating longitudinal, multimodal data from 94,517 bone marrow-derived single T cell transcriptomes in addition to chromatin accessibility and single T cell receptor sequencing from patients undergoing DLI. We find that responsive tumors are defined by enrichment of late-differentiated T cells before DLI and rapid, durable expansion of early differentiated T cells after treatment, highly similar to ""terminal"" and ""precursor"" exhausted subsets, respectively. Resistance, in contrast, is defined by heterogeneous T cell dysfunction. Surprisingly, early differentiated T cells in responders mainly originate from pre-existing and novel clonotypes recruited to the leukemic microenvironment, rather than the infusion.

However, the degree to which CD8(+) T cell fates are influenced by the context in which they encounter cognate tumor antigen is less clear. We previously demonstrated that CD8(+) T cells reactive to a model leukemia antigen were deleted by antigen cross-presenting type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s). Here, through a study of T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic CD8(+) T cells (TCRTg101) reactive to a native C1498 leukemia cell antigen, we uncover a different mode of T cell tolerance in which TCRTg101 undergo progressive expansion and differentiation into an exhausted state. Antigen encounter by TCRTg101 requires leukemia cell major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I expression and is independent of DCs, implying that leukemia cells directly mediate the exhausted TCRTg101 phenotype. Collectively, our data reveal that leukemia antigens are presented to CD8(+) T cells via discrete pathways, leading to distinct tolerant states.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s).

MCL1 is highly unstable, with its stability being regulated by phosphorylation and ubiquitination. Here, we identify acetylation as another critical post-translational modification regulating MCL1 protein stability. We demonstrate that the lysine acetyltransferase p300 targets MCL1 at K40 for acetylation, which is counteracted by the deacetylase sirtuin 3 (SIRT3). Mechanistically, acetylation enhances MCL1 interaction with USP9X, resulting in deubiquitination and subsequent MCL1 stabilization. Therefore, ectopic expression of acetylation-mimetic MCL1 promotes apoptosis evasion of cancer cells, enhances colony formation potential, and facilitates xenografted tumor progression. We further demonstrate that elevated MCL1 acetylation sensitizes multiple cancer cells to pharmacological inhibition of USP9X. These findings reveal that acetylation of MCL1 is a critical post-translational modification enhancing its oncogenic function and provide a rationale for developing innovative therapeutic strategies for MCL1-dependent tumors.",['Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s).

METHODS: Real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR was utilized to test circPVT1 and miR-125b in ALL samples and ALL cell systems. Dual luciferase reporter assay verified the combination of circPVT1 and miR-125b. We utilized circPVAT1 as well as miR-125b's over-expression and low-expression to prove their influence on cell proliferation and invading. RESULTS: We found that more expression of circPVT1 occurred in ALL samples and ALL cell systems. CircPVT1 over-expression promoted ALL cell proliferation and migration besides invading. CircPVT1 low expression inhibited ALL cell proliferation and migration besides invading. MiR-125b was a target combination of circPVT1. CircPVT1 was able to enhance NF-kappaB signal pathway's expression through reducing miR-125b.

We hypothesized that early intervention with ibrutinib would be well tolerated and lead to superior disease control in a subgroup of early-stage patients with CLL. The phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled CLL12 trial randomly assigned asymptomatic, treatment-naive Binet stage A CLL patients at increased risk of progression in a 1:1 ratio to receive ibrutinib (n = 182) or placebo (n = 181) at a dose of 420 mg daily. At a median follow-up of 31 months, the study met its primary endpoint by significantly improving event-free survival in the ibrutinib group (median, not reached vs 47.8 months; hazard ratio = 0.25; 95% confidence interval = 0.14-0.43, P < .0001). Compared with placebo, ibrutinib did not increase overall toxicity, yielding similar incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs). The most common serious AEs were atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, and rash in the ibrutinib group, and basal cell carcinoma, pneumonia, and myocardial infarction in the placebo group. Ibrutinib-associated risk for bleeding (33.5%) was decreased by prohibiting the use of oral anticoagulants through an amendment of the study protocol and by avoiding CYP3A4 drug-drug interactions. Ibrutinib confirms efficacy in CLL patients at an early stage with an increased risk of progression. However, the results do not justify changing the current standard of ""watch and wait.""

Germline GATA1s generating mutations result in congenital anemia in males. We report on two unrelated families harboring germline GATA1s generating mutations in which several members developed acute megakaryoblastic leukemia in early childhood. All evaluable leukemias had acquired trisomy or tetrasomy 21. The leukemia characteristics overlapped those of myeloid leukemia of Down syndrome including age of onset of less than 4 years, unique immunophenotype, complex karyotype, gene expression pattern, and drug sensitivity. These findings demonstrate that the combination of trisomy 21 and GATA1s generating mutations results in a unique myeloid leukemia independent of whether the GATA1 mutation or trisomy 21 is the primary or secondary event and suggest that there is unique functional cooperatively between GATA1s and trisomy 21 in leukemogenesis. The family histories also indicate that germline GATA1s generating mutations should be included among those associated with familial myelodysplastic syndrome and leukemia predisposition.",['Copyright (c) 2021 American Society of Hematology.'],"['Hasle, Henrik', 'Kline, Ronald M', 'Kjeldsen, Eigil', 'Nik-Abdul-Rashid, Nik F', 'Bhojwani, Deepa', 'Verboon, Jeffrey M', 'DiTroia, Stephanie P', 'Chao, Katherine R', 'Raaschou-Jensen, Klas', 'Palle, Josefine', 'Zwaan, C Michel', 'Nyvold, Charlotte Guldborg', 'Sankaran, Vijay G', 'Cantor, Alan B']","['Hasle H', 'Kline RM', 'Kjeldsen E', 'Nik-Abdul-Rashid NF', 'Bhojwani D', 'Verboon JM', 'DiTroia SP', 'Chao KR', 'Raaschou-Jensen K', 'Palle J', 'Zwaan CM', 'Nyvold CG', 'Sankaran VG', 'Cantor AB']","['Pediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'United States Office of Personnel Management, Washington, District of Columbia, United States.', 'Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Hemostasis and Thrombosis Center of Nevada, Sickle Cell Center of Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada, United States.', ""Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, United States."", '7Center for Mendelian Genomics, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, United States.', 'Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States.', 'Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States.', 'Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'Pediatric oncology and haematology, Uppsala, Sweden.', ""10Department of pediatric Oncology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, Netherlands."", 'Odense University Hospital, Odense C, Denmark.', 'Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, United States.', 'Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, United States.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20211110,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,2021/11/11 06:00,2021/11/11 06:00,['2021/11/10 18:03'],"['2021/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2021/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2021/10/13 00:00 [revised]', '2021/11/10 18:03 [entrez]', '2021/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(21)01869-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2021011463 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Blood. 2021 Nov 10. pii: S0006-4971(21)01869-3. doi: 10.1182/blood.2021011463.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-4454-6043', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2897-2410', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4032-6617', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0411-7594', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0044-443X']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Henrik Clausen, Head of the Immunology Laboratory, initiated the project by isolating human group A transferase (AT), whose partial amino acid sequence was key to its success. Sen-itiroh Hakomori, the Scientific Director, provided all the institutional support. The characterization started from the 3 major alleles (A1, B, and O), and proceeded to the alleles of A2, A3, Ax and B3 subgroups and also to the cis-AB and B(A) alleles, which specify the expression of A and B antigens by single alleles. In addition to the identification of allele-specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variations, we also experimentally demonstrated their functional significance in glycosyltransferase activity and sugar specificity of the encoded proteins. Other scientists interested in blood group genes later characterized more than 250 ABO alleles. However, recent developments in next-generation sequencing have enabled the sequencing of millions of human genomes, transitioning from the era of genetics to the era of genomics. As a result, numerous SNP variations have been identified in the coding and noncoding regions of the ABO gene, making ABO one of the most studied loci for human polymorphism. As a tribute to Dr. Hakomori's scientific legacy, a historical overview in molecular genetic/genomic studies of the human ABO gene polymorphism is presented, with an emphasis on early discoveries made at his institute.","['(c) 2021.

We conducted a cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis comparing VEN + R versus six comparators from the Swiss healthcare payer perspective. METHODS: A three-state partitioned survival model, developed in accordance with NICE and ISPOR decision modelling guidelines, was adapted to Switzerland. Model inputs were informed by the MURANO trial (survival data, patient characteristics), publicly available Swiss sources (drug prices, inpatient and outpatient costs), Swiss National Institute of Cancer Epidemiology and Registration data (incidence and prevalence values), and Swiss medical expert feedback. We used published (dis-)utility values and adverse event probabilities. RESULTS: Over a lifetime, VEN + R resulted in an expected gain of 2.60 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient and incremental costs of Swiss Francs (CHF) 147,851 compared to BR, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CHF 56,881/QALY gained. Other treatment strategies (for example ibrutinib versus VEN + R) resulted in higher costs and lower QALYs. Results were not different for subgroups of patients with/without deletion of chromosome 17p/tumour protein 53 mutation. In scenario analysis, changes in post-progression treatment costs demonstrated a high impact on results. We estimated an expected value of perfect information of CHF 3,318/patient. A moderate VEN + R uptake was estimated to save CHF 12.3 million during 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Using a threshold of CHF 100,000 per QALY, VEN + R was projected to be cost-effective vs BR.",['(c) 2021.

In addition to MYC translocations, different secondary genetic abnormalities have been described, some of them with prognostic significance. However, dual translocations of chromosome 14, except those involving chromosome 18, are very rare events in this pathology. Herein, we present the coexistence of translocations t(8;14) and t(14;15) in a pediatric BL/L patient. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a translocation t(14;15)(q32;q22) as a secondary alteration in a BL/L patient. The patient had multiple complications at diagnosis but he evolved favorably reaching complete remission. The description of new secondary alterations in this pathology as well as their impact on clinical evolution, add information to the biological characterization of BL, contributing to a higher accuracy in the diagnosis and/or prognosis of the disease.",['Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

34757220,NLM,Publisher,20211110,2666-6367 (Electronic) 2666-6367 (Linking),,,2021 Oct 29,Male-specific late effects in adult hematopoietic cell transplantation recipients: a systematic review from the Late Effects and Quality of Life Working Committee of the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research and Transplant Complications Working Party of the European Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation.,,S2666-6367(21)01329-4 [pii] 10.1016/j.jtct.2021.10.013 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Male-specific late effects after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) include genital chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), hypogonadism, sexual dysfunction, infertility, and subsequent malignancies, such as prostate, penile, and testicular cancer. They may be closely intertwined and cause prolonged morbidity and decreased quality of life after HCT. OBJECTIVE: Here, we provide a systematic review of male-specific late effects in a collaboration between transplant physicians, endocrinologists, urologists, dermatologists, and sexual health professionals through the Late Effects and Quality of Life Working Committee of the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, and the Transplant Complications Working Party of the European Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation. STUDY DESIGN: We utilized systematic review methodology to summarize incidence, risk factors, screening, prevention and treatment of these complications and provide consensus evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice and future research. RESULTS: Most of the evidence regarding male GvHD is still based on limited data, precluding strong therapeutic recommendations. We therefore recommend to systematically screen for male genital GvHD regularly and report it to large registries to allow for a better understanding. Future research should also address treatment since little published evidence is available to date. Male-specific endocrine consequences of HCT include hypogonadism which may also affect bone health. Since the evidence is scarce, current recommendations for hormone substitution and/or bone health treatment are based on similar principles as for the general population. Following HCT, sexual health decreases and this topic should be addressed at regular intervals. Future studies should focus on interventional strategies to address sexual dysfunction. Infertility remains prevalent in patients having undergone myeloablative conditioning, which warrants offering sperm preservation in all HCT candidates. Most studies on fertility rely on descriptive registry analysis and surveys, hence the importance of reporting post-HCT conception data to large registries. Although the quality of evidence is low, the development of cancer in male genital organs does not seem more prevalent than in the general population; however, subsequent malignancies in general seem to be more prevalent in males than females, and special attention should be given to skin and oral mucosa. CONCLUSION: Male-specific late effects, probably more under-reported than female-specific complications, should be systematically considered during the regular follow-up visits of male survivors who have undergone HCT. Care of patients with male-specific late effects warrants close collaboration between transplant physicians and specialists from other involved disciplines. Future research should be directed towards better data collection on male-specific late effects and on studies about the interrelationship between these late effects, to allow the development of evidence based effective management practices.",['Copyright (c) 2021.

This study aimed at reporting the characteristics, treatment practices and treatment efficacy in HSCT recipients with chronic HCV. METHODS: Prospective observational study from EBMT Infectious Diseases Working Party (IDWP). Patients with chronic HCV infection were included. RESULTS: Between 12/2015 and 07/2018, 45 patients were included: male in 53%; median age 49 years (range, 8-75); acute leukaemia in 48.9%, lymphoma in 17.7%, non-malignant disorders in 22.3%; allogeneic HSCT in 84%; 77.8% no immunosuppressive treatment. Genotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4 were detected in 54.5%, 20.5%, 13.6% and 11.4%, respectively; advanced fibrosis in 40%, including cirrhosis in 11.4%. Overall, 37 (82.2%) patients received DAAs, at a median of 8.4 years after HSCT (16.2% within 6 months from HSCT). Sofosbuvir-based treatment was given to 62.2%. Thirty-five patients completed planned treatment course, with sustained virological response (SVR) of 89.1%, and 94.3% (33/35) in those who completed the treatment. Side effects possibly related to DAAs were reported in 5 (14%) and did not require treatment discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: DAAs treatment was effective, safe and feasible in this cohort of mainly allogeneic HSCT recipients with mild/moderate liver damage.","['Copyright (c) 2021 The British Infection Association.
