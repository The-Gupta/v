It binds to H3K4me3, an active histone mark usually located at transcription start sites (TSSs), through its plant homeo-domain, and is thus recruited and enriched in gene promoters. PHF8 is involved in the development of several types of cancer, including leukemia, prostate cancer, and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Herein we report that PHF8 is an oncogenic protein in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PHF8 is up-regulated in human NSCLC tissues, and high PHF8 expression predicts poor survival. Our in vitro and in vivo evidence demonstrate that PHF8 regulates lung cancer cell proliferation and cellular transformation. We found that PHF8 knockdown induces DNA damage and apoptosis in lung cancer cells. PHF8 promotes miR-21 expression in human lung cancer, and miR-21 knockdown blocks the effects of PHF8 on proliferation and apoptosis of lung cancer cells. In summary, PHF8 promotes lung cancer cell growth and survival by regulating miR-21.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Hence, the evaluation of cellular defense mechanisms is essential in the establishment of new chemotherapeutics. Archazolid B, a novel vacuolar H(+)-ATPase inhibitor, displayed cytotoxicity in the low nanomolar range on a panel of different tumor cell lines. First, we investigated tumor-specific cytotoxicity of archazolid B by comparing cancer to non-cancer cells. Breast, liver and colon cancer cells displayed higher drug sensitivity than corresponding non-tumorous cells, whereas leukemia cell lines were as sensitive as peripheral mononuclear blood cells. Investigating classical drug resistance mechanisms, archazolid B was identified as a possible substrate of the ABC transporters ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein) and ABCG2 (BCRP), whereas collateral sensitivity was observed in ABCB5-expressing cells. Our results pointed to a possible binding competition of archazolid B with verapamil on P-glycoprotein. However, archazolid B did not reverse resistance towards doxorubicin indicating that it might be a substrate but not an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein mediated transport. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of archazolid B was independent of the p53 status of the cell. Mechanisms of aquired resistance were investigated establishing an archazolid B-resistant MCF-7 cell line. Interestingly, drug resistance was not conferred by aberrant expression or DNA mutations of the gene encoding vacuolar H(+)-ATPase subunit c, the direct target of archazolids. Instead, long-term treatment with archazolid B led to a slight overexpression of ABCB1 and a significant overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor and reduced cell growth, all of which can be assumed to contribute to archazolid B resistance.",,"['Hamm, Rebecca', 'Sugimoto, Yoshikazu', 'Steinmetz, Heinrich', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Hamm R', 'Sugimoto Y', 'Steinmetz H', 'Efferth T']","['Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Johannes Gutenberg University, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128, Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140729,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (ATP6V0C protein, human)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (archazolid B)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (EGFR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Vacuolar Proton-Translocating ATPases)']",IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'ErbB Receptors/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Macrolides/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53', 'Vacuolar Proton-Translocating ATPases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']",,,2014/07/30 06:00,2015/06/10 06:00,['2014/07/29 06:00'],"['2014/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-014-0134-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2014 Oct;32(5):893-903. doi: 10.1007/s10637-014-0134-1.

We compared total hospital length of stay in the first 100 days after HCT in 1577 patients with acute leukemia in remission who underwent HCT with an umbilical cord blood (UCB), matched unrelated donor (MUD), or mismatched unrelated donor (MMUD) graft between 2008 and 2011. To ensure a relatively homogenous study population, the analysis was limited to patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first or second complete remission who underwent HCT in the United States. To account for early deaths, we compared the number of days alive and out of the hospital in the first 100 days post-transplantation. For children who received myeloablative conditioning, the median time alive and out of the hospital in the first 100 days was 50 days for single UCB recipients, 54 days for double UCB recipients, and 60 days for MUD bone marrow (BM) recipients. In multivariate analysis, use of UCB was significantly associated with fewer days alive and out of the hospital compared with MUD BM. For adults who received myeloablative conditioning, the median time alive and out of the hospital in first 100 days was 52 days for single UCB recipients, 55 days for double UCB recipients, 69 days for MUD BM recipients, 75 days for MUD peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) recipients, 63 days for MMUD BM recipients, and 67 days for MMUD PBSC recipients. In multivariate analysis, UCB and MMUD BM recipients had fewer days alive and out of the hospital compared with recipients of other graft sources. For adults who received a reduced-intensity preparative regimen, the median time alive and out of the hospital during the first 100 days was 65 days for single UCB recipients, 63 days for double UCB recipients, 79 days for MUD PBSC recipients, and 79 days for MMUD PBSC recipients. Similar to the other 2 groups, receipt of UCB was associated with a fewer days alive and out of the hospital. In conclusion, length of stay in the first 100 days post-transplantation varies by graft source and is longer for UCB HCT recipients. These data provide insight into the resource needs of patients who undergo HCT with these various graft sources.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

We hypothesized that a CNI-free regimen consisting of post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy) and brief-course sirolimus would reduce chronic GVHD and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) after reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). Twenty-six patients (median age, 61 years) underwent unmanipulated PBSCT from an 8/8 locus-matched donor (matched related donor, n = 17; natched unrelated donor, n = 9). GVHD prophylaxis consisted of PTCy and brief-course sirolimus. Donor engraftment occurred in all patients. The cumulative incidence (CI) of grade II-IV acute GVHD, grade III-IV acute GVHD, and chronic GVHD was 46%, 15%, and 31% respectively. One-year NRM was 4%. The median time to immunosuppression discontinuation was day +138. With a median follow-up of 20 months, the estimated 2-year overall survival was 71%, estimated disease-free survival was 64%, and estimated relapse incidence was 32%. In patients with a lymphoid malignancy (eg, chronic lymphoblastic leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin disease), 2-year disease-free survival was 100%, and there were no relapses. Good immune reconstitution was evidenced by low cytomegalovirus reactivation rate of 21% (4 of 19 at-risk patients).

The signalling cascade linking microtubule disruption to MCL1 degradation remains however to be defined. Here, we establish an in vivo screening strategy in Caenorhabditis elegans to uncover genes involved in chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Using an RNAi-based screen, we identify three genes required for vincristine-induced apoptosis. We show that the DEP domain protein LET-99 acts upstream of the heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunit GPA-11 to control activation of the stress kinase JNK-1. The human homologue of LET-99, DEPDC1, similarly regulates vincristine-induced cell death by promoting JNK-dependent degradation of the BCL-2 family protein MCL1.

Patients with MDACC score point >/=38, at any level of beta2-microglobulin and irrespective of whether they fulfilled 2008 International Workshop on CLL (IWCLL) criteria for CLL Rai stage 0 or cMBL, experienced the worst clinical outcome (5-year TTFT, 24%) and formed the high-risk group. In contrast, subjects with a diagnosis of cMBL, MDACC score point <38 and beta2-microglobulin </= UNL had the best clinical outcome (5-year TTFT, 100%) and constituted the low-risk group. The intermediate group included patients in Rai stage 0, MDACC score point <38, and any level of beta2-microglobulin, and patients with cMBL, MDACC score point <38, and beta2-microglobulin >/= UNL. Cases showing these features can be grouped together to form the intermediate-risk group (5-year TTFT, 65%). Although the separation between cMBL and Rai stage 0, as proposed by the 2008 IWCLL guidelines, has clinical implications, the model we propose may help to classify patients with cMBL and Rai stage 0 into more precise subgroups suggesting that a prognostic separation of these entities based solely on clonal B-cell threshold may be unsatisfactory.",,"['Molica, Stefano', 'Giannarelli, Diana', 'Levato, Luciano', 'Mirabelli, Rosanna', 'Gentile, Massimo', 'Lentini, Mirella', 'Morabito, Fortunato']","['Molica S', 'Giannarelli D', 'Levato L', 'Mirabelli R', 'Gentile M', 'Lentini M', 'Morabito F']","['Department of Oncology-Hematology, Pugliese-Ciaccio Hospital Center, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, Viale Pio X, 88100, Catanzaro, Italy, smolica@libero.it.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20140727,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Single-Domain Antibodies)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Cohort Studies', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/drug therapy/metabolism/mortality', 'Lymphocytosis/*diagnosis/drug therapy/metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Research Design', 'Single-Domain Antibodies/blood', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/blood']",,,2014/07/30 06:00,2015/04/07 06:00,['2014/07/28 06:00'],"['2014/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/03 00:00 [revised]', '2014/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-014-1634-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2014 Sep;100(3):290-5. doi: 10.1007/s12185-014-1634-7.

This heterogeneity is rarely taken into account in therapies, so it is still essential to look for new specific drugs for leukemia subtypes or even for therapy-resistant cases. Naphthoquinones (NQ) are considered privileged structures in medicinal chemistry due to their plethora of biological activities, including antimicrobial and anticancer effects. Nitrogen-containing heterocycles such as 1,2,3-1H-triazoles have been identified as general scaffolds for generating glycosidase inhibitors. In the present study, the NQ and 1,2,3-1H-triazole cores have been combined to chemically synthesize 18 new 1,2-furanonaphthoquinones tethered to 1,2,3-1H-triazoles (1,2-FNQT). Their cytotoxicities were evaluated against four different leukemia cell lines, including MOLT-4 and CEM (lymphoid cell lines) and K562 and KG1 (myeloid cell lines), as well as normal human peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMCs). The new 1,2-FNQT series showed high cytotoxic potential against all leukemia cell lines tested, and some compounds (12o and 12p) showed even better results than the classical therapeutic compounds such as doxorubicin or cisplatin. Others compounds, such as 12b, are promising because of their high selectivity against lymphoblastic leukemia and their low activity against normal hematopoietic cells. The cells of lymphoid origin (MOLT and CEM) were generally more sensitive than the myeloid cell lines to this series of compounds, and most of the compounds that showed the highest cytotoxicity were similarly active against both cell lines.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Patients were classified into low stage (Rai stage 0/I/II) and high stage (Rai stage III/IV). Gene expression profiles were obtained on pretreatment samples using the HG-U133A 2.0 Affymetrix platform. A comparison of low versus high stage CLL revealed a set of 21 genes differentially expressed genes. 15 genes were up regulated in the high stage compared to low stage while 6 genes were down regulated. Analysis of GO molecular function revealed 9 of 21 genes were involved in transcription factor activity. Serum cytokine profiles showed six cytokines to be significantly different in high stage patients. Two chemokines, SDF-1/CXCL12 and uPAR known to be involved in stem cell mobilization and homing were increased in serum of high stage patients.

Though there is experimental evidence for presence of dehydro amino acids in human proteins, no eukaryotic homologs of these lyases have been identified as of today. A comprehensive genome-wide search for identifying phosphothreonine lyase homologs in eukaryotes was carried out. Our fold-based search revealed structural and catalytic site similarity between bacterial phosphothreonine lyases and BLES03 (basophilic leukemia-expressed protein 03), a human protein with unknown function. Ligand induced conformational changes similar to bacterial phosphothreonine lyases, and movement of crucial arginines in the loop region to the catalytic pocket upon binding of phosphothreonine-containing peptides was seen during docking and molecular dynamics studies. Genome-wide search for BLES03 homologs using sensitive profile-based methods revealed their presence not only in eukaryotic classes such as chordata and fungi but also in bacterial and archaebacterial classes. The synteny of these archaebacterial BLES03-like proteins was remarkably similar to that of type IV lantibiotic synthetases which harbor LanL-like phosphothreonine lyase domains. Hence, context-based analysis reinforced our earlier sequence/structure-based prediction of phosphothreonine lyase catalytic function for BLES03. Our in silico analysis has revealed that BLES03-like proteins with previously unknown function are novel eukaryotic phosphothreonine lyases involved in biosynthesis of dehydro amino acids, whereas their bacterial and archaebacterial counterparts might be involved in biosynthesis of natural products similar to lantibiotics.","['(c) The Author(s) 2014.

The number of patients that undergo radiation as a part of their therapy regimen is only increasing every year, but this does not come without cost. As this number increases, so too does the incidence of secondary, radiation-induced neoplasias, creating a need for therapeutic agents targeted specifically towards incidence reduction and treatment of these cancers. Development and efficacy testing of these agents requires not only extensive in vitro testing but also a set of reliable animal models to accurately recreate the complex situations of radiation-induced carcinogenesis. As radiation-induced leukemic progression often involves genomic changes such as rearrangements, deletions, and changes in methylation, the laboratory mouse Mus musculus, with its fully sequenced genome, is a powerful tool in cancer research. This fact, combined with the molecular and physiological similarities it shares with man and its small size and high rate of breeding in captivity, makes it the most relevant model to use in radiation-induced leukemia research.

There are innumerable potential applications for these procedures in laboratory research and clinical therapeutic interventions. One paradigmatic example is the genetic modification of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). These are rare nucleated cells which reside in a specialized microenvironment within the bone marrow, and have the potential to self-renew and/or differentiate into all hematopoietic lineages. Due to their enormous regenerative capacity in steady state or under stress conditions these cells are routinely used in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation to reconstitute the hematopoietic system in patients with metabolic, inflammatory, malignant, and other hematologic disorders. For patients lacking a matched bone marrow donor, gene therapy of autologous hematopoietic stem cells has proven to be an alternative as highlighted recently by several successful gene therapy trials. Genetic modification of HSPCs using retrovirus vectors requires ex vivo manipulation to efficiently introduce the new genetic material into cells (transduction). Optimal culture conditions are essential to facilitate this process while preserving the stemness of the cells.

In the present study, we examined the effects of AC on cell cycle arrest in vitro in HL-60 cells and on tumor regression in vivo using an athymic nude mouse model. We found that AC (20-80 mug mL(-1)) treatment significantly induced G1 cell-cycle arrest in HL-60 cells by reducing the levels of cyclin D1, CDK4, cyclin E, CDK2, cyclin A, and phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (p-Rb). Moreover, AC treatment led to significantly increased protein expression levels of CDK inhibitors, including p21(WAF1) and p15(NIK4B). Additionally, AC treatment markedly induced intracellular ROS generation and mitochondrial dysfunction in HL-60 cells. Furthermore, the in vivo study results revealed that AC treatment was effective in terms of delaying the tumor incidence in nude mice that had been inoculated with HL-60 cells as well as in reducing the tumor burden. Histological analysis confirmed that AC treatment significantly modulated the xenografted tumor progression as demonstrated by a reduction in mitotic cells.

Most characteristic are neurofibromas which occur in almost all NF1 patients at some point in lifetime. Although neurofibromas are benign tumors they can be disfiguring and plexiform neurofibromas may progress to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Overall survival rates of patients with these malignant tumors are poor. Other neoplasias frequently observed in NF1 patients are pilocytic astrocytomas, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, pheochromocytomas and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Several other tumors have been reported in NF1 patients but it is unclear if there is a true association between the particular tumor type and NF1. Some of these tumors might be caused by a rare recessively inherited childhood cancer syndrome termed constitutive mismatch repair deficiency syndrome which shows certain phenotypic overlap with NF1 but includes a broad spectrum of tumors which usually do not occur in NF1. The development of NF1-associated tumors is largely explained by the underlying defect of the NF1 gene which results in activation of the RAS proto-oncogene- a key mechanism of tumorigenesis. Several downstream effectors of activated RAS as well as cooperating molecular pathways have been identified. These insights provide the basis to develop novel targeted treatment strategies which are urgently needed to improve the outcome for patients with NF1-associated malignancies.",['(c) Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

PATIENTS AND METHOD: We studied the expression of nerve growth factor/tumor necrosis factor receptor (NGFR/TNFR)/ligand family members on 108 primary BCP-ALL samples by flow cytometry and compared both their baseline expression and CD40-induced modulation on TEL-AML positive and negative leukemia samples. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrate that TEL-AML positive patients exhibit a significantly higher percentage of CD40, CD27 and p75NTR positive blasts at diagnosis. This might well contribute to the improved relapse-free survival of these patients assessed in Kaplan Meier analysis as CD27 and p75NTR directly mediate apoptotic signals. Furthermore CD40 ligation enhances antigen presenting and T cell stimulatory capacity via significant up regulation of CD70 while adequate response to physiological maturation signals as indicated by concomitant down regulation of CD27 is retained in TEL-AML positive leukemia. CONCLUSION: These data provide novel insights in immunological control mechanisms preserved in this leukemia subtype and suggest that not only treatment with chemicals such as HDAC inhibitors but also retained in vivo response to CD40 ligation contributes to improved immune surveillance in these patients which may add to a superior relapse-free survival observed particularly in the presence of other risk factors.",['(c) Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

Increased expression of diabetic marker miR-29 family miRNAs (miR-29a, b and c) that suppress the pro-survival protein Myeloid Cell Leukemia 1(MCL-1) is reported in pancreatic beta-cells in Type 1 DM. Whether an up-regulation of miR-29 family miRNAs and suppression of MCL-1 (dysregulation of miR-29-MCL-1 axis) occurs in diabetic heart is not known. This study tested the hypothesis that insulin regulates cardiac miR-29-MCL-1 axis and its dysregulation correlates with DM progression. In vitro studies with mouse cardiomyocyte HL-1 cells showed that insulin suppressed the expression of miR-29a, b and c and increased MCL-1 mRNA. Conversely, Rapamycin (Rap), a drug implicated in the new onset DM, increased the expression of miR-29a, b and c and suppressed MCL-1 and this effect was reversed by transfection with miR-29 inhibitors. Rap inhibited mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling in HL-1 cells. Moreover, inhibition of either mTORC1 substrate S6K1 by PF-4708671, or eIF4E-induced translation by 4E1RCat suppressed MCL-1. We used Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat, a rodent model for DM, to test whether dysregulation of cardiac miR-29-MCL-1 axis correlates with DM progression. 11-week old ZDF rats exhibited significantly increased body weight, plasma glucose, insulin, cholesterol, triglycerides, body fat, heart weight, and decreased lean muscle mass compared to age-matched lean rats. Rap treatment (1.2 mg/kg/day, from 9-weeks to 15-weeks) significantly reduced plasma insulin, body weight and heart weight, and severely dysregulated cardiac miR-29-MCL1 axis in ZDF rats.

OBJECTIVE: To assess method performance, interlaboratory precision, and different IS standardization modalities in representative laboratories performing routine BCR-ABL1 testing. DESIGN: Fifteen blinded test specimens with 5-level nominal BCR-ABL1 to ABL1 IS percentage ratios ranging from 5% to 0.0005% and 4-level secondary IS reference panels, the ARQ IS Calibrator Panels, were tested by relative quantitative polymerase chain reaction in 15 laboratories in 5 countries. Both raw and IS percentage ratios calculated by using local conversion factors (CFs) or analytic correction parameters (CPs) were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 670 valid positive results were generated. BCR-ABL1 detection was associated with variable ABL1 quality metric passing rates (P < .001) and reached at least 0.01% in 13 laboratories. Intralaboratory precision was within 2.5-fold for all sample levels combined with a relative mean difference greater than 5-fold across laboratories. International Scale accuracy was increased by using both the CF and CP standardization methods. Classification agreement for major molecular response status was 90% after CF conversion and 93% after CP correction, with precision improved by 3-fold for the CP method. CONCLUSIONS: Despite preanalytic and analytic differences between laboratories, conversion and correction are effective IS standardization methods. Validated secondary reference materials can facilitate global diffusion of the IS without the need to perform sample exchange and improve the accuracy and precision of BCR-ABL1 quantitative measurements, including at low levels of residual disease.",,"['Griffiths, Michael', 'Patton, Simon J', 'Grossi, Alberto', 'Clark, Jordan', 'Paz, Maria Fe', 'Labourier, Emmanuel']","['Griffiths M', 'Patton SJ', 'Grossi A', 'Clark J', 'Paz MF', 'Labourier E']","[""From West Midlands Regional Genetics Laboratory, Birmingham Women's NHS Foundation Trust, and School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom (Mr Griffiths); the European Molecular Genetics Quality Network, Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine, St Mary's Hospital, Manchester, United Kingdom (Dr Patton); Oncology Unit, Ospedale di Prato, Prato, Italy (Dr Grossi); United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Schemes, Sheffield, United Kingdom (Mr Clark); Labceutics, Belfast, United Kingdom (Dr Fe Paz); and Asuragen, Austin, Texas (Dr Labourier).

NO-aspirin is a novel drug that has efficacy against a number of solid tumours, and can inhibit Wnt signaling, and although we have shown Wnt signaling to be important for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell proliferation and survival inhibition of Wnt signaling does not appear to be involved in the induction of ALL cell death. Treatment of B lineage ALL cell lines and patient ALL cells with NO-aspirin induced rapid apoptotic cell death mediated via the extrinsic death pathway. Apoptosis was dependent on caspase-10 in association with the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) incorporating pro-caspase-10 and tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNF-R1). There was no measurable increase in TNF-R1 or TNF-alpha in response to NO-aspirin, suggesting that the process was ligand-independent. Consistent with this, expression of silencer of death domain (SODD) was reduced following NO-aspirin exposure and lentiviral mediated shRNA knockdown of SODD suppressed expansion of transduced cells confirming the importance of SODD for ALL cell survival.

The main impact of the fusion itself is to generate and sustain a clone of clinically silent preleukemic B-cell progenitors (BCP). Additional oncogenic hits, occurring even several years later, are required for overt disease. The understanding of the features and interactions of ETV6-RUNX1-positive cells during this ""latency"" period may explain how these silent cells can persist and whether they could be prone to additional genetic changes. In this study, two in vitro murine models were used to investigate whether ETV6-RUNX1 alters the cellular adhesion and migration properties of BCP. ETV6-RUNX1-expressing cells showed a significant defect in the chemotactic response to CXCL12, caused by a block in CXCR4 signaling, as demonstrated by inhibition of CXCL12-associated calcium flux and lack of ERK phosphorylation. Moreover, the induction of ETV6-RUNX1 caused changes in the expression of cell-surface adhesion molecules. The expression of genes regulating the cytoskeleton was also affected, resulting in a block of CDC42 signaling. The abnormalities described here could alter the interaction of ETV6-RUNX1 preleukemic BCP with the microenvironment and contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. IMPLICATIONS: Alterations in the expression of cytoskeletal regulatory genes and migration properties of BCP represent early events in the evolution of the disease, from the preleukemic phase to the clinical onset, and suggest new strategies for effective eradication of leukemia.",['(c)2014 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Palmi, Chiara', 'Fazio, Grazia', 'Savino, Angela M', 'Procter, Julia', 'Howell, Louise', 'Cazzaniga, Valeria', 'Vieri, Margherita', 'Longinotti, Giulia', 'Brunati, Ilaria', 'Andre, Valentina', 'Della Mina, Pamela', 'Villa, Antonello', 'Greaves, Mel', 'Biondi, Andrea', ""D'Amico, Giovanna"", 'Ford, Anthony', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni']","['Palmi C', 'Fazio G', 'Savino AM', 'Procter J', 'Howell L', 'Cazzaniga V', 'Vieri M', 'Longinotti G', 'Brunati I', 'Andre V', 'Della Mina P', 'Villa A', 'Greaves M', 'Biondi A', ""D'Amico G"", 'Ford A', 'Cazzaniga G']","['Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica, Universita di Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica, Universita di Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica, Universita di Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Centre for Evolution and Cancer, Division of Molecular Pathology, The Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, United Kingdom.', 'Haemato-Oncology Research Unit, Division of Molecular Pathology, The Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, United Kingdom.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica, Universita di Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica, Universita di Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica, Universita di Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica, Universita di Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica, Universita di Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Microscopy and Image Analysis Consortium, Universita di Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Microscopy and Image Analysis Consortium, Universita di Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Centre for Evolution and Cancer, Division of Molecular Pathology, The Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, United Kingdom.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica, Universita di Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy. abiondi.unimib@gmail.com.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica, Universita di Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Centre for Evolution and Cancer, Division of Molecular Pathology, The Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, United Kingdom.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica, Universita di Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140724,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (CXCR4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cdc42 protein, mouse)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Cxcl12 protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Movement', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CXCL12/*metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cytoskeleton/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/*cytology/metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein/*metabolism']",,,2014/07/26 06:00,2015/08/15 06:00,['2014/07/26 06:00'],"['2014/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1541-7786.MCR-14-0056-T [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-14-0056-T [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2014 Dec;12(12):1796-806. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-14-0056-T.

An alternative approach is to inhibit downstream of mTORC1; therefore, acquired resistance to fludarabine (Flu), a purine analogue and antimetabolite chemotherapy, active agent for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was investigated. Elevated phospho-p70S6K, also known as RPS6KB1 (ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 70kDa, polypeptide 1) (T389), an mTORC1 activation marker, predicted Flu resistance in a panel of B-cell lines, isogenic Flu-resistant (FluR) derivatives, and primary human CLL cells. Consistent with the anabolic role of mTORC1, FluR cells had higher rates of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation than Flu-sensitive (FluS) cells. Rapalogs (everolimus and rapamycin) induced moderate cell death in FluR and primary CLL cells, and everolimus significantly inhibited glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in FluR cells. Strikingly, the higher oxidative phosphorylation in FluR cells was not coupled to higher ATP synthesis. Instead, it contributed primarily to an essential, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase catalyzed, step in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. mTORC1 promotes pyrimidine biosynthesis by p70S6 kinase-mediated phosphorylation of CAD (carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase; Ser1859) and favors S-phase cell-cycle progression. We found increased phospho-CAD (S1859) and higher S-phase population in FluR cells. Pharmacological inhibition of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis using N-phosphonacetyl-l-aspartate and leflunomide, RNAi-mediated knockdown of p70S6K, and inhibition of mitochondrial respiration were selectively cytotoxic to FluR, but not FluS, cells.

FOXO3a polymorphisms have not been reported previously associated with an increased risk for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In this study, the rs4946936 polymorphism located in the 3'UTR of FOXO3a was selected to evaluate its relationship with a risk for ALL in Chinese children. METHODS: Questionnaires, SNaPshot genotyping, real-time PCR, cell transfection and dual luciferase reporter assays were used in this study. RESULTS: Parental alcohol consumption and whether the child's house had been painted had significantly different distributions among the cases and controls. In addition, the C to T mutation was significantly associated with the risk for ALL. We determined that FOXO3a expression levels in patients with the CT or TT genotype were significantly higher than those of patients with the CC genotype. The T allele significantly increased the expression levels in luciferase assays and affected the binding affinity of miR-223 to the FOXO3a 3'UTR. CONCLUSION: Rs4946936 in FOXO3a was highly associated with an increased risk of childhood ALL in a Chinese population.","['(c) 2014 S.

Chromosomal MYC rearrangements and consequent MYC overexpression is the defining lesion in Burkitt lymphoma (BL), conferring a highly proliferative state. However, abnormalities of MYC are increasingly appreciated in non-BL histologies, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and B-cell lymphomas intermediate between BL and DLBCL, with a particularly aggressive clinical phenotype. Although there are conflicting data regarding prognostic implications of isolated MYC aberrancy in these non-BLs, the co-occurrence of MYC rearrangements and either the antiapoptotic gene B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) or the transcriptional repressor BCL6 leads to an entity termed double-hit B-cell lymphoma (DHL) (or triple-hit if all 3 abnormalities are observed) with a particularly poor prognosis and no established treatment paradigms. Notably, a distinct pattern of gene expression profiling has been noted when MYC is overexpressed in BL compared with other lymphomas, supporting the notion that, although MYC promotes target gene transcription, the target genes vary by disease subtype. The frequency of MYC activity depends on the method of detection and ranges from 5% to 10% using fluorescence in situ hybridization but up to 30% of DLBCL using immunohistochemistry. Standard therapies developed for DLBCL are less effective when the disease is driven by MYC, leading to lower response rates and response durations. An important clinical challenge is to pre-emptively identify MYC-associated lymphomas and to subsequently develop trials specifically for this group of patients. However, the design of such studies is complicated by variable definitions of MYC-associated lymphoid malignancies and the lack of effective therapies to date. The objective if the current review was to evaluate the implications of MYC aberrancy with respect to the B-cell lymphoma double-hit and triple-hit phenotypes and to consider the available data for clinical and practical management.",['(c) 2014 American Cancer Society.'],"['Petrich, Adam M', 'Nabhan, Chadi', 'Smith, Sonali M']","['Petrich AM', 'Nabhan C', 'Smith SM']","['Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20140724,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (BCL6 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)']",IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', '*Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['BCL2', 'MYC', 'aggressive lymphoma', 'double-hit', 'lymphoma']",2014/07/26 06:00,2015/02/26 06:00,['2014/07/26 06:00'],"['2014/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/13 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.28899 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2014 Dec 15;120(24):3884-95. doi: 10.1002/cncr.28899.

However, despite the high efficacy of IM, clinical resistance develops due to a heterogeneous array of mechanisms. Pharmacogenetic variability as a result of genetic polymorphisms could be one of the most important factors influencing resistance to IM. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between genetic variations in drug efflux transporter ABCC1 (MRP1) and ABCC2 (MRP2) genes and response to IM in patients with CML. METHODS: We genotyped 215 Malaysian patients with CML (comprising of two groups with 108 IM resistant and 107 IM responsive) for polymorphisms of ABCC1 (2012G>T and 2168G>A) and ABCC2 (-24C>T, 1249G>A and 3972C>T) genes. Genotype, allele and haplotype frequencies were compared between two groups of patients. Patients with CML were further stratified according to their clinical response to IM into those having cytogenetics and molecular responses, and the associations with genotypes were evaluated. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We observed no significant differences in the distribution of any of the tested genotypes between the investigated groups. However, on evaluating the risk association, ABCC2 T(-)(2)(4) G(1)(2)(4)(9) T(3)(9)(7)(2) haplotype was found to be associated with IM resistance (P = 0.046). These results suggest that haplotype variants -24T and 3972T might be associated with lower expression of ABCC2 protein and reduced transport activity and hence might be contributing to development of IM resistance. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Our results suggest the ABCC2 T(-)(2)(4) G(1)(2)(4)(9) T(3)(9)(7)(2) haplotype was associated with imatinib resistance. However, the evidence is as yet insufficient to establish this haplotype as a predictive biomarker for response to the drug.",['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Au, A', 'Baba, A A', 'Azlan, H', ""Norsa'adah, B"", 'Ankathil, R']","['Au A', 'Baba AA', 'Azlan H', ""Norsa'adah B"", 'Ankathil R']","['Human Genome Centre, School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Kubang Kerian, Kelantan, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140724,England,J Clin Pharm Ther,Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,8704308,"['0 (ABCC2 protein, human)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 2)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alleles', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Asians/genetics', 'Benzamides/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Malaysia', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 2', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/*genetics', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['ABCC1', 'ABCC2', 'chronic myeloid leukaemia', 'genetic polymorphisms', 'imatinib resistance']",2014/07/26 06:00,2015/06/27 06:00,['2014/07/26 06:00'],"['2014/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jcpt.12197 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pharm Ther. 2014 Dec;39(6):685-90. doi: 10.1111/jcpt.12197.

However, there has been limited efficacy, most often because of inadequate achievement of FLT3 inhibition through a variety of mechanisms. In a previous study, TTT-3002 was identified as a novel FLT3 inhibitor with the most potent activity to date against FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3/ITD) mutations. Here, the activity of TTT-3002 is demonstrated against a broad spectrum of FLT3-activating point mutations, including the most frequently occurring D835 mutations. The compound is also active against a number of point mutations selected for in FLT3/ITD alleles that confer resistance to other TKIs, including the F691L gatekeeper mutation. TTT-3002 maintains activity against patients with relapsed AML samples that are resistant to sorafenib and AC220. Studies utilizing human plasma samples from healthy donors and patients with AML indicate that TTT-3002 is only moderately protein bound compared with several other TKIs currently in clinical trials. Tumor burden of mice in a FLT3 TKI-resistant transplant model is significantly improved by oral dosing of TTT-3002. Therefore, TTT-3002 has demonstrated preclinical potential as a promising new FLT3 TKI that may overcome some of the limitations of other TKIs in the treatment of FLT3-mutant AML.

Recently, HPIP was demonstrated to promote breast cancer cell proliferation and hepatocellular carcinoma growth. Moreover, it has been revealed that homeobox and PBX proteins, the expression of which is regulated by HPIP, play key roles in cancer of various organs, including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Nevertheless, there has not been any study regarding the role of HPIP in OSCC. This study investigated the expression of HPIP in normal oral mucosa, epithelial precursor lesion (OEPL), and OSCC, and the functional roles of HPIP in OSCC cells and normal keratinocytes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemical analysis of HPIP, Ki-67, and involucrin was performed in OSCC specimens, and the change in involucrin expression following RNA interference treatment against HPIP was examined by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis in SCC9 and NHEK cells undergoing extracellular calcium-induced differentiation. Matrigel transwell and cell proliferation assays for both cell lines transfected with HPIP siRNA were also conducted. RESULTS: HPIP expression increased in OEPL and OSCC specimens. In vitro analysis revealed that HPIP suppressed differentiation and proliferation of SCC9 cells and transwell migration of NHEK cells, while HPIP promoted invasion of SCC9 and proliferation of NHEK cells. However, HPIP has no significant effect on NHEK cell differentiation. CONCLUSION: HPIP may play a critical role in oral carcinogenesis and is thus a potential target for anticancer therapy, with particular emphasis on its involvement in differentiation and migration/metastasis.",['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

However, microscopically counting ATL cells based on morphology requires experience and tends to be inaccurate due to the rarity of ATL. METHODS: Based on our research showing that acute-type ATL cells are specifically enriched in the CD4+/CD7- (CD7N) fraction, a new analytical method to accurately quantify ATL cells was established using an internal bead standard and simple four-color flow cytometry. This method was verified by comparison with microscopic examination of 49 peripheral blood samples and used to follow up patients. RESULTS: A strong correlation was observed between the number of CD7N cells measured by flow cytometry and the number of abnormal lymphocytes measured microscopically by experienced technicians [Pearson's R, 0.963; Spearman's rho, 0.921; intercorrelation coefficient, 0.962]. The linear regression coefficient was close to 1 (beta=1.013). Our method could detect 1 cell/muL, and the limit of quantitation was between 2.9 and 9.8 cells/muL. The frequency of CD7N cells among CD4+ cells changed during chemotherapy, which reflected differences between chemosensitive and chemoresistant cases. Kaplan-Meier analysis with a log-rank test showed that patients with decreased CD7N proportion after chemotherapy had significantly longer disease-specific survival (p=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Our newly established method quantified tumor cells in patients with acute-type ATL. Furthermore, this method was useful for assessing the efficacy of chemotherapy, and the change of the CD7N proportion could be more important to predict prognosis.",,"['Ishigaki, Tomohiro', 'Zaike, Yuji', 'Nojima, Masanori', 'Kobayashi, Seiichiro', 'Ohno, Nobuhiro', 'Uchimaru, Kaoru', 'Tojo, Arinobu', 'Nakauchi, Hiromitsu', 'Watanabe, Nobukazu']","['Ishigaki T', 'Zaike Y', 'Nojima M', 'Kobayashi S', 'Ohno N', 'Uchimaru K', 'Tojo A', 'Nakauchi H', 'Watanabe N']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Clin Chem Lab Med,Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,9806306,['0 (CD4 Antigens)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'CD4 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cell Count', 'Color', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2014/07/26 06:00,2015/08/13 06:00,['2014/07/26 06:00'],"['2014/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1515/cclm-2014-0183 [doi]', '/j/cclm.ahead-of-print/cclm-2014-0183/cclm-2014-0183.xml [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Chem Lab Med. 2015 Jan;53(1):85-93. doi: 10.1515/cclm-2014-0183.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epidemiological data and survival rates of childhood ALL in Lithuania were lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the population-based long-term treatment results of childhood ALL in Lithuania during 1992-2012. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data of all 459 children with T-lineage and B-cell precursor ALL treated in Lithuania from 1992 to 2012 were collected and analyzed. Results were compared among four time-periods: 1992-1996 (N=132), 1997-2002 (N=136), 2003-2008 (N=109) and 2009-2012 (N=82). RESULTS: The incidence of childhood ALL in Lithuania was 3.2-3.6 cases per 100000 children per year during the study period. Five-year probability of event-free survival increased from 50%+/- 4% in 1992-1996 to 71%+/- 4% in 2003-2008 (P<0.001). Five-year cumulative incidence of relapses reduced from 27%+/- 4.5% in 1992-1996 to 14%+/- 3.6% in 2003-2008 (P=0.042). After introduction of high-dose methotrexate of 5 g/m(2), cumulative incidence of CNS-involving relapses reduced from 17%+/- 3.9% in 1992-1996 to 1%+/- 1.0% in 2003-2008 (P<0.001). Trend for further improvement in survival was seen in 2009-2012 when Lithuania joined international the Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (NOPHO) ALL-2008 treatment protocol. CONCLUSIONS: Cure rates of childhood ALL in Lithuania are improving steadily and are now approaching those reported by the largest international study groups. The reasons for such a positive effect are both better financial support for treatment of children with cancer in Lithuania and international collaboration with joining international treatment protocol for childhood ALL.","['Copyright (c) 2014 Lithuanian University of Health Sciences.

The genes encoding these autoantigens are abnormally expressed in peripheral granulocytes of patients with active ANCA-associated vasculitis. This study provides evidence that this transcriptional dysregulation results in a variety of mRNA processing events from the PRTN3 gene locus. In addition to elevated levels of PR3 message, leukocyte RNA from patients contained PR3 transcripts with an alternative 3' untranslated region. Furthermore, we detected usage of an alternative transcription start site within intron 1 of the PRTN3 gene locus that coincided with active disease (odds ratio, 3.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 8.4; P=0.01). This promoter may be developmentally regulated, because it was active in normal human bone marrow, multiple leukemia cell lines, MCF-7 cells, and subjects after GM-CSF treatment but not subjects with a neutrophil left shift. This transcript, which lacks exon 1 of PRTN3, encodes a 24-kD protein (p24(PR3/MBN)) with a sequence similar to that previously described for myeloblastin. Notably, PR3, p24(PR3/MBN), and MPO were synthesized in cultured neutrophils from patients with active ANCA-associated vasculitis, indicating that increased transcription results in newly synthesized autoantigens in peripheral neutrophils of patients. The synthesis of p24(PR3/MBN) seems to expand the autoantigen repertoire, because immunoblots showed that sera from patients recognized p24(PR3/MBN). These findings emphasize the importance of transcriptional dysregulation of the autoantigen in autoimmune disease.",['Copyright (c) 2015 by the American Society of Nephrology.'],"['McInnis, Elizabeth A', 'Badhwar, Anshul K', 'Muthigi, Akhil', 'Lardinois, Olivier M', 'Allred, S Colby', 'Yang, Jiajin', 'Free, Meghan E', 'Jennette, J Charles', 'Preston, Gloria A', 'Falk, Ronald J', 'Ciavatta, Dominic J']","['McInnis EA', 'Badhwar AK', 'Muthigi A', 'Lardinois OM', 'Allred SC', 'Yang J', 'Free ME', 'Jennette JC', 'Preston GA', 'Falk RJ', 'Ciavatta DJ']","['University of North Carolina Kidney Center, Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Department of Medicine and.', 'University of North Carolina Kidney Center, Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Department of Medicine and.', 'University of North Carolina Kidney Center, Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Department of Medicine and.', 'University of North Carolina Kidney Center, Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Department of Medicine and.', 'University of North Carolina Kidney Center, Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Department of Medicine and.', 'University of North Carolina Kidney Center, Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Department of Medicine and.', 'University of North Carolina Kidney Center, Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Department of Medicine and.', 'University of North Carolina Kidney Center, Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Department of Medicine and Departments of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and.', 'University of North Carolina Kidney Center, Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Department of Medicine and.', 'University of North Carolina Kidney Center, Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Department of Medicine and.', 'University of North Carolina Kidney Center, Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Department of Medicine and Genetics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina dciavatt@med.unc.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140724,United States,J Am Soc Nephrol,Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,9013836,"['0 (Autoantigens)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.4.21.76 (Myeloblastin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody-Associated Vasculitis/*genetics/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Autoantigens/*genetics/physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Exons/genetics/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloblastin/genetics/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/metabolism/pathology', 'Peroxidase/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Biosynthesis/*genetics/physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics/physiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['ANCA', 'GN', 'transcription regulation']",2014/07/26 06:00,2015/04/22 06:00,['2014/07/26 06:00'],"['2014/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['ASN.2013101092 [pii]', '10.1681/ASN.2013101092 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Soc Nephrol. 2015 Feb;26(2):390-9. doi: 10.1681/ASN.2013101092.

A broader use of Id-based vaccination, however, is hampered by the complexity and costs due to the individualized production of protein vaccines. These limitations may be overcome by targeted DNA vaccines encoding stereotyped immunoglobulin V regions of B cell malignancies. We have here investigated whether such vaccines might elicit cross-reactive immune responses thus offering the possibility to immunize subsets of patients with the same vaccine. METHODS: Fusion vaccines targeting patient Id to mouse Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II molecules (chimeric mouse/human) or chemokine receptors (fully human) on antigen-presenting cells (APC) were genetically constructed for two Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) patients and one prototypic stereotyped B-cell receptor (BCR) commonly expressed by Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)-associated Non Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL). The A20 murine B lymphoma cells were engineered to express prototypic HCV-associated B cell lymphoma BCR. Anti-Id antibody responses were studied against stereotyped and non-stereotyped BCRs on CLL patients' cells as well as transfected A20 cells. RESULTS: DNA vaccination of mice with Id vaccines that target APC elicited increased amounts of antibodies specific for the patient's Id as compared with non targeted control vaccines. Anti-Id antibodies cross-reacted between CLL cells with closely related BCR. A20 cells engineered to express patients' V regions were not tumorigenic in mice, preventing tumor challenge experiments. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide experimental support for use of APC-targeted fusion Id DNA vaccines for the treatment of B cell lymphoma and CLL that express stereotyped BCRs.",,"['Ruffini, Pier Adelchi', 'Os, Audun', 'Dolcetti, Riccardo', 'Tjonnfjord, Geir E', 'Munthe, Ludvig A', 'Bogen, Bjarne']","['Ruffini PA', 'Os A', 'Dolcetti R', 'Tjonnfjord GE', 'Munthe LA', 'Bogen B']","['Department of Immunology, Centre for Immune Regulation, University of Oslo, Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet, NO-0424 Oslo, Norway. pieradelchi.ruffini@virgilio.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140725,England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)', '0 (Vaccines, DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/*immunology', 'Antibody Formation/immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cross Reactions/*immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Hepacivirus/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunization', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/immunology', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Receptors, Chemokine/metabolism', 'Vaccines, DNA/*immunology']",,,2014/07/26 06:00,2015/03/05 06:00,['2014/07/26 06:00'],"['2014/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['1479-5876-12-207 [pii]', '10.1186/1479-5876-12-207 [doi]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2014 Jul 25;12:207. doi: 10.1186/1479-5876-12-207.,,,,PMC4119056,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole provides a very effective prophylaxis, pneumocystosis still occurs and may even be emerging due to suboptimal characterization of patients most at risk, hence precluding targeted prophylaxis. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all cases of documented pneumocystosis in HIV-negative patients admitted in our institution, a referral center in the area, from January 1990 to June 2010, and extracted data on their underlying condition(s). To estimate incidence rates within each condition, we estimated the number of patients followed-up in our area for each condition by measuring the number of patients admitted with the corresponding international classification diagnostic code, through the national hospital discharge database (Program of Medicalization of the Information System [PMSI]). RESULTS: From 1990 to 2010, 293 cases of pneumocystosis were documented, of which 154 (52.6%) tested negative for HIV. The main underlying conditions were hematological malignancies (32.5%), solid tumors (18.2%), inflammatory diseases (14.9%), solid organ transplant (12.3%), and vasculitis (9.7%). Estimated incidence rates could be ranked in 3 categories: 1) high risk (incidence rates >45 cases per 100,000 patient-year): polyarteritis nodosa, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, polymyositis/dermatopolymyositis, acute leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma; 2) intermediate risk (25-45 cases per 100,000 patient-year): Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, multiple myeloma, and central nervous system cancer; and 3) low risk (<25 cases per 100,000 patient-year): other solid tumors, inflammatory diseases, and Hodgkin lymphoma.

Here, we determined the moiety responsible for the erythroid differentiation induction effect of apigenin by using different flavonoids to represent the functional groups in its structure. In addition, we compared apigenin and apigetrin, a flavonoid similar in structure to apigenin except for the glycoside in its structure. Morphological changes as well as expressions of specific markers in K562 cells treated with apigenin were compared with those treated with apigetrin, flavone, 7-hydroxyflavone, chrysin, luteolin, or naringenin. The anti-proliferative and erythroid differentiation-inducing effect of apigenin and the five flavonoids were then investigated and their effects on the alpha, beta, and gamma globin genes expressions were compared using real-time PCR. Results of the comparison between apigenin and apigetrin revealed that the glycoside part of apigetrin does not have a role in the induction of cell differentiation. Based on glycophorin A expression, the potency of the other flavonoids for induction of differentiation, was: apigenin>chrysin>flavone/7-hydroxyflavone>luteolin/naringenin. Results of the analysis of the relationship between the structure and function of the flavonoids suggest that the apigenin-induced K562 cell differentiation was due to the 2-3 double bond and hydroxyl groups in its structure. This is the first study that identified the specific functional group in apigenin that impact the erythroid differentiation effect in K562 cells.","['Copyright (c) 2014 The Authors.

Here, we identified ELL2 as the sole transcription elongation factor to be specifically upregulated in HTLV-1-/Tax-transformed T-cells. Tax contributes to regulation of ELL2, since transient transfection of Tax increases ELL2 mRNA, Tax transactivates the ELL2 promoter, and repression of Tax results in decrease of ELL2 in transformed T-lymphocytes. However, we also measured upregulation of ELL2 in HTLV-1-transformed cells exhibiting undetectable amounts of Tax, suggesting that ELL2 can still be maintained independent of continuous Tax expression. We further show that Tax and ELL2 synergistically activate the HTLV-1 promoter, indicating that ELL2 cooperates with Tax in viral transactivation. This is supported by our findings that Tax and ELL2 accumulate in nuclear fractions and that they co-precipitate upon co-expression in transiently-transfected cells.

This family, comprising JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2 (tyrosine kinase 2), was first described more than 20 years ago, but the complexities underlying their activation, regulation and pleiotropic signalling functions are still being explored. Here, we review the current knowledge of their physiological functions and the causative role of activating and inactivating JAK mutations in human diseases, including haemopoietic malignancies, immunodeficiency and inflammatory diseases. At the molecular level, recent studies have greatly advanced our knowledge of the structures and organization of the component FERM (4.1/ezrin/radixin/moesin)-SH2 (Src homology 2), pseudokinase and kinase domains within the JAKs, the mechanism of JAK activation and, in particular, the role of the pseudokinase domain as a suppressor of the adjacent tyrosine kinase domain's catalytic activity. We also review recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of negative regulation exerted by the SH2 domain-containing proteins, SOCS (suppressors of cytokine signalling) proteins and LNK. These recent studies highlight the diversity of regulatory mechanisms utilized by the JAK family to maintain signalling fidelity, and suggest alternative therapeutic strategies to complement existing ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors.",,"['Babon, Jeffrey J', 'Lucet, Isabelle S', 'Murphy, James M', 'Nicola, Nicos A', 'Varghese, Leila N']","['Babon JJ', 'Lucet IS', 'Murphy JM', 'Nicola NA', 'Varghese LN']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria 3050, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria 3050, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria 3050, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria 3050, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria 3052, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria 3050, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (SH2B3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (TYK2 Kinase)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 1)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/genetics', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Janus Kinase 1/*metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 2/*metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 3/*metabolism', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/metabolism', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/physiology', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 1/metabolism', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/metabolism', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6/metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'TYK2 Kinase/*metabolism', 'src Homology Domains']",,,2014/07/25 06:00,2014/09/30 06:00,['2014/07/25 06:00'],"['2014/07/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1042/BJ20140712 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 2014 Aug 15;462(1):1-13. doi: 10.1042/BJ20140712.,,,"['R01 CA022556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA022556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA22556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4112375,['NIHMS612129'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although internationally recognized definitions of main AL subsets are available, there is currently no consensus format for the short summary of clinical flow cytometry reports. Since clinical reports are too long for most database purposes, there is a need for a standardized format of their short summaries. METHODS: The Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica--Berlin Frankfurt Muenster (AIEOP-BFM) Flow Network that encompasses reference diagnostics laboratories in Australia, Austria, Czechia, Germany, Israel, Italy, and Switzerland have designed a pro-forma for the summary of flow cytometry results in the diagnosis of leukemia. The process involved several meetings and other communications, during which the group established a consensus on the essentials that lead to the diagnostic conclusions in childhood AL. RESULTS: The ""Flow Diagnostics Essential (FDE) Code"" is a result from an agreement within the AIEOP-BFM Flow Network. In a standardized format, it reports the extent of the infiltration by a malignant clone, followed by description antigen expression as strong, weak or negative, and a diagnostic conclusion. CONCLUSIONS: A consensus brief format (the ""FDE Code"") has been designed as a brief summary of the diagnostic immunophenotype of childhood AL. It is also applicable for the diagnostic investigation of other malignancies by flow cytometry. The FDE code may be included in the final clinical report and/or used in the setting of a multicenter clinical trial database.",['(c) 2013 Clinical Cytometry Society.'],"['Hrusak, Ondrej', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Ratei, Richard', 'Gaipa, Giuseppe', 'Luria, Drorit', 'Mejstrikova, Ester', 'Karawajew, Leonid', 'Buldini, Barbara', 'Rozenthal, Eti', 'Bourquin, Jean Pierre', 'Kalina, Tomas', 'Sartor, Mary', 'Dworzak, Michael N']","['Hrusak O', 'Basso G', 'Ratei R', 'Gaipa G', 'Luria D', 'Mejstrikova E', 'Karawajew L', 'Buldini B', 'Rozenthal E', 'Bourquin JP', 'Kalina T', 'Sartor M', 'Dworzak MN']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

Mutations in the master regulator of hematopoiesis GATA-2 underlie an immunodeficiency associated with myelodysplastic syndrome and leukemia. We discovered that a GATA-2 disease mutant (T354M) defective in chromatin binding was hyperphosphorylated by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. p38 also induced multisite phosphorylation of wild-type GATA-2, which required a single phosphorylated residue (S192). Phosphorylation of GATA-2, but not T354M, stimulated target gene expression. While crosstalk between oncogenic Ras and GATA-2 has been implicated as an important axis in cancer biology, its mechanistic underpinnings are unclear. Oncogenic Ras enhanced S192-dependent GATA-2 phosphorylation, nuclear foci localization, and transcriptional activation. These studies define a mechanism that controls a key regulator of hematopoiesis and a dual mode of impairing GATA-2-dependent genetic networks: mutational disruption of chromatin occupancy yielding insufficient GATA-2, and oncogenic Ras-mediated amplification of GATA-2 activity.",['(c) 2014 The Authors.'],"['Katsumura, Koichi R', 'Yang, Chenxi', 'Boyer, Meghan E', 'Li, Lingjun', 'Bresnick, Emery H']","['Katsumura KR', 'Yang C', 'Boyer ME', 'Li L', 'Bresnick EH']","['UW-Madison Blood Research Program, Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, Carbone Cancer Center, Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA.', 'UW-Madison Blood Research Program, Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, Carbone Cancer Center, Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA University of Wisconsin School of Pharmacy, Madison, WI, USA.', 'UW-Madison Blood Research Program, Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, Carbone Cancer Center, Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, USA ehbresni@wisc.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140723,England,EMBO Rep,EMBO reports,100963049,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/genetics', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', 'Genes, ras/*genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*biosynthesis/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['GATA factor', 'GATA-2', 'Ras', 'p38', 'transcription']",2014/07/25 06:00,2015/05/15 06:00,['2014/07/25 06:00'],"['2014/07/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['embr.201438808 [pii]', '10.15252/embr.201438808 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO Rep. 2014 Sep;15(9):938-47. doi: 10.15252/embr.201438808.

Objective To investigate the relationship between SLCO1B3, SLCO1A2, and ABCA3 polymorphisms and IM response in CML patients. METHODS: Patients in chronic phase CML (N = 118) were studied. All patients were treated with a standard dose of IM (400 mg/day) and classified into one of the two groups according to their responses. Major molecular response (MMR) and complete molecular response (CMR) were evaluated. Criteria for response failure were established according to European LeukemiaNet (2009). Analysis of the SLCO1B3 c.334T > G (rs4149117) and c.699G > A (rs7311358), SLCO1A2 c.516A > C (rs11568563) and c.-62-361G > A (rs3764043), and ABCA3 c.1755C > G (rs323043) and c.4548-191C > A (rs150929) polymorphisms was carried out by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: SLCO1A2 and ABCA3 polymorphisms have similar frequencies between responders and non-responders. SLCO1B3 699GG and 344TT genotypes were more frequent in the responder group (63.8%) than in the non-responder group (44.7%, P = 0.042). Furthermore, carriers of 699GA/AA and 334TG/GG genotypes presented a higher probability of not responding to the standard dose of IM (odds ratio: 2.17; 95% confidence interval: 1.02-4.64, P = 0.04). Poor CMR for ABCA3 4548-91C > A was observed in patients with the CC/CA genotype when compared to AA carriers in the responder group (P = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: SLCO1B3 699GG and 344TT genotypes are associated with non-response to IM, while ABCA3 4548-91 CC/CA genotypes are related to poor CMR in CML patients treated with standard-dose imatinib.",,"['de Lima, Luciene Terezina', 'Bueno, Carolina Tosin', 'Vivona, Douglas', 'Hirata, Rosario Domiguez Crespo', 'Hirata, Mario Hiroyuki', 'Hungria, Vania Tiestsche de Moraes', 'Chiattone, Carlos Sergio', 'Zanichelli, Maria Aparecida', 'Chauffaille, Maria de Lourdes Lopes Ferrari', 'Guerra-Shinohara, Elvira Maria']","['de Lima LT', 'Bueno CT', 'Vivona D', 'Hirata RD', 'Hirata MH', 'Hungria VT', 'Chiattone CS', 'Zanichelli MA', 'Chauffaille Mde L', 'Guerra-Shinohara EM']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140724,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (ABCA3 protein, human)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organic Anion Transporters)', '0 (Organic Anion Transporters, Sodium-Independent)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (SLCO1A2 protein, human)', '0 (SLCO1B3 protein, human)', '0 (Solute Carrier Organic Anion Transporter Family Member 1B3)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*genetics', 'Adult', 'Alleles', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Organic Anion Transporters/genetics', 'Organic Anion Transporters, Sodium-Independent/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Solute Carrier Organic Anion Transporter Family Member 1B3', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['ABCA3', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Imatinib', 'Membrane transporters', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Resistance', 'SLCO1B3']",2014/07/25 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/07/25 06:00'],"['2014/07/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/1607845414Y.0000000181 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2015 Apr;20(3):137-42. doi: 10.1179/1607845414Y.0000000181.

Advances in cancer genomics have revealed the spectrum of somatic mutations that give rise to human AML and drawn our attention to its molecular evolution and clonal architecture.

This characteristic, combined with our ability to identify mutations in individual leukaemic cells and our detailed understanding of normal human and murine haematopoiesis, makes AML an excellent model for understanding the principles of cancer evolution. Furthermore, a better understanding of how AML evolves can help us devise strategies to improve the therapy and prognosis of AML patients.

Human C-type lectin-like molecule-1 (CLL1) is a recently identified myeloid lineage restricted cell surface marker, which is overexpressed in over 90% of AML patient myeloid blasts and in leukemic stem cells. Here, we describe the synthesis of a novel bispecific antibody, alphaCLL1-alphaCD3, using the genetically encoded unnatural amino acid, p-acetylphenylalanine. The resulting alphaCLL1-alphaCD3 recruits cytotoxic T cells to CLL1 positive cells, and demonstrates potent and selective cytotoxicity against several human AML cell lines and primary AML patient derived cells in vitro. Moreover, alphaCLL1-alphaCD3 treatment completely eliminates established tumors in an U937 AML cell line xenograft model. These results validate the clinical potential of CLL1 as an AML-specific antigen for the generation of a novel immunotherapeutic for AML.","['(c) 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The trithorax family member MLL (myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia) is presumed to activate Hox expression, counteracting polycomb-mediated repression. PC4 and SF2 interacting protein 1 (PSIP1)/p75, also known as LEDGF, whose PWWP domain binds to H3K36me3, interacts with MLL and tethers MLL fusion proteins to HOXA9 in leukaemias. Here we show, unexpectedly, that Psip1/p75 regulates homeotic genes by recruiting not only MLL complexes, but also the polycomb group protein Bmi1. In Psip1(-/-) cells binding of Mll1/2, Bmi1 and the co-repressor Ctbp1 at Hox loci are all abrogated and Hoxa and Hoxd mRNA expression increased. Our data not only reveal a potential mechanism of action for Psip1 in the regulation of Hox genes but also suggest an unexpected interplay between proteins usually considered as transcriptional activators and repressors.","['(c) The Author(s) 2014.

While empirical studies have quantified the effects of provisioning on host behaviour and immunology, the net interactive effect of these components on host-pathogen dynamics is unknown. We use simple compartmental models to investigate how provisioning-induced changes to host demography, contact behaviour and immune defence influence pathogen invasion and persistence. We show that pathogen invasion success and equilibrium prevalence depend critically on how provisioning affects host immune defence and that moderate levels of provisioning can lead to drastically different outcomes of pathogen extinction or maximizing prevalence.

We assessed the impact of primary prophylaxis with posaconazole and levofloxacin on the incidence of invasive fungal infections (IFI) and bacteraemia. METHODS: A retrospective single-centre study including two groups of adult patients with AML receiving intensive chemotherapy. Group one without anti-infective prophylaxis (September 2008 - February 2010), and group two with anti-infective prophyalaxis (March 2010 - April 2011). The primary end-point was IFI according to the EORTC/MSG 2008 definitions and bacteraemia. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar in the non-prophylaxis (n = 43 patients; 99 chemotherapy cycles) and the prophylaxis (n = 45; 104 chemotherapy cycles) group. IFI were significantly reduced in the prophylaxis group (55.3% vs. 88.9%; p = 0.0032) and there was a trend of the projected IFI-free survival at 100 days to be increased (50.1% vs. 25%; p = 0.0526). One-hundred day overall survival (84.4% and 88.4%, p = 0.35) and 2-year overall survival (64.4% and 58.1%; p = 0.64) were unaffected. No difference in the occurrence of bacteraemia was observed (32.3% vs. 34.6%; p = 0.8). A total of two (3.6%) patients in the non-prophylaxis and three (6.7%) in the prophylaxis group died due to IFI, and two (3.6%) in the non-prophylaxis and none in the prophylaxis group patients had to stop leukaemia treatment due to IFI. CONCLUSIONS: The anti-infective prophylaxis with posaconazole and levofloxacin resulted in a significant reduction of 'possible' IFI with a number-needed to treat to prevent one IFI of only 3 but did not result in a reduction of the incidence of bacteraemia.",,"['Gerber, Bernhard', 'Koppel, Jan', 'Paul, Michaela', 'Nguyen-Kim, Thi Dan Linh', 'Frauenfelder, Thomas', 'Nair, Gayathri', 'Schanz, Urs', 'Manz, Markus G']","['Gerber B', 'Koppel J', 'Paul M', 'Nguyen-Kim TD', 'Frauenfelder T', 'Nair G', 'Schanz U', 'Manz MG']","['Division of Hematology, University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland; bernhard.gerber@usz.ch.', 'Division of Hematology, University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Division of Biostatistics, Institute for Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Division of Hematology, University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Division of Hematology, University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Division of Hematology, University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140723,Switzerland,Swiss Med Wkly,Swiss medical weekly,100970884,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Triazoles)', '6GNT3Y5LMF (Levofloxacin)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antibiotic Prophylaxis/*methods', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/prevention & control', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Levofloxacin/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/prevention & control', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Triazoles/*therapeutic use']",,,2014/07/24 06:00,2015/02/20 06:00,['2014/07/24 06:00'],"['2014/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.4414/smw.2014.13985 [doi]', 'smw-13985 [pii]']",epublish,Swiss Med Wkly. 2014 Jul 23;144:w13985. doi: 10.4414/smw.2014.13985. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vivo, the impact of CLL cells on mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) remains a source of debate. Here, we quantified and expanded colony forming unit-fibroblasts (CFU-Fs) from CLL-BM under standard conditions, analyzed the expression of selected genes, and studied secretion profiles. We observed failing of CLL-BM cultures in standard conditions (45.5% vs. <0.1%), and even after adding basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), there were fewer CFU-F than from normal BM (1.3 vs. 40/10(6) cells respectively; P<0.01). Furthermore, their polygonal aspect and low proliferative capacity, together with the expression of 384 selected genes and a secreted set of molecules related to senescence-associated secretory phenotype indicated a state of senescence, further confirmed by the higher proportion of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-betaGAL)-positive cells and p16INK4a overexpression. In our hands, hypoxic conditions (5% O2) did not rescue CFU-Fs. Given the role of MSC in BM tissue organization, we studied hematons that are generally considered to be elementary BM units. These structures were rare or had even disappeared completely. When hematons were present, we systematically observed nodular B-CLL cell invasion only.

METHODS: Human promyelocytic leukaemia cells (HL-60) cells and peripheral blood or synovial fluid neutrophils were isolated from RA patients. Under cyclophilin A (CypA) stimulation, chemotaxis, adhesion potential and invasion ability were assessed using chemotaxis, adhesion and invasiveness assays. Lipid raft isolation and western blot were used to determine the mechanism underlying the effects of CypA stimulation. RESULTS: CD147 up-regulates the calcium-induced chemotaxis, adhesion ability and invasiveness of human neutrophils in RA patients. Transient receptor potential melastatin 7 may be responsible for this phenomenon. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that in RA patients, abundant CypA up-regulates the calcium-induced chemotactic, adhesive and invasive properties of neutrophils via direct binding to CD147. Cyclophilin-CD147 interactions might contribute to the destruction of cartilage and bone in RA.","['(c) The Author 2014.

Here, we demonstrate that cotreatment with JQ1 and the FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) ponatinib or AC220 synergistically induce apoptosis of cultured and primary CD34(+) human AML blast progenitor cells (BPC) expressing FLT3-ITD. Concomitantly, as compared with each agent alone, cotreatment with JQ1 and the FLT3-TKI caused greater attenuation of c-MYC, BCL2, and CDK4/6. Simultaneously, cotreatment with JQ1 and the FLT3-TKI increased the levels of p21, BIM, and cleaved PARP, as well as mediated marked attenuation of p-STAT5, p-AKT, and p-ERK1/2 levels in AML BPCs. Conversely, cotreatment with JQ1 and FLT3-TKI was significantly less active against CD34(+) normal bone marrow progenitor cells. Knockdown of BRD4 by short hairpin RNA also sensitized AML cells to FLT3-TKI. JQ1 treatment induced apoptosis of mouse Ba/F3 cells ectopically expressing FLT3-ITD with or without FLT3-TKI-resistant mutations F691L and D835V. Compared with the parental human AML FLT3-ITD-expressing MOLM13, MOLM13-TKIR cells resistant to AC220 were markedly more sensitive to JQ1-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, cotreatment with JQ1 and the pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDI) panobinostat synergistically induced apoptosis of FLT3-TKI-resistant MOLM13-TKIR and MV4-11-TKIR cells. Collectively, these findings support the rationale for determining the in vivo activity of combined therapy with BA and FLT3-TKI against human AML cells expressing FLT3-ITD or with BA and HDI against AML cells resistant to FLT3-TKI.",['(c)2014 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Fiskus, Warren', 'Sharma, Sunil', 'Qi, Jun', 'Shah, Bhavin', 'Devaraj, Santhana G T', 'Leveque, Christopher', 'Portier, Bryce P', 'Iyer, Swaminathan', 'Bradner, James E', 'Bhalla, Kapil N']","['Fiskus W', 'Sharma S', 'Qi J', 'Shah B', 'Devaraj SG', 'Leveque C', 'Portier BP', 'Iyer S', 'Bradner JE', 'Bhalla KN']","['Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'University of Utah, Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, Utah.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, Texas.', 'Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, Texas.', 'Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, Texas.', 'Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, Texas.', 'Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, Texas.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, Texas. knbhalla@tmhs.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140722,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 ((+)-JQ1 compound)', '0 (Azepines)', '0 (BRD4 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Triazoles)', '4340891KFS (ponatinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Azepines/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyridazines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Triazoles/*pharmacology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1/biosynthesis', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/metabolism']",,,2014/07/24 06:00,2015/05/13 06:00,['2014/07/24 06:00'],"['2014/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-14-0258 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-14-0258 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2014 Oct;13(10):2315-27. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-14-0258.

We present here a platform of unique geometry and substrate versatility that generates a stationary nanodroplet array by using wells branching off a main microfluidic channel. These droplets are confined by multiple sides of a nanowell and are in direct contact with a biocompatible substrate of choice. The device is operated by a unique and reversed loading procedure that eliminates the need for fine pressure control or external tubing. Fluorocarbon oil isolates the droplets and provides soluble oxygen for the cells. By using this approach, the metabolic activity of single adherent cells was monitored continuously over time, and the concentration of viable pathogens in blood-derived samples was determined directly by measuring the number of colony-formed droplets. The method is simple to operate, requires a few microliters of reagent volume, is portable, is reusable, and allows for cell retrieval.

However, inconsistent results have been reported on the diagnostic performance of various kinds of miRNAs. To systematically assess the potential diagnostic value of miRNAs in hematologic cancers, we conducted the present meta-analysis. Multiple databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CNKI, and Wan Fang) were carefully searched for available studies up to April 4, 2014. Sensitivity and specificity were pooled using a random-effects model. Likelihood ratio (LR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and the area under the curve (AUC) were used to measure the diagnostic values. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were used to find potential sources of heterogeneity. Thirty-four studies from 14 publications, which involved 1,159 hematologic cancer patients and 826 healthy controls, were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled estimates indicated a moderately high diagnostic accuracy for circulating miRNAs, with a sensitivity of 0.83, a specificity of 0.85, a PLR of 5.7, a NLR of 0.20, a DOR of 29, and an AUC of 0.91. The subgroup analyses showed that diagnostic accuracy was better for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and Asians compared with other subgroups. In addition, multiple miRNA assays displayed a better performance than single ones. Furthermore, we found that plasma might be a more promising matrix for detecting the expression of miRNAs than serum. Our results identified the potential use of circulating miRNAs in second-line diagnosis for hematologic cancers, especially the value of miRNA panels. However, further large cohort studies are still required to confirm our findings.",,"['Li, Quan', 'Liu, Long', 'Li, Weiming']","['Li Q', 'Liu L', 'Li W']","['Department of Oncology, Xiangyang Central Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Hubei College of Arts and Sciences, Xiangyang, 430022, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",20140723,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['*DNA, Neoplasm/blood', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/blood/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Humans', '*MicroRNAs/blood']",,,2014/07/24 06:00,2015/01/06 06:00,['2014/07/24 06:00'],"['2014/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-014-2364-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2014 Oct;35(10):10467-78. doi: 10.1007/s13277-014-2364-4.

The log-rank test and the weighted log-rank test may not be appropriate or efficient to use here, because they are sensitive to differences in survival at any time and don't just focus on long-term outcomes. Also in a prospective clinical trial, patients are entered sequentially over calendar time, so that group sequential designs may be considered for ethical, administrative and economic concerns. Here we develop group sequential methods for testing the null hypothesis that the survival curves are identical after a prespecified time point. Several classes of tests are considered, including an integrated difference in survival probabilities after this time point, and linear or quadratic combinations of two component test statistics (pointwise comparisons of survival at the time point and comparisons of hazard rates after the time point).

We thus examined the issue using data from a cohort of workers of a laminated plastic factory sited in Piedmont, northern Italy. METHODS: The study cohort included 2,750 subjects (2,227 men and 523 women) who worked in the factory between 1947 and 2011, for at least 180 days. Follow-up ended in May 2011, for a total of 70,933 person-years of observation. We computed standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using national and (whenever available) Piedmont Region death rates. RESULTS: Overall, there were 417 deaths versus 493.4 expected ones (SMR = 84.5, 95% CI 76.6-93.0). The SMRs were 79.8 (95% CI 67.5-93.6) for total cancer mortality, 148.5 (95% CI 68.0-282.2) for oral cavity and pharynx (three deaths were registered, but not confirmed, as nasopharyngeal cancer), 48.3 (95% CI 13.1-123.7) for pancreas, 66.1 (95% CI 13.6-193.0) for larynx, and 96.7 (95% CI 72.0-127.2) for lung cancer. The SMR of all lymphohematopoietic malignancies was 68.6 (95% CI 31.4-130.3; nine observed deaths). This tended to increase with duration of exposure and to decrease with period at first exposure, always remaining below 100. There were four deaths from lymphoma (SMR = 74.1, 95% CI 20.1-189.6) and five deaths from leukemia (SMR = 92.4, 95% CI 29.9-215.3).

STUDY DESIGN: An observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Pathology, Hayatabad Medical Complex (HMC), Peshawar, from January 2011 to May 2012. METHODOLOGY: A total of 618 bone marrow biopsy reports were reviewed. All biopsy reports labeled as acute leukemia were reviewed for age, gender, address, referring unit, diagnosis on bone marrow examination, presenting complaints, duration of illness and findings of clinical examination. RESULTS: Ninety-two patients were diagnosed as suffering from acute leukemias (15%). ALL was most prevalent (46%), followed by AML (38%) and undifferentiated acute leukemia (16%). Males were affected more compared to females (60% vs. 40%). ALL and AML were predominant in pediatric (64%) and adults (77%) patients respectively. Patients from Afghanistan accounted for 33% of all cases followed by Peshawar (14%). Fever (77%), pallor (33%) and bleeding disorders (23%) were the main presenting complaints. Enlargement of liver, spleen and lymph nodes together was associated with ALL compared with AML (p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: ALL-L1 and AML-M4 were the most common sub-types.

Pancytopenia, caused by bone marrow substitution with leukemic cells, impairs maternal and fetal health. Chemotherapeutic agents required to be immediately used to save the mother's life are likely to adversely affect fetal development and outcome, especially if administered at an early gestational stage. Patients diagnosed with acute leukemia during the first trimester are, therefore, recommended to undergo pregnancy termination. At later gestational stages, antileukemic therapy can be administered, although in this case, fetal outcome is still associated with increased incidence of growth restriction and loss. Special attention to the issue of future reproduction, adopting a personalized fertility preservation approach, is required.

METHODS: The value of 50% inhibition concentration (IC(5)(0)) for KG-1a by resveratrol was analyzed using trypan blue staining. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated, and then activated by interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-15. The sensitivity of KG-1a treated with and without resveratrol to activated immune cell-mediated cytolysis was assayed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) -releasing assay. The expression of tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) on the surface of activated immune cells and its receptors (DR4/5 and DcR1/2) on the surface of KG-1a were detected by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Resveratrol could inhibit the proliferation of KG-1a and IC50 at 24 h was 25 mmol/L. At a ratio of 10:1 or 20:1 between effect and target, the cytolytic rates of treated KG-1a by activated immune cells were (55.80 +/- 10.88)% and (72.31 +/- 13.06)%, significantly higher than (24.96 +/- 9.25)% and (37.93 +/- 5.21)% of untreated KG-1a (P<0.05). The expression of DR5 on the surface of KG-1a treated with resveratrol was (9.05 +/- 3.57)%, significantly higher than (3.11 +/- 0.54)% of untreated KG-1a (P<0.05). Conversely, the expression of DcR1 on the surface of treated KG-1a was (13.23 +/- 3.56)%, lower than (53.75 +/- 10.51)% of KG-1a (P<0.05). When TRAIL pathway on the surface of activated immune cells was blocked, the cytolytic rates of treated KG-1a were (35.97 +/- 6.36)% and (49.80 +/- 10.68)%, significantly lower than (52.92 +/- 6.98)% and (70.73 +/- 9.79)% of untreated KG-1a (P<0.05) at the same ratio of effector and target.

METHODS: 90 patients with de novo AML undergoing auto-HSCT between August 1999 and November 2012 were enrolled. All patients received the mobilization regimen of cytarabine and etoposide chemotherapy in combination with recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF). Stem cell apheresis was scheduled when blood leukocyte count recovered greater than 4.0 x 10(9)/L or the proportion of CD34(+) cells greater than 1% in peripheral blood. The impact of ID-Ara-C courses on the mobilization efficiency was analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: According to the ID-Ara-C courses, patients were divided into group A (<2 courses), B (2 courses), and C (>2 courses). The median doses of CD34(+) cells (x10(6)/kg) in three groups were 4.7, 2.7, 2.3, respectively (P=0.003). Of the available 87 patients who could be evaluated, 61 (70.1%) cases had CD34(+) cells greater than 2.0 x 10(6)/kg, and 26 (29.9%) cases less than 2.0 x 10(6)/kg. Of the 26 patients without satisfactory mobilization efficiency, 7 (15.2%) were in group A, 10 (47.6%) in group B, and 9 (45.0%) in group C (chi(2)=10.05, P=0.007). In addition, patients with satisfactory mobilization efficiency (CD34(+) cells >/= 2.0x10(6)/kg) in groups C needed more times of collection, more volume of blood processed, and even high-dose and longer course of rhG-CSF (P<0.05). In univariate analysis. The ID-Ara-C courses and the cumulative dose were significant correlate with mobilization efficiency.

METHODS: To present a case of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) associated with long-term exposure to dasatinib and review the related literatures. RESULTS: A 23-year-old female with chronic myelogenous leukemia was treated with dasatinib at a dosage of 140 mg/d after failure of imatinib treatment and achieved complete cytogenetic response. The patient was presented with exertional dyspnea after 35 months of administration with dasatinib. The electrocardiogram showed right ventricular hypertrophy and right axis deviation; transthoracic Doppler echocardiography documented a reduction in diameters of left heart chambers with normal systolic left ventricular function, right heart chambers and pulmonary trunk dilatation, an estimated pulmonary arterial pressure of 114 mmHg; Computed tomography showed thickened pulmonary artery. PAH related to dasatinib was diagnosed and dasatinib was permanently discontinued. The symptom of dyspnea disappeared quickly after withdrawal of dasatinib. The heart structure and pulmonary arterial pressure completely recovered after 7 months of dasatinib discontinuation. CONCLUSION: PAH is a rare adverse effect of dasatinib treatment. Echocardiograhpy, as a non-invasive screening test for PAH, should be performed before starting dasatinib treatment and repeated during the administration with dasatinib.

We present detailed phenotypic descriptions and neuroimaging on 36 patients analyzed by our group and six cases from the literature with a molecularly proven actinopathy (9 ACTG1 and 33 ACTB). The major clinical anomalies are striking dysmorphic facial features with hypertelorism, broad nose with large tip and prominent root, congenital non-myopathic ptosis, ridged metopic suture and arched eyebrows. Iris or retinal coloboma is present in many cases, as is sensorineural deafness. Cleft lip and palate, hallux duplex, congenital heart defects and renal tract anomalies are seen in some cases. Microcephaly may develop with time. Nearly all patients with ACTG1 mutations, and around 60% of those with ACTB mutations have some degree of pachygyria with anteroposterior severity gradient, rarely lissencephaly or neuronal heterotopia. Reduction of shoulder girdle muscle bulk and progressive joint stiffness is common. Early muscular involvement, occasionally with congenital arthrogryposis, may be present. Progressive, severe dystonia was seen in one family. Intellectual disability and epilepsy are variable in severity and largely correlate with CNS anomalies. One patient developed acute lymphocytic leukemia, and another a cutaneous lymphoma, indicating that actinopathies may be cancer-predisposing disorders. Considering the multifaceted role of actins in cell physiology, we hypothesize that some clinical manifestations may be partially mutation specific.

DNA was extracted from lymphoid tissue by microdissection. A nested PCR was conducted to detect HTLV-1 genome using primers for the tax region. As negative controls, four cases of superficial perivascular dermatitis were chosen. As positive controls, five cases of T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATCL) were studied. RESULTS: A positive reaction was found in 3 of 25 cases. These biopsies corresponded to a case of Mycosis Fungoides, a case of CD30 (-) T-cell lymphoma and a case of lymphomatoid papulosis. Search was negative in the four cases of superficial perivascular dermatitis and positive in four cases of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATCL).

Molecules that specifically inhibit Mcl-1 hold potential for diagnosing and disrupting Mcl-1-dependent cell survival. We selected three peptides from a yeast-surface display library that showed moderate specificity and affinity for binding to Mcl-1 over Bfl-1, Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and Bcl-w. Specificity for Mcl-1 was improved by introducing threonine at peptide position 2e. The most specific peptide, MS1, bound Mcl-1 with 40-fold or greater specificity over four other human Bcl-2 paralogs. In BH3 profiling assays, MS1 caused depolarization in several human Mcl-1-dependent cell lines with EC50 values of approximately 3 muM, contrasted with EC50 values of >100 muM for Bcl-2-, Bcl-xL-, or Bfl-1-dependent cell lines. MS1 is at least 30-fold more potent in this assay than the previously used Mcl-1 targeting reagent NoxaA BH3.

This study is an attempt to determine the chemopreventive and antileukemic activities of ethanol extracts of Moringa oleifera leaves on benzene induced leukemia bearing rats. Leukemia was induced by intravenous injection of 0.2 mL benzene solution 48 hourly for 4 weeks in appropriate rat groups. Ethanol extract of Moringa oleifera (EMO) leaves was administered at 0.2 mL of 100 mg/mL to respective treatment rat groups. A standard antileukemic drug (cyclophosphamide) was also used to treat appropriate rat groups. Clinical examination of liver and spleen with hematological parameters were employed to assess the leukemia burden following analysis of the rat blood samples on Sysmex KX-21N automated instrument. Leukemia induction reflected in severe anemia and a marked leukocytosis over the control/baseline group. Liver and spleen enlargements were also observed in group exposed to benzene carcinogen. The in vivo antioxidative potential of EMO was evaluated using Malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels. The liver MDA and GSH levels obtained in benzene induced leukemic rats treated with EMO compared favorably with those obtained in similar treatments with the standard drug (p< 0.05). The extract demonstrated chemopreventive and anti-leukemic activities as much as the standard anti-leukemic drug (p>0.05) by ameliorating the induced leukemic condition in the affected rat groups owing to its bioactive constituents.

Some increases in cancer risk in these age groups have also been noted among those living around Dounreay. We aimed to update previous analyses relating to areas close to these nuclear installations by considering data from an additional 16 years of follow-up. METHODS: Cross-sectional analyses compared cancer incidence rates for 1963-2006 among those aged 0-24 years at diagnosis living in geographically specified areas around either Sellafield or Dounreay with general population rates. Cancer incidence for the period 1971-2006 among the cohort of Cumbrian births between 1950 and 2006 was compared to national incidence for 1971-2006 using person-years analysis. Cancer among those born in the postcode sector closest to Dounreay was compared with that among those born in the three adjoining postcode sectors. Analyses considered both cancer overall and ICD-O-3 defined diagnostic subgroups including leukaemia, central nervous system tumours and other malignancies. RESULTS: Apart from previously reported raised risks, no new significantly increased risks for cancer overall or any diagnostic subgroup were found among children or teenagers and young adults living around either nuclear installation. Individuals born close to the installations from 1950 to 2006 were not shown to be at any increased risk of cancer during the period 1971 to date. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of recent data suggests that children, teenagers and young adults currently living close to Sellafield and Dounreay are not at an increased risk of developing cancer.

However there is no information on the co-expression of both genes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We found a lack of correlation between RNA and protein levels of p27 and Myc in CLL cells, so we determined the protein levels by immunoblot in 107 cases of CLL. We observed a high p27 protein expression in CLL compared to normal B cells. Ectopic p27 expression in a CLL-derived cell line resulted in cell death resistance. Surprisingly, Myc expression was very low or undetectable in most CLL cases analyzed, with a clear correlation between high p27 and low Myc protein levels. This was associated with low Skp2 expression, which is consistent with the Skp2 role in p27 degradation and with SKP2 being a Myc target gene. High Myc expression did not correlate with leukemia progression, despite that cell cycle-related Myc target genes were upregulated. However, biochemical analysis showed that the high p27 levels inhibited cyclin-Cdk complexes even in Myc expressing CLL cells.

The molecular mechanisms behind the potential clinical efficacy of combination EGT treatment are incompletely understood and the frequently lengthy EGT regimes required to determine clinical response have generated a significant demand for early molecular markers of treatment response. Our study aimed to identify the effect of combination azacitidine (AZA) and panobinostat (LBH589) on expression levels of a panel of genes implicated in the pathogenesis of high-risk MDS or AML in HL-60 cells. We also characterized gene expression profiles in peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMCs) from patients in a recently reported phase Ib/II clinical trial using the combination of AZA and LBH589 and correlated these findings with clinical response to treatment. In vitro analysis demonstrated increased expression of caspase-3, Nor-1, NUR77, p15INK4B and p21WAF1/CIP1 and decreased expression of BclxL in HL-60 cells treated with combination EGT. Analysis of patient samples prior to treatment demonstrated a significant reduction in NUR77 and p21WAF1/CIP1 expression compared to healthy controls. NUR77 and p21WAF1/CIP1 levels were similar between treatment nonresponders and responders at screening. Early post first cycle treatment (day 25) analysis demonstrated a significant increase in expression of both NUR77, and p21WAF1/CIP1. A significant increase in NUR77, and p21WAF1/CIP1 together with a trend to increase in p15INK4B first cycle expression was observed in treatment responders compared to non-responders. In summary, combination AZA and LBH589 epigenetic treatment is associated with in vitro and in vivo modulation of genes implicated in the pathogenesis of MDS/AML. Early expression of NUR77 and p21WAF1/CIP1 correlated with clinical response to combination EGT suggesting investigation for potential use as molecular markers of early treatment response may be warranted.",,"['Liu, H B', 'Urbanavicius, D', 'Tan, P', 'Spencer, A', 'Dear, A E']","['Liu HB', 'Urbanavicius D', 'Tan P', 'Spencer A', 'Dear AE']","['Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Prahran 3181, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Prahran 3181, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Prahran 3181, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Prahran 3181, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Prahran 3181, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140722,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Indoles)', '9647FM7Y3Z (Panobinostat)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Apoptosis', 'Azacitidine/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Indoles/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Panobinostat', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2014/07/23 06:00,2015/06/10 06:00,['2014/07/23 06:00'],"['2014/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2014.2555 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2014 Oct;45(4):1742-8. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2014.2555.

Chemo-immunotherapy is an established treatment modality for CLL patients, resulting in high rates of responses and improved survival, especially in low-risk CLL. New, alternative treatments target B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and the Chemokine (C-X-C motif) Receptor 4 (CXCR4)-Chemokine (C-X-C motif) Ligand 12 (CXCL12) axis, which are key pathways of CLL-microenvironment cross talk. The remarkable clinical efficacy of inhibitors targeting the BCR-associated kinases Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kdelta) challenges established therapeutic paradigms and corroborates the central role of BCR signaling in CLL pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss the cellular and molecular components of the CLL microenvironment.

In this study,we report that FTY720 (Fingolimod), a sphingosine analogue and an FDA approved drug for treating of multiple sclerosis, shows antitumorigenic activity against the Kasumi-1 cell line, xenograft mouse models and leukemic blasts isolated from AML-M2 patients with t(8;21) translocation. Primary investigation indicated that FTY720 caused cell apoptosis through caspases and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activation. Transcriptomic profiling further revealed that FTY720 treatment could upregulate AML1 target genes and interfere with genes involved in ceramide synthesis. Treatment with FTY720 led to the elimination of AML1-ETO oncoprotein and caused cell cycle arrest. More importantly, FTY720 treatment resulted in rapid and significant increase of pro-apoptotic ceramide levels, determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry based lipidomic approaches. Structural simulation model had also indicated that the direct binding of ceramide to inhibitor 2 of PP2A (I2PP2A) could reactivate PP2A and cause cell death. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that accumulation of ceramide plays a central role in FTY720 induced cell death of AML-M2 with t(8;21).

The cohort comprised 64,956 individuals who were employed at the four study sites between 1946 and 2002, followed up to 2005. External radiation exposures as measured by personal dosimeters (generally 'film badges') were available for 42,431 individuals classified as 'radiation workers'. Poisson regression models were used to investigate cancer mortality and incidence in relation to cumulative external radiation exposure using relative risk models. The cohort showed the expected 'healthy worker' effect. This analysis found an increased risk of all cancers associated with external occupational radiation exposure (ERR/Gy = 0.34 90% CI: 0.07; 0.64), with significant excess risks observed for all solid cancers (ERR/Gy = 0.29 90% CI: 0.02; 0.59) and leukaemia excluding CLL (ERR/Gy = 2.60 90% CI: 0.28; 7.01). The overall cancer risk estimates are consistent with values used by national and international bodies in setting radiation protection standards. The slopes of the dose response relationships for all cancer mortality and incidence were found to be significantly less steep for workers exposed to both external radiation and potentially to internal radiation (ERR/Gy = 0.09 90% CI: -0.17; 0.39) when compared to those workers only exposed to external radiation (ERR/Gy = 1.14 90% CI: 0.49; 1.89). Analyses of individual cancer types indicate that this overall result is mainly driven by that for digestive cancers and in particular cancers of the oesophagus. Categorical analyses also revealed that the difference in the dose response relationship between the two groups is only apparent for those exposed to cumulative external doses in excess of 200 mGy. Such differences have also been observed for non-cancer mortality outcomes in this cohort. Further work is required to explain these differences; for example, whether they may result from confounding by internal organ dose or lifestyle factors associated with socio-economic status.",,"['Gillies, Michael', 'Haylock, Richard']","['Gillies M', 'Haylock R']","['Public Health England, Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards, Moor Row, Cumbria CA24 3HU.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140722,England,J Radiol Prot,Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,8809257,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*mortality', '*Nuclear Power Plants', 'Occupational Diseases/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Risk Assessment', 'Time Factors', 'United Kingdom', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/07/23 06:00,2015/05/29 06:00,['2014/07/23 06:00'],"['2014/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1088/0952-4746/34/3/595 [doi]'],ppublish,J Radiol Prot. 2014 Sep;34(3):595-623. doi: 10.1088/0952-4746/34/3/595.

In the present study, the in vitro antileukemic activity of meisoindigo was investigated in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, and myelomonocytic leukemia cells (NB4, NB4.007/6, HL-60 and U937) comprising both retinoic acid-sensitive and retinoic acid-resistant cells. We found that meisoindigo effectively inhibited the growth and/or proliferation of these four cell types at microM levels. The effects of meisoindigo in these cells are related to its proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction, and are independent of cell cycle arrest, indicating that meisoindigo could be possible in the treatment of APL, AML and retinoic acid resistant APL. The in vivo pharmacokinetics of meisoindigo and its major circulatory metabolites in rat plasma were then investigated by a newly developed and validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. The profiles of plasma concentration versus time were plotted and the relevant pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated for meisoindigo and its reductive metabolites. The plasma concentrations of meisoindigo after oral administration were much lower than the in vitro IC50s determined in the leukemic cells.

The kinase-inducible domain interacting (KIX) domain of the master coactivator CREB binding protein/p300 is a conformationally dynamic domain that complexes with transcriptional activators at two discrete binding sites in allosteric communication. The complexation of KIX with the transcriptional activation domain of mixed-lineage leukemia protein leads to an enhancement of binding by the activation domain of CREB (phosphorylated kinase-inducible domain of CREB) to the second site. A transient kinetic analysis of the ternary complex formation aided by small molecule ligands that induce positive or negative cooperative binding reveals that positive cooperativity is largely governed by stabilization of the bound complex as indicated by a decrease in koff. Thus, this suggests the increased binding affinity for the second ligand is not due to an allosteric creation of a more favorable binding interface by the first ligand. This is consistent with data from us and from others indicating that the on rates of conformationally dynamic proteins approach the limits of diffusion. In contrast, negative cooperativity is manifested by alterations in both kon and koff, suggesting stabilization of the binary complex.",,"['Wang, Ningkun', 'Lodge, Jean M', 'Fierke, Carol A', 'Mapp, Anna K']","['Wang N', 'Lodge JM', 'Fierke CA', 'Mapp AK']","['Program in Chemical Biology,Life Sciences Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Life Sciences Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109Departments of Chemistry and.', 'Program in Chemical Biology,Departments of Chemistry andBiological Chemistry, amapp@umich.edu fierke@umich.edu.', 'Program in Chemical Biology,Life Sciences Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109Departments of Chemistry and amapp@umich.edu fierke@umich.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140721,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Ligands)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Allosteric Regulation', 'Ligands', 'Models, Molecular', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors/*chemistry']",['NOTNLM'],"['IDP', 'protein-protein interaction']",2014/07/23 06:00,2014/11/05 06:00,['2014/07/23 06:00'],"['2014/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['1406033111 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1406033111 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Aug 19;111(33):12061-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1406033111.

Outcome was compared between patients with and those without BCR-ABL1-like ALL. RESULTS: Forty (11.6%) of the 344 patients had BCR-ABL1-like ALL. They were significantly more likely to be male, have Down syndrome, and have higher MRD levels on day 19 and at the end of induction than did other patients with B-ALL. Among 25 patients comprehensively studied for genetic abnormalities, 11 harbored a genomic rearrangement of CRLF2, six had fusion transcripts responsive to ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors or JAK inhibitors, and seven had mutations involving the Ras signaling pathway. There were no significant differences in event-free survival (90.0% +/- 4.7% [SE] v. 88.4% +/- .9% at 5 years; P = .41or in overall survival (92.5% +/- 4.2% v. 95.1% +/- 1.3% at 5 years; P = .41) between patients with and without BCR-ABL1-like ALL. CONCLUSION: Patients who have BCR-ABL1-like ALL with poor initial treatment response can be salvaged with MRD-based risk-directed therapy and may benefit from identification of kinase-activating lesions for targeted therapies.",,"['Roberts, Kathryn G', 'Pei, Deqing', 'Campana, Dario', 'Payne-Turner, Debbie', 'Li, Yongjin', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'Sandlund, John T', 'Jeha, Sima', 'Easton, John', 'Becksfort, Jared', 'Zhang, Jinghui', 'Coustan-Smith, Elaine', 'Raimondi, Susana C', 'Leung, Wing H', 'Relling, Mary V', 'Evans, William E', 'Downing, James R', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'Pui, Ching-Hon']","['Roberts KG', 'Pei D', 'Campana D', 'Payne-Turner D', 'Li Y', 'Cheng C', 'Sandlund JT', 'Jeha S', 'Easton J', 'Becksfort J', 'Zhang J', 'Coustan-Smith E', 'Raimondi SC', 'Leung WH', 'Relling MV', 'Evans WE', 'Downing JR', 'Mullighan CG', 'Pui CH']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/drug effects/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Salvage Therapy/*methods']",,,2014/07/23 06:00,2015/02/11 06:00,['2014/07/23 06:00'],"['2014/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2014.55.4105 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2014.55.4105 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2014 Sep 20;32(27):3012-20. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2014.55.4105.,,,"['GM92666/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA036401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA036401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM092666/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4162497,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the introduction of B-cell receptor (BCR) kinase inhibitors such as ibrutinib has the potential to eliminate the role of chemotherapy in the treatment of CLL. How to best incorporate old and new therapies for CLL in this landscape is increasingly complex. METHODS: This article reviews current data available to clinicians and integrates these data to provide a strategy that can be used to approach the treatment of CLL in the era of BCR signaling inhibitors. RESULTS: Current strategies separate patients based on age or functional status as well as genetics [presence or absence of del(17)(p13.1)]. In the era of targeted therapy, this will likely continue based on current available data. Phase III studies support chemoimmunotherapy as the initial standard therapy for patients without del(17)(p13.1). Choice of chemotherapy (fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide, bendamustine, or chlorambucil) and anti-CD20 antibody (rituximab, ofatumumab, or obinutuzumab) varies based on regimen and patient status. For patients with del(17)(p13.1), no standard initial therapy exists, although several options supported by phase II clinical trials (methylprednisolone plus alemtuzumab or ibrutinib) seem better than chemoimmunotherapy. Treatment of relapsed CLL seems to be best supported by ibrutinib-based therapy. Completion of trials with ibrutinib and other new agents in the near future will offer opportunity for chemotherapy-free treatment across all groups of CLL. CONCLUSION: Therapy for CLL has evolved significantly over the past decade with introduction of targeted therapy for CLL. This has the potential to completely transform how CLL is treated in the future.",,"['Byrd, John C', 'Jones, Jeffrey J', 'Woyach, Jennifer A', 'Johnson, Amy J', 'Flynn, Joseph M']","['Byrd JC', 'Jones JJ', 'Woyach JA', 'Johnson AJ', 'Flynn JM']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'YG57I8T5M0 (idelalisib)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bendamustine Hydrochloride', 'Chlorambucil/administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Deletion', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*immunology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/administration & dosage', 'Piperidines', ""Practice Patterns, Physicians'/standards/*trends"", 'Purines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Quinazolinones/therapeutic use', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",,,2014/07/23 06:00,2015/02/11 06:00,['2014/07/23 06:00'],"['2014/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2014.55.8262 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2014.55.8262 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2014 Sep 20;32(27):3039-47. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2014.55.8262.,,,"['P50 CA140158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA177292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA159296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA183444/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4162500,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although it has become apparent that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is highly heterogeneous at the molecular level, the standard framework for risk stratification guiding transplant practice in this disease remains largely based on pretreatment assessment of cytogenetics and a limited panel of molecular genetic markers, coupled with morphological assessment of bone marrow (BM) blast percentage after induction. However, application of more objective methodology such as multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) has highlighted the limitations of morphology for reliable determination of remission status. Moreover, there is a growing body of evidence that detection of subclinical levels of leukemia (ie, minimal residual disease, MRD) using MFC or molecular-based approaches provides powerful independent prognostic information. Consequently, there is increasing interest in the use of MRD detection to provide early end points in clinical trials and to inform patient management. However, implementation of MRD assessment into clinical practice remains a major challenge, hampered by differences in the assays and preferred analytical methods employed between routine laboratories. Although this should be addressed through adoption of standardized assays with external quality control, it is clear that the molecular heterogeneity of AML coupled with increasing understanding of its clonal architecture dictates that a ""one size fits all"" approach to MRD detection in this disease is not feasible.

In times of increasing triazole resistance and changing use of antifungal prophylaxis, insight into the risk factors for IA is needed to improve strategies for preventing IA in this population. Consecutive patients who received remission-induction therapy for AML or MDS at the Leiden Academic Medical Centre were included. Instead of standard antifungal prophylaxis, an assertive protocol for diagnosis of suspected fungal infection was in place. IA was classified according to the revised European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer criteria. Potential predisposing characteristics for IA were compared by uni- and multivariate analyses. In 45 (25%) of 184 included episodes (167 patients), IA was diagnosed prior to SCT. A multivariate Cox regression model demonstrated that relapsed AML (hazard ratio [HR] 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-5.1; P = 0.02), secondary AML (HR, 5.2; 95% CI, 2.3-11.8; P < 0.001), and prolonged duration of neutropenia (HR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2-4.0; P = 0.01) were independently associated with IA. Use of granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor showed a trend toward a protective effect (HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.1-31.0; P = 0.06). Relapsed AML, secondary AML, and duration of neutropenia were independent factors for determining the risk for development of IA prior to SCT. The results provide further guidance for antifungal stewardship programs when integrating individual patient tailored decision making in antifungal prophylaxis strategies.","['(c) The Author 2014.

Although cure rates have improved greatly, approximately one in five children relapse and poor survival rates post relapse remain a challenge. Given this, more effective and innovative therapeutic strategies are needed in order to improve prognosis. Aurora kinases, a family of serine/threonine kinases essential for the regulation of several mitotic processes, have been identified as potential targets for cancer therapeutics. Elevated expression of Aurora kinases has been demonstrated in several malignancies and is associated with aberrant mitotic activity, aneuploidy and alterations in chromosomal structure and genome instability. Based on this rationale, a number of small molecule inhibitors have been formulated and advanced to human studies in the recent past.

The clinical course of CLL presents with an impressive heterogeneity. During recent years, the combined use of clinical, biologic, and genetic parameters has allowed characterization of at least three categories of patients(1): (1) patients with a very mild onset and course; (2) patients with an intermediate prognosis; and (3) patients with an aggressive course of high-risk leukemia.

Although the combination of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab is the current frontline treatment of choice for fit patients, targeted therapies such ibrutinib, idelalisib, and ABT-199 are showing great promise in clinical trials. However, none of these drugs seems curative, and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains the only strategy that produces durable clinical remissions in otherwise poor-risk disease. Immune reconstitution remains an enticing prospect in CLL, as malignant B cells should be particularly susceptible to a T cell-mediated attack. It has recently been demonstrated that the T-cell defect in CLL can be effectively overcome by both lenalidomide treatment and by adoptive transfer of chimeric antigen receptor T cells. A variety of other immunotherapies are in development, including CLL vaccines, CD40 ligand therapies, and monoclonal antibody immune checkpoint blockade.

In hematologic malignancies, this impairment of apoptosis is often caused by overexpression of the pro-survival protein BCL2. Because abnormally high levels of BCL2 sustain these tumors, there has been much interest in targeting BCL2 as a novel approach to treating various hematologic malignancies. One such approach is the development of BH3 mimetic compounds, small molecules that mimic the action of the BH3-only proteins, natural antagonists of BCL2 and its pro-survival relatives. These compounds act by restoring the ability of a cell to undergo apoptotic cell death. Some of them have shown very encouraging results in early-phase clinical trials that are currently underway, particularly in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and some non-Hodgkin lymphomas, diseases marked by BCL2 overexpression. In this review, we discuss the rationale behind targeting BCL2, highlight the recent findings from clinical trials, and pinpoint the next steps in the clinical development of this interesting and promising class of targeted agents, particularly for the treatment of lymphoid malignancies.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Genetic differences/abnormalities have been found in hematopoietic stem cells from patients, as well as in B lymphocytes of individuals with monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis who may develop the disease. Furthermore, after the onset of CLL, additional genetic alterations occur over time, often causing disease worsening and altering patient outcomes. Therefore, being able to genetically engineer mouse models that mimic CLL or at least certain aspects of the disease will help us understand disease mechanisms and improve treatments. This notwithstanding, because neither the genetic aberrations responsible for leukemogenesis and progression nor the promoting factors that support these are likely identical in character or influences for all patients, genetically engineered mouse models will only completely mimic CLL when all of these factors are precisely defined. In addition, multiple genetically engineered models may be required because of the heterogeneity in susceptibility genes among patients that can have an effect on genetic and environmental characteristics influencing disease development and outcome.

A combination of genetic lesions is primarily responsible for the first step(s) of neoplastic transformation, along with microenvironmental signals, which concurrently operate by enhancing proliferation and/or inhibiting apoptosis. In this context, CD49d is known to play a pivotal role in mediating both cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions in CLL-involved tissues, eventually delivering pro-survival signals and protecting CLL cells from drug-induced damages. In the present review, we address, in detail, CD49d activities in the CLL microenvironment, CD49d functional and physical interactions with other microenvironmental receptors (including CD38 and B-cell receptor), and the relationship of CD49d expression with specific cytogenetic features in CLL.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The two major subsets of CLL are biologically distinct, being derived from B cells at different stages of differentiation and carrying unmutated (U-CLL) or mutated (M-CLL) IGHV genes. U-CLL, which has a poorer prognosis, often has relatively conserved (stereotypic) IGHV-HD-HJ sequences, indicative of interaction with large (super)antigens and similar to those in normal naive innate B cells. Conserved sequences are less evident in M-CLL, in keeping with its postfollicular origin. However, both subsets exhibit features of chronic antigen exposure in tissue sites, with local proliferative events, but also downregulation of surface immunoglobulin M but not surface immunoglobulin D, a characteristic of normal anergic B cells. BCR-mediated anergy can spread to other receptors such as CXCR4. Circulating CLL cells retain a shadow of tissue-based events that can reverse over time, but the overall extent of anergy is greater in M-CLL. Despite this stereotypic variety and more genomic complexity, BCR-mediated responses in vitro appear relatively homogeneous in U-CLL, but M-CLL is more heterogeneous. The differential balance between antigen-induced proliferation or anergy is the likely determinant of clinical behavior and possibly of response to kinase inhibitors.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

As a single biopsy might not represent the full biologic complexity of the tumor, we have analyzed immunohistochemically four different cores obtained from each primary tumor within the cohort of 364 patients with endometrial cancer (EC). The following proteins were examined: estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), progesterone receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor, v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2, receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-3, v-erb-b2 avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 4, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, phosphorylated v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1, v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog, DNA topoisomerase II alpha 170 kDa (TOP2A), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A), tumor protein p53, RAD21 homolog, S. pombe, and runt-related transcription factor 1. Particularly strong correlation was found between TOP2A and CDKN2A heterogeneity and higher stage of the disease (P = .0002 and P = .0003, respectively). Most correlations with clinicopathologic data were observed for ESR1 heterogeneity that correlated with non-endometrioid carcinomas (P=.02), higher stage (P=.005), grade (P=.01), and the presence of metastases (P = .01). Thirty-nine (11.0%) patients were classified as ""globally heterogeneous"".

However, its clinical use is limited by its hypercalcemic effects. An analog of 1,25D, doxercalciferol (1-D2), has anti-tumor activity, with markedly reduced calcemic effects, which makes it a potential agent for clinical treatment of AML. Previous studies suggested that the combination of 1,25D with other agents, such as plant-derived antioxidants, can have additive or synergistic anti-cancer activities in leukemia cells. Here we report that 1-D2 induced monocytic differentiation of HL60 and U937 cells, and that the antioxidant carnosic acid (CA) enhanced 1-D2 induced differentiation and cell cycle arrest. MicroRNA181a (miR181a) expression was also reduced after exposure to CA/1-D2. Since the cell cycle regulator p27Kip1 has been shown to be a target of miR181a, we modulated miR181a levels to determine if it plays a role in CA/1-D2 induced differentiation and cell cycle arrest in AML cells. We found that transfection of antisense miR181a potentiated CA/1-D2-induced cell differentiation, while the transfection of precursor of miR181a partially inhibited the effect of CA/1-D2 on the differentiation. These findings imply that miR181a has a role in CA/1-D2- induced differentiation and cell cycle arrest of HL60 and U937 cells, and shows a broader participation of miR181a in cell cycle control in leukemia cells.",,"['Duggal, Jyoti', 'Harrison, Jonathan S', 'Studzinski, George P', 'Wang, Xuening']","['Duggal J', 'Harrison JS', 'Studzinski GP', 'Wang X']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UMD-New Jersey Medical School, 185 South Orange Ave, Newark, New Jersey, 07101-1709, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United Arab Emirates,Microrna,"MicroRNA (Shariqah, United Arab Emirates)",101631045,"['0 (Abietanes)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Ergocalciferols)', '0 (MIrn181 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Vitamins)', '3DIZ9LF5Y9 (1 alpha-hydroxyergocalciferol)', 'LI791SXT24 (salvin)']",IM,"['Abietanes/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Ergocalciferols/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'Vitamins/*pharmacology']",,,2012/01/01 00:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2014/07/23 06:00'],"['2012/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/25 00:00 [revised]', '2012/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['MIRNA-45882 [pii]', '10.2174/2211536611201010026 [doi]']",ppublish,Microrna. 2012;1(1):26-33. doi: 10.2174/2211536611201010026.,,,['R01-CA-044722-21/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One hundred and eighty-one patients were recruited by 21 Italian centers. There were 95 males and 86 females, median age 78.6 years (range 75-93.6). According to Sokal score, 106 patients were classified as intermediate risk and 55 as high risk (not available in 20 patients). According to CCI stratification, 71 patients had score 0 and 110 a score >/= 1. Imatinib standard dose was reduced at start of therapy (200-300 mg/day) in 68 patients independently from the evaluation of baseline comorbidities, but based only on physician judgement: 43.6% of these patients had score 0 compared to 34% of patients who had score >/= 1. Significant differences were found in terms of subsequent dose reduction (39% of patients with score 0 compared to 53% of patients with score >/= 1) and in terms of drug discontinuation due to toxicity (35% of patients with score 0 vs 65% of patients with score >/= 1). We did not find significant differences as regards occurrence of hematologic side effects, probably as a consequence of the initial dose reduction: 39% of patients with score 0 experienced grade 3/4 hematologic toxicity (most commonly anemia) compared to 42% of patients with score >/= 1. Independently from the initial dose, comorbidities again did not have an impact on development of grade 3/4 non-hematologic side effects (most commonly skin rash, muscle cramps and fluid retention): 62% of patients with score 0 compared to 52.5% of patients with score >/= 1. Notwithstanding the reduced dose and the weight of comorbidities we did not find significant differences but only a trend in terms of efficacy: 66% of patients with score 0 achieved a CCyR compared to 54% of patients with score >/= 1. Comorbidities appeared to have an impact on median OS (40.8 months for patients with score 0 vs 20.16 months for patients with score >/= 1) on EFS and on non-CML death rate. Our results suggest that treatment of very elderly CML patients might be influenced by personal physician perception: evaluation at baseline of comorbidities according to CCI should improve initial decision-making in this subset of patients.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

STUDY DESIGN: Bivariate Probit treatment effects model that accounts for both the type of treatment received and survival while controlling for nonrandom selection due to unobservable factors. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Having private insurance coverage and residence in a well-educated county increased the chances a patient with either disease received HSCT. Increasing age and travel distance to the nearest transplant hospital had the opposite effect. Receipt of HSCT had a significant impact on mortality. We found the probability of death was 4.3 percentage points higher for leukemia patients who did NOT have HSCT. Receipt of HSCT reduced the chances of dying by almost 50 percent. The likelihood of death among lymphoma patients who underwent HSCT was almost 5 percentage points lower, a 70 percent reduction in the probability of death.

METHODS: We examined 57 survivors of childhood ALL, who were off treatment for at least 2 years and were in remission, aged 4-18 years, and 221 unrelated healthy controls. The Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) parent report was used either in English or in Bahasa Malaysia (the national language of Malaysia) to assess the behavioural outcome. RESULTS: Childhood ALL survivors had significantly higher scores on externalising behaviour on the CBCL parent report than did controls. Higher problem scores were found in ALL survivors with single parents on 'total problems' (P = 0.03) and subscales 'withdrawn' (P = 0.03), 'social problems' (P < 0.01) and 'delinquent behaviour' (P = 0.03) than in survivors with married parents. Significant associations were seen between a lower education level of the father and the variables representing internalising (withdrawn, anxious/depressed) and externalising (aggressive behaviour). We observed trends on higher scores in all scales in ALL survivors with single parents than in controls with single parents or with fathers with low education level, especially primary education only. CONCLUSIONS: Malaysian childhood ALL survivors had a significantly increased risk for externalising behavioural problems, and there was a trend towards increased risk of problems in many other behavioural scales. Understanding the sociocultural dimension of patients' health is important to be able to design the most appropriate remedy for problem behaviours detected in this multi-ethnic population.",['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Hamidah, Alias', 'Sham Marina, Mohd', 'Tamil, Azmi M', 'Loh, C-Khai', 'Zarina, Latiff A', 'Jamal, Rahman', 'Tuti Iryani, Mohd Daud', 'Ratnam, Vijayalakshmi C']","['Hamidah A', 'Sham Marina M', 'Tamil AM', 'Loh CK', 'Zarina LA', 'Jamal R', 'Tuti Iryani MD', 'Ratnam VC']","['Department of Pediatrics, National University of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140722,England,Trop Med Int Health,Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,9610576,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aggression', '*Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Anxiety', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', '*Child Behavior', '*Child Behavior Disorders', 'Child, Preschool', 'Depression', 'Educational Status', 'Fathers', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Malaysia', 'Male', '*Parents', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Single Parent', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survivors']",['NOTNLM'],"['Leucemia aguda', 'Malaisie', 'Malasia', 'Malaysia', 'Supervivientes', 'acute leukaemia', 'behavioural outcome', 'leucemie aigue', 'resultados conductuales', 'resultat comportemental', 'survivants', 'survivors']",2014/07/23 06:00,2014/11/13 06:00,['2014/07/23 06:00'],"['2014/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/tmi.12358 [doi]'],ppublish,Trop Med Int Health. 2014 Oct;19(10):1177-84. doi: 10.1111/tmi.12358.

It is interesting to study whether they could be an adjuvant to photodynamic therapy (PDT). Recent in vitro study proved that novel photosensitizer ZnPcS2P2 has capability of effective photodynamic killing of leukemic cells. In this preliminary study, we evaluated the photodynamic efficacy of ZnPcS2P2 on two tumor models and the improving anti-tumor efficacy of PDT in combination with GM-CSF gene-transduced vaccine and B7.1 gene-transduced vaccine. METHODS: Nude mice bearing human leukemia xenograft and C57BL/6 mice bearing EL-4 thymic lymphoma were used to evaluate photodynamic efficacy of ZnPcS2P2. The EL-4 thymic lymphoma was used to test the improving anti-tumor efficacy of ZnPcS2P2-PDT in combination with GM-CSF gene-transduced vaccine and B7.1 gene-transduced vaccine. Each vaccine was administered near the tumor bed three times: 2 days before PDT, 0 and 2 days after PDT. RESULTS: ZnPcS2P2-PDT could significantly reduce tumor growth and prolong the survival time in both tumor models. Improving anti-tumor efficacy of ZnPcS2P2-PDT was demonstrated when utilizing GM-CSF-transduced vaccine and B7.1-transduced vaccine prior to and after ZnPcS2P2-PDT in lymphoma-bearing mice. Twenty-five percent of lymphoma-bearing mice were completely cured with a combination of PDT and vaccine cells. CONCLUSIONS: ZnPcS2P2-PDT may be a beneficial treatment for hemotopoietic malignance. GM-CSF-transduced vaccine and B7.1-transduced vaccine could strengthen ZnPcS2P2-PDT-elicited anti-lymphoma potency.",,"['Huang, Hui-Fang', 'Chen, Yuan-Zhong', 'Wu, Yong', 'Li, Nai-Nong', 'Chen, Ping']","['Huang HF', 'Chen YZ', 'Wu Y', 'Li NN', 'Chen P']","['Fujian Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Fujian Medical University, 29 Xinquan Road, Fuzhou 350001, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20070327,Netherlands,Photodiagnosis Photodyn Ther,Photodiagnosis and photodynamic therapy,101226123,,,,,,2007/06/01 00:00,2007/06/01 00:01,['2014/07/23 06:00'],"['2006/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2007/02/05 00:00 [revised]', '2007/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2007/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/01 00:01 [medline]']","['S1572-1000(07)00029-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.pdpdt.2007.02.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Photodiagnosis Photodyn Ther. 2007 Jun;4(2):100-5. doi: 10.1016/j.pdpdt.2007.02.001.

The various ligands of the activating immunoreceptor NKG2D, NKG2DL) are selectively expressed on malignant cells including leukemia. We here took advantage of the tumor-associated expression of NKG2DL for targeting leukemic cells by NKG2D-immunoglobulin G (IgG)1 fusion proteins containing modified Fc parts. Compared to NKG2D-Fc containing a wild-type Fc part (NKG2D-Fc-WT), our mutants (S239D/I332E and E233P/L234V/L235A/DeltaG236/A327G/A330S) displayed highly enhanced (NKG2D-Fc-ADCC) and abrogated (NKG2D-Fc-KO) affinity to the NK cell Fc receptor, respectively. Functional analyses with allogenic as well as autologous NK cells and primary malignant cells of leukemia patients revealed that NKG2D-Fc-KO significantly reduced NK reactivity by blocking immunostimulatory NKG2D-NKG2DL interaction. NKG2D-Fc-WT already enhanced antileukemia reactivity by inducing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) with NKG2D-Fc-ADCC mediating significantly stronger effects. Parallel application of NKG2D-Fc-ADCC with Rituximab caused additive effects in lymphoid leukemia. In line with the tumor-associated expression of NKG2DL, no NK cell ADCC against resting healthy blood cells was induced. Thus, NKG2D-Fc-ADCC potently enhances NK antileukemia reactivity despite the inevitable reduction of activating signals upon binding to NKG2DL and may constitute an attractive means for immunotherapy of leukemia.",['(c) 2014 UICC.'],"['Steinbacher, Julia', 'Baltz-Ghahremanpour, Katrin', 'Schmiedel, Benjamin Joachim', 'Steinle, Alexander', 'Jung, Gundram', 'Kubler, Ayline', 'Andre, Maya Caroline', 'Grosse-Hovest, Ludger', 'Salih, Helmut Rainer']","['Steinbacher J', 'Baltz-Ghahremanpour K', 'Schmiedel BJ', 'Steinle A', 'Jung G', 'Kubler A', 'Andre MC', 'Grosse-Hovest L', 'Salih HR']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140728,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (KLRK1 protein, human)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments/genetics/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin G/genetics/*immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia/genetics/*immunology/*pathology', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K/genetics/*immunology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/*immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['ADCC', 'NK cells', 'NKG2D ligands', 'leukemia']",2014/07/22 06:00,2015/02/27 06:00,['2014/07/22 06:00'],"['2014/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.29083 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2015 Mar 1;136(5):1073-84. doi: 10.1002/ijc.29083.

This retrospective comparison reports on this combination and TKI alone for treatment of CML-BC. Of the 83 CML-BC patients, 45 received TKIs (imatinib; nilotinib or dasatinib after imatinib resistance; TKIs group) and 38 were treated with allo-HSCT after TKI (TKIs+allo-HSCT group). Treatment success was measured in terms of the hematologic, cytogenic and molecular responses, and subject outcome. Follow-up was 30-126 months or until death.

This finding was noted in seven different patient samples analyzed on different days as part of routine clinical care in our laboratory, with analysis of different anti-CD19 antibody clones and fluorochrome conjugates in five of the seven samples. Although the etiology of this finding is not clear, possibilities include true low level expression and trogocytosis.

However, there were few reports on the effects and underlying mechanism of PD on apoptosis in U87 human glioma cells. The present study was conducted to evaluate apoptotic induction of PD in U87 human glioma cells, and explore its underlying pathway. U87 glioma cells were cultured and treated with varied concentrations of PD (from 10(-8) to 10(-4) M). The inhibition of U87 glioma cell proliferation by PD was assessed by MTT assay. The apoptosis of U87 glioma cells was detected by flow cytometry, and western blot analysis was used to examine human B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), human Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax), caspase-3, total-c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (t-JNK), and phosphorylation-JNK (p-JNK) protein expression in U87 human glioma cells. The treatment with PD for 24 h significantly inhibited the proliferation of U87 human glioma cells in a concentration-dependent manner. PD increased apoptosis and significantly upregulated the expression of Bax, caspase-3, and p-JNK associated with apoptosis, but downregulated antiapoptotic Bcl-2 expression in U87 human glioma cells. Our data provided evidences that PD induces apoptosis in U87 human glioma cells.

In 2-10% of CML cases, the fusion gene arises in connection with a variant translocation, involving chromosomes 9, 22, and one or more different chromosomes; consequently, the Ph chromosome could be masked within a complex chromosome rearrangement.

Results of trials from pediatric groups have shown that the unfavourable prognosis of adolescents is no more adequate. The majority of the older adolescents with ALL can be cured with risk-adjusted and minimal residual disease-guided intensive chemotherapy, without stem cell transplantation. However, some specific subgroups, which are more frequent in adolescents than in children (e.g., early pre-T, iAMP21, and BCR-ABL-like), deserve particular attention.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Overall, 128 high-risk ALL patients at a median age of 26 years (range 18-56 years) at diagnosis received AHSCT between 1991-2008. Induction treatment was anthracycline-based in all patients. Conditioning regimen consisted of CAV (cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, etoposide) in 125 patients whereas 3 subjects received cyclophosphamide and TBI (total body irradiation). Bone marrow was stored for 72 hours in 4 degrees C and re-infused 24 hours after conditioning completion. Bone marrow was a source of stem cells in 119 patients, peripheral blood in 2 and 7 subjects received both bone marrow and peripheral blood. RESULTS: With a median follow-up after AHSCT of 1.6 years (range 0.1-22.3 years), the probability of leukemia-free survival (LFS) for the whole group at 10 years was 27% and 23% at 20 years. Transplant-related mortality at 100 days after AHSCT was 3.2%. There was a strong tendency for better LFS for MRD-negative patients if compared with patients who had positive or unknown MRD status at AHSCT (32% vs 23% and 25%, respectively; p=0.06).

To gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms of this process and identify the differentially expressed genes in SUDHL6 cells after BCL11A downregulation, the global gene expression profile was identified and analyzed using the Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 array. Twenty-one differentially expressed genes were validated and analyzed from the BCL11A siRNA-treated SUDHL6 cells. There was a significant dysregulation in the global gene expression of the BCL11A-suppressed SUDHL6 cells. There were 1903 genes differentially expressed with >2-fold changes between the BCL11A siRNA- and negative control-transfected cells. Of these, there were 916 upregulated genes and 987 downregulated genes. The differential genes are involved in various molecular functions and signaling pathways. QRT-PCR validation of the selected differentially expressed genes demonstrated there was a good correlation with the microarray analysis.

Three new limonoids, 3-deacetyl-4'-demethylsalannin (5), 3-deacetyl-28-oxosalannin (14), and 1-detigloylohchinolal (17), along with 16 known limonoids, 1-4, 6-13, 15, 16, 18, and 19, and one known triterpenoid, 20, were isolated from the fraction. The structures of new compounds were elucidated on the basis of extensive spectroscopic analyses and comparison with literature. These compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxic activities against the four cancer cell lines mentioned above. 3-Deacetyl-4'-demethyl-28-oxosalannin (16), which exhibited potent cytotoxicity against AZ521 (IC50 3.2 muM) cells, induced typical apoptotic cell death in AZ521 cells upon evaluation of the apoptosis-inducing activity by flow cytometry.

The frequency of BTG1 deletions in DS-ALL is controversial. IKZF1 deletions, found in 20-30% of DS-ALL patients, are associated with a poor outcome and EBF1 deletions are very rare ( approximately 2%). We analyzed 38 patients to determine the frequencies and clinical implications of CRLF2-JAK pathway genetic alterations and recurrent gene deletions in Japanese DS-ALL patients. We confirmed a high incidence of P2RY8-CRLF2 (29%) and JAK2 mutations (16%), though the frequency of P2RY8-CRLF2 was slightly lower than that in Western countries ( approximately 50%). BTG1 deletions were common in our cohort (25%). IKZF1 deletions were detected in 25% of patients and associated with shorter overall survival (OS). EBF1 deletions were found at an unexpectedly high frequency (16%), and at a significantly higher level in P2RY8-CRLF2-positive patients than in P2RY8-CRLF2-negative patients (44% vs. 4%, P=0.015). Deletions of CDKN2A/B and PAX5 were common in P2RY8-CRLF2-negative patients (48 and 39%, respectively) but not in P2RY8-CRLF2-positive patients (11% each). Associations between these genetic alterations and clinical characteristics were not observed except for inferior OS in patients with IKZF1 deletions. These results suggest that differences exist between the genetic profiles of DS-ALL patients in Japan and in Western countries, and that P2RY8-CRLF2 and EBF1 deletions may cooperate in leukemogenesis in a subset of Japanese DS-ALL patients.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Hanada, Isamu', 'Terui, Kiminori', 'Ikeda, Fumika', 'Toki, Tsutomu', 'Kanezaki, Rika', 'Sato, Tomohiko', 'Kamio, Takuya', 'Kudo, Ko', 'Sasaki, Shinya', 'Takahashi, Yoshihiro', 'Hayashi, Yasuhide', 'Inukai, Takeshi', 'Kojima, Seiji', 'Koike, Kenichi', 'Kosaka, Yoshiyuki', 'Kobayashi, Masao', 'Imaizumi, Masue', 'Mitsui, Tetsuo', 'Hori, Hiroki', 'Hara, Junichi', 'Horibe, Keizo', 'Nagai, Jun-ichi', 'Goto, Hiroaki', 'Ito, Etsuro']","['Hanada I', 'Terui K', 'Ikeda F', 'Toki T', 'Kanezaki R', 'Sato T', 'Kamio T', 'Kudo K', 'Sasaki S', 'Takahashi Y', 'Hayashi Y', 'Inukai T', 'Kojima S', 'Koike K', 'Kosaka Y', 'Kobayashi M', 'Imaizumi M', 'Mitsui T', 'Hori H', 'Hara J', 'Horibe K', 'Nagai J', 'Goto H', 'Ito E']","['Department of Pediatrics, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine, Hirosaki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140716,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (CRLF2 protein, human)', '0 (P2RY8 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2Y)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Asians', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Down Syndrome/complications/ethnology/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Dosage', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/ethnology/*genetics', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*genetics', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2Y/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/07/22 06:00,2015/07/22 06:00,['2014/07/22 06:00'],"['2014/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/15 00:00 [revised]', '2014/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.22201 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2014 Nov;53(11):902-10. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22201.

Some studies report a correlation between a MK and a worse survival, whereas others claim that this correlation arises because of a confounding effect between a MK and a complex karyotype (CK). To address this question, we analyzed the clinical data and karyotypes of 610 adults with MDS. A MK was identified in 60 patients, of whom 55 (92%) also fulfilled the criteria for a CK. Conversely, a CK was found in 85 patients, of whom 55 (65%) also had a MK. To determine the impact of a MK on survival, 464 patients who received nonintensive therapies for MDS were analyzed separately. Patients with a MK demonstrated worse survival than those without a MK in univariate analyses (median, 8 months [95% CI, 3-12 months] versus 83 months [63-103 months]; P < 0.001). This effect was observed predominately in the cohorts of higher-risk patients according to the Revised International Prognostic Scoring System and the World Health Organization Prognostic Scoring System (HR [hazard ratio] 3.94 [1.97-7.89]; P < 0.001 and 4.937 [2.45-9.94]; P < 0.001, respectively) and surpassed the impact of a CK in the final survival models. Our data suggest that the addition of MK as a binary variable could improve the predictive accuracy of current models to estimate the survival of patients with MDS.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Xing, Ruixian', 'Li, Chengwen', 'Gale, Robert Peter', 'Zhang, Yue', 'Xu, Zefeng', 'Qin, Tiejun', 'Li, Bing', 'Fang, Liwei', 'Zhang, Hongli', 'Pan, Lijuan', 'Hu, Naibo', 'Qu, Shiqiang', 'Xiao, Zhijian']","['Xing R', 'Li C', 'Gale RP', 'Zhang Y', 'Xu Z', 'Qin T', 'Li B', 'Fang L', 'Zhang H', 'Pan L', 'Hu N', 'Qu S', 'Xiao Z']","['MDS and MPN Centre, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, China.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140730,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Biological', '*Monosomy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Survival Rate']",,,2014/07/22 06:00,2014/11/11 06:00,['2014/07/22 06:00'],"['2014/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/02 00:00 [revised]', '2014/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23801 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2014 Oct;89(10):E163-8. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23801.

In this study, the molecular mechanism how HKL 2H induces cytotoxic activity in the human chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells was investigated. Flow cytometric analysis showed that the cells were arrested in the G2/M phase and accumulated subsequently in the sub-G1 phase in the presence of HKL 2H. HKL 2H treatment down-regulated the expressions of CDK1 and cyclin B but up-regulated the level of phosphorylated CDK1. Annexin-V staining and the classic DNA ladder studies showed that HKL 2H induced the apoptosis of K562 cells. Our study further showed that HKL 2H treatment caused the dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, activated caspase-3 and lowered the Bcl-2/Bax ratio in K562 cells, suggesting that the HKL 2H-causing programmed cell death of K562 cells was caused via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Taken together, our data demonstrated that HKL 2H, a 5-(2-carboxyethenyl) isatin derivative, notably induces G2/M cell cycle arrest and mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in K562 cells, indicating that this compound could be a promising anticancer candidate for further investigation.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, we report the clinical characteristics and outcomes of these patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RL or refractory Burkitt lymphoma and mature B-ALL in 125 patients diagnosed from 1990 to 2009 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Nineteen patients experienced RL or progressive disease (PD). Among them, 12 patients had PD or RL less than six months after initial treatment and seven had late RL. Seven patients achieved complete response (CR), 11 had PD, and one had no more therapy. Six patients who achieved CR survived without evidence of disease and four of them underwent high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) followed by stem cell transplantation (SCT). However, 11 patients who failed to obtain CR eventually died of their disease. Five-year overall survival (OS) was 31.6+/-10.7%. OS of patients with late RL was superior to that of patients with early RL (57.1+/-18.7%, vs. 16.7+/-10.8%, p=0.014). Achievement of CR after reinduction had significant OS (p < 0.001). OS for patients who were transplanted was superior (p < 0.01). In multivariate analysis, achievement of CR after reinduction chemotherapy showed an association with improved OS (p=0.05).

Meanwhile, the decrease of NHE1 and up-regulation of phosphorylated ERK1/2 were observed after CIAPIN1 depletion. Interestingly, targeted inhibition of NHE1 further promoted the differentiation of K562 cells with CIAPIN1 silencing. Accordingly, ectopic expression of NHE1 reversed this phenotype. Furthermore, ERK1/2 inhibition with the chemical inhibitor, PD98059, abolished CIAPIN1 silencing-induced differentiation of K562 cells after NHE1 inhibition. Thus, our results revealed important mechanism that CIAPIN1 targeted NHE1 to mediate differentiation of K562 cells via ERK1/2 pathway.

Studies have shown that patients with CLL have increased angiogenesis in the microenvironment; levels of proangiogenic growth factors such as VEGF and/or angiopoietin-2 are also elevated. Increased angiogenesis correlates with poor outcome in CLL. Bevacizumab (B) is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting VEGF-A. METHODS: In this study, we analyzed whether a combination of bevacizumab with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab chemoimmunotherapy (FCR-B) could improve outcomes in patients with relapsed CLL. Sixty-two patients were enrolled. The median age of the patients was 60 years (range, 31-84 years) and 40% had received >1 prior therapy for CLL. Sixty-one patients were evaluable for toxicity, and 57 were evaluable for response. Six cycles were planned; 36 patients (59%) completed >/=4-6 cycles of the regimen. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 79%, with 13 (23%) complete remissions (CRs), 8 nodular partial remissions (14%), and 24 partial remissions (43%). The median progression-free survival and overall survival rates were 13.5 and 45 months, respectively. Grade 3 or 4 toxicities included febrile neutropenia (n = 40), infections (n = 21), thrombocytopenia (n = 18) and anemia (n = 9).

The mechanisms underlying reactive astrocyte proliferation upon injury remain partially understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) function as a major class of post-transcriptional gene expression regulators that participate in many biological processes. However, miRNA function during reactive astrogliosis, particularly in injury-induced astrocyte proliferation, has not been carefully examined. In this study, we conditionally deleted Dicer1 gene encoding an enzyme that is required for mature miRNA generation, and examined the proliferative behavior of Dicer1-null reactive astrocytes in the transected mouse spinal cord. We found that injury-induced proliferation is blocked in Dicer1-null astrocytes. Previous reports indicate that miR-17-5p family members are upregulated during SCI. We therefore tested functional contribution of miR-17-5p to the proliferation of reactive astrocytes in vitro. Our results showed that a synthetic miR-17-5p mimic is able to rescue the proliferation defect of Dicer1-null astrocytes, while an antisense inhibitor of miR-17-5p blocked lipopolysaccharide-induced astrocytic proliferation. Similar results are also observed in leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-treated astroglial cultures suggesting that miR-17-5p particularly modulates reactive astrocyte proliferation initiated by LIF presumably via the JAK/STAT3 pathway. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-17-5p leads to decrease of several cell cycle regulators in cultured astroglia and astrocytoma cell line C6. Our conclusion is that miRNAs are indispensable to the injury-induced reactive astrocyte proliferation, and that miR-17-5p may be a major player regulating this pathological process by affecting cell cycle machinery.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Hong, Peiwei', 'Jiang, Mei', 'Li, Hedong']","['Hong P', 'Jiang M', 'Li H']","[""West China Developmental & Stem Cell Institute, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140718,United States,Glia,Glia,8806785,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn17 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Olig2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Oligodendrocyte Transcription Factor 2)', 'EC 3.1.26.3 (Dicer1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.26.3 (Ribonuclease III)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (DEAD-box RNA Helicases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/*metabolism', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'CD11b Antigen/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DEAD-box RNA Helicases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Ki-67 Antigen/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism', 'Oligodendrocyte Transcription Factor 2', 'Ribonuclease III/genetics/*metabolism', 'Spinal Cord Injuries/*pathology/physiopathology', 'beta-Galactosidase/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Dicer (Dicer1)', 'miR-17-5p', 'miRNAs', 'proliferation', 'spinal cord injury']",2014/07/22 06:00,2015/06/20 06:00,['2014/07/22 06:00'],"['2014/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/01 00:00 [revised]', '2014/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/glia.22725 [doi]'],ppublish,Glia. 2014 Dec;62(12):2044-60. doi: 10.1002/glia.22725.

METHODS: The apoptotic effects of sorafenib were performed using MTS assay, diamidino-phenylindole (DAPI) staining, Western blotting, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), siRNA, and xenograft. RESULTS: Sorafenib had apoptotic effects on MC-3 and YD15 cells and decreased myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) through proteasome-dependent protein degradation and the inhibition of protein synthesis. Sorafenib significantly affected truncated bid (t-Bid) and siMcl-1 resulting in the upregulation of t-Bid to induce apoptosis. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation was also blocked by sorafenib and a potent STAT3 inhibitor, cryptotanshinone clearly induced poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage by inhibiting Mcl-1 and increasing t-Bid. Finally, administration of sorafenib significantly suppressed tumor growth and induced apoptosis in tumor xenograft model in association with downregulation of Mcl-1 without any side effects. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these findings suggest that sorafenib can be a good anticancer drug candidate for the treatment of MEC.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Yu, Hyun-Ju', 'Shin, Ji-Ae', 'Jung, Ji-Youn', 'Nam, Jeong-Seok', 'Hong, In-Sun', 'Cho, Nam-Pyo', 'Cho, Sung-Dae']","['Yu HJ', 'Shin JA', 'Jung JY', 'Nam JS', 'Hong IS', 'Cho NP', 'Cho SD']","['Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry, and Institute of Oral Bioscience, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry, and Institute of Oral Bioscience, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Companion and Laboratory Animal Science, Kongju National University, Yesan, Republic of Korea.', 'Lee Gil Ya Cancer and Diabetes Institute, Inchon, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Gachon University, Incheon, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry, and Institute of Oral Bioscience, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry, and Institute of Oral Bioscience, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140719,United States,Head Neck,Head & neck,8902541,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carcinoma, Mucoepidermoid/drug therapy/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Heterografts/drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics', 'Niacinamide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Phenylurea Compounds/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Random Allocation', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Salivary Gland Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorafenib', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",['NOTNLM'],"['apoptosis', 'mucoepidermoid carcinoma', 'myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1)', 'signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)', 'sorafenib']",2014/07/22 06:00,2016/05/14 06:00,['2014/07/22 06:00'],"['2013/11/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/24 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hed.23749 [doi]'],ppublish,Head Neck. 2015 Sep;37(9):1326-35. doi: 10.1002/hed.23749.

This study investigated its clinical and prognostic significance in GBC patients, as well as its association with the anti-apoptotic protein, myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL1) protein. METHODS: FXR and MCL1 expression in 42 primary GBC and 15 normal gallbladder tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The patients and samples were collected from Ren Ji Hospital from January 2005 to December 2010. Their association with clinicopathologic factors and prognosis, as well as the correlation between FXR and MCL1 protein expression were analyzed by statistical analyses. RESULTS: Compared with normal gallbladder tissues, FXR expression was decreased and MCL1 expression was increased in GBC, during progression of tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that FXR low-expression and MCL1 over-expression were significantly associated with overall poor survival. Furthermore, multivariate analysis showed that FXR and MCL1 are both prognostic factors for GBC patients. FXR low-expression was significantly correlated with MCL1 over-expression.

For patients who experience an unsatisfactory response tomDLI, relapse is usually inevitable. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the efficacy ofinterferon alpha therapy in these patients. METHODS: Regular MRD monitoring was carried out after the HSCT. The patients who were MRD-positive underwent mDLI. Patients with an unsatisfactory response to mDLI received interferon alpha therapy (3 million units, twice weekly) with regular monitoring of MRD. To ensure the immunomodulatory effects of interferon alpha, immunosuppressant treatment would be stopped before interferon alpha treatment. RESULTS: Five patients with an unsatisfactory response to mDLI treatment received interferon alpha (3 had t (8;21) chromosomal translocation acute myeloid leukemia, and 2 had common acute leukemia). They had significantly reduced or resolved MRD. Four patients developed chronic graft-versus-host disease. Two of the 5 patients reported transient fevers, and no significant bone marrow suppression was observed. All of them were in continuous complete remission after interferon a treatment. The median survival time was 469 days (range 368-948 days).

However, the transcriptional machinery contains various enzymatic cofactors that can be targeted for the development of new therapeutic candidates, including cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Here we present the discovery and characterization of a covalent CDK7 inhibitor, THZ1, which has the unprecedented ability to target a remote cysteine residue located outside of the canonical kinase domain, providing an unanticipated means of achieving selectivity for CDK7. Cancer cell-line profiling indicates that a subset of cancer cell lines, including human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL), have exceptional sensitivity to THZ1. Genome-wide analysis in Jurkat T-ALL cells shows that THZ1 disproportionally affects transcription of RUNX1 and suggests that sensitivity to THZ1 may be due to vulnerability conferred by the RUNX1 super-enhancer and the key role of RUNX1 in the core transcriptional regulatory circuitry of these tumour cells.

Mice invariably relapsed after treatment with drug-resistant clones, most of which unexpectedly had reduced levels of activated Notch1 protein, downregulated many Notch1 target genes, and exhibited cross-resistance to gamma-secretase inhibitors. Multiple resistant primary T-ALLs that emerged in vivo did not contain somatic Notch1 mutations present in the parental leukaemia. Importantly, resistant clones upregulated PI3K signalling. Consistent with these data, inhibiting Notch1 activated the PI3K pathway, providing a likely mechanism for selection against oncogenic Notch1 signalling.

Eleven trials with a total of 1392 patients with MDS (decitabine, n = 768; azacitidine, n = 624) were included for analysis. The pooled estimates of partial response, hematologic improvement, and overall response rates for azacitidine were significantly higher than for decitabine. There were no differences between these 2 drugs regarding complete response, red blood cell transfusion-independent rates, and grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity. When compared with best supportive care, azacitidine significantly improved overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; 95% CI, 0.54-0.87) and time to acute myeloid leukemia transformation (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.35-0.74). But these benefits were not found with decitabine. Among patients with higher risk (International Prognostic Scoring System value of 3) or older than 75 years, treatment with azacitidine was a favorable factor, whereas decitabine showed no advantage. Therefore, with higher overall response rates and better survival benefits, azacitidine is recommended as the first-line hypomethylating agent for MDS, especially in elderly patients or those with high risk.",['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This work provides a consistent test for this association with respect to the conditional odds ratio (ORc), which is a measure of association that is also valid in prospective studies. We formulate the test from the maximum likelihood (ML) estimate of ORc by using data under inverse binomial sampling, in which individuals are selected sequentially to form matched pairs until for the first time one obtains either a prefixed number of index pairs with the case unexposed but the control exposed or with the case exposed but the control unexposed. We discuss the situation of possible early stopping. We compare numerically the performance of our procedure with a competitor proposed by Lui () in terms of type I error rate, power, average sample number (ASN) and the corresponding standard error. Our numerical study shows a gain in sample size without loss in power as compared to the competitor.

We found that 6PGD is commonly activated in EGF-stimulated cells and human cancer cells by lysine acetylation. Acetylation at K76 and K294 of 6PGD promotes NADP(+) binding to 6PGD and formation of active 6PGD dimers, respectively. Moreover, we identified DLAT and ACAT2 as upstream acetyltransferases of K76 and K294, respectively, and HDAC4 as the deacetylase of both sites. Expressing acetyl-deficient mutants of 6PGD in cancer cells significantly attenuated cell proliferation and tumor growth. This is due in part to reduced levels of 6PGD products ribulose-5-phosphate and NADPH, which led to reduced RNA and lipid biosynthesis as well as elevated ROS. Furthermore, 6PGD activity is upregulated with increased lysine acetylation in primary leukemia cells from human patients, providing mechanistic insights into 6PGD upregulation in cancer cells.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

This is a multicenter, retrospective cohort study of patients with biopsy-proven indolent B cell nonfollicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma and simultaneous or subsequent biopsy-proven aggressive histology transformation who were treated with allo-SCT or auto-SCT between 1996 and 2013. All patients received myeloablative conditioning regimens. Outcomes were compared with a cohort of 246 patients with transformed follicular lymphoma who also underwent allo-SCT (n = 47) or auto-SCT (n = 199) across the same institutions and time frame. Thirty-four patients were identified with the following underlying indolent histologies: 15 (44%) marginal zone lymphoma, 11 (32%) chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 6 (18%) small lymphocytic lymphoma, and 2 (6%) lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. Patients received various anthracycline or platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens for transformation, incorporating rituximab in 25 (74%). Twelve (35%) subsequently underwent allo-SCT, whereas 33 (65%) underwent auto-SCT. The 3-year overall survival rate after transplantation was 67% (allo-SCT 54%, auto-SCT 74%), and 3-year progression-free survival rate was 49% (allo-SCT 40%, auto-SCT 54%). The 3-year nonrelapse mortality rate was 14% (allo-SCT 15%, auto-SCT 7%). Transplant-related mortality at 100 days was 17% for allo-SCT and 0% for auto-SCT. Adjusted for type of stem cell transplantation, 3-year overall survival, progression-free survival, and nonrelapse mortality rates were similar to those of patients with transformed follicular lymphoma receiving allo-SCT and auto-SCT (P = .38, P = .69, and P = .54, respectively). Allo-SCT and auto-SCT may be reasonable treatments for selected patients with transformed nonfollicular indolent lymphoma, although medium-term outcomes and toxicity appear to be more favorable with auto-SCT.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

RIC/NMC recipients with leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (n = 2833) and lymphoma (n = 1436) between 1995 and 2006 were included. In addition, RIC/NMC recipients 40 to 60 years of age (n = 2138) were compared with patients of the same age receiving myeloablative conditioning (MAC, n = 6428). The cumulative incidence of solid cancers was 3.35% at 10 years. There was no increase in overall cancer risk compared with the general population (leukemia/MDS: standardized incidence ratio [SIR] .99, P = 1.00; lymphoma: SIR .92, P = .75). However, risks were significantly increased in leukemia/MDS patients for cancers of lip (SIR 14.28), tonsil (SIR 8.66), oropharynx (SIR 46.70), bone (SIR 23.53), soft tissue (SIR 12.92), and vulva (SIR 18.55) and skin melanoma (SIR 3.04). Lymphoma patients had significantly higher risks of oropharyngeal cancer (SIR 67.35) and skin melanoma (SIR 3.52). Among RIC/NMC recipients, age >50 years was the only independent risk factor for solid cancers (hazard ratio [HR] 3.02, P < .001). Among patients ages 40 to 60 years, when adjusted for other factors, there was no difference in cancer risks between RIC/NMC and MAC in leukemia/MDS patients (HR .98, P = .905). In lymphoma patients, risks were lower after RIC/NMC (HR .51, P = .047).

Those reports prompted the current investigation of the pediatric augmented Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (ABFM) regimen in AYA patients. The results were compared with those from a similar population that received the hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (hyper-CVAD) regimen. METHODS: Eighty-five patients ages 12 to 40 years who had Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-negative ALL received the ABFM regimen from October 2006 through April 2012. Their outcome was compared with outcomes in 71 historic AYA patients who received hyper-CVAD from the authors' institution. Patient and disease characteristics, as well as minimal residual disease status, were analyzed for their impact on outcomes. RESULTS: The complete response rate with ABFM was 94%. The 3-year complete remission duration (CRD) and overall survival (OS) rates were 70% and 74%, respectively. For patients aged </=21 years, the 3-year CRD and OS rates were 72% and 85%, respectively; and, for patients ages 21 to 40 years, the respective rates were 69% and 60%. The initial white blood cell count was an independent predictive factor of OS and CRD. The minimal residual disease status on days 29 and 84 of therapy also were predictive of long-term outcomes. Severe regimen toxicities included transient hepatotoxicity in 35% to 39% of patients, pancreatitis in 11% of patients, osteonecrosis in 11% of patients, and thrombosis in 22% of patients. The 3-year OS rate was 74% in the ABFM group versus 71% in the hyper-CVAD group, and the corresponding 3-year CRD rate was 70% versus 66%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: ABFM was tolerable in AYA patients with ALL but was not associated with significant improvements in CRD and OS compared with hyper-CVAD.",['(c) 2014 American Cancer Society.'],"['Rytting, Michael E', 'Thomas, Deborah A', ""O'Brien, Susan M"", 'Ravandi-Kashani, Farhad', 'Jabbour, Elias J', 'Franklin, Anna R', 'Kadia, Tapan M', 'Pemmaraju, Naveen', 'Daver, Naval G', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Konopleva, Marina Y', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Borthakur, Gautham', 'Garris, Rebecca', 'Cardenas-Turanzas, Maria', 'Schroeder, Kurt', 'Jorgensen, Jeffrey L', 'Kornblau, Steven M', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M']","['Rytting ME', 'Thomas DA', ""O'Brien SM"", 'Ravandi-Kashani F', 'Jabbour EJ', 'Franklin AR', 'Kadia TM', 'Pemmaraju N', 'Daver NG', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Konopleva MY', 'Cortes JE', 'Borthakur G', 'Garris R', 'Cardenas-Turanzas M', 'Schroeder K', 'Jorgensen JL', 'Kornblau SM', 'Kantarjian HM']","['Department of Pediatrics-Patient Care, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas; Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140717,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster protocol II']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Philadelphia chromosome-negative ALL', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'augmented Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster', 'pediatric-based regimens', 'pediatric-based therapy']",2014/07/22 06:00,2015/01/17 06:00,['2014/07/22 06:00'],"['2014/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/20 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.28930 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2014 Dec 1;120(23):3660-8. doi: 10.1002/cncr.28930.

We retrospectively studied 571 de novo AML in patients aged >50 years, including 142 RAEBT and 429 with >/=30% blasts (AML30), as well as 151 patients with 10-19% BM blasts (RAEB2). RAEBT patients were older and had lower white blood count, but higher hemoglobin, platelet count, and karyotype risk scores compared to AML30, while these features were similar to RAEB2. FLT3 and NPM1 mutations and monocytic morphology occurred more commonly in AML30 than in RAEBT. RAEBT patients were treated less often with induction therapy than AML30, whereas allogeneic stem cell transplant frequency was similar. The median and 4-year OS of RAEBT patients were longer than those of AML30 patients (20.5 vs 12.0 months and 28.6% vs 20.4%, respectively, P = 0.003); this difference in OS was manifested in patients in the intermediate UKMRC karyotype risk group, whereas OS of RAEBT patients and AML30 patients in the adverse karyotype risk group were not significantly different. Multivariable analysis showed that RAEBT (P < 0.0001), hemoglobin (P = 0.005), UKMRC karyotype risk group (P = 0.002), normal BM karyotype (P = 0.004), treatment with induction therapy (P < 0.0001), and stem cell transplant (P < 0.0001) were associated with longer OS.

The recent availability of alternative tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) renders the clinical management of CML more complex. In this article, we summarize our long-term single institution experience. From 2003 to 2012, 102 patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML were referred to our institution and treated with imatinib mesylate as first-line therapy. All patients were followed inside a dedicated CML clinic. At 1 year, 82/95 patients (86.3%) achieved complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) using a treatment performed analysis (TPA); when using an intention to treat analysis, 85/102 patients (83.3%) obtained CCyR. At 3 months, 58 patients (64.4% TPA) obtained a BCR-ABL transcripts level <10%. A major molecular response (MMR) was obtained by 38% and 53% of patients at 1 and 2 years. Twenty patients (19.6%) discontinued treatment with imatinib; six of them did so in the initial 2 years of treatment (4 for resistance and 2 for adverse events). We observed seven deaths (6.86%). Overall survival (OS) at 6 years is 95.1% (95% C.I. 90-100%) and is not different from that of the general population. No patient experienced progression of disease (95% C.I.: 0-3%). Our results suggest that patient management is a crucial point to obtain a successful therapeutic outcome: at 1 year CCyR and MMR rates are similar to the results obtained with second generation TKIs and OS is not different from that of the general population.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Vigano, Ilaria', 'Di Giacomo, Nunzio', 'Bozzani, Sofia', 'Antolini, Laura', 'Piazza, Rocco', 'Gambacorti Passerini, Carlo']","['Vigano I', 'Di Giacomo N', 'Bozzani S', 'Antolini L', 'Piazza R', 'Gambacorti Passerini C']","['Department of Health Sciences, University of Milano-Bicocca, via Cadore 48, Monza, Italy; San Gerardo Hospital, Clinical Research Unit, Monza, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140731,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Benzamides/*administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism/*mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",,,2014/07/22 06:00,2014/11/11 06:00,['2014/07/22 06:00'],"['2014/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23804 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2014 Oct;89(10):E184-7. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23804.

However, autologous NK cells from AML patients express decreased levels of activating receptors, and show reduced cytotoxicity. Here, we investigated how interactions between NK and AML cells might cause loss of NK-cell activity in patients. Our results show that AML cell lines and primary blasts alter the NK-cell phenotype, reducing their cytotoxic potential upon prolonged contact. Downregulation of NK-cell-activating receptors was contact-dependent and correlated with conjugate formation. Time-lapse imaging of HL60 AML cell line and NK-cell interactions showed a high proportion of noncytolytic contacts. Studies of NK-cell immunological synapses revealed a defect in lytic synapse formation. Namely, despite correct F-actin and LFA-1 recruitment, polarization of lytic granules toward primary blasts or AML cell lines was reduced. The NK-AML cell line synapses showed impairment of CD3zeta recruitment. Attempts to correct these synapse defects by cytokine stimulation of NK cells improved conjugate formation, but not granule polarization. Pretreatment of AML cell lines with the immunomodulating molecule lenalidomide significantly enhanced granule polarization. We speculate that combining immunomodulatory drugs and cytokines could increase AML cell sensitivity to autologous NK cells and reinforce the activity of allogeneic NK cells in adoptive immunotherapy.","['(c) 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

NET1 was identified as one of the targets of miR-22 using both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Either mutations or naturally occurring single-nucleotide polymorphisms in NET1 3'-UTR that map at the miR-22 binding site were found to affect binding of miR-22 to NET1 mRNA. Over expression of NET1 in K562 cells resulted in increased proliferation. However decreased proliferation and alteration in cell cycle were observed on either overexpression of miR-22 or knockdown of NET1 expression respectively. We also found that overexpression of miR-22 or NET1 knockdown inhibits actin fiber formation, probably by downregulation of NET1 as NET1 knockdown also resulted in depletion of actin fiber formation.

One potential mechanism of protection is through secretion of soluble factors that protect neurons and oligodendrocytes (OLs) from oxidative stress. To overcome practical issues with cellular therapies, identification of soluble factors released by HUCB and other stem cells may pave the way for treatment modalities that are safer for a larger percentage of stroke patients. Among these soluble factors is leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a cytokine that exerts pleiotropic effects on cell survival. Here, data show that LIF effectively reduced infarct volume, reduced white matter injury and improved functional outcomes when administered to rats following permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion. To further explore downstream signaling, primary oligodendrocyte cultures were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation to mimic stroke conditions.

However, the specific effects and mechanisms of saponins of Rubus parvifolius L. (SRP) remain unclear with regard to human chronic myeloid leukemia cells. The aim of this study was to investigate inhibition of proliferation and apoptosis induction effects of SRP in K562 cells and further elucidate its regulatory mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: K562 cells were treated with different concentrations of SRP and MTT assays were performed to determine cell viability. Apoptosis induction by SRP was determined with FACS and DAPI staining analysis. Western blotting was used to detect expression of apoptosis and survival related genes. Specific inhibitors were added to confirm roles of STAT3 and AMPK pathways in SRP induction of apoptosis. RESULTS: Our results indicated that SRP exhibited obvious inhibitory effects on the growth of K562 cells, and significantly induced apoptosis. Cleavage of pro-apoptotic proteins was dramatically increased after SRP exposure. SRP treatment also increased the activities of AMPK and JNK pathways, and inhibited the phosphorylation expression level of STAT3 in K562 cells. Inhibition of the AMPK pathway blocked the activation of JNK by SRP, indicating that SRP regulated the expression of JNK dependent on the AMPK pathway. Furthermore, inhibition of the latter significantly conferred resistance to SRP pro- apoptotic activity, suggesting involvement of the AMPK pathway in induction of apoptosis. Pretreatment with a STAT3 inhibitor also augmented SRP induced growth inhibition and cell apoptosis, further confirming roles of the STAT3 pathway after SRP treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that SRP induce cell apoptosis through AMPK activation and STAT3 inhibition in K562 cells. This suggests the possibility of further developing SRP as an alternative treatment option, or perhaps using it as adjuvant chemotherapeutic agent for chronic myeloid leukemia therapy.",,"['Ge, Yu-Qing', 'Xu, Xiao-Feng', 'Yang, Bo', 'Chen, Zhe', 'Cheng, Ru-Bin']","['Ge YQ', 'Xu XF', 'Yang B', 'Chen Z', 'Cheng RB']","['Zhejiang Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, China E-mail : biothcheng@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Saponins)', '0 (UCN2 protein, human)', '0 (Urocortins)', '9015-71-8 (Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone)', 'EC 2.7.11.31 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/metabolism', 'Rubus/*chemistry', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Saponins/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Urocortins/metabolism']",,,2014/07/22 06:00,2015/04/08 06:00,['2014/07/22 06:00'],"['2014/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.13.5455 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2014;15(13):5455-61. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.13.5455.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Genes involved in chronic myelocytic leukemia were selected from OMIM database. Literature mining was performed by Agilent Literature Search plugin and a protein-protein interaction network of chronic myelocytic leukemia was established by Cytoscape. The molecular complexes in the network were detected by Clusterviz plugin and pathway enrichment of molecular complexes were performed by DAVID online. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: There are seventy-nine chronic myelocytic leukemia genes in the Mendelian Inheritance In Man Database. The protein-protein interaction network of chronic myelocytic leukemia contained 638 nodes, 1830 edges and perhaps 5 molecular complexes.

We selected and assessed journal articles evaluating the relationship between local traffic density and the risk of leukemia in children. The analysis was carried out using STATA version 12.0. RESULTS: A total of 11 articles, including 12 estimates of effect, were included in our meta-analysis. The summary effect size from the random-effects model, expressed as an odds ratio, was 1.03 (95% CI: 0.98-1.09, p=0.002). No significant association between traffic density and the risk of childhood leukemia was found. Similar conclusions were found on subgroup analysis.

The ten-eleven translocation (TET) gene family, initially found as a chromosomal translocation partner in leukemia, turned out to be a key enzyme for DNA demethylation. TET genes hydroxylate 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, which is then converted to unmodified cytosine through multiple mechanisms. Somatic mutations of the TET2 gene were reported in a variety of human hematological malignancies such as leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and malignant lymphoma, suggesting a critical role for TET2 in hematopoiesis. The importance of the TET-mediated cytosine demethylation pathway is also underscored by a recurrent mutation of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and IDH2 in hematological malignancies, whose mutation inhibits TET function through a novel oncometabolite, 2-hydroxyglutarate. Studies using mouse models revealed that TET2 is critical for the function of hematopoietic stem cells, and disruption of TET2 results in the expansion of multipotent as well as myeloid progenitors, leading to the accumulation of premalignant clones. In addition to cytosine demethylation, TET proteins are involved in chromatin modifications and other cellular processes through the interaction with O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine transferase. In summary, TET2 is a critical regulator for hematopoietic stem cell homeostasis whose functional impairment leads to hematological malignancies. Future studies will uncover the whole picture of epigenetic and signaling networks wired with TET2, which will help to develop ways to intervene in cellular pathways dysregulated by TET2 mutations.","['(c) 2014 The Authors.

SETTING AND PATIENT: A 46-year-old male with a history of adult T-cell ALL presented with persistent positional headache and neutropenic fever 2 weeks after receiving multiple intrathecal methotrexate treatments. His symptoms were consistent with post-dural puncture headache. The patient underwent an EBP and experienced complete pain relief following the procedure. He had no evidence of central nervous system involvement of ALL on his last evaluation 3 months following the blood patch. CONCLUSION: Post-dural puncture headache due to intrathecal administration of chemotherapy agents becomes increasingly recognized, and there are an increasing number of requests to anesthesiologists for EBP. A major concern in the patient population with hematological malignancies is the possibility of neuroaxial seeding of malignancies. Therein, flow cytometry was implemented to screen for blast cells in the circulating blood. Careful analysis and minimization of this potential risk is required to ensure the safety of the EBP in this specific patient population.","['Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Mergan, Zara Y', 'Khetani, Nicole', 'Wang, Dajie']","['Mergan ZY', 'Khetani N', 'Wang D']","['Department of Anesthesiology, Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20140707,England,Pain Med,"Pain medicine (Malden, Mass.)",100894201,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', '*Blood Patch, Epidural', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal/*adverse effects', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Post-Dural Puncture Headache/*surgery', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",['NOTNLM'],"['Chemotherapy', 'Dural Puncture Headache', 'Epidural Blood Patch']",2014/07/22 06:00,2015/06/17 06:00,['2014/07/22 06:00'],"['2014/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/pme.12470 [doi]'],ppublish,Pain Med. 2014 Aug;15(8):1343-5. doi: 10.1111/pme.12470.

EcAII is an important drug in the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common malignancy in children. Leukemic blast cells lack the ability to synthesize l-asparagine and rely on other sources of l-asparagine for protein synthesis. EcAII injections deplete extracellular levels of l-asparagine, disrupting protein synthesis and inducing apoptosis in the malignant cells. The detailed mechanism of l-asparaginase catalytic action, the molecular mechanisms of its anticancer activity and the side effects associated with the treatment, including resistance to therapy, are not fully understood despite over 40 years of research. Here, we present X-ray structures of EcAII with an active site mutation, D90E, in three crystal forms. The region of the mutation is well ordered, allowing precise functional analysis of the consequences of the replacement of Asp90. In all three structures, the mutant protein exhibits an open conformation of the active site. In one of the structures, a zinc cation has been detected. The zinc cation is coordinated in a region of the protein that is implicated in the immunological response to EcAII treatment. A combined sequence-structure analysis of bacterial-type l-asparaginases reveals that the metal coordination may play a role in the response to asparaginase treatment. The observation of a zinc-binding site in antileukemic l-asparaginases provides new insight, with consequences for acute lymphoblastic leukemia therapy.

Although TP53 mRNA levels did indeed vary among the 104 CLL samples examined, this variability resulted primarily from over-expression of TP53 mRNA in 18 samples, all of which lacked TP53 deletion/mutation. These patients had higher lymphocyte counts and shorter overall and treatment-free survival times compared to cases with low TP53 mRNA expression and no TP53 deletion/mutation. Furthermore, TP53 mRNA levels did not correlate with levels of TP53 protein or its transcriptional target CDKN1A. We speculated that the adverse outcome associated with TP53 mRNA over-expression might reflect variation in levels of MIR15A and MIR16-1, which are encoded on chromosome 13q14 and target TP53 and some oncogenes including BCL2. In keeping with our hypothesis, 13q14 copy number and levels of MIR15A/MIR16-1 correlated positively with one another but negatively with levels of TP53 mRNA and BCL2 mRNA. Our findings support a model in which loss of MIR15A/MIR16-1 at chromosome 13q14 results in adverse outcome due to de-repression of oncogenes such as BCL2, and up-regulation of TP53 mRNA as a bystander effect.",['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Lin, Ke', 'Farahani, Mosavar', 'Yang, Yi', 'Johnson, Gillian G', 'Oates, Melanie', 'Atherton, Mark', 'Douglas, Angela', 'Kalakonda, Nagesh', 'Pettitt, Andrew R']","['Lin K', 'Farahani M', 'Yang Y', 'Johnson GG', 'Oates M', 'Atherton M', 'Douglas A', 'Kalakonda N', 'Pettitt AR']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust, Liverpool, UK; Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140718,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (MIRN15 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN16 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Dosage', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', '*Genes, bcl-2', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*physiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis']",['NOTNLM'],"['13q14', 'BCL2', 'CLL', 'MIR15A/16-1', 'TP53']",2014/07/22 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2014/07/22 06:00'],"['2014/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.13043 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2014 Nov;167(3):346-55. doi: 10.1111/bjh.13043.

Chromosomal abnormalities in CLL are predictive of the natural disease course; del(11q) and del(17p) are recognized as high risk genetic lesions. Del(17p) is associated with an impaired function of TP53, a key tumour suppressor, and is particularly problematic. Such patients respond poorly to chemo-immunotherapy and have significantly shorter survival compared to patients with standard and low-risk cytogenetics. While TP53 pathway defects are rare at initial diagnosis, their frequency increases in relapsed CLL. Until very recently, this group of patients represented an unmet clinical need with few therapeutic options. However, the advent of targeted therapies has expanded the drug armamentarium and introduced new hope for these highly refractory patients. Agents that target B-cell receptor signalling, BH3-mimetics and others induce apoptosis of the neoplastic B-cells in a TP53-independent manner. Their use in the clinic is associated with remarkable activity in patients with del(17p).

In addition, dendritic cells (DC) infected with HIV-1 also play an important role in viral transmission to uninfected CD4+ T cells via VS formation. Recent studies revealed that several DC subsets are also infected with HTLV-1. These findings may help explain the rapid dissemination of both viruses within secondary lymphoid tissues in vivo. VS also explain, at least in part, why HIV-1 can propagate in the mucosal sites during sexual transmission.

A fourth proposed subtype describes EF associated with hematologic malignancy. Recently, EF has occurred after bone marrow or stem cell transplantation (SCT). OBJECTIVES: We report a unique case of EF after haploidentical allogeneic SCT for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and review the literature for similar cases. METHODS: A 56-year-old, HIV-negative ALL patient presented with an intensely pruritic papulopustular eruption. He had undergone haploidentical allogeneic SCT 65 days earlier, which he had tolerated well. Histopathology revealed a moderately dense perifollicular and perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with many eosinophils extending from the superficial dermis to the subcutaneous fat. Fungal stains were negative. These findings were highly consistent with EF. RESULTS: Therapy with a class II topical corticosteroid ointment, oral doxepin, and emollients achieved near-resolution of the lesions within eight weeks. Transition to topical tacrolimus 0.1% ointment applied twice daily to residual lesions yielded complete clearance by 12 weeks with mild post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. The patient's ALL remains in remission. CONCLUSIONS: A fourth proposed subtype of EF is associated with HIV-negative hematologic disease. This subtype is distinguished by a predictable timeframe to presentation and a relatively rapid response to therapy. Although EF is an important consideration in all patients with hematologic malignancy, clinically heightened suspicion is warranted during the 2-3 months after transplant.",['(c) 2014 The International Society of Dermatology.'],"['Zitelli, Kristine', 'Fernandes, Neil', 'Adams, Brian B']","['Zitelli K', 'Fernandes N', 'Adams BB']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'Section of Dermatology, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20140711,England,Int J Dermatol,International journal of dermatology,0243704,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Histamine Antagonists)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '1668-19-5 (Doxepin)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use', 'Doxepin/therapeutic use', 'Eosinophilia/*drug therapy/*etiology/pathology', 'Folliculitis/*drug therapy/*etiology/pathology', 'Histamine Antagonists/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Tacrolimus/therapeutic use']",,,2014/07/22 06:00,2016/03/26 06:00,['2014/07/22 06:00'],"['2012/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/24 00:00 [revised]', '2013/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijd.12521 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Dermatol. 2015 Jul;54(7):785-9. doi: 10.1111/ijd.12521.

The accumulated rhVEGF165 protein in the culture medium was 19 mg/L after 18 days of culturing in a sugar-free medium. The rhVEGF165 was purified using a heparin HP column and its biological activity was tested on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The purified rhVEGF165 significantly increased the proliferative activity of the HUVECs. Therefore, it was demonstrated that functional rhVEGF165 could be produced using transgenic rice suspension culture vector under the control of the RAmy3D promoter.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Few studies investigated this, mainly as a secondary endpoint in randomized clinical trials where patients with early stage CLL/SLL, and elderly/frail patients were underrepresented. The aim of our study was to assess HRQoL in a population-based setting, including these previously underrepresented patients. Out of 175 patients diagnosed with CLL/SLL between 2004 and 2011, 136 (78 %) returned the HRQoL questionnaire. The outcomes were compared to an age- and sex-matched norm population. Detailed data on stage and treatment were extracted from a population-based hematological registry (PHAROS). Patients ever treated for CLL/SLL reported significantly poorer HRQoL than the norm population (p < 0.01 with large clinically important differences. Interestingly, no differences were observed between the norm population and patients under active surveillance. In contrast to our hypothesis, patients treated with chlorambucil reported the lowest HRQoL scores. Drastic, long-lasting negative effects of starting treatment on HRQoL cannot be excluded, whereas active surveillance does not seem to provoke worrying, anxiety, or depressive symptoms. Further elaborate research into the impact of starting therapy on HRQoL is needed, especially in patients that are underrepresented in most clinical trials, and thoroughly consider its results during revision of treatment guidelines.",,"['van den Broek, Esther C', 'Oerlemans, Simone', 'Nijziel, Marten R', 'Posthuma, Eduardus F M', 'Coebergh, Jan Willem W', 'van de Poll-Franse, Lonneke V']","['van den Broek EC', 'Oerlemans S', 'Nijziel MR', 'Posthuma EF', 'Coebergh JW', 'van de Poll-Franse LV']","['Department of Research, Comprehensive Cancer Centre the Netherlands, Eindhoven, The Netherlands, E.vandenBroek@iknl.nl.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140720,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*therapeutic use', 'Chlorambucil/*therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*therapy', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Netherlands/epidemiology', '*Population Surveillance/methods', '*Quality of Life/psychology', 'Registries']",,,2014/07/21 06:00,2015/03/21 06:00,['2014/07/21 06:00'],"['2014/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-014-2161-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2015 Jan;94(1):45-56. doi: 10.1007/s00277-014-2161-6.

Despite much progress, mainly in genetics, its etiology remains obscure in approximately 50% of cases. To fill this gap, imaging of the male genital tract (MGT) has progressively expanded, providing useful information in the assessment of MGT abnormalities. METHODS: A critical, systematic review of the available literature was performed using Medline, with no restrictions regarding date of publication (i.e. from inception date until March 2014), along with analysis of previous reports in color Doppler ultrasound (CDUS) atlas textbooks. Normal anatomy and sonographic characteristics of the MGT have also been summarized. RESULTS: Testicular volume (TV) is tightly associated with both sperm and hormonal parameters. Ultrasound (US) offers a greater accuracy in TV measurement than Prader orchidometer (PO). However US- and PO-derived TV are closely related, making PO-derived TV informative enough in the work-up of the infertile man in everyday clinical practice. US-derived TV might play an independent role in specific clinical conditions (i.e. large hydrocele, inguinal testis, enlarged epididymis). Scrotal US may detect signs of testicular dysgenesis, often related to an impaired spermatogenesis and to a higher risk of malignancy, or testicular lesions suggestive of malignancy. A decreased testis vascularization is characteristic of testicular torsion, whereas hyperemia is often observed in epididymo-orchitis or in some malignant conditions (i.e. lymphoma, leukemia). The impact of varicocele detection and surgical correction on sperm parameters/fatherhood is debated. At present, the clinical management of varicocele is mainly based on physical examination. However, CDUS is useful in assessing venous reflux, when palpation is unreliable and/or in detecting recurrence/persistence after surgery. Epididymis head and/or tail dilation is suggestive of MGT obstruction or inflammation and both are related, along with echo-texture abnormalities, to impaired sperm parameters. Scrotal and transrectal US (TRUS) are useful in detecting congenital uni- or bilateral absence of vas deferens (CBAVD), which may be associated with epididymis, seminal vesicles (SV) or kidney abnormalities/agenesis. TRUS plays a key role in assessing obstructive azoospermia and detecting distal CBAVD or anomalies related to ejaculatory ducts obstruction, such as ejaculatory duct abnormalities, prostate median cysts or SV enlargement/emptying impairment. TRUS findings lead to operational decision-making, such as testicular sperm extraction in the case of CBAVD, cyst aspiration in the case of a large prostatic median cyst, and surgical treatment if ejaculatory duct abnormalities are observed. TRUS may reveal prostate volume reduction (suggestive of hypogonadism) or enlargement, which can be related to aging or even metabolic abnormalities. Finally, TRUS may reveal prostate and SV echo-texture abnormalities suggestive of inflammation or SV stasis. CONCLUSIONS: MGT-CDUS is a useful tool in detecting abnormalities related to impaired male reproductive health. However, it suffers from a lack of standardization and often produces subjective/vague diagnoses. To fill this gap, the European Academy of Andrology has promoted an ongoing multicenter study aimed at defining the MGT-CDUS characteristics of healthy, fertile men.","['(c) The Author 2014.

An 18 h long LPS induced human monocyte leukemia cell stimulation was performed and the cell-growth medium was supplemented with three different industrial lipid emulsions: Intralipid((R)), containing long-chain triglycerides (LCT--soybean oil); Medialipid((R)), containing LCT (soybean oil) and medium-chain triglycerides (MCT--coconut oil); and SMOFlipid((R)), containing LCT, MCT, omega-9 and -3 (soybean, coconut, olive and fish oils). Cell viability and apoptosis were assessed by Trypan blue exclusion and flow cytometry respectively. Monocyte composition and membrane remodeling were studied using gas chromatography and NR12S staining. Microparticles released in supernatant were measured by prothrombinase assay. After LPS challenge, both cellular necrosis and apoptosis were increased (threefold and twofold respectively) and microparticle release was enhanced (sevenfold) after supplementation with Medialipid((R)) compared to Intralipid((R)), SMOFlipid((R)) and monocytes in the standard medium. The monocytes differentially incorporated fatty acids after lipid emulsion challenge. Finally, lipid-treated cells displayed microparticles characterized by disrupted membrane lipid order, reflecting lipid remodeling of the parental cell plasma membrane. Our data suggest that lipid emulsions differentially alter cell viability, monocyte composition and thereby microparticle release.

Increasing the antileukemic efficacy of the pretransplant conditioning regimen may be a strategy to increase remission rates and duration. We therefore investigated the antiproliferative effects of nilotinib in combination with drugs that are usually used for conditioning: the alkylating agents mafosfamide, treosulfan, and busulfan. METHODS: Drug combinations were tested in vitro in different imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL-positive cell lines. A tetrazolium-based MTT assay was used for the assessment and quantification of growth inhibition after exposure to alkylating agents alone or to combinations with nilotinib. Drug interaction was analyzed using the median-effect method of Chou and Talalay, and combination index (CI) values were calculated according to the classic isobologram equation. RESULTS: Treatment of imatinib-sensitive, BCR-ABL-positive K562 and LAMA84 cells with nilotinib in combination with mafosfamide, treosulfan, or busulfan resulted in synergistic (CI < 1), additive (CI ~ 1), and predominantly antagonistic (CI > 1) effects, respectively. In imatinib-resistant K562-R and LAMA84-R cells, all applied drug combinations were synergistic (CI < 1) at higher growth inhibition levels.

We extended a previous follow-up of the Iowa Women's Health Study cohort to examine farm residence and the incidence of lymphohematopoietic cancers. Further, we investigated crop acreage within 750 m of residences, which has been associated with higher herbicide levels in Iowa homes. METHODS: We analyzed data for a cohort of 37,099 Iowa women aged 55-69 years who reported their residence location (farm, rural (not a farm), town size based on population) at enrollment in 1986. We identified incident lymphohematopoietic cancers (1986-2009) by linkage with the Iowa Cancer Registry. Using a geographic information system, we geocoded addresses and calculated acreage of pasture and row crops within 750 m of homes using the 1992 National Land Cover Database. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) in multivariate analyses of cancer risk in relation to both residence location and crop acreage. RESULTS: As found in an earlier analysis of residence location, risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was higher among women living on farms (HR=2.23, 95%CI: 1.25-3.99) or rural areas (but not on a farm) (HR=1.95, 95%CI: 0.89-4.29) compared with women living in towns of >10,000 population. We observed no association between farm or rural residence and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL; overall or for major subtypes) or multiple myeloma. In analyses of crop acreage, we observed no association between pasture or row crop acreage within 750 m of homes and risk of leukemia overall or for the AML subtype. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) risk was nonsignificantly elevated among women with pasture acreage within 750 m of their home (HRs for increasing tertiles=1.8, 1.8 and 1.5) and with row crop acreage within 750 m (HRs for increasing tertiles of acreage=1.4, 1.5 and 1.6) compared to women with no pasture or row crop acreage, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Iowa women living on a farm or in a rural area were at increased risk of developing AML, which was not related to crop acreage near the home. Living near pasture or row crops may confer an increased risk of CLL/SLL regardless of residence location. Further investigation of specific farm-related exposures and these cancers among women living on farms and in agricultural areas is warranted.",['Copyright (c) 2014.

Oral mucositis (OM) is a common and debilitating toxicity side effect of autologous and allogeneic HSCT. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) on the severity of OM and inflammatory mediator (TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta, IL-10, TGF-beta, metalloproteinases, and growth factors) levels in saliva and blood of HSCT patients. Thirty patients were randomly assigned to two groups: control (n = 15) and laser (n = 15). LLLT was applied from the first day of the conditioning regimen until day 7 post-HSCT (D + 7). Saliva and blood were collected from patients on admission (AD), D-1, D + 3, D + 7, and on marrow engraftment day (ME). Clinical results showed less severe OM in the laser group (p < 0.05). The LLLT group showed increased matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) levels in saliva on D + 7 (p = 0.04). Significant differences were also observed for IL-10 on D + 7 and on ME in blood plasma, when compared to the control group (p < 0.05). No significant differences were seen in saliva or blood for the other inflammatory mediators investigated. LLLT was clinically effective in reducing the severity of chemotherapy-induced OM in HSCT patients, and its mechanism of action does not seem to be completely linked to the modulation of pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors or matrix metalloproteinases.",,"['Silva, Geisa Badauy Lauria', 'Sacono, Nancy Tomoko', 'Othon-Leite, Angelica Ferreira', 'Mendonca, Elismauro Francisco', 'Arantes, Adriano Moraes', 'Bariani, Cesar', 'Duarte, Luciana Garcia Lobo', 'Abreu, Mauro Henrique Nogueira', 'Queiroz-Junior, Celso Martins', 'Silva, Tarcilia Aparecida', 'Batista, Aline Carvalho']","['Silva GB', 'Sacono NT', 'Othon-Leite AF', 'Mendonca EF', 'Arantes AM', 'Bariani C', 'Duarte LG', 'Abreu MH', 'Queiroz-Junior CM', 'Silva TA', 'Batista AC']","['Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Unit, Araujo Jorge Hospital, Associacao de Combate ao Cancer de Goias, Goiania, Goias, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140719,England,Lasers Med Sci,Lasers in medical science,8611515,"['0 (IL10 protein, human)', '0 (IL6 protein, human)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', '0 (TNF protein, human)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (MMP2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Inflammation Mediators/metabolism', 'Interleukin-10/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Lasers, Semiconductor/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/therapy', '*Low-Level Light Therapy', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/adverse effects', 'Saliva/enzymology', 'Stomatitis/chemically induced/metabolism/*radiotherapy', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*adverse effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/07/20 06:00,2015/12/23 06:00,['2014/07/20 06:00'],"['2014/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10103-014-1624-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Lasers Med Sci. 2015 Jan;30(1):117-26. doi: 10.1007/s10103-014-1624-2.

A real life experience from a tertiary center.,768-71,10.1016/j.ejim.2014.06.028 [doi] S0953-6205(14)00200-3 [pii],"INTRODUCTION/AIM: Patients who present HBV reactivation during immunosuppressive treatment are prone to develop life threatening decompensation of the liver function, therefore prophylaxis and treatment are strongly recommended. So far there are no data regarding the role of tenofovir in this context. Therefore, the aim of our study was to describe our ""real life"" experience with the use of tenofovir (TDF) in patients who underwent immunosuppressive treatment. RESULTS: 38 patients with immunosuppression received antiviral treatment with tenofovir (25 patients as prophylaxis and 13 patients as treatment of HBV reactivation). In all 25 patients in whom prophylactic treatment with tenofovir was administered no HBV flare occurred during immunosuppression and the levels of serum HBV-DNA became or remained undetectable during the follow up period (mean follow up 17.2 months, range 6-54). One patient experienced HBsAg seroconversion. In the 13 patients who exhibited HBV reactivation TDF treatment resulted in complete biochemical and virological response within 6 months except two patients with high pretreatment HBV-DNA levels who became HBV-DNA negative at 9 months. No exacerbation of liver disease or liver related death has been observed. One patient who presented with decompensated cirrhosis during HBV reactivation returned into a compensated state after treatment. No side effects of tenofovir have been documented. CONCLUSION: Tenofovir seems to be highly effective and safe in the prophylaxis and rescue treatment of HBV reactivation in patients who receive immunosuppression therapy.","['Copyright (c) 2014 European Federation of Internal Medicine.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective single-center study, we evaluated the results of the Hyper-CVAD (fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone) regimen in 49 ALL patients treated between 2001 and 2013. No exclusion criteria were applied. The primary outcome measure was the CR rate. RESULTS: Forty-six of the 49 patients (93.8%) obtained CR, and 3 (6%) patients died during induction. Philadelphia chromosome was present in 6 patients (12.2%); in all a CR was obtained. Among the 46 patients in CR, 30 (65.2%) received the full planned intensive-phase treatment (8 cycles). Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation was performed in 2 (4%) patients in first CR and in 3 (6%) patients after a second CR. Nonrelapse mortality was observed in 8 patients (16.3%). The median overall survival (OS) and 5-year OS were 24.4 months and 35%, respectively. Initial leukocyte count (> 30 x 10(9)/L) was an important prognostic factor. CONCLUSION: Hyper-CVAD as an induction regimen for adults and adolescents with ALL was feasible and yielded a high rate of CR.

DATA SOURCES: A PubMed literature search (August 2002 to March 2014) was conducted using the terms obinutuzumab, GA101, anti-CD20 antibody, and CLL. Data were also obtained through the FDA briefing documents and American Society of Hematology abstracts. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: The literature search was limited to human studies published in English. Priority was placed on trials of obinutuzumab in previously untreated CLL. DATA SYNTHESIS: Obinutuzumab is a novel glycoengineered type II anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, with a higher affinity for CD20 epitope, leading to superior cytotoxicity compared with rituximab. The FDA approval was based on a phase III, randomized trial of chlorambucil monotherapy (n = 118), chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab (n = 333), or rituximab (n =330) in previously untreated elderly CLL patients. Obinutuzumab was administered intravenously as 1000 mg on days 1, 8, and 15 of cycle 1 and day 1 for subsequent cycles. Median progression-free survival was 26.7 months in the chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab arm. The incidence of grade 3 or higher adverse events in the obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil arm was as follows: neutropenia (33%), infusion-related reactions (20%), thrombocytopenia (10%), and infections (7%). CONCLUSION: Obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil is a safe and effective new treatment option for previously untreated elderly CLL patients. It should become the new preferred therapy for these patients with significant comorbidities who are not candidates for fludarabine-based therapy.",['(c) The Author(s) 2014.'],"['Shah, Arpita']",['Shah A'],"['Georgia Regents University Medical Center (formerly MCG Health), Augusta, GA, USA arshah@gru.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20140718,United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', 'O43472U9X8 (obinutuzumab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD20/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Chlorambucil/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration']",['NOTNLM'],"['GA101', 'chlorambucil', 'obinutuzumab', 'untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia']",2014/07/20 06:00,2014/12/20 06:00,['2014/07/20 06:00'],"['2014/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/20 06:00 [medline]']","['1060028014543271 [pii]', '10.1177/1060028014543271 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2014 Oct;48(10):1356-61. doi: 10.1177/1060028014543271.

Calreticulin (CALR) and myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene (MPL) mutations are specific to JAK2-unmutated essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). We examined the effect of these mutations on long-term disease outcome. One thousand five hundred eighty-one patients from the Mayo Clinic (n = 826) and Italy (n = 755) were studied. Fifty-eight percent of Mayo patients were followed until death; median survivals were 19.8 years in ET (n = 292), 13.5 PV (n = 267; hazard ratio [HR], 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-2.2), and 5.9 PMF (n = 267; HR, 4.5; 95% CI, 3.5-5.7). The survival advantage of ET over PV was not affected by JAK2/CALR/MPL mutational status. Survival in ET was inferior to the age- and sex-matched US population (P < .001). In PMF (n = 428), but not in ET (n = 576), survival and blast transformation (BT) were significantly affected by mutational status; outcome was best in CALR-mutated and worst in triple-negative patients: median survival, 16 vs 2.3 years (HR, 5.1; 95% CI, 3.2-8.0) and BT, 6.5% vs 25% (HR, 7.6; 95% CI, 2.8-20.2), respectively.

The specific roles of the three Akt isoforms in somatic cell reprogramming have not been investigated. Here we report that, during iPSC generation, enhanced Akt1 activity promotes complete reprogramming mainly through increased activation of Stat3 in concert with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and, to a lesser extent, through promotion of colony formation. Akt1 augments Stat3 activity through activation of mTOR and upregulation of LIF receptor expression. Similarly, enhanced Akt2 or Akt3 activation also promotes reprogramming and coordinates with LIF to activate Stat3. Blocking Akt1 or Akt3 but not Akt2 expression prohibits cell proliferation and reprogramming. Furthermore, the halt in cell proliferation and reprogramming caused by mTOR and Akt inhibitors can be reversed by inhibition of GSK3. Finally, we found that expressing the GSK3beta target Esrrb overrides inhibition of Akt and restores reprogramming. Our data demonstrated that during reprogramming, Akt promotes establishment of pluripotency through co-stimulation of Stat3 activity with LIF. Akt1 and Akt3 are essential for the proliferation of reprogrammed cells, and Esrrb supports cell proliferation and complete reprogramming during Akt signaling.",['(c) 2014.

To indentify the protein-protein interactions (PPI) between HTLV viruses and Homo sapiens is one of the significant approaches to reveal the underlying mechanism of HTLV infection and host defence. At present, as biological experiments are labor-intensive and expensive, the identified part of the HTLV-human PPI networks is rather small. Although recent years have witnessed much progress in computational modeling for reconstructing pathogen-host PPI networks, data scarcity and data unavailability are two major challenges to be effectively addressed. To our knowledge, no computational method for proteome-wide HTLV-human PPI networks reconstruction has been reported. RESULTS: In this work we develop Multi-instance Adaboost method to conduct homolog knowledge transfer for computationally reconstructing proteome-wide HTLV-human PPI networks. In this method, the homolog knowledge in the form of gene ontology (GO) is treated as auxiliary homolog instance to address the problems of data scarcity and data unavailability, while the potential negative knowledge transfer is automatically attenuated by AdaBoost instance reweighting. The cross validation experiments show that the homolog knowledge transfer in the form of independent homolog instances can effectively enrich the feature information and substitute for the missing GO information. Moreover, the independent tests show that the method can validate 70.3% of the recently curated interactions, significantly exceeding the 2.1% recognition rate by the HT-Y2H experiment. We have used the method to reconstruct the proteome-wide HTLV-human PPI networks and further conducted gene ontology based clustering of the predicted networks for further biomedical research. The gene ontology based clustering analysis of the predictions provides much biological insight into the pathogenesis of HTLV retroviruses. CONCLUSIONS: The Multi-instance AdaBoost method can effectively address the problems of data scarcity and data unavailability for the proteome-wide HTLV-human PPI interaction networks reconstruction. The gene ontology based clustering analysis of the predictions reveals some important signaling pathways and biological modules that HTLV retroviruses are likely to target.",,"['Mei, Suyu', 'Zhu, Hao']","['Mei S', 'Zhu H']","['Bioinformatics Section, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China. meisygle@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140718,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,,IM,"['Cluster Analysis', 'Deltaretrovirus/*genetics', 'Gene Ontology', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Protein Interaction Mapping/*methods', 'Proteomics/*methods']",,,2014/07/20 06:00,2014/10/13 06:00,['2014/07/20 06:00'],"['2014/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2105-15-245 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-15-245 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2014 Jul 18;15:245. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-15-245.,,,,PMC4133621,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression levels of genes including apoptosis-antagonizing transcription factor (AATF), MYC, B-cell lymphoma (BCL3), P21CIP, CCND1 and SP1 in B- and T-cells from patients with pediatric ALL were compared with control levels using real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, and reporter assays. RESULTS: We identified two novel mutations in KLF4 in pediatric T-ALL. A mutation in the 3' untranslated region of the KLF4 gene resulted in loss of miR-2909-mediated regulation, while mutation in its first or third zinc-finger motif (Zf1/Zf3) rendered KLF4 transcriptionally inactive. This mutation was a frameshift mutation resulting in alteration of the Zf3 motif sequence in the mutant KLF4 protein in all pediatric T-ALL samples. Homology models, docking studies and promoter activity of its target gene P21CIP confirmed the lack of function of the mutant KLF4 protein in pediatric T-ALL. Moreover, the inability of miR-2909 to regulate KLF4 and its downstream genes controlling cell cycle and apoptosis in T-cell but not in B-ALL was verified by antagomiR-2909 transfection. Comprehensive sequence analysis of KLF4 identified the predominance of isoform 1 (~55 kDa) in most patients with pediatric B-ALL, while those with pediatric T-ALL expressed isoform 2 (~51 kDa). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified a novel miR-2909-KLF4 molecular axis able to differentiate between the pathogeneses of pediatric B- and T-cell ALLs, and which may represent a new diagnostic/prognostic marker.",,"['Malik, Deepti', 'Kaul, Deepak', 'Chauhan, Nalini', 'Marwaha, Ram Kumar']","['Malik D', 'Kaul D', 'Chauhan N', 'Marwaha RK']","['Department of Experimental Medicine & Biotechnology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education & Research, Chandigarh, India. dkaul_24@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140718,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (MIRN2909 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Pathology, Molecular', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']",,,2014/07/20 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/07/20 06:00'],"['2013/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-13-175 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-13-175 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2014 Jul 18;13:175. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-13-175.,,,,PMC4112645,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transgenic expression of the mutant gene causes MPN-like phenotypes in mice. We have produced JAK2V617F mice with p53 null background. Some of these mice developed acute erythroleukemia. From one of these mice, we derived a cell line designated J53Z1. J53Z1 cells were stained positive for surface markers CD71 and CD117 but negative for Sca-1, TER-119, CD11b, Gr-1, F4/80, CD11c, CD317, CD4, CD8a, CD3e, B220, CD19, CD41, CD42d, NK-1.1, and FceR1. Real time PCR analyses demonstrated expressions of erythropoietin receptor EpoR, GATA1, and GATA2 in these cells. J53Z1 cells grew rapidly in suspension culture containing fetal bovine serum with a doubling time of approximately 18 hours. When transplanted into C57Bl/6 mice, J53Z1 cells induced acute erythroleukemia with massive infiltration of tumor cells in the spleen and liver. J53Z1 cells were responsive to stimulation with erythropoietin and stem cell factor and were selectively inhibited by JAK2 inhibitors which induced apoptosis of the cells. Together, J53Z1 cells belong to the erythroid lineage, and they may be useful for studying the role of JAK2V617F in proliferation and differentiation of erythroid cells and for identifying potential therapeutic drugs targeting JAK2.",,"['Zhao, Wanke', 'Zou, Kang', 'Farasyn, Taleah', 'Ho, Wanting Tina', 'Zhao, Zhizhuang Joe']","['Zhao W', 'Zou K', 'Farasyn T', 'Ho WT', 'Zhao ZJ']","['Department of Pathology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States of America.', 'Oklahoma School of Science and Mathematics, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States of America.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States of America.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States of America.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140718,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/*enzymology/transplantation', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Erythropoiesis/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes, p53', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Liver/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', '*Point Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Spleen/pathology']",,,2014/07/19 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/07/19 06:00'],"['2013/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0099017 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-54099 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jul 18;9(7):e99017. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0099017. eCollection 2014.,,,,PMC4103785,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to evaluate the anticancer efficacy of SRP on human leukemia HL-60 cells in vitro and unveil the underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that SRP was able to suppress the proliferation of HL-60 cells in a dose-dependent manner by the mechanism involved in the induction of apoptosis. The increase in SRP-induced apoptosis was correlated with a rapid and sustained loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsim) and a release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol. Furthermore, Western blot and RT-PCR analysis revealed that the protein and mRNA levels of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 were downregulated, whereas those of pro-apoptotic Bax were upregulated. Besides, caspase-9 and caspase-3 were activated, while caspase-8 was intact. Additionally, the apoptotic cells by SRP were significantly inhibited by a caspase-3 inhibitor (z-DEVD-fmk) or a caspase-9 inhibitor (Z-LETD-FMK), demonstrating the important role of caspase-9 and -3 in the process. Taken together, these findings provided evidence that SRP induced the apoptosis of HL-60 cells through an intrinsic mitochondria-mediated signaling pathway and SRP may be a promising chemotherapeutic agent for treatment of leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We here differentiated human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells bearing with either control sense RNA and shRNA for ANXA3 mRNA or a vector cDNA with or without ANXA3 cDNA into macrophage-like cells by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate and found that a fluorescence ratio (340 nm/380 nm) upon the S-tagged C5a/RP S19-induced alternative cytoplasmic calcium oscillation by extracellular calcium was an equilateral association with a dose of ANXA3. Moreover, the ANXA3-dependent modification was partially reflected upon the S-tagged C5a-induced classical cytoplasmic calcium oscillation by both intracellular calcium and extracellular calcium. ANXA3 seems to extend the C5aR-mediated cytoplasmic calcium oscillation by extracellular calcium at least in the HL-60 macrophage-like cells.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

However, the fundamental role of CB2R in the regulation of diseases remains unclear, largely due to a lack of reliable imaging tools for the receptors. The goal of this study was to develop a CB2R-targeted molecular imaging probe and evaluate the specificity of the probe using human tumor cells that naturally overexpress CB2R. To synthesize the CB2R-targeted probe (NIR760-Q), a conjugable CB2R ligand based on the quinolone structure was first prepared, followed by bioconjugation with a near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent dye, NIR760. In vitro fluorescence imaging and competitive binding studies showed higher uptake of NIR760-Q than free NIR760 dye in Jurkat human acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia cells. In addition, the high uptake of NIR760-Q was significantly inhibited by the blocking agent, 4-quinolone-3-carboxamide, indicating specific binding of NIR760-Q to the target receptors. These results indicate that the NIR760-Q has potential in diagnostic imaging of CB2R positive cancers and elucidating the role of CB2R in the regulation of disease progression.",,"['Wu, Zhiyuan', 'Shao, Pin', 'Zhang, Shaojuan', 'Ling, Xiaoxi', 'Bai, Mingfeng']","['Wu Z', 'Shao P', 'Zhang S', 'Ling X', 'Bai M']","['University of Pittsburgh, Molecular Imaging Laboratory, Department of Radiology, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219bShanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Ruijin Hospital, Department of Radiology, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'University of Pittsburgh, Molecular Imaging Laboratory, Department of Radiology, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219.', ""University of Pittsburgh, Molecular Imaging Laboratory, Department of Radiology, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219cXi'an Jiaotong University, The First Hospital of Medical School, Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710061, China."", 'University of Pittsburgh, Molecular Imaging Laboratory, Department of Radiology, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219.', 'University of Pittsburgh, Molecular Imaging Laboratory, Department of Radiology, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219dUniversity of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15232, United StateseUniversity of Pittsburgh, Department of Bioengineering.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Biomed Opt,Journal of biomedical optics,9605853,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Molecular Probes)', '0 (Quinolones)', '0 (Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB2)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Dyes/analysis/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Molecular Imaging/*methods', 'Molecular Probes/analysis/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Quinolones/*chemistry', 'Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB2/*analysis/genetics/metabolism']",,,2014/07/19 06:00,2015/02/24 06:00,['2014/07/19 06:00'],"['2014/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['1890536 [pii]', '10.1117/1.JBO.19.7.076016 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biomed Opt. 2014;19(7):76016. doi: 10.1117/1.JBO.19.7.076016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To improve comparability, an internationally accepted plasmid certified reference material (CRM) was developed according to ISO Guide 34:2009. Fragments of BCR-ABL1 (e14a2 mRNA fusion), BCR and GUSB transcripts were amplified and cloned into pUC18 to yield plasmid pIRMM0099. Six different linearised plasmid solutions were produced with the following copy number concentrations, assigned by digital PCR, and expanded uncertainties: 1.08+/-0.13 x 10(6), 1.08+/-0.11 x 10(5), 1.03+/-0.10 x 10(4), 1.02+/-0.09 x 10(3), 1.04+/-0.10 x 10(2) and 10.0+/-1.5 copies/mul. The certification of the material for the number of specific DNA fragments per plasmid, copy number concentration of the plasmid solutions and the assessment of inter-unit heterogeneity and stability were performed according to ISO Guide 35:2006. Two suitability studies performed by 63 BCR-ABL1 testing laboratories demonstrated that this set of 6 plasmid CRMs can help to standardise a number of measured transcripts of e14a2 BCR-ABL1 and three control genes (ABL1, BCR and GUSB).

In addition, compared to RBL-2H3 cells stimulated with a calcium ionophore, those treated with DMF and TMF showed more marked inhibition of the degranulation and the production and mRNA expression of inflammatory mediators.

Ginseng has been used in Asian countries for the treatment and prevention of various diseases, including leukemia, but the molecular mechanism of its antileukemia activity has not been well defined. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of 20-(s)-ginsenoside Rg3 on apoptosis in human leukemic U937 and HL-60 cells and the underlying mechanism. We found that 20-(s)-ginsenoside Rg3 reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis in U937 and HL-60 cells. The induction of apoptosis was accompanied by the downregulation of PI3K/Akt family proteins. Moreover, we observed that 20-(s)-ginsenoside Rg3 treatment resulted in activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9. Taken together, our findings suggest for the first time that 20-(s)-ginsenoside Rg3 can promote apoptosis in U937 and HL-60 cells, at least partly through the downregulation of PI3K/Akt family proteins. Moreover, the triggering of caspase-3 and caspase-9 activation mediated apoptotic induction. All these findings collectively demonstrate that the natural compound 20-(s)-ginsenoside Rg3 effectively induces apoptosis in human leukemic cells, which suggests that this compound may play a role in future therapies for leukemia.",,"['Qiu, Xiao-Min', 'Bai, Xue', 'Jiang, Hong-Fang', 'He, Ping', 'Wang, Jia-He']","['Qiu XM', 'Bai X', 'Jiang HF', 'He P', 'Wang JH']","[""Department of Geriatrics, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Ginsenosides)', '0 (Morpholines)', '227D367Y57 (ginsenoside Rg3)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Ginsenosides/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'U937 Cells/drug effects']",,,2014/07/19 06:00,2015/04/08 06:00,['2014/07/19 06:00'],"['2014/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CAD.0000000000000147 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2014 Oct;25(9):1072-80. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0000000000000147.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This pathway is altered in various cancers, including Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). ALL begins with a change in bone marrow cells and is the most common type of leukemia in children under 15 years. UBE2Q1 as a new characterized gene of E2 enzyme family is located on chromosome 1 and reported to be altered in some malignancies. In this study, we aimed to explore the expression pattern of UBE2Q1 gene in children with ALL. For this purpose, a series of RT - PCR and quantitative RT - PCR were performed on a collection of 20 bone marrow samples of ALL patients and the same number of whole blood samples of age - matched normal subjects. Gel electrophoresis of RT - PCR products revealed the expression of UBE2Q1 mRNA in most of the normal (90%) and about half of the leukemic (45%) samples. QRT - PCR data indicated that only 1 patient out of 20 (5%) showed up regulation of the gene (> 2 folds). In 4 patients (20%), the expression of UBE2Q1 mRNA was equivocal (from 1/2 to 2) and in 15 cases (75%), the gene was down regulated (> 1/2) when compared to the normal samples. In conclusion, down regulation of UBE2Q1 in the majority of the leukemic samples suggests its potential implication in the pathogenesis of ALL. UBE2Q1 can be considered as a molecular marker and a candidate targeting to treat ALL in the future.",,"['Seghatoleslam, Atefeh', 'Bozorg-Ghalati, Farzaneh', 'Monabati, Ahmad', 'Nikseresht, Mohsen', 'Owji, Ali Akbar']","['Seghatoleslam A', 'Bozorg-Ghalati F', 'Monabati A', 'Nikseresht M', 'Owji AA']","['Histomorphometry & Stereology Research Center, School of Medicine, Shiraz, Iran. ; Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Int J Mol Cell Med,International journal of molecular and cellular medicine,101598104,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['QRT-PCR', 'UBE2Q1', 'Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme', 'pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia']",2014/07/19 06:00,2014/07/19 06:01,['2014/07/19 06:00'],"['2013/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/01 00:00 [revised]', '2014/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/19 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Int J Mol Cell Med. 2014 Spring;3(2):95-101.,,,,PMC4082811,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: All patients applying to the Hematology Service with any underlying complaint were studied. RESULTS: The study included 2,417 cases (1,248 females). The mean ages were 47.3 versus 50.7 years in females and males, respectively (p<0.000). There were 33 cases (1.3%) with the left renal atrophy against five cases (0.2%) with the right (p<0.001). The left renal atrophy cases have splenomegaly (SM) in 51.5%, thalassemia minors (TMs) in 30.3%, sickle cell diseases (SCDs) in 27.2%, myeloproliferative disorders in 18.1%, chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 6.0%, cirrhosis in 6.0%, solid organ malignancies in 6.0%, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 3.0%, multiple myeloma in 3.0%, and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia in 3.0%. Similarly, the right renal atrophy cases have SM in 20.0%, TMs in 40.0%, and SCDs in 20.0%. CONCLUSION: Left renal atrophy may be significantly higher than the right side in human being. Aortic pressure induced flow disorders in the left renal vein, structural anomalies of the left renal vein, and possibly the higher arterial pressure of the left kidney due to the shorter distance to the heart as an underlying cause of atherosclerosis may be some of the possible causes. Due to the stronger arterial wall protecting itself from compression and high prevalences of SM and left varicocele in population, SM induced flow disorders of the left renal vein may be the most common cause.",,"['Davran, Ramazan', 'Helvaci, Mehmet Rami', 'Davarci, Mursel']","['Davran R', 'Helvaci MR', 'Davarci M']","['Medical Faculty of The Mustafa Kemal University Antakya.', 'Medical Faculty of The Mustafa Kemal University Antakya.', 'Medical Faculty of The Mustafa Kemal University Antakya.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140615,United States,Int J Clin Exp Med,International journal of clinical and experimental medicine,101471010,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Left renal atrophy', 'atherosclerosis', 'left renal vein', 'splenomegaly']",2014/07/19 06:00,2014/07/19 06:01,['2014/07/19 06:00'],"['2014/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/19 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Int J Clin Exp Med. 2014 Jun 15;7(6):1603-6. eCollection 2014.,,,,PMC4100972,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quantitative and comparative cytokine expression profiling could be reliable to be used for biomarkers in deadly and fast-growing cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The present study aims to assess and further validate cytokines with probable effects on proliferation and maturation of blood cells in AML. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gene expression levels of IL-1beta, IL-10, IL-8, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma were analyzed before and after chemotherapy and after granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) therapy in 46 AML patients by an in-house quantitative comparative RT-PCR method. RESULTS: Our findings indicated that although the gene expression level of TNF-alpha was almost constant in all 3 samples, IL-1beta, IL-8, and IL-10 expression levels showed a decrease after chemotherapy and an increase after G-CSF therapy.

The lymphoblastic leukemia-derived sequence 1 (LYL1) gene, which encodes a basic helix-loop helix, was first identified with human T-cell acute leukemia. Recent studies suggest its involvement in myeloid malignancies. We aimed to study the expression percent of oncogene LYL1 in primary and secondary high-risk myeloid leukemia and the impact on prognostic significance in those patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for detection of LYL1 oncogenes, our study was carried out on 39 myeloid leukemia patients including de novo cases, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with transformation, and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in accelerated and blast crisis, in addition to 10 healthy individuals as the reference control. RESULTS: LYL1 expression was increased at least 2 times compared to the controls. The highest expression of this transcription factor was observed in the MDS cases transformed to acute leukemia at 7.3+/-3.1, p=0.0011. LYL1 expression was found in 68.2%, 75%, and 77.8% of cases of acute myeloid leukemia, CML crisis, and MDS, respectively. Significant correlation of LYL1 overexpression with some subtypes of French-American-British classification was found. There was, for the first time, significant correlation between the blood count at diagnosis and LYL1 expression (p=0.023, 0.002, and 0.031 for white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets, respectively). The rate of complete remission was lower with very high levels of LYL1 expression and the risk of relapse increased with higher levels of LYL1 expression, suggesting an unfavorable prognosis for cases with enhanced expression. CONCLUSION: Overexpression of LYL1 is highly associated with acute myeloid leukemia and shows more expression in MDS with unfavorable prognosis in response to induction chemotherapy. These observations could signal a promising tool for a therapeutic target to basic helix-loop helix protein related to transcription factors, which may improve patient outcome in acute myeloid leukemia, MDS, and CML in blast crisis.",,"['El-Menshawy, Nadia', 'Shahin, Doaa', 'Ghazi, Hayam Fathi']","['El-Menshawy N', 'Shahin D', 'Ghazi HF']","['Mansoura University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Clinical Pathology, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Mansoura University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Clinical Pathology, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Mansoura University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Oncology Medicine, Mansoura, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140610,Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast and accelerated phases', 'LYL1 gene', 'Real-time polymerase chain reaction', 'myelodysplastic syndrome']",2014/07/19 06:00,2014/07/19 06:01,['2014/07/19 06:00'],"['2012/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4274/tjh.2012.0063 [doi]'],ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2014 Jun;31(2):128-35. doi: 10.4274/tjh.2012.0063.

METHODS: A total of 1,274 cases with childhood cancer in Beijing from 2000 to 2009 were included in the study. All rates were age-standardized using the direct method to the world standard population and expressed per million person-years. Incidence trends were characterized by calculating annual percent change (APC) using Joinpoint Regression Program. RESULTS: The crude incidence rate was 106.47 per million [age-standardized rate (ASR) 113.34] between 2000 and 2009 in Beijing with the most common diagnoses, leukemia (N=505, 39.64%, ASR 45.20), followed by central nervous system (CNS) tumors (N=228, 17.90%, ASR 19.28) and lymphoma (N=91, 7.14%, ASR 6.97). The incidence for all childhood cancers combined has increased during the study period, with an APC of 5.84% [95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.0-10.9] after adjusted by world population. The ASR of all combined cancers in boys showed a slight, but no significant increase, with an APC of 5.33% (95% CI: -0.6-11.6); for girls, the trends increased significantly, with an APC of 6.54% (95% CI: 1.5-11.8). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence rate of childhood cancer in Beijing was higher than the average level of China and lower than that of western countries. The incidence trends of childhood cancer, especially leukemia among girls showed a significantly increase from 2000 to 2009. While among boys, no substantially change was seen during the observed time period. Some sex-specific trends by subcategories and trends of major cancers in different age groups by cancer site merit further investigation.",,"['Yang, Lei', 'Yuan, Yannan', 'Sun, Tingting', 'Li, Huichao', 'Wang, Ning']","['Yang L', 'Yuan Y', 'Sun T', 'Li H', 'Wang N']","['Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Beijing Office for Cancer Prevention and Control, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Beijing Office for Cancer Prevention and Control, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Beijing Office for Cancer Prevention and Control, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Beijing Office for Cancer Prevention and Control, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Beijing Office for Cancer Prevention and Control, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing 100142, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,Chin J Cancer Res,Chinese journal of cancer research = Chung-kuo yen cheng yen chiu,9315242,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Beijing', 'Childhood cancer', 'epidemiology', 'incidence']",2014/07/19 06:00,2014/07/19 06:01,['2014/07/19 06:00'],"['2014/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3978/j.issn.1000-9604.2014.06.09 [doi]', 'cjcr-26-03-285 [pii]']",ppublish,Chin J Cancer Res. 2014 Jun;26(3):285-92. doi: 10.3978/j.issn.1000-9604.2014.06.09.,,,,PMC4076710,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on this hypothesis, the ENCODE Project Consortium measured the status of multiple histone modifications across the genome in several cell types and used these data to segment the genome into regions with different predicted regulatory activities. We measured the cis-regulatory activity of more than 2000 of these predictions in the K562 leukemia cell line. We tested genomic segments predicted to be Enhancers, Weak Enhancers, or Repressed elements in K562 cells, along with other sequences predicted to be Enhancers specific to the H1 human embryonic stem cell line (H1-hESC). Both Enhancer and Weak Enhancer sequences in K562 cells were more active than negative controls, although surprisingly, Weak Enhancer segmentations drove expression higher than did Enhancer segmentations. Lower levels of the covalent histone modifications H3K36me3 and H3K27ac, thought to mark active enhancers and transcribed gene bodies, associate with higher expression and partly explain the higher activity of Weak Enhancers over Enhancer predictions. While DNase I hypersensitivity (HS) is a good predictor of active sequences in our assay, transcription factor (TF) binding models need to be included in order to accurately identify highly expressed sequences. Overall, our results show that a significant fraction (-26%) of the ENCODE enhancer predictions have regulatory activity, suggesting that histone modification states can reflect the cis-regulatory activity of sequences in the genome, but that specific sequence preferences, such as TF-binding sites, are the causal determinants of cis-regulatory activity.",['(c) 2014 Kwasnieski et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.'],"['Kwasnieski, Jamie C', 'Fiore, Christopher', 'Chaudhari, Hemangi G', 'Cohen, Barak A']","['Kwasnieski JC', 'Fiore C', 'Chaudhari HG', 'Cohen BA']","['Center for Genome Sciences and Systems Biology, Department of Genetics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA.', 'Center for Genome Sciences and Systems Biology, Department of Genetics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA.', 'Center for Genome Sciences and Systems Biology, Department of Genetics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA.', 'Center for Genome Sciences and Systems Biology, Department of Genetics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA cohen@genetics.wustl.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140717,United States,Genome Res,Genome research,9518021,['0 (Histones)'],IM,"['Computational Biology/*methods', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Logistic Models', 'Models, Genetic', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA']",,,2014/07/19 06:00,2015/06/16 06:00,['2014/07/19 06:00'],"['2014/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['gr.173518.114 [pii]', '10.1101/gr.173518.114 [doi]']",ppublish,Genome Res. 2014 Oct;24(10):1595-602. doi: 10.1101/gr.173518.114.

Here, we investigate the preclinical efficacy of the synthetic retinoid ST1926 in ATL and peripheral T-cell lymphomas. Clinically achievable concentrations of ST1926 induced a dramatic inhibition of cell proliferation in malignant T-cell lines and primary ATL cells with minimal effect on resting or activated normal lymphocytes. ST1926 induced apoptosis, DNA damage, and upregulation of p53 proteins in malignant T cells, whereas it caused an early downregulation of Tax proteins in HTLV-1-positive cells. In murine ATL, oral treatment with ST1926 prolonged survival and reduced leukemia cell infiltration, white blood cell counts, and spleen mass. In spleens of ST1926-treated animals, p53 and p21 proteins were upregulated, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase was cleaved, and Tax transcripts were reduced.

Using fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry analysis, we showed that HE intracellular oxidation products accumulate mostly in the cell mitochondria.

In this study, we demonstrate that various types of macrophages internalize microvesicles, called exosomes, secreted by breast cancer and non-cancerous cell lines. Although both types of exosomes targeted macrophages, only cancer-derived exosomes stimulated NF-kappaB activation in macrophages resulting in secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNFalpha, GCSF, and CCL2. In vivo mouse experiments confirmed that intravenously injected exosomes are efficiently internalized by macrophages in the lung and brain, which correlated with upregulation of inflammatory cytokines. In mice bearing xenografted human breast cancers, tumor-derived exosomes were internalized by macrophages in axillary lymph nodes thereby triggering expression of IL-6. Genetic ablation of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) or MyD88, a critical signaling adaptor in the NF-kappaB pathway, completely abolished the effect of tumor-derived exosomes. In contrast, inhibition of TLR4 or endosomal TLRs (TLR3/7/8/9) failed to abrogate NF-kappaB activation by exosomes. We further found that palmitoylated proteins present on the surface of tumor-secreted exosomes contributed to NF-kappaB activation.

In the present study, clioquinol was found to trigger autophagy by inducing LC3 lipidation and autophagosome formation which was abolished by an autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine. Further study showed clioquinol displayed no effects on PI3KC3 or Beclin 1 expression but downregulated the expression and the enzymatic activity of mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR), a critical modulator of autophagy. Moreover, clioquinol inhibited the catalytic activity of the mTOR complex 1, thus suppressing phosphorylation of P70S6K and 4E-BP1, two major proteins associated with autophagy in the mTORC1 signaling pathway. Clioquinol induced leukemia and myeloma cell apoptosis, however, addition of autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine attenuated this kind of cell death.

Here, we investigate the regulation and roles of p62/SQSTM1 during acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell maturation into granulocytes. Levels of p62/SQSTM1 mRNA and protein were both significantly increased during all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced differentiation of AML cells through a mechanism that depends on NF-kappaB activation. We show that this response constitutes a survival mechanism that prolongs the life span of mature AML cells and mitigates the effects of accumulation of aggregated proteins that occurs during granulocytic differentiation. Interestingly, ATRA-induced p62/SQSTM1 upregulation was impaired in maturation-resistant AML cells but was reactivated when differentiation was restored in these cells. Primary blast cells of AML patients and CD34(+) progenitors exhibited significantly lower p62/SQSTM1 mRNA levels than did mature granulocytes from healthy donors. Our results demonstrate that p62/SQSTM1 expression is upregulated in mature compared with immature myeloid cells and reveal a pro-survival function of the NF-kappaB/SQSTM1 signaling axis during granulocytic differentiation of AML cells.

However, achieving an adequate adherence to treatment regimes is of critical importance. The characteristics of treatment compliance in Mexican patients have not been determined. METHODS: We evaluated 38 CML patients, members of the Glivec((R)) International Patient Assistance Program (GIPAP). A bimonthly simplified medication adherence questionnaire was applied and the adherence rate was calculated by direct tablet counting. RESULTS: Two groups, one of local patients and another of out-of-town patients, were studied using an 85% adherence rate as a cut-off. The overall adherence rate was 85.9%. Fifteen patients were considered non-adherent (39.5%). The group of out-of-town patients presented a higher adherence rate of 92.8% in contrast with 76.3% in the local population (P = 0.021). The probability of achieving a complete cytogenetic response at some point of evolution after 8 years of follow-up was 93% in the adherent group vs. 58% in the group with an adherence rate <85% (P = 0.008). In patients with imatinib failure, the adherence rate was 75.8% compared to 95.5% (P = 0.008) in the optimal response group. CONCLUSIONS: In Mexican patients with CML, non-adherence to treatment is a cause of the failure to achieve remission or the subsequent loss of a complete cytogenetic and major molecular response.",,"['Cantu-Rodriguez, Olga Graciela', 'Sanchez-Cardenas, Monica', 'Gutierrez-Aguirre, Cesar Homero', 'Jaime-Perez, Jose Carlos', 'Mancias-Guerra, Consuelo', 'Gonzalez-Llano, Oscar', 'Gomez-Almaguer, David']","['Cantu-Rodriguez OG', 'Sanchez-Cardenas M', 'Gutierrez-Aguirre CH', 'Jaime-Perez JC', 'Mancias-Guerra C', 'Gonzalez-Llano O', 'Gomez-Almaguer D']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140718,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology/*psychology', 'Male', 'Mexico', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Compliance/*ethnology/psychology', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",['NOTNLM'],"['Adherence', 'Imatinib', 'Treatment']",2014/07/19 06:00,2015/11/13 06:00,['2014/07/19 06:00'],"['2014/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/1607845414Y.0000000165 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2015 Mar;20(2):72-6. doi: 10.1179/1607845414Y.0000000165.

However, the roles of HCCR in leukemia remain unclear. The present study is to investigate whether the expression levels of HCCR mRNA are associated with clinical prognosis in patients with acute leukemia (AL) and to explore the potential use as a biomarker for monitoring minimal residual disease (MRD) in AL. The mRNA levels of HCCR1 and HCCR2 were quantified by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in bone marrow samples from 80 adult de novo AL patients and 20 normal healthy donors. The expressions of HCCR1 and HCCR2 were significantly higher in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) than those in healthy donors (P < 0.01), but there was no significant difference between AML and ALL (P > 0.05). Besides white blood cell count, we did not find any significant correlation between HCCR expression and clinical characteristics, such as age, sex, CD34 antigen expression, and response to chemotherapy. HCCR was monitored in 12 cases during remission and/or relapse. Significant reductions of both HCCR1 and HCCR2 mRNA levels were observed in patients who had achieved complete remission after chemotherapy but not in patients with non-responsive. However, an increased HCCR expression was detected in these patients who relapsed.

This study is to explore the mechanism of sorafenib resistance and find an effective strategy to sensitize HBV-associated HCC to sorafenib. METHODS: Cytotoxicity to sorafenib was evaluated in HBV-positive/negative HCC cell lines. Expression of miR-193b and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) protein were assessed by Q-PCR, in situ hybridization and western blot, immunohistochemistry, respectively. A luciferase reporter of Mcl-1 3'-UTR was used for validation as a target of miR-193b. Cell apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry, caspase-3 activity assay and DAPI staining. RESULT: The IC50 to sorafenib was significantly higher in HBV-positive HCC cells than those without HBV infection. Significant downregulation of miR-193b and a higher level of Mcl-1 were observed in HBV-positive HCC cells and tissues. The activity of Mcl-1 3'-UTR reporter was inhibited by co-transfection with miR-193b mimic. Restoring the expression of miR-193b sensitized HBV-associated HCC cells to sorafenib treatment and facilitated sorafenib-induced apoptosis.

For alloSCT, consensus was reached in support of: alloSCT should be considered for patients relapsing after autoSCT; reduced intensity conditioning regimens should be used; allogeneic immunotherapy should be used for MRD eradication after alloSCT; and there is a lack of prognostic criteria to guide the use of alloSCT as first-line consolidation.

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have shown promise for treating refractory cGVHD, but the favorable effects of MSCs therapy in cGVHD are complex and not fully understood. In this prospective clinical study, 20 of 23 cGVHD patients had a complete response or partial response in a 12-month follow-up study. The most marked improvements in cGVHD symptoms were observed in the skin, oral mucosa and liver. Clinical improvement was accompanied by a significantly increased number of interleukin (IL)-10-producing CD5+ B cells. Importantly, CD5+ B cells from cGVHD patients showed increased IL-10 expression after MSCs treatment, which was associated with reduced inflammatory cytokine production by T cells. Mechanistically, MSCs could promote the survival and proliferation of CD5+ regulatory B cells (Bregs), and indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase partially participates in the MSC-mediated effects on Breg cells. Thus, CD5+ Breg cells may have an important role in the process of MSC-induced amelioration of refractory cGVHD and may provide new clues to reveal novel mechanisms of action for MSCs.",,"['Peng, Y', 'Chen, X', 'Liu, Q', 'Zhang, X', 'Huang, K', 'Liu, L', 'Li, H', 'Zhou, M', 'Huang, F', 'Fan, Z', 'Sun, J', 'Liu, Q', 'Ke, M', 'Li, X', 'Zhang, Q', 'Xiang, A P']","['Peng Y', 'Chen X', 'Liu Q', 'Zhang X', 'Huang K', 'Liu L', 'Li H', 'Zhou M', 'Huang F', 'Fan Z', 'Sun J', 'Liu Q', 'Ke M', 'Li X', 'Zhang Q', 'Xiang AP']","['Center for Stem Cell Biology and Tissue Engineering, The Key Laboratory for Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering, Ministry of Education, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Biology and Tissue Engineering, The Key Laboratory for Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering, Ministry of Education, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Biology and Tissue Engineering, The Key Laboratory for Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering, Ministry of Education, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Second Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Organ Transplant Center, First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangdong Institute for Food and Drug Control, Guangdong Food and Drug Administration, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Guangdong General Hospital, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Biology and Tissue Engineering, The Key Laboratory for Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering, Ministry of Education, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Biology and Tissue Engineering, The Key Laboratory for Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering, Ministry of Education, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Biology and Tissue Engineering, The Key Laboratory for Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering, Ministry of Education, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and Pharmacology, School of the Dental Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania, PA, USA.', '1] Center for Stem Cell Biology and Tissue Engineering, The Key Laboratory for Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering, Ministry of Education, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China [2] Department of Biochemistry, Zhongshan Medical School, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China [3] Cell-Gene Therapy Translational Medicine Research Center, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140718,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (IL10 protein, human)', '0 (Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'B-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/pathology/therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase/genetics/metabolism', 'Interleukin-10/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Liver/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', '*Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Mucosa/metabolism/pathology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Skin/metabolism/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,2014/07/19 06:00,2015/05/09 06:00,['2014/07/19 06:00'],"['2014/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/30 00:00 [revised]', '2014/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014225 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.225 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Mar;29(3):636-46. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.225.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 65 consecutive patients who received an allo-HPCT from Human Leucocyte Antigen-matched sibling donors were analyzed. The conditioning was BuCy2 in 48 patients and BuFlu in 17 patients. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the 2 cohorts in hematological engraftment, incidence of extrahematological toxicities, and acute graft versus host disease (GVHD). The incidence of chronic GVHD was 34% in the BuCy2 group versus 57% in the BuFlu group (P = .03). Transplant-related mortality was 17% (8 patients) in the BuCy2 group versus 0 in the BuFlu arm. Disease-related mortality was similar in the whole study population; in high-risk AML patients it was 11% in the BuCy2 group and 19% in the BuFlu group (P = .015). The probability of disease-free and event-free survival at 2 years was, respectively, 70% and 60% in the BuCy2 group and 59% and 58% in the BuFlu group (P = .06 and P = not significant [ns]). The probability of overall survival at 2 years was 71% in the BuCy2 group and 63% in the BuFlu group (P = ns), and in the high-risk group it was 83% and 67% in the BuCy2 and BuFlu group, respectively (P = ns). CONCLUSION: BuFlu is well tolerated and is less toxic than BuCy2 and our results did not suggest that in high-risk AML, BuCy2 should be the favorite regimen in terms of efficacy.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The resultant NPM-RAR fusion protein blocks myeloid differentiation and leads to a leukemic phenotype similar to that caused by the t(15;17)(q22;q21) PML-RAR fusion. The contribution of the N-terminal 117 amino acids of NPM contained within NPM-RAR has not been well studied. As a molecular chaperone, NPM interacts with a variety of proteins implicated in leukemogenesis. Therefore, a proteomic analysis was conducted to identify novel NPM-RAR-associated proteins. TNF receptor type I-associated DEATH domain protein (TRADD) was identified as a relevant binding partner for NPM-RAR. This interaction was validated by coprecipitation and colocalization analysis. Biologic assessment found that NPM-RAR expression impaired TNF-induced signaling through TRADD, blunting TNF-mediated activation of caspase-3 (CASP3) and caspase-8 (CASP8), to ultimately block apoptosis.

The precise molecular mechanisms that shape the latent histone modification landscape, however, remain unknown. Promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NB), also called nuclear domain 10 (ND10), have emerged as mediators of innate immune responses that can limit viral gene expression via chromatin based mechanisms. Consequently, although ND10 functions thus far have been almost exclusively investigated in models of productive herpesvirus infection, it has been proposed that they also may contribute to the establishment of viral latency. Here, we report the first systematic study of the role of ND10 during KSHV latency establishment, and link alterations in the subcellular distribution of ND10 components to a temporal analysis of histone modification acquisition and host cell gene expression during the early infection phase. Our study demonstrates that KSHV infection results in a transient interferon response that leads to induction of the ND10 components PML and Sp100, but that repression by ND10 bodies is unlikely to contribute to KSHV latency establishment. Instead, we uncover an unexpected role for soluble Sp100 protein, which is efficiently and permanently relocalized from nucleoplasmic and chromatin-associated fractions into the insoluble matrix. We show that LANA expression is sufficient to induce Sp100 relocalization, likely via mediating SUMOylation of Sp100. Furthermore, we demonstrate that depletion of soluble Sp100 occurs precisely when repressive H3K27me3 marks first accumulate on viral genomes, and that knock-down of Sp100 (but not PML or Daxx) facilitates H3K27me3 acquisition. Collectively, our data support a model in which non-ND10 resident Sp100 acts as a negative regulator of polycomb repressive complex-2 (PRC2) recruitment, and suggest that KSHV may actively escape ND10 silencing mechanisms to promote establishment of latent chromatin.",,"['Gunther, Thomas', 'Schreiner, Sabrina', 'Dobner, Thomas', 'Tessmer, Uwe', 'Grundhoff, Adam']","['Gunther T', 'Schreiner S', 'Dobner T', 'Tessmer U', 'Grundhoff A']","['Research Group Virus Genomics, Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Research Unit Viral Transformation, Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Research Unit Viral Transformation, Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Research Group Virus Genomics, Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Research Group Virus Genomics, Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140717,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (CALCOCO2 protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (latency-associated nuclear antigen)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Antigens, Nuclear/genetics/immunology', 'Antigens, Viral/genetics/immunology', 'Autoantigens/genetics/immunology', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/*immunology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Herpesvirus 8, Human/*physiology', 'Histones/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Innate', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Transport/genetics/immunology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/immunology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Virus Latency/*physiology']",,,2014/07/18 06:00,2015/11/07 06:00,['2014/07/18 06:00'],"['2014/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1004274 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-14-00271 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2014 Jul 17;10(7):e1004274. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1004274. eCollection 2014 Jul.,,,,PMC4102598,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although post-translational modifications including SUMOylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination have been found to regulate the stability or activity of PML, little is known about the role of its acetylation in the control of cell survival. Here we demonstrate that acetylation of lysine 487 (K487) and SUMO1 conjugation of K490 at PML protein are mutually exclusive. We found that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) promotes PML deacetylation and identified SIRT1 and SIRT5 as PML deacetylases. Both SIRT1 and SIRT5 are required for H2O2-mediated deacetylation of PML and accumulation of nuclear PML protein in HeLa cells. Knockdown of SIRT1 reduces the number of H2O2-induced PML-nuclear bodies (NBs) and increases the survival of HeLa cells. Ectopic expression of wild-type PML but not the K487R mutant rescues H2O2-induced cell death in SIRT1 knockdown cells. Furthermore, ectopic expression of wild-type SIRT5 but not a catalytic defective mutant can also restore H2O2-induced cell death in SIRT1 knockdown cells. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel regulatory mechanism in which SIRT1/SIRT5-mediated PML deacetylation plays a role in the regulation of cancer cell survival.",,"['Guan, D', 'Lim, J H', 'Peng, L', 'Liu, Y', 'Lam, M', 'Seto, E', 'Kao, H-Y']","['Guan D', 'Lim JH', 'Peng L', 'Liu Y', 'Lam M', 'Seto E', 'Kao HY']","['Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, and Comprehensive Cancer Center of Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, and Comprehensive Cancer Center of Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, and Comprehensive Cancer Center of Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Dermatology, University Hospitals Case Medical Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, and Comprehensive Cancer Center of Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140717,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (SUMO1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (SIRT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (SIRT5 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuins)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/enzymology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'SUMO-1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Sirtuin 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sirtuins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2014/07/18 06:00,2015/06/05 06:00,['2014/07/18 06:00'],"['2014/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/18 00:00 [revised]', '2014/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2014185 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2014.185 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2014 Jul 17;5:e1340. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2014.185.,,,"['DK078965/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK078965/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AR039750/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AR-039750/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA169210/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL093269/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4123062,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increased myometrial growth in the early and midterm of pregnancy involves a complex process of cell proliferation, antiapoptosis and differentiation. We have previously demonstrated that the androgen receptor (AR) is required for myometrial cell proliferation by modulating IGF-1 signaling during early pregnancy. Here, we report that AR also exerts its antiapoptotic function in human myometrial cells. Enhanced AR expression protects, whereas AR silencing sensitizes myometrial cells to both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic stimuli. AR agonist inhibits, whereas AR antagonist induces myometrial cells to undergo apoptotic cell death. Gene microarray analysis confirms that the central functions of AR in myometrial cells are to regulate cell cycling and apoptosis through three major gene groups involving the epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling, RNA splicing and DNA repair processes. AR mediates its antiapoptotic function through two distinct pathways. In the receptor-dependent pathway, AR is required for the expression of several protein factors within the EGF signaling pathway. Through the PI3K/Akt pathway, AR enhances the expression of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1. In the ligand-dependent pathway, AR agonist triggers the activation of Src kinase, which in turn phosphorylates STAT3 to increase Mcl-1 expression. We conclude from these results that the AR signaling exerts antiapoptotic function in myometrial cells, further supporting its key role in programming of myometrial phenotype.",,"['Li, H', 'Li, Y', 'Morin, D', 'Plymate, S', 'Lye, S', 'Dong, X']","['Li H', 'Li Y', 'Morin D', 'Plymate S', 'Lye S', 'Dong X']","['The Vancouver Prostate Centre, Department of Urologic Sciences, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'The Vancouver Prostate Centre, Department of Urologic Sciences, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'The Vancouver Prostate Centre, Department of Urologic Sciences, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine and VAPSHCS-GRECC, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', '1] The Vancouver Prostate Centre, Department of Urologic Sciences, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada [2] Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140717,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (AR protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Androgen)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Myometrium/*cytology/enzymology/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Receptors, Androgen/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,,2014/07/18 06:00,2015/06/05 06:00,['2014/07/18 06:00'],"['2014/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/06 00:00 [revised]', '2014/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2014303 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2014.303 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2014 Jul 17;5:e1338. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2014.303.,,,['MOP-111148/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],PMC4123094,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

KIT (D816V) is regarded as driver-mutation in SM-AHNMD. METHODS: DNA isolated from peripheral blood (PB) of an SM-CMML patient was investigated with targeted next generation sequencing. Variants were verified by Sanger sequencing and further characterized in the SM part of the bone marrow trephine (BMT), normal tissue, and FACS sorted PB cell subpopulations. FINDINGS: Low coverage deep-sequencing (mean 10x) on a GS 454 Junior revealed two as yet unreported SNVs (CBFA2T3 and CLTCL1), both germ-line mutations. High coverage (mean 1674x) targeted re-sequencing on an Ion Proton revealed 177 variants in coding regions. Excluding SNPs, the final list comprised 11 variants. Among these, TET2 (p.Thr1027fs, p.Cys1263Ser) and RUNX1 (p.Asn109Ser) were identified in in the peripheral blood and the SM part of BMT, but not in normal tissue. Furthermore, Sanger sequencing of PB cells revealed similar signal intensities for both TET2 mutations in FACS sorted CD34+ precursor cells and CD16+ granulocytes comparable to signals in the SM part of BMT. In contrast, RUNX1 exhibited a double intensity in CD34+ cells compared to the SM part of BMT and a homozygous variant signal in granulocytes. Both TET2 and RUNX1 mutations were not detectable in B- and T-cells. CONCLUSION: We present a heterozygous triple-mutation pattern (KIT, TET2, RUNX1) in mast cells (SM disease part) with additional LOH of RUNX1 in granulocytes (CMML disease part).

Tumor lysis syndrome occurs most often after administration of cytotoxic therapy in patients with high-grade lymphomas and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, but it can also occur spontaneously in tumor types that have a high proliferative rate and/or a large tumor burden. The metabolic disturbances of TLS include hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, secondary hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, and acute renal failure. The most important treatment for TLS is prevention. The mainstays of TLS prevention include aggressive hydration, control of hyperuricemia with allopurinol and rasburicase treatment, and close monitoring of electrolyte abnormalities. It is crucial for clinicians to prevent, detect, and treat TLS early to prevent life-threatening complications such as acute renal failure, cardiac dysrhythmia, and seizures. The purpose of this article is to explain the pathophysiology of TLS, identify patients at risk for TLS, and detail strategies for prevention and management of this oncologic emergency.",,"['Sarno, Jessica']",['Sarno J'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,J Adv Pract Oncol,Journal of the advanced practitioner in oncology,101550346,,,,,,2013/03/01 00:00,2013/03/01 00:01,['2014/07/18 06:00'],"['2014/07/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Adv Pract Oncol. 2013 Mar;4(2):101-6.,,,,PMC4093415,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal of therapy is to prevent transformation to the accelerated or blast crisis phases, which are associated with poor survival. Knowledge of the appropriate monitoring tests and treatment milestones, as well as the ability to interpret responses, allows advanced practitioners (APs) to effectively communicate key aspects of management to their patients. Monitoring patient responses to TKIs and identifying suboptimal responses early on offer APs the opportunity to reevaluate and adjust therapeutic treatment options. One of the causes of treatment failure is noncompliance; thus, educating patients on the importance of adhering to treatment and identifying reasons for noncompliance are of major importance. Because intolerance to TKIs may lead to discontinuation, frequent monitoring of side effects and response to treatment, open communication, patient education, and careful management are all essential in helping patients remain compliant with therapy. This review discusses the AP's role in helping patients achieve their best response to TKI therapy and optimize their long-term outcomes.",,"['Galinsky, Ilene', 'Buchanan, Susan']","['Galinsky I', 'Buchanan S']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,J Adv Pract Oncol,Journal of the advanced practitioner in oncology,101550346,,,,,,2012/07/01 00:00,2012/07/01 00:01,['2014/07/18 06:00'],"['2014/07/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.6004/jadpro.2012.3.4.3 [doi]'],ppublish,J Adv Pract Oncol. 2012 Jul;3(4):225-36. doi: 10.6004/jadpro.2012.3.4.3.,,,,PMC4093342,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22 (known as the Philadelphia chromosome) results in a fusion BCR-ABL gene that produces a dysregulated BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase protein and triggers events leading to malignant transformation. The tyrosine kinase inhibitors imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib block the BCR-ABL protein and prevent activation of the transformation pathways. Molecular monitoring, the most sensitive approach currently available to assess treatment response, measures BCR-ABL messenger RNA levels and serves as a surrogate marker of disease. Further, molecular responses are predictive of patient outcomes. It is important for advanced practitioners to become familiar with the technology and interpretation of molecular monitoring results as well as efforts to standardize this type of testing so they can educate their patients and aid their understanding of test results. Undetectable BCR-ABL levels can bring feelings of relief, whereas an increasing level can lead to anxiety.

METHODS: Using Kitasato University's Department of Neuro-Ophthalmology medical records and fundus photographs of the period December 1977 through November 2010, we retrospectively identified 121 outpatients who had been initially confirmed with bilateral disc swelling. RESULTS: The most common cause of the bilateral disc swelling was increased intracranial pressure (ICP) (59%); followed by pseudopapillitis (16%); uveitis (8%); hypertensive retinopathy (5%); bilateral optic neuritis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and optic disc drusen (all at 2% each); and leukemia (1%). Unknown etiology accounted for 6% of the cases. CONCLUSION: Although increased ICP is the most common etiology for bilateral disc swelling, it can also be triggered by a variety of other causes.

The main prognostic factor for predicting outcome and response to treatment is based on the underlying cause. To detect the root cause of this problem, depending on other accompanied signs or symptoms, the need for bone marrow examination and other advanced work ups is different at least at the practical level. This study focuses on the karyotype abnormality and to demonstrate the ability of this complimentary study in diagnosis and prognosis of such patients. METHODS: In this cross sectional study, bone marrow aspiration samples of all patients with Pancytopenia underwent cytogenetic investigation on bone marrow aspiration. Gathered data were analyzed by SPSS software. RESULTS: Among the 100 eligible patients, 67% revealed hypercellular, 19% had hypocellular and 13% had normocellular marrow. Most common causes of pancytopenia were myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (33%), MDS vs. megaloblastic anemia (23%) and acute leukemia (18%). Thirty one patients had karyotype abnormality in which majority (13 patients) were diagnosed as MDS followed by 11 patients with acute leukemia. CONCLUSION: Beside bone marrow examination, there is a need for more supplementary studies like karyotyping to detect the exact cause of pancytopenia. It is concluded that cytogenetic study on bone marrow aspiration can be a complementary test in diagnosis of pancytopenic patients. However, there are also cases where diagnosis even with implementing bone marrow examination and cytogenetic analysis is not possible. Such patients require more clinical follow-up and investigation.",,"['Safaei, Akbar', 'Shokripour, Mansoureh', 'Omidifar, Navid']","['Safaei A', 'Shokripour M', 'Omidifar N']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Iran J Med Sci,Iranian journal of medical sciences,8104374,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cytogenetics', 'Karyotype', 'Megaloblastic anemia', 'Myelodysplastic syndrome', 'Pancytopenia']",2014/07/18 06:00,2014/07/18 06:01,['2014/07/18 06:00'],"['2013/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/06 00:00 [revised]', '2013/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/18 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Med Sci. 2014 Jul;39(4):333-40.,,,,PMC4100044,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In mice, the E2-induced cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is essential in switching the uterine luminal epithelium (LE) from a nonreceptive to a receptive state. Here we define the LIF-mediated switch using array analysis and informatics to identify LIF-induced changes in gene expression and annotated signaling pathways specific to the LE. We compare gene expression profiles at 0, 1, 3, and 6 h, following LIF treatment. During the first hour, the JAK-STAT signaling pathway is activated and the expression of 54 genes declines, primarily affecting LE cytoskeletal and chromatin organization as well as a transient reduction in the progesterone, TGFbetaR1, and ACVR1 receptors. Simultaneously 256 genes increase expression, of which 42 are transcription factors, including Sox, Kfl, Hes, Hey, and Hox families. Within 3 h, the expression of 3987 genes belonging to more than 25 biological process pathways was altered. We confirmed the mRNA and protein distribution of key genes from 10 pathways, including the Igf-1, Vegf, Toll-like receptors, actin cytoskeleton, ephrin, integrins, TGFbeta, Wnt, and Notch pathways. These data identify novel LIF-activated pathways in the LE and define the molecular basis between the refractory and receptive uterine phases. More broadly, these findings highlight the staggering capacity of a single cytokine to induce a dynamic and complex network of changes in a simple epithelium essential to mammalian reproduction and provide a basis for identifying new routes to regulating female reproduction.","['(c) 2014 by the Society for the Study of Reproduction, Inc.']","['Rosario, Gracy X', 'Hondo, Eiichi', 'Jeong, Jae-Wook', 'Mutalif, Rafidah', 'Ye, Xiaoqian', 'Yee, Li Xuan', 'Stewart, Colin L']","['Rosario GX', 'Hondo E', 'Jeong JW', 'Mutalif R', 'Ye X', 'Yee LX', 'Stewart CL']","['Developmental and Regenerative Biology, Institute of Medical Biology, A*STAR, Immunos, Singapore.', 'Laboratory of Animal Morphology, Division of Biofunctional Development, Graduate School of Bioagricultural Sciences, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Reproductive Biology, Michigan State University, Grand Rapids, Michigan.', 'Developmental and Regenerative Biology, Institute of Medical Biology, A*STAR, Immunos, Singapore.', 'Developmental and Regenerative Biology, Institute of Medical Biology, A*STAR, Immunos, Singapore.', 'Developmental and Regenerative Biology, Institute of Medical Biology, A*STAR, Immunos, Singapore.', 'Developmental and Regenerative Biology, Institute of Medical Biology, A*STAR, Immunos, Singapore colin.stewart@imb.a-star.edu.sg.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140716,United States,Biol Reprod,Biology of reproduction,0207224,"['0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'Computational Biology', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Dinoprostone/administration & dosage/metabolism', '*Embryo Implantation', 'Endometrium/cytology/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/administration & dosage/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Signal Transduction']",['NOTNLM'],"['LIF', 'implantation', 'luminal epithelium', 'microarray', 'uterus']",2014/07/18 06:00,2015/05/23 06:00,['2014/07/18 06:00'],"['2014/07/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['biolreprod.114.118513 [pii]', '10.1095/biolreprod.114.118513 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Reprod. 2014 Sep;91(3):66. doi: 10.1095/biolreprod.114.118513.

The co-expression of two of myeloid, B- or T-lymphoid antigens is the hallmark of this disease. Herein, the case of a 28-year-old female patient is reported who presented with hemoglobin of 5.8g/dL, white blood cell count of 138x10(9)/L and platelet count of 12x10(9)/L. The differential count of peripheral blood revealed 96% of blasts. Moreover, the patient presented with lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly and bone marrow infiltration by monocytoid blasts characterized as 7% positivity by Sudan Black cytochemical staining. Immunophenotyping revealed the involvement of blasts of both T- and monocytic lineages. The cytogenetic analysis showed an isolated 17p deletion. Thus, the diagnosis of T-cell/myeloid mixed phenotype acute leukemia was made with two particular rare features, that is, the monocytic differentiation and the 17p deletion as unique cytogenetic abnormalities. The possibility of concomitant expressions of T-cell and monocytic differentiation antigens in the same blast population is hard to explain using the classical model of hematopoiesis. However, recent studies have suggested that myeloid potential persists even when the lineage branches segregate toward B- and T-cells. The role of an isolated 17p deletion in the pathogenesis of this condition is unclear. At present, the patient is in complete remission after an allogeneic stem cell transplantation procedure.","['Copyright (c) 2014 Associacao Brasileira de Hematologia, Hemoterapia e Terapia', 'Celular.

Pathologic rupture has been reported in infectious diseases such as infectious mononucleosis, and hematologic malignancies such as acute and chronic leukemias. Splenomegaly is considered the most relevant factor that predisposes to splenic rupture. A 66-year-old man with acute myeloid leukemia evolved from an unclassified myeloproliferative neoplasm, complaining of fatigue and mild upper left abdominal pain. He was pale and presented fever and tachypnea. Laboratory analyses showed hemoglobin 8.3g/dL, white blood cell count 278x10(9)/L, platelet count 367x10(9)/L, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ratio 2.10, and international normalized ratio (INR) 1.60. A blood smear showed 62% of myeloblasts. The immunophenotype of the blasts was positive for CD117, HLA-DR, CD13, CD56, CD64, CD11c and CD14. Lactate dehydrogenase was 2384U/L and creatinine 2.4mg/dL (normal range: 0.7-1.6mg/dL). Two sessions of leukapheresis were performed. At the end of the second session, the patient presented hemodynamic instability that culminated in circulatory shock and death. The post-mortem examination revealed infiltration of the vessels of the lungs, heart, and liver, and massive infiltration of the spleen by leukemic blasts. Blood volume in the peritoneal cavity was 500mL. Acute leukemia is a rare cause of splenic rupture. Male gender, old age and splenomegaly are factors associated with this condition. As the patient had leukostasis, we hypothesize that this, associated with other factors such as lung and heart leukemic infiltration, had a role in inducing splenic rupture. Finally, we do not believe that leukapheresis in itself contributed to splenic rupture, as it is essentially atraumatic.","['Copyright (c) 2014 Associacao Brasileira de Hematologia, Hemoterapia e Terapia', 'Celular.

Previous studies, using the murine leukemia virus-derived retroviral vector pMFG-FVIII-P140K, modified two recombinant human cell lines, HepG2 and Hek293 to produce recombinant factor VIII. In order to characterize these cells, the present study aimed to analyze the integration pattern of retroviral vector pMFG-FVIII-P140K. METHODS: This study used ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction to locate the site of viral vector integration by sequencing polymerase chain reaction products. The sequences were compared to genomic databases to characterize respective clones. RESULTS: The retroviral vector presented different and non-random profiles of integration between cells lines. A preference of integration for chromosomes 19, 17 and 11 was observed for HepG2FVIIIdB/P140K and chromosome 9 for Hek293FVIIIdB/P140K. In genomic regions such as CpG islands and transcription factor binding sites, there was no difference in the integration profiles for both cell lines. Integration in intronic regions of encoding protein genes (RefSeq genes) was also observed in both cell lines. Twenty percent of integrations occurred at fragile sites in the genome of the HepG2 cell line and 17% in Hek293. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the cell type can affect the profile of chromosomal integration of the retroviral vector used; these differences may interfere in the level of expression of recombinant proteins.","['Copyright (c) 2014 Associacao Brasileira de Hematologia, Hemoterapia e Terapia', 'Celular.

METHODS: Forty-eight patients were randomly selected and assigned to an SB solution group or CHX-based product group according to acute myelogenous leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Patients were asked to rinse their mouth four times a day from the day before chemotherapy started until discharge. The World Health Organization mucositis grade, patient-reported Oral Mucositis Daily Questionnaire, and clinical signs associated with infection were assessed on a daily basis. The oral microbial count was assessed on a weekly basis from the 1st day of chemotherapy started to the 28th day or to the day of discharge from the hospital. RESULTS: Of all the patients in the SB group, 25.0% developed ulcerative oral mucositis, whereas 62.5% in the CHX group did. The onset of oral mucositis was later in the SB group than the CHX group. The oral bacterial colonization in the SB group was significantly higher than that in the CHX group, but clinical signs associated with infection did not differ in both groups. CONCLUSION: As a result of this study, it was found that oral care by SB solution for acute leukemia patients undergoing chemotherapy was an effective intervention to improve oral health.",['Copyright (c) 2012.

Here we show that PEDF expression positively correlates with microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) in melanoma cell lines and human samples. High PEDF and MITF expression is characteristic of low aggressive melanomas classified according to molecular and pathological criteria, whereas both factors are decreased in senescent melanocytes and naevi. Importantly, MITF silencing down-regulates PEDF expression in melanoma cell lines and primary melanocytes, suggesting that the correlation in the expression reflects a causal relationship. In agreement, analysis of Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) data sets revealed three MITF binding regions within the first intron of SERPINF1, and reporter assays demonstrated that the binding of MITF to these regions is sufficient to drive transcription. Finally, we demonstrate that exogenous PEDF expression efficiently halts in vitro migration and invasion, as well as in vivo dissemination of melanoma cells induced by MITF silencing. In summary, these results identify PEDF as a novel transcriptional target of MITF and support a relevant functional role for the MITF-PEDF axis in the biology of melanoma.","['Copyright (c) 2014 Neoplasia Press, Inc.

Using EUROCARE data, and HAEMACARE morphological groupings, we aimed to estimate time trends in population-based survival for 11 lymphoid and myeloid malignancies in 20 European countries, by region and age. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we included patients (aged 15 years and older) diagnosed with haematological malignancies, diagnosed up to Dec 31, 2007, and followed up to Dec 31, 2008. We used data from the 30 cancer registries (across 20 countries) that provided continuous incidence and good quality data from 1992 to 2007. We used a hybrid approach to estimate age-standardised and age-specific 5-year relative survival, for each malignancy, overall and for five regions (UK, and northern, central, southern, and eastern Europe), and four 3-year periods (1997-99, 2000-02, 2003-05, 2006-08). For each malignancy, we also estimated the relative excess risk of death during the 5 years after diagnosis, by period, age, and region. FINDINGS: We analysed 560 444 cases. From 1997-99 to 2006-08 survival increased for most malignancies: the largest increases were for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (42.0% [95% CI 40.7-43.4] to 55.4% [54.6-56.2], p<0.0001), follicular lymphoma (58.9% [57.3-60.6] to 74.3% [72.9-75.5], p<0.0001), chronic myeloid leukaemia (32.3% [30.6-33.9] to 54.4% [52.5-56.2], p<0.0001), and acute promyelocytic leukaemia (50.1% [43.7-56.2] to 61.9% [57.0-66.4], p=0.0038, estimate not age-standardised). Other survival increases were seen for Hodgkin's lymphoma (75.1% [74.1-76.0] to 79.3% [78.4-80.1], p<0.0001), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (66.1% [65.1-67.1] to 69.0% [68.1-69.8], p<0.0001), multiple myeloma/plasmacytoma (29.8% [29.0-30.6] to 39.6% [38.8-40.3], p<0.0001), precursor lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma (29.8% [27.7-32.0] to 41.1% [39.0-43.1], p<0.0001), acute myeloid leukaemia (excluding acute promyelocytic leukaemia, 12.6% [11.9-13.3] to 14.8% [14.2-15.4], p<0.0001), and other myeloproliferative neoplasms (excluding chronic myeloid leukaemia, 70.3% [68.7-71.8] to 74.9% [73.8-75.9], p<0.0001). Survival increased slightly in southern Europe, more in the UK, and conspicuously in northern, central, and eastern Europe. However, eastern European survival was lower than that for other regions. Survival decreased with advancing age, and increased with time only slightly in patients aged 75 years or older, although a 10% increase in survival occurred in elderly patients with follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and chronic myeloid leukaemia. INTERPRETATION: These trends are encouraging. Widespread use of new and more effective treatment probably explains much of the increased survival. However, the persistent differences in survival across Europe suggest variations in the quality of care and availability of the new treatments. High-resolution studies that collect data about stage at diagnosis and treatments for representative samples of cases could provide further evidence of treatment effectiveness and explain geographic variations in survival.

We achieved high engraftment rates (96.7%) and rapid hematopoietic reconstitution. Acute GVHD occurred in 12 cases of the 29 engraftment patients (41.4%), and 6 cases (20.7%) were of grade III-IV. Chronic GVHD only occurred in 1 of 28 evaluable patients (3.6%). Twenty-three patients (76.7%) became infected, and 3 cases (10.0%) died of severe infections. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation occurred in 70.0% of the patients, but no CMV diseases were observed, nor did any patients die of CMV infection. The cumulative incidence of relapse (6.7%) was significantly reduced, and none of the acutelymphoblasticleukemia (ALL) patients relapsed. The 3-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) rates were 73.3% and 70.0%, respectively. The 3-year OS and EFS of the ALL patients was 75.0%.

Therefore, in the present study based upon our prior pilot results, we measured mRNA expressions of angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and endoglin (CD105) by reverse transcription quantitative PCR in purified CD19+ cells from 70 untreated CLL patients (median age, 63 years; males, 64%; Rai III/IV stages, 29 %; unmutated IgVH genes, 60 %) and evaluated their possible association with established prognostic factors and clinical course of the disease. Higher expression of Ang-2 was significantly associated with unmutated IgVH genes (n = 55, p= 0.003). Higher CD105 expression was significantly associated with unmutated IgVH genes (n = 55, p < 0.001), high CD38 expression (n = 66, p = 0.022), high ZAP-70 expression (n = 66, p = 0.010), Rai stage I-IV (n = 70, p < 0.001), progressive clinical course of CLL (n = 70, p = 0.001) and shorter time to treatment (n = 70; p < 0.001). Expression of FGF-2 was not significantly associated with any of the prognostic markers. These results indicate that elevated expression of Ang-2 and in particular CD105 by CLL cells is associated with unfavorable prognostic features and clinical outcome; thus, both cytokines appear to play an important role in biology and progression of CLL and warrant further investigation.",,"['Vrbacky, F', 'Nekvindova, J', 'Rezacova, V', 'Simkovic, M', 'Motyckova, M', 'Belada, D', 'Painuly, U', 'Jiruchova, Z', 'Maly, J', 'Krejsek, J', 'Zak, P', 'Cervinka, M', 'Smolej, L']","['Vrbacky F', 'Nekvindova J', 'Rezacova V', 'Simkovic M', 'Motyckova M', 'Belada D', 'Painuly U', 'Jiruchova Z', 'Maly J', 'Krejsek J', 'Zak P', 'Cervinka M', 'Smolej L']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (Angiopoietin-2)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (ENG protein, human)', '0 (Endoglin)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Angiopoietin-2/*genetics', 'Antigens, CD/*genetics', 'Endoglin', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*genetics']",,,2014/07/18 06:00,2015/06/02 06:00,['2014/07/18 06:00'],"['2014/07/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4149/neo_2014_071 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasma. 2014;61(5):585-92. doi: 10.4149/neo_2014_071.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, we used three L1210 cell variants: Scells - parental drug-sensitive cells; Rcells - drug-resistant cells with P-gp overexpression due to selection with vincristine; Tcells - drug-resistant cells with P-gp overexpression due to stable transfection with the pHaMDRwt plasmid, which encodes human full-length P-gp. Several authors have described the induction of P-gp expression/activity in malignant cell lines after treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (AtRA; ligand of retinoic acid nuclear receptors, RARs). An isomer of AtRA also exists, 9-cis retinoic acid, which is aligand of both RARs and nuclear retinoid Xreceptors (RXRs). In aprevious work, we described that the combined treatment of Rcells with verapamil and AtRA induces the downregulation of P-gp expression/activity. In the current study, we studied the expression of RARs and RXRs in S, Rand Tcells and the effects of treatment with AtRA, 9cRA and verapamil on P-gp expression, cellular localization and efflux activity in Rand Tcells. We found that the overexpression of P-gp in L1210 cells is associated with several changes in the specific transcription of both subgroups of nuclear receptors, RARs and RXRs. We also demonstrated that treatment with AtRA, 9cRA and verapamil induces alterations in P-gp expression in Rand Tcells. Particularly, combined treatment of Rcells with verapamil and AtRA induced downregulation of P-gp content/activity. In contrast, similar treatment of Tcells induced slight increase of P-gp content without any changes in efflux activity of this protein. These findings indicate that active crosstalk between the RAR and RXR regulatory pathways and P-gp-mediated MDR could take place.",,"['Breier, A', 'Stetka, J', 'Bohacova, V', 'Macejova, D', 'Brtko, J', 'Sulova, Z']","['Breier A', 'Stetka J', 'Bohacova V', 'Macejova D', 'Brtko J', 'Sulova Z']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '1UA8E65KDZ (Alitretinoin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*analysis', 'Alitretinoin', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/analysis', 'Retinoid X Receptors/analysis', 'Tretinoin/*administration & dosage', 'Verapamil/*administration & dosage']",,,2014/07/18 06:00,2015/06/02 06:00,['2014/07/18 06:00'],"['2014/07/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4149/neo_2014_068 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasma. 2014;61(5):553-65. doi: 10.4149/neo_2014_068.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Headache sub types, related morbidity, and effect on quality of life has not been reported thus far. OBJECTIVE: To study headache prevalence and type, related disability, and quality of life in a cohort of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors. METHODS: Childhood ALL survivors in at least 1-year of remission and 5 years from diagnosis completed questionnaires and were evaluated by a neurologist. Disability was evaluated with Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment scale and the Short Form-36 Health Survey assessed quality of life. RESULTS: Thirty nine of 72 (54%) females and 37 of 90 (41%) males reported headaches. Median time from ALL diagnosis to first headache was 5.2 years and median age at headache onset was 10.1 years in 76 participants with headache. Migraine headaches were diagnosed in 51 (31%) and episodic tension-type headaches in 49 (30%); migraine and tension-type headaches co-existed in 24 (15%) and 18 (11%) participants had chronic daily headaches. Fatigue was associated with migraine headache while hypertension and female gender associated with tension type headache. Headache-related disability was mild in 22 (29%), moderate in 7 (9%), and severe in 5 (7%) survivors, and was absent in the remaining 42 (55%) survivors with headache. Both migraine and tension type headaches associated with reduced mental component scores, while headache related disability associated with a reduced physical component scores. CONCLUSIONS: Headaches are common in ALL survivors but only a minority has significant disability or impairment of quality of life.","['Copyright (c) 2014 European Paediatric Neurology Society.

Although imatinib and its analogues have been used as front-line therapy to target this mutation and control the disease for over a decade, resistance to the therapy is still observed and most patients are not cured but need to continue the therapy indefinitely. It is therefore of great importance to find new therapies, possibly as drug combinations, which can overcome drug resistance. In this study, we identified eleven candidate anti-leukemic drugs that might be combined with imatinib, using three approaches: a kinase inhibitor library screen, a gene expression correlation analysis, and literature analysis. We then used an experimental search algorithm to efficiently explore the large space of possible drug and dose combinations and identified drug combinations that selectively kill a BCR-ABL+ leukemic cell line (K562) over a normal fibroblast cell line (IMR-90). Only six iterations of the algorithm were needed to identify very selective drug combinations. The efficacy of the top forty-nine combinations was further confirmed using Ph+ and Ph- ALL patient cells, including imatinib-resistant cells.

Somatic IDH mutations are often seen in gliomas and myeloid leukemia but have also been recently reported in a subset of other neoplasms. We analyzed a series of intestinal adenocarcinomas with (n=23) and without (n=39) associated chronic idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease treated at our institution for IDH1 and IDH2 mutations and correlated the clinicopathologic findings with mutation status. Compared with intestinal adenocarcinomas not associated with inflammatory bowel disease, adenocarcinomas associated with inflammatory bowel disease more frequently demonstrated IDH mutations (13% vs. 0%, P=0.047). All IDH mutations were identified in IDH1 and resulted in substitution of arginine by cysteine at position 132 (p.R132C, c.394C>T). IDH1 mutations were frequently (66%) associated with concurrent KRAS mutations (p.G12D, c.35G>A). IDH1-mutated intestinal adenocarcinomas were seen in the setting of both Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis and were located in both the ileum and colon. Compared with IDH1-negative inflammatory bowel disease-associated adenocarcinoma, IDH1-positive adenocarcinomas more frequently demonstrated tubuloglandular histology (100% vs. 25%, P=0.032) and were more frequently associated with precursor lesions exhibiting serrated morphology (66% vs. 6%, P=0.034). IDH1 mutations were also identified in the precursor dysplastic lesions associated with IDH1-positive adenocarcinomas. In conclusion, we demonstrate that IDH1 mutations are occasionally identified in inflammatory bowel disease-associated intestinal adenocarcinoma but not in intestinal adenocarcinoma not associated with inflammatory bowel disease. In addition, IDH1-mutated intestinal adenocarcinoma is associated with a characteristic low-grade tubuloglandular histology and often harbors concurrent KRAS mutations. Identification of patients with IDH1-mutated intestinal adenocarcinoma may become clinically important as new therapies emerge that target tumors that harbor IDH mutations.",,"['Hartman, Douglas J', 'Binion, David', 'Regueiro, Miguel', 'Schraut, Wolfgang', 'Bahary, Nathan', 'Sun, Weijing', 'Nikiforova, Marina', 'Pai, Reetesh K']","['Hartman DJ', 'Binion D', 'Regueiro M', 'Schraut W', 'Bahary N', 'Sun W', 'Nikiforova M', 'Pai RK']","['Departments of *Pathology double daggerSurgery, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center daggerDepartment of Internal Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology section signDepartment of Internal Medicine, Division of Medical Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,"['EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

Descriptive epidemiological analysis of data from the Saudi Cancer Registry 2001-2008.,674-83,,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiological data of leukemia cases diagnosed from 2001 to 2008 among male and female Saudis, including the frequency and percentage of cases, the crude incidence rate (CIR), and the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) stratified by leukemia subtype, region, and year of diagnosis. METHODS: This is a retrospective descriptive epidemiological analysis of all Saudi leukemia cases recorded in the Saudi Cancer Registry SCR between January 2001 and December 2008. The study was carried out in 2013 to investigate the pattern of leukemia in the Saudi population. Descriptive statistics and Poisson regression model were used. RESULTS: A total of 3852 leukemia cases were registered in the SCR between January 2001 and December 2008. The region of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia had the highest overall ASIR among Saudi males at 5.2 per 100,000 males, followed by both the Eastern region and Northern region at 4.9 per 100,000 males. Furthermore, the region of Najran recorded the highest overall ASIR among Saudi females at 4.5 per 100,000 females. However, Jazan had the lowest average ASIRs of leukemia in Saudi Arabia. CONCLUSION: There was a slight increase in the CIRs and ASIRs of leukemia in Saudi Arabia between 2001 and 2008. Riyadh, the Eastern region, and the Northern region had the highest overall ASIRs of leukemia among Saudi males, and Najran had the highest overall ASIRs of leukemia among Saudi females; while Jazan had the lowest rates among the Saudi population.",,"['Alghamdi, Ibrahim G', 'Hussain, Issam I', 'Alghamdi, Mohamed S', 'Dohal, Ahlam A', 'El-Sheemy, Mohamed A']","['Alghamdi IG', 'Hussain II', 'Alghamdi MS', 'Dohal AA', 'El-Sheemy MA']","['School of Life Sciences, University of Lincoln, Brayford Pool, Lincoln LN6 7TS, United Kingdom.

Because IFN-gamma induces a pro-inflammatory phenotype in macrophages and because trophoblast cells are principal targets of LIF in the placenta, we investigated whether and how soluble factors from trophoblast cells regulate the effects of IFN-gamma on macrophage activation. IFN-gamma reduces macrophage motility, but enhances Stat1 activation, pro-inflammatory gene expression and cytotoxic functions. Soluble factors from villous cytotrophoblasts (vCT+LIF cells) and BeWo cells (BW/ST+LIF cells) that were differentiated in the presence of LIF inhibit macrophage Stat1 activation but inversely sustain Stat3 activation in response to IFN-gamma. vCT+LIF cells produce soluble factors that induce Stat3 activation; this effect is partially abrogated in the presence of neutralizing anti-interleukin 10 (IL-10) antibodies. Moreover, soluble factors from BW/ST+LIF cells reduce cell proliferation but enhance the migratory responses of monocytes. In addition, these factors reverse the inhibitory effect of IFN-gamma on monocyte/macrophage motility. BW/ST+LIF cells also generate IFN-gamma-activated macrophages with enhanced IL-10 expression, but reduced tumor-necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), CD14 and CD40 expression as well as impaired cytotoxic function. Additional assays performed in the presence of neutralizing anti-IL-10 antibodies and exogenous IL-10 demonstrate that reduced macrophage cytotoxicity and proliferation, but increased cell motility result from the ability of trophoblast IL-10 to sustain Stat3 activation and suppress IFN-gamma-induced Stat1 activation. These in vitro studies are the first to describe the regulatory role of the LIF-trophoblast-IL-10 axis in the process of macrophage activation in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines.",,"['Dallagi, Angham', 'Girouard, Julie', 'Hamelin-Morrissette, Jovane', 'Dadzie, Rachel', 'Laurent, Laetitia', 'Vaillancourt, Cathy', 'Lafond, Julie', 'Carrier, Christian', 'Reyes-Moreno, Carlos']","['Dallagi A', 'Girouard J', 'Hamelin-Morrissette J', 'Dadzie R', 'Laurent L', 'Vaillancourt C', 'Lafond J', 'Carrier C', 'Reyes-Moreno C']","['1] Groupe de Recherche en Oncologie et Endocrinologie Moleculaires, Universite du Quebec a Trois-Rivieres, departement de biologie medicale, Trois-Rivieres, PQ, G9A 5H7, Canada [2] Centre de recherche BioMed UQAM-UQTR-INRS, Montreal, PQ, H3C 3P8, Canada.', '1] Groupe de Recherche en Oncologie et Endocrinologie Moleculaires, Universite du Quebec a Trois-Rivieres, departement de biologie medicale, Trois-Rivieres, PQ, G9A 5H7, Canada [2] Centre de recherche BioMed UQAM-UQTR-INRS, Montreal, PQ, H3C 3P8, Canada.', '1] Groupe de Recherche en Oncologie et Endocrinologie Moleculaires, Universite du Quebec a Trois-Rivieres, departement de biologie medicale, Trois-Rivieres, PQ, G9A 5H7, Canada [2] Centre de recherche BioMed UQAM-UQTR-INRS, Montreal, PQ, H3C 3P8, Canada.', '1] Groupe de Recherche en Oncologie et Endocrinologie Moleculaires, Universite du Quebec a Trois-Rivieres, departement de biologie medicale, Trois-Rivieres, PQ, G9A 5H7, Canada [2] Centre de recherche BioMed UQAM-UQTR-INRS, Montreal, PQ, H3C 3P8, Canada.', '1] Centre de recherche BioMed UQAM-UQTR-INRS, Montreal, PQ, H3C 3P8, Canada [2] INRS-Institut Armand-Frappier, Universite du Quebec, Laval, PQ, H7V 1B7, Canada.', '1] Centre de recherche BioMed UQAM-UQTR-INRS, Montreal, PQ, H3C 3P8, Canada [2] INRS-Institut Armand-Frappier, Universite du Quebec, Laval, PQ, H7V 1B7, Canada.', '1] Centre de recherche BioMed UQAM-UQTR-INRS, Montreal, PQ, H3C 3P8, Canada [2] Universite du Quebec a Montreal, departement des sciences biologiques, Montreal, QC, H3C 3P8, Canada.', 'Centre Hospitalier Regional de Trois-Rivieres, Trois-Rivieres, PQ, G9A 1Y1, Canada.', '1] Groupe de Recherche en Oncologie et Endocrinologie Moleculaires, Universite du Quebec a Trois-Rivieres, departement de biologie medicale, Trois-Rivieres, PQ, G9A 5H7, Canada [2] Centre de recherche BioMed UQAM-UQTR-INRS, Montreal, PQ, H3C 3P8, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140714,China,Cell Mol Immunol,Cellular & molecular immunology,101242872,"['0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chorionic Villi/immunology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*immunology', 'Interleukin-10/immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Macrophage Activation', 'Macrophages/*immunology', 'Monocytes/*immunology', 'Pregnancy/immunology', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Trophoblasts/*immunology']",,,2014/07/17 06:00,2016/02/18 06:00,['2014/07/17 06:00'],"['2013/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/30 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['cmi201450 [pii]', '10.1038/cmi.2014.50 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Mol Immunol. 2015 May;12(3):326-41. doi: 10.1038/cmi.2014.50.

The intronic microRNA (miRNA) clusters miR-99a ~ 125b-2 and miR-100 ~ 125b-1 promote progression of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL), an aggressive form of hematologic cancers. The function of the lncRNA hostgenes MIR99AHG (alias MONC) and MIR100HG within this ncRNA ensemble remained elusive. RESULTS: Here we report that lncRNAs MONC and MIR100HG are highly expressed in AMKL blasts. The transcripts were mainly localized in the nucleus and their expression correlated with the corresponding miRNA clusters. Knockdown of MONC or MIR100HG impeded leukemic growth of AMKL cell lines and primary patient samples. The development of a lentiviral lncRNA vector to ectopically express lncRNAs without perturbing their secondary structure due to improper termination of the viral transcript, allowed us to study the function of MONC independent of the miRNAs in cord blood hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). We could show that MONC interfered with hematopoietic lineage decisions and enhanced the proliferation of immature erythroid progenitor cells.

Monosomal karyotype (MK), a newly recognized cytogenetic category, has been reported to be a marker of poor prognosis in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and myelofibrosis, but its effect in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) remains relatively unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of cases diagnosed with CMML found a total of 262 patients. Patient characteristics, cytogenetic data, and survival were analyzed. RESULTS: Cytogenetic analysis found diploidy in 167 patients (64%). Trisomy 8 was the most frequent cytogenetic abnormality at 8% (22), followed by complex karyotype (CK) at 5% (14), (-)7 at 4% (10), and MK at 3% (7, of which 6 [86%] were also CK). Median overall survival was statistically significantly worse in MK-positive cases than in MK-negative cases (MK(+) vs. MK(-)). Patients with MK(+) only or CK(+)MK(+) did worse than any other group.

In order to investigate the clonal evolution of this lymphoma, we studied paired primary and relapse tumor samples from 33 patients with recurrent non-transformed t(14;18)-positive FL. We reconstructed phylogenetic trees of the evolution by taking advantage of the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)-mediated somatic hypermutation (SHM) active in the germinal center reaction using sequences of the clonal VHDHJH rearrangements of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) locus. Mutational analysis of the IGH locus showed evidence for ongoing somatic mutation and for counter-selection of mutations affecting the BCR conformation during tumor evolution. We further followed evolutionary divergence by targeted sequencing of gene loci affected by aberrant SHM as well as of known driver genes of lymphomagenesis, and by array-based genome-wide chromosomal imbalance and DNA methylation analysis. We observed a wide spectrum of evolutionary patterns ranging from almost no evolution to divergent evolution within recurrent non-transformed t(14;18) FL. Remarkably, we observed a correlation of the magnitude of evolutionary divergence across all genetic and epigenetic levels suggesting co-evolution. The distribution of coding mutations in driver genes and the correlation with SHM suggest CREBBP and AID to be potential modifiers of genetic and epigenetic co-evolution in FL.",,"['Loeffler, M', 'Kreuz, M', 'Haake, A', 'Hasenclever, D', 'Trautmann, H', 'Arnold, C', 'Winter, K', 'Koch, K', 'Klapper, W', 'Scholtysik, R', 'Rosolowski, M', 'Hoffmann, S', 'Ammerpohl, O', 'Szczepanowski, M', 'Herrmann, D', 'Kuppers, R', 'Pott, C', 'Siebert, R']","['Loeffler M', 'Kreuz M', 'Haake A', 'Hasenclever D', 'Trautmann H', 'Arnold C', 'Winter K', 'Koch K', 'Klapper W', 'Scholtysik R', 'Rosolowski M', 'Hoffmann S', 'Ammerpohl O', 'Szczepanowski M', 'Herrmann D', 'Kuppers R', 'Pott C', 'Siebert R']","['Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel & University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Second Medical Department, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Interdisciplinary Centre for Bioinformatics (IZBI), University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Translational Centre for Regenerative Medicine (TRM-Leipzig), Leipzig, Germany.', 'Hematopathology Section, Christian-Albrechts-University, Kiel, Germany.', 'Hematopathology Section, Christian-Albrechts-University, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Cell Biology (Cancer Research), Faculty of Medicine, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Transcriptome Bioinformatics, LIFE Research Center for Civilization Diseases, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel & University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Hematopathology Section, Christian-Albrechts-University, Kiel, Germany.', 'Second Medical Department, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Cell Biology (Cancer Research), Faculty of Medicine, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Second Medical Department, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel & University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140716,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosomes/ultrastructure', 'Computational Biology', 'Cytidine Deaminase/genetics', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Epigenomics', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genomics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/immunology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*genetics/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phylogeny', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,,2014/07/17 06:00,2015/04/07 06:00,['2014/07/17 06:00'],"['2014/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/08 00:00 [revised]', '2014/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014209 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.209 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Feb;29(2):456-63. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.209.

In recent years, several Plk1 inhibitors have been developed, with some agents showing encouraging results in early-phase clinical trials. This review focuses on volasertib (BI 6727; an investigational agent), a potent and selective Plk inhibitor. Volasertib has shown promising activity in various cancer cell lines and xenograft models of human cancer. Trials performed to date suggest that volasertib has clinical efficacy in a range of malignancies, with the most promising results seen in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Encouragingly, recent phase II data have demonstrated that volasertib combined with low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) was associated with higher response rates and improved event-free survival than LDAC alone in patients with previously untreated AML. Based on these observations, and its presumably manageable safety profile, volasertib is currently in phase III development as a potential treatment for patients with AML who are ineligible for intensive remission induction therapy. Given that many patients with AML are of an older age and frail, this constitutes an area of major unmet need. In this review, we discuss the biologic rationale for Plk1 inhibitors in cancer, the clinical development of volasertib to date in solid tumors and AML, and the future identification of biomarkers that might predict response to volasertib and help determine the role of this agent in the clinic.",,"['Gjertsen, B T', 'Schoffski, P']","['Gjertsen BT', 'Schoffski P']","['1] Centre for Cancer Biomarkers (CCBIO), Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway [2] Department of Internal Medicine, Haematology Section, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of General Medical Oncology, Leuven Cancer Institute, University Hospitals Leuven, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20140716,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (BI 6727)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pteridines)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pteridines/*therapeutic use']",,,2014/07/17 06:00,2015/03/25 06:00,['2014/07/17 06:00'],"['2014/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/05 00:00 [revised]', '2014/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014222 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.222 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Jan;29(1):11-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.222.

Thirty-nine MM patients receiving bortezomib-thalidomide-dexamethasone after autologous transplantation were monitored for MRD by both nested and real-time quantitative-PCR until relapse. Our data confirm the strong impact of MRD on survival: overall survival was 72% at 8 years median follow-up for patients in major MRD response versus 48% for those experiencing MRD persistence (P=0.041). In addition, MRD kinetics resulted predictive for relapse: indeed median remission duration was not reached for patients in major MRD response, 38 months for those experiencing MRD reappearance and 9 months for patients with MRD persistence (P<0.001). Moreover: (1) 26 patients achieving major MRD response (67%) benefit of excellent disease control (median TNT: 42 months); (2) MRD reappearance heralds relapse, with a TNT comparable to that of MRD persistence (9 versus 10 months, P=0.706); (3) the median lag between MRD reappearance and need for salvage treatment is 9 months.

In a landmark analysis assessing outcomes performed at 6 months, the CR rate with CVD was 59.6% vs 34.0% for CTD (P=0.03). The 1-year OS was 96% with CVD and 92% with CTD (P=0.40). The median PFS with CVD was not reached and was 19.2 m with CTD, P=0.028). In summary, both regimens are unable to overcome the high rate of early deaths in AL amyloidosis. However, CVD correlates with improved depth of response and superior PFS supporting its use in the frontline setting.

CALM-AF10 leukemias display abnormal H3K79 methylation and increased HOXA cluster gene transcription. Elevated expression of HOXA genes is critical for leukemia maintenance and progression; however, the precise mechanism by which CALM-AF10 alters HOXA gene expression is unclear. We previously determined that CALM contains a CRM1-dependent nuclear export signal (NES), which is both necessary and sufficient for CALM-AF10-mediated leukemogenesis. Here, we find that interaction of CALM-AF10 with the nuclear export receptor CRM1 is necessary for activating HOXA gene expression. We show that CRM1 localizes to HOXA loci where it recruits CALM-AF10, leading to transcriptional and epigenetic activation of HOXA genes. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of the CALM-CRM1 interaction prevents CALM-AF10 enrichment at HOXA chromatin, resulting in immediate loss of transcription. These results provide a comprehensive mechanism by which the CALM-AF10 translocation activates the critical HOXA cluster genes. Furthermore, this report identifies a novel function of CRM1: the ability to bind chromatin and recruit the NES-containing CALM-AF10 transcription factor.",,"['Conway, A E', 'Haldeman, J M', 'Wechsler, D S', 'Lavau, C P']","['Conway AE', 'Haldeman JM', 'Wechsler DS', 'Lavau CP']","['Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', '1] Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA [2] Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140716,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (AF10-CALM fusion protein, human)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Karyopherins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (exportin 1 protein)', '157907-48-7 (HoxA protein)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'Y031I2N1EO (leptomycin B)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/chemistry', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Karyopherins/*physiology', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Multigene Family', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'U937 Cells']",,,2014/07/17 06:00,2015/04/07 06:00,['2014/07/17 06:00'],"['2014/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/15 00:00 [revised]', '2014/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014221 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.221 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Feb;29(2):423-32. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.221.

Here, we describe use of quantitative in vivo stable isotope labeling in mammals to accurately compare serum proteomes of wild-type and dystrophin-deficient mdx mice. Biomarkers identified in serum from two independent dystrophin-deficient mouse models (mdx-Delta52 and mdx-23) were concordant with those identified in sera samples of DMD patients. Of the 355 mouse sera proteins, 23 were significantly elevated and 4 significantly lower in mdx relative to wild-type mice (P-value < 0.001). Elevated proteins were mostly of muscle origin: including myofibrillar proteins (titin, myosin light chain 1/3, myomesin 3 and filamin-C), glycolytic enzymes (aldolase, phosphoglycerate mutase 2, beta enolase and glycogen phosphorylase), transport proteins (fatty acid-binding protein, myoglobin and somatic cytochrome-C) and others (creatine kinase M, malate dehydrogenase cytosolic, fibrinogen and parvalbumin). Decreased proteins, mostly of extracellular origin, included adiponectin, lumican, plasminogen and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor. Analysis of sera from 1 week to 7 months old mdx mice revealed age-dependent changes in the level of these biomarkers with most biomarkers acutely elevated at 3 weeks of age. Serum analysis of DMD patients, with ages ranging from 4 to 15 years old, confirmed elevation of 20 of the murine biomarkers in DMD, with similar age-related changes. This study provides a panel of biomarkers that reflect muscle activity and pathogenesis and should prove valuable tool to complement natural history studies and to monitor treatment efficacy in future clinical trials.","['(c) The Author 2014.

We have developed a dual-color, dual-fusion fluorescence in situ hybridization (D-FISH) assay to detect fusion of the MLF1 and NPM1 genes. A blinded investigation was performed using 25 normal bone marrow specimens and 26 bone marrow samples from patients with one or more metaphases with a t(3;5)(q21-q25;q31-q35) or a der(5)t(3;5)(q21-q25;q31-q35) previously identified by chromosome analysis. Once unblinded, the results indicate our D-FISH method identified NPM1/MLF1 fusion in 15 of the 26 fully evaluated patient samples. Excluding three samples with a single abnormal t(3;5) metaphase, 15 of 17 (88%) patient samples with a balanced t(3;5) demonstrated NPM1/MLF1 fusion, and 0 of 6 patient samples with a der(5)t(3;5) demonstrated NPM1/MLF1 fusion, suggesting only the balanced form of this 3;5 translocation as observed by karyotype is associated with NPM1/MLF1 fusion. Overall, the FISH results demonstrated five different outcomes (NPM1/MLF1 fusion, MLF1 disruption, MLF1 duplication, NPM1 deletion, and normal), indicating significant molecular heterogeneity when the 3;5 translocation is identified. The development of this sensitive D-FISH strategy for the detection of NPM1/MLF1 fusion adds to the AML FISH testing repertoire and is effective in the detection of this translocation at diagnosis as well as monitoring residual disease in AML patients.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Society for Investigative Pathology and the', 'Association for Molecular Pathology.

Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is characterized by the t(15;17) translocation and can be treated by a combination of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and anthracycline. This treatment can induce leukemic cell differentiation, leading to extremely high remission rates. XAB2, a molecule involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER), is downregulated during granulocyte differentiation and shows reduced expression in NB4 APL-derived cells in vitro. Differentiation of APL by ATRA treatment reduced XAB2 expression levels in vivo.

Total saponins from P. chinensis can induce the apoptosis of solid cancer cells; however, their activity on chronic myeloid leukemia and the mechanisms remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To study the activity of total saponins and the main active fractions from P. chinensis saponins on chronic myeloid leukemia, and to illustrate the mechanisms underlying the anticancer activities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cytotoxic activity were assayed by MTT; cell cycle arrest and apoptosis were tested by flow cytometry system; changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential were determined using JC-1; and the apoptosis signaling pathway was determined by western blotting. RESULTS: We demonstrated that total P. chinensis saponin displayed cytotoxic activity against K562 cell line. In addition, we identified 23-hydroxybetulinic acid (HBA), pulchinenoside A (PA), and anemoside B4 (AB4) from the total saponins, with the most cytotoxic compound HBA. Glycosylation at C3 and C28 of HBA significantly reduces its cytotoxicity. HBA could promote cell cycle arrest at S phase and induce apoptosis via intrinsic pathway. HBA disrupts mitochondrial membrane potential significantly (p < 0.01) and selectively downregulates the levels of Bcl-2, survivin and upregulates Bax, cytochrome C, cleaved caspase-9 and -3. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Total saponins from P. chinensis may be effective natural products against human chronic myelogenous leukemia; HBA is one of the bioactive components responsible for its anticancer activity, and could be further investigated as an alternative therapeutic drug for leukemia.",,"['Liu, Ming', 'Zhao, Xingzeng', 'Xiao, Lin', 'Liu, Ge', 'Liu, Haizhou', 'Wang, Xiangyun', 'Feng, Xu', 'Lin, Xiukun']","['Liu M', 'Zhao X', 'Xiao L', 'Liu G', 'Liu H', 'Wang X', 'Feng X', 'Lin X']","['Key Laboratory of Marine Drugs, Ministry of Education, School of Medicine and Pharmacy, Ocean University of China , Qingdao , China .']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140715,England,Pharm Biol,Pharmaceutical biology,9812552,"['0 (23-hydroxybetulinic acid)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Saponins)', '0 (Triterpenes)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Molecular Structure', 'Pulsatilla/*chemistry', 'Rhizome/chemistry', 'S Phase/drug effects', 'Saponins/*chemistry', 'Triterpenes/isolation & purification/*pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Cell cycle arrest', 'K562', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'intrinsic apoptosis pathway']",2014/07/16 06:00,2015/09/04 06:00,['2014/07/16 06:00'],"['2014/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/13880209.2014.907323 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharm Biol. 2015 Jan;53(1):1-9. doi: 10.3109/13880209.2014.907323.

Except treatment response and immunophenotype, few markers are reliably prognostic in pediatric T-ALL patients. Aiming to improve T-ALL risk stratification, we investigated a new candidate biomarker with potential prognostic relevance. A phosphoproteomic screening of 98 pediatric T-ALL samples at diagnosis had been performed using the high-throughput Reverse Phase Protein Arrays technique, which led to the identification of PKCalphaS657 as an activated protein with a broad variation among T-ALL samples. To evaluate PKCalpha potential as a prognostic biomarker, PKCalpha expression was analyzed using RQ-PCR in a cohort of 173 patients, representative of ALL2000-ALLR2006 AIEOP study. A threshold of PKCalpha expression with the highest discrimination for incidence of relapse was identified. Patients with PKCalpha down-regulation, compared to patients with PKCalpha levels above the threshold, presented a markedly increased cumulative incidence of relapse (43.8% vs. 10.9%, P<0.001), as well as a worse 4-year overall survival (66% vs. 87.9%, P=0.002) and event-free survival (53.1% vs. 85.2%, P=0.002). In particular, low PKCalpha expression identified cases with extremely poor outcome within the high-risk minimal residual disease (MRD) stratum, their incidence of relapse being of 69% vs. 15% in the high PKCalpha levels group. In a multivariate analysis adjusting for main prognostic features, PKCalpha proved to be an independent prognostic factor related to incidence of relapse.

Here, we tested the role of SHP2/PTPN11 phosphatase in oncogenic KIT signaling using an aggressive SM mouse model. Stable knock-down (KD) of SHP2 led to impaired growth, colony formation, and increased rates of apoptosis in P815 cells. This correlated with defects in signaling to ERK/Bim, Btk, Lyn, and Stat5 pathways in P815-KD cells compared to non-targeting (NT). Retro-orbital injections of P815 NT cells in syngeneic DBA/2 mice resulted in rapid development of aggressive SM within 13-16 days characterized by splenomegaly, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and multifocal liver tumors. In contrast, mice injected with P815 SHP2 KD cells showed less disease burden, including normal spleen weight and cellularity, and significant reductions in mastocytoma cells in spleen, bone marrow, peripheral blood and liver compared to NT controls. Treatment of human mast cell leukemia HMC-1 cells or P815 cells with SHP2 inhibitor II-B08, resulted in reduced colony formation and cell viability. Combining II-B08 with multi-kinase inhibitor Dasatinib showed enhanced efficacy than either inhibitor alone in blocking cell growth pathways and cell viability.

This analysis aimed to identify the low-grade AEs which significantly impact the Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) of CML patients in chronic phase (CP) and to compare the incidence of such AEs among nilotinib- and imatinib-treated patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data from the 48 month ENESTnd trial were used (N = 593 patients). HRQoL was assessed using generic (SF-36) and leukemia-specific (FACT-Leu) HRQoL surveys. AEs were categorized into 26 system organ classes. RESULTS: In the adjusted regression model, five low-grade AE categories - gastrointestinal disorders, blood and lymphatic system disorders, general disorders and administration site conditions, musculoskeletal disorders, and psychiatric disorders - significantly impaired at least one HRQoL score. The incidence rate of these five AE categories was either significantly lower for nilotinib than imatinib or not different between the two drugs. The AE categories with lower incidence for both nilotinib 300 mg BID and 400 mg BID versus imatinib 400 mg daily were gastrointestinal, blood and lymphatic system, and musculoskeletal; nilotinib 300 mg BID had lower incidence than imatinib for general disorders. LIMITATIONS: Low-grade AEs were grouped and analyzed by system organ class category, so the effect of some rare individual AEs on HRQoL may have been missed. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of low-grade AEs on HRQoL should be taken into account, along with other factors, when selecting the optimal treatment for patients newly diagnosed with CML-CP.",,"['Guerin, Annie', 'Chen, Lei', 'Ionescu-Ittu, Raluca', 'Marynchenko, Maryna', 'Nitulescu, Roy', 'Hiscock, Robert', 'Keir, Christopher', 'Wu, Eric Qiong']","['Guerin A', 'Chen L', 'Ionescu-Ittu R', 'Marynchenko M', 'Nitulescu R', 'Hiscock R', 'Keir C', 'Wu EQ']","['Analysis Group Inc. , Montreal, QC , Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140805,England,Curr Med Res Opin,Current medical research and opinion,0351014,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Benzamides/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Piperazines/*adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects', '*Quality of Life', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['Adverse effects', 'Imatinib', 'Myelogenous leukemia, chronic', 'Nilotinib', 'Quality of life']",2014/07/16 06:00,2015/05/29 06:00,['2014/07/16 06:00'],"['2014/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1185/03007995.2014.944973 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Med Res Opin. 2014 Nov;30(11):2317-28. doi: 10.1185/03007995.2014.944973.

Accordingly, within T-cell neoplasms, CD103 reactivity has most frequently been reported in enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphomas, which are postulated to arise from intestinal intraepithelial T lymphocytes. However, prior studies of CD103 expression in T-cell neoplasms have been limited by the requirement for fresh or frozen tissue, given the historic lack of an antibody to CD103 for use in paraffin-embedded sections. Thus, a thorough assessment of CD103 expression in a broad spectrum of T-cell neoplasms as categorized by the current classification system has not yet been performed. This study uses a newly described antibody to define the profile of CD103 immunoreactivity in paraffin sections of a wide variety of T-cell neoplasms (184 cases). Overall, 22 T-cell neoplasms (12%) were CD103 positive, including 7 of 15 gastrointestinal lymphomas (3.8% of total cases; 46% of gastrointestinal cases). In intestinal cases, CD103 positivity did not correlate with morphology, presence or absence of enteropathy, or immunohistochemical profile. A history of celiac disease was not documented in any case. Frequent but inconsistent reactivity was also noted for adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma with 4 of 10 cases (40%) positive. In the remaining T-cell neoplasms representing most entities within the current World Health Organization classification, CD103 reactivity was sporadically observed in 11 of 159 cases (6.9%). CD103 positivity is an unusual feature in T-cell neoplasms and tends to occur in gastrointestinal lymphomas and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma but is not a consistent characteristic of these neoplasms.",,"['Morgan, Elizabeth A', 'Pihan, German A', 'Said, Jonathan W', 'Yu, Hongbo', 'Pinkus, Jack L', 'Dorfman, David M', 'Rodig, Scott J', 'Pinkus, Geraldine S']","['Morgan EA', 'Pihan GA', 'Said JW', 'Yu H', 'Pinkus JL', 'Dorfman DM', 'Rodig SJ', 'Pinkus GS']","[""*Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School daggerDepartment of Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston section signDepartment of Pathology, UMass Memorial Medical Center and University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA double daggerDepartment of Pathology, UCLA Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Review']",,United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Integrin alpha Chains)', '0 (alpha E integrins)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Enteropathy-Associated T-Cell Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology', 'Frozen Sections', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/*immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Integrin alpha Chains/*analysis', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'United States']",,,2014/07/16 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2014/07/16 06:00'],"['2014/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PAS.0000000000000296 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2014 Nov;38(11):1557-70. doi: 10.1097/PAS.0000000000000296.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although second-generation tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKI) such as nilotinib have shown activity in systemic BCR-ABL(+) disease, little data exists on their penetration and efficacy within the CNS. Four patients (3 male, 1 female; age 15-49) with meningeal relapse after alloSCT and subsequent treatment with nilotinib were identified. A total of 17 cerebrospinal fluid (csf) and serum samples were assessed for nilotinib concentration and patient outcome was recorded. Nilotinib concentrations showed a low median csf/plasma ratio of 0.53% (range 0.23-1.5%), yet pronounced clinical efficacy was observed with long-lasting responses (>1 year) in three patients. Comparison with historical data showed a trend towards superior efficacy of nilotinib versus imatinib. Despite poor csf penetration, nilotinib showed significant clinical activity in CNS relapse of BCR-ABL(+) leukemias. As nilotinib has a high protein-binding affinity, the low-protein concentration in csf could translate into a relatively higher amount of free and therefore active nilotinib in csf as compared to blood, possibly explaining the observed efficacy. Thus, treatment with a 2nd generation TKI warrants further investigation and should be considered in cases of CNS relapse of BCR-ABL-positive leukemia after alloSCT.",,"['Reinwald, Mark', 'Schleyer, Eberhard', 'Kiewe, Philipp', 'Blau, Igor Wolfgang', 'Burmeister, Thomas', 'Pursche, Stefan', 'Neumann, Martin', 'Notter, Michael', 'Thiel, Eckhard', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Kolb, Hans-Jochem', 'Burdach, Stefan', 'Bender, Hans-Ulrich']","['Reinwald M', 'Schleyer E', 'Kiewe P', 'Blau IW', 'Burmeister T', 'Pursche S', 'Neumann M', 'Notter M', 'Thiel E', 'Hofmann WK', 'Kolb HJ', 'Burdach S', 'Bender HU']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Theodor-Kutzer-Ufer 1-3, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Fetscherstrasse 74, 01307 Dresden, Germany ; Department of Internal Medicine, Klinikum Merseburg, Weisse Mauer 52, 06217 Merseburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Charite Berlin, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12203 Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Charite Berlin, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12203 Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Charite Berlin, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12203 Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Fetscherstrasse 74, 01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Charite Berlin, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12203 Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Charite Berlin, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12203 Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Charite Berlin, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12203 Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Theodor-Kutzer-Ufer 1-3, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Technische Universitat Munchen, Kolner Platz 1, 80804 Munchen, Germany.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Technische Universitat Munchen, Kolner Platz 1, 80804 Munchen, Germany.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Technische Universitat Munchen, Kolner Platz 1, 80804 Munchen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20140615,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Benzamides/administration & dosage', 'Central Nervous System/*pathology', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects']",,,2014/07/16 06:00,2015/03/13 06:00,['2014/07/16 06:00'],"['2014/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2014/637059 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Res Int. 2014;2014:637059. doi: 10.1155/2014/637059.

After complete resection of tumors, however, Burkitt and childhood B-cell Non-Hodgkin lymphoma show favorable outcomes, even after abbreviated chemotherapy of only 2 or 3 cycles. We investigated the effectiveness of abbreviated chemotherapy in patients with LS DLBCL after complete tumor resection. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 18 patients with LS DLBCL who underwent complete tumor resection followed by either 3 or 4 cycles of chemotherapy between March 2002 and May 2010. RESULTS: With a median follow-up period of 57.9 months (range, 31.8-130.2 months), no patients experienced disease relapse or progression; however, 1 patient experienced secondary acute myeloid leukemia during follow-up. The 5-year progression-free survival rate and overall survival rate were 93.3% and 94.1%, respectively.

We analyzed retrospectively the clinical data of AML patients 65 years old and above to describe patients' characteristics and treatment patterns, and to define meaningful prognostic factors of survival in the Korean population. METHODS: Basic patients' characteristics, clinical outcomes according to treatments, and prognostic factors associated with survival and treatment intensity were examined in a total of 168 patients diagnosed in 5 institutes between 1996 and 2012 as having AML. RESULTS: Herein, 84 patients (50.0%) received high-intensity regimens (HIR), 18 (10.7%) received low-intensity regimens (LIR), and 66 (39.3%) received supportive care (SC) only. The median survival of all patients was 4.5 months; and median survival times with HIR, LIR, and SC were 6.8 months, 10.2 months, and 1.6 months, respectively. Median survival times with HIR and LIR were significantly longer than that with SC (P<0.0001 and P=0.006, respectively). Multivariate analysis identified age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-performance status (ECOG-PS), hemoglobin (Hb) level, and serum creatinine (Cr) level as statistically significant prognostic factors for survival. In the HIR group, prognostic factors for survival were ECOG-PS, Hb level, and C-reactive protein level.

These activities are being exploited for the development of treatments for diseases caused by protein instability and/or aberrant protein-protein interactions, such as those found in certain forms of cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. However, designing or discovering pharmacological chaperones for specific targets is challenging because of the relatively featureless protein target surfaces, the lack of suitable chemical libraries, and the shortage of efficient high-throughput screening methods. In this study, we attempted to address all these challenges by synthesizing a diverse library of small molecules that mimic protein alpha-helical secondary structures commonly found in protein-protein interaction surfaces. This was accompanied by establishing a facile ""on-bead"" high-throughput screening method that allows for rapid and efficient discovery of potential pharmacological chaperones and for identifying novel chaperones/inhibitors against a cancer-associated protein, myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1), and a Parkinson disease-associated protein, alpha-synuclein.

Thus, novel molecular insights and therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. METHODS: We studied the impact of B-cell CLL/lymphoma 11b (BCL11b), a key regulator in normal T-cell development, in T-ALL patients enrolled into the German Multicenter Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Study Group trials (GMALL; n = 169). The mutational status (exon 4) of BCL11b was analyzed by Sanger sequencing and mRNA expression levels were determined by quantitative real-time PCR. In addition gene expression profiles generated on the Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array (affymetrix) were used to investigate BCL11b low and high expressing T-ALL patients. RESULTS: We demonstrate that BCL11b is aberrantly expressed in T-ALL and gene expression profiles reveal an association of low BCL11b expression with up-regulation of immature markers. T-ALL patients characterized by low BCL11b expression exhibit an adverse prognosis [5-year overall survival (OS): low 35% (n = 40) vs. high 53% (n = 129), P = 0.02]. Within the standard risk group of thymic T-ALL (n = 102), low BCL11b expression identified patients with an unexpected poor outcome compared to those with high expression (5-year OS: 20%, n = 18 versus 62%, n = 84, P < 0.01). In addition, sequencing of exon 4 revealed a high mutation rate (14%) of BCL11b. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our data of a large adult T-ALL patient cohort show that low BCL11b expression was associated with poor prognosis; particularly in the standard risk group of thymic T-ALL. These findings can be utilized for improved risk prediction in a significant proportion of adult T-ALL patients, which carry a high risk of standard therapy failure despite a favorable immunophenotype.",,"['Bartram, Isabelle', 'Gokbuget, Nicola', 'Schlee, Cornelia', 'Heesch, Sandra', 'Fransecky, Lars', 'Schwartz, Stefan', 'Stuhlmann, Reingard', 'Schafer-Eckhart, Kerstin', 'Starck, Michael', 'Reichle, Albrecht', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Baldus, Claudia D', 'Neumann, Martin']","['Bartram I', 'Gokbuget N', 'Schlee C', 'Heesch S', 'Fransecky L', 'Schwartz S', 'Stuhlmann R', 'Schafer-Eckhart K', 'Starck M', 'Reichle A', 'Hoelzer D', 'Baldus CD', 'Neumann M']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Charite, University Hospital Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Hindenburgdamm 30, Berlin, 12203, Germany. martin.neumann@charite.de.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140715,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (BCL11B protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis/genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Repressor Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Transcriptome', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics']",,,2014/07/16 06:00,2015/05/15 06:00,['2014/07/16 06:00'],"['2014/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['s13045-014-0051-y [pii]', '10.1186/s13045-014-0051-y [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2014 Jul 15;7:51. doi: 10.1186/s13045-014-0051-y.,,,,PMC4223626,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Between 23 and 28% of the adult population in Spain are obese, 39% are overweight and 36% have abdominal obesity. The association between obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia and sleep obstructive apnea is well known. On the contrary, the association between obesity and cancer is less known, because the recent evidence on it. Several prospective studies have shown during the last years the strong relationship between obesity and cancer of colon, breast in post-menopausal women, endometrial, kidney and pancreas as well as esophageal adenocarcinoma. Furthermore there is recent evidence showing that liver, gallbladder, thyroid and ovarian cancer as well as leukemia, multiple myeloma and Hodgkin lymphomas are probably associated with obesity, yet more studies are needed. A better knowledge of the relation between cancer and obesity will allow improving the prevention strategies against cancer, a more efficient early detection, and a more suitable treatment of obesity and overweight. Although the mechanisms of carcinogenesis of obesity are not well established, avoiding overweight and obesity are considered one of the best approaches to reduce the risk of cancer.

In the past, immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based approaches have been used to facilitate the distinction between GCTs and other, more frequently occurring, primary or metastatic tumors. The purpose of this study was to assess the added value of H1.5 and PLZF protein expression in the correct delineation of GCTs. METHODS: Consecutive 5-mum thick sections from routinely fixed and paraffin embedded tissues from 30 GCTs and 33 benign ovaries were processed for IHC using anti-PLZF and anti-H1.5 monoclonal antibodies. The respective protein staining intensities and distributions were quantified into reported scores for all tissue samples. Student's t-test and Fisher's exact test were used to compare the mean scores for each group. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Also, both the sensitivity and the specificity of the two antibodies were evaluated. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference in the expression of H1.5 between the GCT and normal ovary groups was observed (p < 0.0001). Normal ovarian tissues were found to strongly express H1.5, whereas GCTs were found to weakly express this protein. In contrast, PLZ expression was not found to be significantly different between both study groups. CONCLUSIONS: From our results we conclude that H1.5 is down-regulated in GCTs compared to normal ovarian tissues. Additional investigations on larger and more heterogeneous study populations, and on the molecular mechanism (s) underlying down-regulation of the H1.5 protein, may further substantiate the use of H1.5 as a diagnostic/prognostic marker and, in addition, provide insight into the pathogenesis of GCTs.",,"['Momeni, Mazdak', 'Kalir, Tamara', 'Farag, Sara', 'Chuang, Linus', 'Fishman, David', 'Burstein, David E']","['Momeni M', 'Kalir T', 'Farag S', 'Chuang L', 'Fishman D', 'Burstein DE']","['Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Science, Mount Sinai Medical Center, 1176 Fifth Avenue, 10029-6574, Box 1173, New York, NY, USA, mazdak_mom@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140715,Netherlands,Cell Oncol (Dordr),Cellular oncology (Dordrecht),101552938,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Granulosa Cell Tumor/diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Granulosa Cells/metabolism', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Luteal Cells/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Ovary/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,,2014/07/16 06:00,2015/04/22 06:00,['2014/07/16 06:00'],"['2014/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13402-014-0174-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Oncol (Dordr). 2014 Jun;37(3):229-34. doi: 10.1007/s13402-014-0174-8.

However, many questions remain unanswered regarding the molecular complexities of implantation. On-time implantation requires a receptive uterus and a mature blastocyst with trophoblast cells capable of adhering to and invading the endometrium. Defects in uterine receptivity or embryo/uterine signaling can cause implantation failure or early pregnancy loss, whereas deficient trophoblast differentiation can generate placental abnormalities that produce adverse pregnancy outcomes. This review will discuss several examples of signaling pathways that regulate trophoblast and uterine development during this period. Leukemia inhibitory factor is involved in uterine priming for implantation. The epidermal growth factor signaling system contributes to trophoblast-uterine communication, as well as trophoblast adhesion and invasion. Indian hedgehog signaling synchronizes tissue compartments within the uterus, and WNT signaling mediates numerous interactions within the implantation site and developing placenta. The autocrine, paracrine and juxtacrine interactions mediated by these signaling pathways contribute significantly to the establishment of pregnancy, although there are many other known and yet to be discovered factors that synchronize the maternal and embryonic developmental programs.",,"['Fritz, Rani', 'Jain, Chandni', 'Armant, D Randall']","['Fritz R', 'Jain C', 'Armant DR']","['Obstetrics and Gynecology, Wayne State University, C.S.

Reproduction in the tammar is seasonal, regulated by photoperiod and also lactation. Reactivation is triggered by falling daylength after the austral summer solstice in December. Young are born late January and commence a 9-10-month lactation. Females mate immediately after birth. The resulting conceptus develops over 6- 7 days to form a unilaminar blastocyst of 80-100 cells and enters lactationally, and later seasonally, controlled diapause. The proximate endocrine signal for reactivation is an increase in progesterone which alters uterine secretions. Since the diapausing blastocyst is surrounded by the zona and 2 other acellular coats, the mucoid layer and shell coat, the uterine signals that maintain or terminate diapause must involve soluble factors in the secretions rather than any direct cellular interaction between uterus and embryo. Our studies suggest involvement of a number of cytokines in the regulation of diapause in tammars. The endometrium secretes platelet activating factor (PAF) and leukaemia inhibitory factor, which increase after reactivation. Receptors for PAF are low on the blastocyst during diapause but are upregulated at reactivation. Conversely, there is endometrial expression of the muscle segment homeobox gene MSX2 throughout diapause, but it is rapidly downregulated at reactivation. These patterns are consistent with those observed in diapausing mice and mink after reactivation, despite the very different patterns of endocrine control of diapause in these 3 divergent species. These common patterns suggest a similar underlying mechanism for diapause, perhaps common to all mammals, but which is activated in only a few.",,"['Renfree, Marilyn B', 'Shaw, Geoff']","['Renfree MB', 'Shaw G']","['Department of Zoology, The University of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. m.renfree@unimelb.edu.au.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Spain,Int J Dev Biol,The International journal of developmental biology,8917470,,IM,"['Animals', 'Embryo Implantation, Delayed/*physiology', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*metabolism', 'Endometrium/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Macropodidae/*embryology/metabolism', 'Mice']",,,2014/07/16 06:00,2015/03/07 06:00,['2014/07/16 06:00'],"['2014/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['140059mr [pii]', '10.1387/ijdb.140059mr [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Dev Biol. 2014;58(2-4):175-81. doi: 10.1387/ijdb.140059mr.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PICU outcomes data for individual cancer types are lacking and may help identify patients at risk for poor clinical outcomes. METHODS: We performed a retrospective multicenter analysis of 10,365 PICU admissions of cancer patients no greater than 21 years old among 112 PICUs between 1 January 2009 and 30 June 2012. We evaluated the effect of cancer type, age, gender, genetic syndrome, stem cell transplantation, PRISM3 score, infections, and critical care interventions on PICU mortality. RESULTS: After excluding scheduled perioperative admissions, cancer patients represented 4.2 % of all PICU admissions (10,365/246,346), had overall mortality of 6.8 % (708/10,365) vs. 2.4 % (5,485/230,548) in the general PICU population (RR = 2.9, 95 % CI 2.7-3.1, p < 0.001), and accounted for 11.4 % of all PICU deaths (708/6,215). Hematologic cancer patients had greater median PRISM3 score (8 vs 2, p < 0.001), rates of sepsis (27 vs 9 %, RR = 2.9, 95 % CI 2.6-3.1, p < 0.001), and mortality (9.6 vs 4.5 %, RR = 2.1, 95 % CI 1.8-2.5, p < 0.001) compared to solid cancer patients. Among hematologic cancer patients, stem cell transplantation, diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia, PRISM3 score, and infection were all independently associated with PICU mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Children with cancer account for 4.2 % of PICU admissions and 11.4 % of PICU deaths. Hematologic cancer patients have significantly higher admission illness severity, rates of infections, and PICU mortality than solid cancer patients.

Our results showed that MLPII treatment inhibited pancreatic islet cell apoptosis and ameliorated insulin secretory capacity of pancreatic beta-cells in diabetic rats.

Moreover, MLPII significantly restored pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1 (PDX-1) protein nuclear localization, and increased mRNA and protein expression of PDX-1 and its downstream targets, glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) and glucokinase (GCK) in pancreatic islet cells of diabetic rats. These findings suggested that MLPII might play a critical role in protecting pancreatic islet cell from apoptosis via elevation of Bcl-2/Bax ratio, and ameliorating insulin secretory capacity of pancreatic beta-cells via restoration of PDX-1 nuclear localization and expression levels in diabetic rats.

CIP2A mRNA and protein expression in chronic myelocytic leukemia-chronic (CML-CP) patients and healthy controls were determined by RT-PCR and Western blot. In vivo, c-Myc expression, PP2A activity, cell proliferation, and apoptosis of CML cells were detected with CIP2A depletion. In addition, the relationship among CIP2A, BCR-ABL, and tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 was explored by depleting/overexpressing CIP2A or inhibiting BCR-ABL. The level of CIP2A mRNA was higher in CML-CP patients than healthy controls (56/74, 75.7 % vs. 1/35, 2.9 %, P < 0.001), and CIP2A protein was overexpressed in corresponding specimens. CIP2A knockdown by siRNA reduced the level of c-Myc protein and clonogenic formation, inhibited the activity of PP2A, K562 cell proliferation, and promoted cell apoptosis.

Although genetic alterations are increasingly reported in AML, the gene mutations have not been comprehensively studied in AML-M0. We aimed to examine a wide spectrum of gene mutations in patients with AML-M0 to determine their clinical relevance. Twenty gene mutations including class I, class II, class III of epigenetic regulators (IDH1, IDH2, TET2, DNMT3A, MLL-PTD, ASXL1, and EZH2), and class IV (tumor suppressor genes) were analyzed in 67 patients with AML-M0. Mutational analysis was performed with polymerase chain reaction-based assays followed by direct sequencing. The most frequent gene mutations from our data were FLT3-ITD/FLT3-TKD (28.4%), followed by mutations in IDH1/IDH2 (28.8%), RUNX1 (23.9%), N-RAS/K-RAS (12.3%), TET2 (8.2%), DNMT3A (8.1%), MLL-PTD (7.8%), and ASXL1 (6.3%). Seventy-nine percent (53/67) of patients had at least one gene mutation. Class I genes (49.3%) were the most common mutated genes, which were mutually exclusive. Class III genes of epigenetic regulators were also frequent (43.9%). In multivariate analysis, old age [hazard ratio (HR) 1.029, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.013-1.044, P=.001) was the independent adverse factor for overall survival, and RUNX1 mutation (HR 2.326, 95% CI 0.978-5.533, P=.056) had a trend toward inferior survival. In conclusion, our study showed a high frequency of FLT3, RUNX1, and IDH mutations in AML-M0, suggesting that these mutations played a role in the pathogenesis and served as potential therapeutic targets in this rare and unfavorable subtype of AML.","['Copyright (c) 2014 Neoplasia Press, Inc.

RESULTS: Trough plasma imatinib levels at 1 month correlated well with complete hematological response at 3 months (P = 0.007) and levels at 12 months correlated with molecular response at 12 months (P = 0.04). Compliance to imatinib also significantly correlated with imatinib levels at 1 month (P = 0.0008) and imatinib levels at 12 months (P = 0.0002).

In this model, diagnostic tests are essential for selecting safer and more efficacious treatments. The term ""companion diagnostics"" has been used to describe these tests, whereby molecular assays that measure the levels of proteins or specific gene mutations are used to provide a specific therapy for an individual by stratifying the disease status, selecting the proper medication, and tailoring dosages. Examples of companion diagnostics in the field of cancer medicine for molecular targeted therapy include tests for the ALK-fusion gene in non-small cell lung cancer and expression of CCR4 in adult T-cell leukemia. For breast cancer, the expression of HER2 protein is evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and gene amplification of HER2 is tested by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH); both tests consist of pre-analysis, analysis, and post-analysis processes that require quality control to ensure the reliability of the results. This symposium includes: 1) future aspects of companion diagnostics addressing many of the problems that must be overcome, 2) companion diagnostics using FISH focusing on HER2 amplification and ALK alteration, 3) newly developed diagnostic tests using tumor specimens and cell-free DNA in serum, and 4) CCR4 expression detected by IHC and flow cytometry.",,"['Fukutsuka, Katsuhiro', 'Takubo, Takayuki']","['Fukutsuka K', 'Takubo T']",,['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,Rinsho Byori,Rinsho byori.

The novel point mutation occurred at base number 290 in codon 97, where adenine was replaced with cytosine. The mutation caused the replacement of amino acid glutamine with amino acid proline in the activation domain of the elastase 2 enzyme. The heterozygous mutation generated severe cyclic neutropenia, granulocytic maturation arrest, an increased number of hematogones (26% of marrow cells) in the bone marrow, an absence of neutrophils, and the presence of stage 3 (mature) hematogones in the peripheral blood.

With the purpose of extending the potential clinical impact of sulforaphane in the oncological field, we investigated the antileukemic effect of sulforaphane on blasts from patients affected by different types of leukemia and, taking into account the intrinsically hypoxic nature of bone marrow, on a leukemia cell line (REH) maintained in hypoxic conditions. In particular, we tested sulforaphane on patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and blastic NK cell leukemia. Sulforaphane caused a dose-dependent induction of apoptosis in blasts from patients diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic or myeloid leukemia. Moreover, it was able to cause apoptosis and to inhibit proliferation in hypoxic conditions on REH cells. As to its cytotoxic mechanism, we found that sulforaphane creates an oxidative cellular environment that induces DNA damage and Bax and p53 gene activation, which in turn helps trigger apoptosis. On the whole, our results raise hopes that sulforaphane might set the stage for a novel therapeutic principle complementing our growing armature against malignancies and advocate the exploration of sulforaphane in a broader population of leukemic patients.",,"['Fimognari, Carmela', 'Turrini, Eleonora', 'Sestili, Piero', 'Calcabrini, Cinzia', 'Carulli, Giovanni', 'Fontanelli, Giulia', 'Rousseau, Martina', 'Cantelli-Forti, Giorgio', 'Hrelia, Patrizia']","['Fimognari C', 'Turrini E', 'Sestili P', 'Calcabrini C', 'Carulli G', 'Fontanelli G', 'Rousseau M', 'Cantelli-Forti G', 'Hrelia P']","['Department for Life Quality Studies, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, Rimini, Italy.', 'Department for Life Quality Studies, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, Rimini, Italy.', 'Department of Biomolecular Sciences, University of Urbino ""Carlo Bo"", Urbino, Italy.', 'Department of Biomolecular Sciences, University of Urbino ""Carlo Bo"", Urbino, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Department for Life Quality Studies, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, Rimini, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmacy and BioTechnology, Alma Mater Studiorum-University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140714,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Isothiocyanates)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Sulfoxides)', 'GA49J4310U (sulforaphane)']",IM,"['Anaerobiosis', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cellular Microenvironment/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Isothiocyanates/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Sulfoxides']",,,2014/07/16 06:00,2015/11/18 06:00,['2014/07/15 06:00'],"['2014/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0101991 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-08622 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jul 14;9(7):e101991. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0101991. eCollection 2014.,,,,PMC4096754,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ruthenium complexes have shown potential utility in chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy. The identification of new chemotherapeutics agents is critical for further progress in the treatment of leukemia. Ruthenium complexes generally have lower toxicities compared to cisplatin attributed to their specific accumulation in cancer tissues. Based on these evidences, in the present work we studied the cytotoxic activity of the ruthenium(III) compound cis-tetraammine(oxalato)ruthenium(III) dithionate - {cis-[Ru(C2O4)(NH3)4]2(S2O6)} against human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells (K-562) tumor cell line. The tested compound induces cell death in a dose and time dependent manner on K-562 cells. It is found that the effect was improved linearly while prolonging the incubation time. Compared to the cell cycle profiles of untreated cells, flow cytometric analysis indicated the sub-G1 arresting effect of ruthenium compound on K-562 cells. In our study, {cis-[Ru(C2O4)(NH3)4]2(S2O6)} shows a significant increase in tailed cells in any of the concentrations tested compared with negative control. Consequently, the concentration of {cis-[Ru(C2O4)(NH3)4]2(S2O6)} might be associated cytotoxicity with direct effect on K-562 cells DNA. Thus, it can be deducted that ruthenium-based compounds present selectivity to enter both tumor and normal cells.

Recent studies showed that patients with lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and acute leukemia have an increased thrombotic risk, particularly at the time of diagnosis and during chemotherapy. We searched the PubMed database for articles on thromboembolic complications in patients with hematological malignancies published between 1996 and 2013. The incidence of thrombotic events is variable, and is influenced by the type and the stage of hematological malignancy, the antitumor therapy, and the use of central venous devices. The pathogenesis of thromboembolic disease in hematological malignancies is multifactorial. Tumor cell-derived procoagulant, fibrinolytic, or proteolytic factors, and inflammatory cytokines affect clotting activation, and chemotherapy and immunomodulatory drugs increase the thrombotic risk in patients with lymphoma, acute leukemia, and multiple myeloma. Infections might also contribute to the pathogenesis of the thromboembolic complications: endotoxins from gram-negative bacteria induce the release of tissue factor, tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1b, and gram-positive organisms can release bacterial mucopolysaccharides that directly activate factor XII. In the setting of plasma cell dyscrasias, hyperviscosity, decreased fibrinolysis, procoagulant autoantibody production, inflammatory cytokines, acquired activated protein C resistance, and the prothrombotic effects of antimyeloma agents might be the cause of thromboembolic complications. Anticoagulant therapy is very complicated because of high risk of hemorrhage. Therefore, an accurate estimate of a patient's thrombotic risk is essential to allow physicians to target thromboprophylaxis in high-risk patients.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

However, the development of resistance to TRAIL in cancer cells cannot be avoided. This study investigated the effects of 2-(5-methylselenophen2yl)6,7methylenedioxyquinolin4-one (CCT327), an analogue of quinolin-4-one, on the sensitization of cancer cells to TRAIL and on TRAILinduced apoptosis in TRAILresistance human leukemia cells (HL60TR). We found that CCT327 enhanced TRAILinduced apoptosis through upregulation of death receptors DR4 and DR5. In addition to upregulating DRs (death receptors), CCT327 suppressed the expression of decoy receptor DcR1 and DcR2. CCT327 significantly downregulated the expression of FLICE inhibitory protein (cFLIP) and other antiapoptotic proteins. We also demonstrated that CCT327 could activate p38 and JNK. Moreover, CCT327-induced induction of DR5 and DR4 was mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) blocked the induction of DRs by CCT327.

Preventing CNS relapse after HSCT remains a therapeutic challenge, and criteria for post-HSCT CNS prophylaxis have not been addressed. In a 3-center retrospective analysis, we reviewed the data for 457 adult patients with ALL who received a first allogeneic HSCT in first or second complete remission (CR). All patients received CNS prophylaxis as part of their upfront therapy for ALL, but post-transplantation CNS prophylaxis practice varied by institution and was administered to 48% of the patients. Eighteen patients (4%) developed CNS relapse after HSCT (isolated CNS relapse, n = 8; combined bone marrow and CNS relapse, n = 10). Patients with a previous history of CNS involvement with leukemia had a significantly higher rate for CNS relapse (P = .002), and pretransplantation CNS involvement was the only risk factor for post-transplantation CNS relapse found in this study. We failed to find a significant effect of post-transplantation CNS prophylaxis to prevent relapse after transplantation. Furthermore, no benefit for post-transplantation CNS prophylaxis could be detected when a subgroup analysis of patients with (P = .10) and without previous CNS involvement (P = .52) was performed. Finally, we could not find any significant effect for intensity of the transplantation conditioning regimen on CNS relapse after HSCT. In conclusion, CNS relapse is an uncommon event after HSCT for patients with ALL in CR1 or CR2, but with higher risk among patients with CNS involvement before transplantation. Furthermore, neither the use of post-HSCT CNS prophylaxis nor the intensity of the HSCT conditioning regimen made a significant difference in the rate of post-HSCT CNS relapse.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, the interactions and influence of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) stem cells with the microenvironment remain largely unexplored. We have unexpectedly found that neuropathy of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) promotes leukemic bone marrow infiltration in an MLL-AF9 AML model. Development of AML disrupts SNS nerves and the quiescence of Nestin(+) niche cells, leading to an expansion of phenotypic MSPCs primed for osteoblastic differentiation at the expense of HSC-maintaining NG2(+) periarteriolar niche cells. Adrenergic signaling promoting leukemogenesis is transduced by the beta2, but not beta3, adrenergic receptor expressed on stromal cells of leukemic bone marrow.

Clinical data demonstrate that in vivo T-cell depletion with the anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody Alemtuzumab is associated with increased relapse rates of hematologic malignancies after allo-HSCT, underlining the importance of donor T cells for graft versus tumor activity. In contrast, recent results suggest that in vivo T-cell depletion with rabbit anti-T-cell globulin (ATG) Fresenius is not associated with tumor relapse after allo-HSCT, raising the possibility that ATG mediates antitumor effects. However, data on ATG's ability to bind to tumor cells and on its effect on the induction of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) are lacking. We used ATG Fresenius, which contains polyclonal rabbit IgG directed against the human T-lymphoma cell line Jurkat, to study relevant mechanisms of ATG-mediated antitumor effects, including ADCC, complement-dependent cytotoxicity, and induction of apoptosis. Based on the knowledge that Jurkat cells aberrantly express myeloid markers and B-cell markers, we hypothesized that rabbit ATG Fresenius binds to a variety of hematologic malignancies. We found that ATG specifically binds to a variety of hematologic malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia and B-cell lymphoma in a concentration-dependent manner. We demonstrate that ATG mediates antitumor activity, including induction of ADCC, complement-dependent cytotoxicity, and apoptosis, toward different hematologic malignancies. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the effects of ATG on posttransplant immunology in patients undergoing allo-HSCT.","['Copyright (c) 2014 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

An 847-amplicon panel was designed with the RainDance DeepSeq system, covering most exons of 28 genes relevant to acute myeloid leukemia and myeloproliferative neoplasms. We developed a paired-sample analysis pipeline for variant calling and sought to assess its sensitivity and specificity relative to a set of samples with previously identified mutations. Thirty samples with known mutations in JAK2, NPM1, DNMT3A, MPL, IDH1, IDH2, CEBPA, and FLT3, were profiled and sequenced to high depth. Variant calling using an unmatched Hapmap DNA control removed a substantial number of artifactual calls regardless of algorithm used or variant class. The removed calls were nonunique, had lower variant frequencies, and tended to recur in multiple unrelated samples. Analysis of sample replicates revealed that reproducible calls had distinctly higher variant allele depths and frequencies compared to nonreproducible calls. On the basis of these differences, filters on variant frequency were chosen to select for reproducible calls. The analysis pipeline successfully retrieved the associated known variant in all tested samples and uncovered additional mutations in some samples corresponding to well-characterized hotspot mutations in acute myeloid leukemia. We have developed a paired-sample analysis pipeline capable of robust identification of mutations from microdroplet-PCR sequencing data with high sensitivity and specificity.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Society for Investigative Pathology and the', 'Association for Molecular Pathology.

Although the radioresistant effect of BMI1 has been thoroughly investigated, the effectiveness of this factor on low-dose radiation (LDR) resistance has not been explored. Here, we demonstrate that BMI1 is not critical for altering cell viability or cell growth in response to LDR, but BMI1 changes cellular gene expression profiles in response to LDR. Normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) stably expressing BMI1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) did not exhibit changes in cell viability or cell cycle distribution assays following exposure to 0.1 Gy of gamma-radiation.

Chromatin is composed of nucleosome cores, in which DNA(147bp) is wrapped around a core histone octamer(two each of histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4), arranged in a ""beads-on-a-string array"" with linker histones and non-histone nuclear proteins. The chromatin structure could be altered by chemical modifications of DNA and histones, including methylation and acetylation, without affecting genetic codes. In mammals, DNA methylation is mediated via DNA methyltransferases (Dnmt) at CpG dinucleotides. Histones are modified by numerous enzymes, such as histone acetyltransferases (HATs), deacetylases (HDACs), methyltransferases and demethylases, in spatio-temporarily distinct manners. These modifications could alter chromatin structures to regulate a wide variety of biological processes such as gene expression, cell cycle progression and DNA repair. Given the biological importance of epigenetic modifications, it is easy to speculate that the abnormalities of chromatin modifying enzymes and reader proteins underlie several human diseases such as cancer, inflammation and metabolic disorders. Because epigenetic states are reversible and could be modified in response to extrinsic signals, including small molecular compounds, an increased understanding of their molecular framework would allow us to treat pathological conditions caused by epigenetic alterations.

Some subclones may be eradicated by treatment, whereas others are resistant to chemotherapeutic agents and ultimately grow out.

This paper reviews economic models of CLL treatment to learn the lessons from this experience and support ongoing model efforts. A search of databases and submissions to key health technology assessment agencies identified nine models. The modelling approaches adopted across these studies were fairly similar, with most models adopting a cohort Markov structure, though one example of a discrete event simulation was identified. While the cohort Markov approach has been acceptable to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the review identifies a number of key uncertainties with these models, including the extrapolation of survival outcomes beyond the period observed by the trial, the effectiveness of second-line therapies, and estimates of health state utility.

Patients with refractory SAA are at risk of later clonal evolution to myelodysplastic syndrome and acute leukemia. We report our pilot findings with haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haploHSCT) using uniform reduced-intensity conditioning with postgraft high-dose cyclophosphamide in 8 patients with refractory SAA or patients who rejected a prior UD or cord blood transplant. Six of 8 patients engrafted. Graft failure was associated with donor-directed HLA antibodies, despite intensive pre-HSCT desensitization with plasma exchange and rituximab. There was only 1 case of grade II skin graft-versus-host disease. We show that haploHSCT can successfully rescue refractory SAA patients who lack donor-directed HLA antibodies but not in the presence of donor-directed HLA antibodies. This novel protocol for haploHSCT for SAA has been adopted by the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation Severe Aplastic Anaemia Working Party for a future noninterventional, observational study to further evaluate its efficacy.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

In general, MLL fusion proteins are encoded by large cDNA cassettes that are difficult to transduce into haematopoietic stem cells. This is due to the size limitations of the packaging process of those vector-encoded RNAs into retro- or lentiviral particles. Here, we present our efforts in establishing a universal vector system to analyse different MLL fusions. The universal cloning system was embedded into the backbone of the Sleeping Beauty transposable element. This transposon has no size limitation and displays no integration preference, thereby avoiding the integration into active genes or their promoter regions. We utilised this novel system to test different MLL fusion alleles (MLL-NEBL, NEBL-MLL, MLL-LASP1, LASP1-MLL, MLL-MAML2, MAML2-MLL, MLL-SMAP1 and SMAP1-MLL) in appropriate cell lines. Stable cell lines were analysed for their growth behaviour, focus formation and colony formation capacity and ectopic Hoxa gene transcription. Our results show that only 1/4 tested direct MLL fusions, but 3/4 tested reciprocal MLL fusions exhibit oncogenic functions. From these pilot experiments, we conclude that a systematic analysis of more MLL fusions will result in a more differentiated picture about the oncogenic capacity of distinct MLL fusions.","['Copyright (c) 2014 The Authors.

Herein we describe the 12th case. METHODS: H&E and Envision immunohistochemical stains as well as in situ hybridization were used to study this disease in combination with review of the literature. RESULTS: Half of the cases reported to date are from China and Taipei. The clinical manifestation of IVNKL is erythema in the limbs and trunk, although patients' conditions have varied notably from each other. One-year survival rate is about 40%. CONCLUSIONS: IVNKL should be distinguished from extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (nasal type) and aggressive NK-cell leukemia. These three diseases have a similar phenotype and are all related to Epstein-Barr virus infection. However, the pathogenesis of similarities and differences needs further study. In particular, IVNKL is quite unusual. The treatment of IVNKL is difficult, and the prognosis is poor. Currently, IVNKL is not included in the World Health Organization classification subtypes and has been classified into NK/T-cell lymphoma (nasal type). However, in view of the unique characteristics of this disease, we propose that the diagnosis be independent, since this will facilitate further study of this disease.",['Copyright(c) by the American Society for Clinical Pathology.'],"['Liu, Yanli', 'Zhang, Wen', 'An, Jie', 'Li, Hui', 'Liu, Shuang']","['Liu Y', 'Zhang W', 'An J', 'Li H', 'Liu S']","['From the Department of Pathology, Bethune International Peace Hospital, Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province, China.', 'From the Department of Pathology, Bethune International Peace Hospital, Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province, China.', 'From the Department of Pathology, Bethune International Peace Hospital, Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province, China.', 'From the Department of Pathology, Bethune International Peace Hospital, Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province, China.', 'From the Department of Pathology, Bethune International Peace Hospital, Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province, China. liu_shuang@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,,IM,"['Adult', 'Biopsy/methods', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/complications/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/metabolism/*mortality/*pathology/virology', 'Skin Neoplasms/diagnosis/*mortality/*pathology/virology', 'Survival Rate']",['NOTNLM'],"['Intravascular lymphoma', 'Natural killer (NK)-cell lymphoma', 'Poor prognosis', 'Subcutaneous lesions']",2014/07/13 06:00,2014/09/23 06:00,['2014/07/13 06:00'],"['2014/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [medline]']","['142/2/243 [pii]', '10.1309/AJCP1JLYXLGDNOCH [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2014 Aug;142(2):243-7. doi: 10.1309/AJCP1JLYXLGDNOCH.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Molecular analysis of a CLL/SLL population detected two different immunoglobulin rearrangement patterns corresponding to a main peak and a minor peak. Transformation took place both as gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and as a synchronous bone marrow classic Hodgkin lymphoma with the same immunoglobulin rearrangement pattern corresponding to the minor peak detected in CLL/SLL at diagnosis.

METHODS: In this retrospective study of 111 patients with AML, we identified 14 patients with MK (13% of all patients with AML) using the definition proposed by Breems et al. RESULTS: Five (36%) of these 14 patients had a loss of a single chromosome in the presence of other structural abnormalities, and nine (64%) had a loss of two or more autosomal chromosomes. Patients with AML-MK presented at an older age, with lower bone marrow blasts, and their blasts less frequently expressed CD34. Most patients with AML-MK had morphologic multilineage dysplasia and were predominantly subclassified as having AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC). Molecular analysis showed a significant absence of NPM1 and FLT3 in patients with AML-MK.

Eight FANC proteins participate in the nuclear FANCcore complex, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin-ligase that monoubiquitylates FANCD2 and FANCI in response to replicative stress. Here, we use mass spectrometry to compare proteins from FANCcore-complex-deficient cells to those of rescued control cells after treatment with hydroxyurea, an inducer of FANCD2 monoubiquitylation. FANCD2 and FANCI appear to be the only targets of the FANCcore complex. We identify other proteins that are post-translationally modified in a FANCA- or FANCC-dependent manner. The majority of these potential targets localize to the cell membrane. Finally, we demonstrate that (a) the chemokine receptor CXCR5 is neddylated; (b) FANCA but not FANCC appears to modulate CXCR5 neddylation through an unknown mechanism; (c) CXCR5 neddylation is involved in targeting the receptor to the cell membrane; and (d) CXCR5 neddylation stimulates cell migration and motility.

PATIENTS AND METHOD: The epidemiological profile based on the described variables of the 10,943 HNs diagnosed during a 10-years period was analyzed, compared with other studies. RESULTS: The overall age-adjusted incidence was 29.4 cases/10(5) inhabitants-year, with some geographical differences. The mean age was 67.3 years, with a turning point between the 6th-7th decades of life from which there was a very significant increase of incidence. Two relevant facts where simultaneous with advancing age: decreased lymphoid neoplasms incidence and increased low degree neoplasms incidence. Lymphoid low degree neoplasms accounted for half of the registered processes, showed the greatest preference for male and reached the mode before the rest of neoplasms. Myeloid neoplasms incidence (9.5) was higher than that reported in other European registries, specially compared to southern European countries, opposite to lymphoid neoplasms incidence (20.0). CONCLUSIONS: A higher myeloid neoplasms incidence and lower lymphoid one than expected was observed. The turning point of incidence is between the 6th-7th decades of life, with a preference for male that decreases with age. There is an increased incidence of HNs in the area where a higher density of potentially polluting facilities is concentrated.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

At the same time, the RKIP-siRNA was transfected into K562 cells in another group. The expressions of RKIP in all groups were assayed by Western blot after 48 h. MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay was used to analyze the cell viability. Flow cytometry (FCM) was used to examine the cell cycle and cell apoptosis. Colony forming unit (CFU) assay was used to analyze the effect of RKIP on the clonogenic growth of CML cells. Western blot or luciferase reporter assay was used to detect the effect of RKIP on the level of phospho-ERK1/2 or the transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB. Western blot analysis showed that the plasmid pcDNA3.1-RKIP or RKIP-siRNA significantly enhanced or decreased RKIP expression (p < 0.01), respectively. In addition, MTT, FCM, and CFU assay indicated that the overexpression of RKIP significantly lowered the cell viability, cell proliferation and the clonogenic growth (p < 0.05), but improved cell apoptosis (p < 0.01). Western blot analysis or luciferase reporter assay showed that the level of phospho-ERK1/2 or the transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB was strongly inhibited by overexpression of RKIP. All these results could bring us a new perspective for biological therapy in myelogenous leukemia in the future.",,"['Li, Bin', 'Sun, Baolan', 'Zhu, Jianwei', 'Zhou, Nina', 'Yang, Zhiping', 'Gu, Jianhui']","['Li B', 'Sun B', 'Zhu J', 'Zhou N', 'Yang Z', 'Gu J']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (PEBP1 protein, human)', '0 (Phosphatidylethanolamine Binding Protein)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*physiology', 'Phosphatidylethanolamine Binding Protein/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Transfection']",,,2014/07/13 06:00,2015/01/06 06:00,['2014/07/13 06:00'],"['2014/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-014-2312-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2014 Oct;35(10):10057-66. doi: 10.1007/s13277-014-2312-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we provide the first mechanistic insights into the role of nucleolin in leukemogenesis through creating a DNA hypermethylation profile in leukemia cells. We found that, in leukemia patients, nucleolin levels are significantly elevated and nucleolin overexpression strongly associates with DNMT upregulation and shorter survival. Enforced nucleolin expression augmented leukemia cell proliferation, whereas nucleolin dysfunction by RNA interference and inhibitory molecule AS1411 blocked leukemia cell clonogenic potential in vitro and impaired tumorigenesis in vivo. Mechanistic investigations showed that nucleolin directly activates NFkappaB signaling, and NFkappaB activates its downstream effector, DNA methylation machinery. Indeed, nucleolin overexpression increased NFkappaB phosphorylation and upregulated DNMT1 that is followed by DNA demethylation; by contrast, nucleolin dysfunction dephosphorylated NFkappaB and abrogated DNMT1 expression, which resulted in decreased global DNA methylation, restored p15INK4B expression and DNA hypomethylation on p15INK4B promoter. Notably, NFkappaB inactivation diminished, whereas NFkappaB overexpression enhanced DNMT1 promoter activity and endogenous DNMT1 expression. Collectively, our studies identify nucleolin as an unconventional epigenetic regulator in leukemia cells and demonstrate nucleolin-NFkappaB-DNMT1 axis as a new molecular pathway underlying AML leukemogenesis.",,"['Shen, Na', 'Yan, Fei', 'Pang, Jiuxia', 'Wu, Lai-Chu', 'Al-Kali, Aref', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Liu, Shujun']","['Shen N', 'Yan F', 'Pang J', 'Wu LC', 'Al-Kali A', 'Litzow MR', 'Liu S']","['The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, MN.', 'The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, MN.', 'The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, MN.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, MN.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (nucleolin)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNMT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (Dnmt1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation']",,,2014/07/13 06:00,2015/06/06 06:00,['2014/07/13 06:00'],"['2014/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/06 06:00 [medline]']","['2131 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.2131 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2014 Jul 30;5(14):5494-509. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.2131.,,,"['R01 CA149623/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA155915/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA149623/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21CA155915/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4170608,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: To elucidate whether miRNAs secreted from chronic myelogenous leukemia cells (CML) are shuttled into endothelial cells thus affecting their phenotype, we first analysed miRNAs content in LAMA84 exosomes. Among the 124 miRNAs identified in LAMA84 exosomes, we focused our attention on miR-126 which was found to be over-overexpressed in exosomes compared with producing parental cells. Transfection of LAMA84 with Cy3-labelled miR-126 and co-culture of leukemia cells with endothelial cells (EC) confirmed that miR-126 is shuttled into HUVECs. The treatment of HUVECs with LAMA84 exosomes for 24 hours reduced CXCL12 and VCAM1 expression, both at the mRNA and protein level, and negatively modulated LAMA84 motility and cells adhesion. Transfection in HUVECs of miR-126 inhibitor reversed the decrease of CXCL12 and restored the motility and adhesion of LAMA84 cells while the over-expression of miR-126, showed opposite effects. CONCLUSION: Our results show that the miR-126 shuttled by exosomes is biologically active in the target cells, and support the hypothesis that exosomal miRNAs have an important role in tumor-endothelial crosstalk occurring in the bone marrow microenvironment, potentially affecting disease progression.",,"['Taverna, Simona', 'Amodeo, Valeria', 'Saieva, Laura', 'Russo, Antonio', 'Giallombardo, Marco', 'De Leo, Giacomo', 'Alessandro, Riccardo']","['Taverna S', 'Amodeo V', 'Saieva L', 'Russo A', 'Giallombardo M', 'De Leo G', 'Alessandro R']","['Dipartimento di Biopatologia e Metodologie Biomediche, Sezione di Biologia e Genetica, Universita di Palermo, Palermo, Italy. riccardo.alessandro@unipa.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140711,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (MIRN126 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Chemokine CXCL12/biosynthesis', 'Endothelial Cells/metabolism', 'Exosomes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/biosynthesis']",,,2014/07/13 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/07/13 06:00'],"['2014/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-13-169 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-13-169 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2014 Jul 11;13:169. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-13-169.,,,,PMC4105877,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While investigation of these processes remains a challenge, advances in genome-wide technologies and growing interactions between laboratory and computational science are starting to produce increasingly accurate network models. The haematopoietic system provides an attractive experimental system to elucidate gene regulatory mechanisms, and allows experimental investigation of both normal and dysregulated networks. In this review we examine the principles of TF-controlled gene regulatory networks and the key experimental techniques used to investigate them.

Immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement can be an optimal target for clonality detection in B-lymphoid malignancies. In the present study, we evaluated the presence of IGH gene rearrangement in non B-cell haemato-oncology patients including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL), acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) and biphenotypic leukaemia. MEHTODS: We studied 18 cases of haematological malignancies which comprised five patients with T-ALL, 12 patients with AML and one with biphenotypic leukaemia. RESULTS: We found that the incidence of IGH gene rearrangement in T-ALL and AML were three (60%) and two (16.7%), respectively. The patient with biphenotypic leukaemia was negative for IGH gene rearrangement.

To identify the biological function of HMGA2, we generated transgenic mice carrying the human HMGA2 gene under control of the VH promoter/Emu enhancer. Approximately 90% of Emu-HMGA2 transgenic mice became visibly sick between 4 and 8 months due to the onset and progression of a T-ALL-like disease. Characteristic features included severe alopecia (30% of mice); enlarged lymph nodes and spleen; and profound immunological abnormalities (altered cytokine levels, hypoimmunoglobulinemia) leading to reduced immune responsiveness. Immunophenotyping showed accumulation of CD5+CD4+, CD5+CD8+ or CD5+CD8+CD4+ T-cell populations in the spleens and bone marrow of sick animals.

The aim of this study was to elucidate parameters explaining the differential leukemia cell sensitivity towards this compound. Among several leukemia cell lines, U937 monocytic leukemia cells appeared more sensitive to plumbagin treatment in terms of cytotoxicity and level of apoptotic cell death compared to more resistant Raji Burkitt lymphoma cells.

Activating alternate death mechanisms introduces the potential to kill cells that have defects in their apoptotic machinery, as is commonly observed in cancer cells, including in hematological malignancies. We, and others, have previously reported that the mTOR inhibitor everolimus has pre-clinical efficacy and induces caspase-independent cell death in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Furthermore, everolimus is currently in clinical trial for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Here we characterize the death mechanism activated by everolimus in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. We find that cell death is caspase-independent and lacks the morphology associated with apoptosis. Although mitochondrial depolarization is an early event, permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane only occurs after cell death has occurred. While morphological and biochemical evidence shows that autophagy is clearly present it is not responsible for the observed cell death. There are a number of features consistent with paraptosis including morphology, caspase-independence, and the requirement for new protein synthesis. However in contrast to some reports of paraptosis, the activation of JNK signaling was not required for everolimus-induced cell death.

These proteins regulate various cellular processes, including cell apoptosis, by binding to adenine uridine rich elements in the 3' untranslated regions of sets of target mRNAs to promote their degradation. The pro-apoptotic and other functions of ZFP36 family members have been implicated in the pathogenesis of lymphoid malignancies. To identify candidate mRNAs that are targeted in the pro-apoptotic response by ZFP36L1, we reverse-engineered a gene regulatory network for all three ZFP36 family members using the 'maximum information coefficient' (MIC) for target gene inference on a large microarray gene expression dataset representing cells of diverse histological origin. Of the three inferred ZFP36L1 mRNA targets that were identified, we focussed on experimental validation of mRNA for the pro-survival protein, BCL2, as a target for ZFP36L1. RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments revealed that ZFP36L1 interacted with the BCL2 adenine uridine rich element. In murine BCL1 leukemia cells stably transduced with a ZFP36L1 ShRNA lentiviral construct, BCL2 mRNA degradation was significantly delayed compared to control lentiviral expressing cells and ZFP36L1 knockdown in different cell types (BCL1, ACHN, Ramos), resulted in increased levels of BCL2 mRNA levels compared to control cells. 3' untranslated region luciferase reporter assays in HEK293T cells showed that wild type but not zinc finger mutant ZFP36L1 protein was able to downregulate a BCL2 construct containing the BCL2 adenine uridine rich element and removal of the adenine uridine rich core from the BCL2 3' untranslated region in the reporter construct significantly reduced the ability of ZFP36L1 to mediate this effect. Taken together, our data are consistent with ZFP36L1 interacting with and mediating degradation of BCL2 mRNA as an important target through which ZFP36L1 mediates its pro-apoptotic effects in malignant B-cells.",,"['Zekavati, Anna', 'Nasir, Asghar', 'Alcaraz, Amor', 'Aldrovandi, Maceler', 'Marsh, Phil', 'Norton, John D', 'Murphy, John J']","['Zekavati A', 'Nasir A', 'Alcaraz A', 'Aldrovandi M', 'Marsh P', 'Norton JD', 'Murphy JJ']","[""Division of Immunology, Infection and Inflammatory Disease, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", ""Division of Immunology, Infection and Inflammatory Disease, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Westminster, London, United Kingdom.', ""Division of Immunology, Infection and Inflammatory Disease, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", ""Division of Endocrinology, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", 'School of Biological Sciences, University of Essex, Colchester, Essex, United Kingdom.', ""Division of Immunology, Infection and Inflammatory Disease, King's College London, London, United Kingdom; Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Westminster, London, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140711,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Butyrate Response Factor 1)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ZFP36L1 protein, human)', '0 (Zfp36l1 protein, mouse)', '114100-40-2 (Bcl2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"[""*3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Butyrate Response Factor 1/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/genetics/metabolism', 'Luciferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Response Elements', 'Signal Transduction']",,,2014/07/12 06:00,2015/03/05 06:00,['2014/07/12 06:00'],"['2013/09/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0102625 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-39334 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jul 11;9(7):e102625. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0102625. eCollection 2014.,,,,PMC4094554,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its role in epithelia remains largely unknown. Here, we uncover two roles for Meis1 in the epidermis: as a critical regulator of epidermal homeostasis in normal tissues and as a proto-oncogenic factor in neoplastic tissues. In normal epidermis, we show that Meis1 is predominantly expressed in the bulge region of the hair follicles where multipotent adult stem cells reside, and that the number of these stem cells is reduced when Meis1 is deleted in the epidermal tissue of mice. Mice with epidermal deletion of Meis1 developed significantly fewer DMBA/TPA-induced benign and malignant tumors compared with wild-type mice, suggesting that Meis1 plays a role in both tumor development and malignant progression. This is consistent with the observation that Meis1 expression increases as tumors progress from benign papillomas to malignant carcinomas. Interestingly, we found that Meis1 localization was altered to neoplasia development. Instead of being localized to the stem cell region, Meis1 is localized to more differentiated cells in tumor tissues.

The ability to accurately predict NF would permit initiation of antimicrobials earlier in the course of infection with the goal of decreasing morbid complications and progression to septic shock and death. Changes in the blood level of inflammatory biomarkers may precede the occurrence of NF. To identify potential biomarkers for the prediction of NF, we performed serial measurements of nine biomarkers [C-reactive protein (CRP), protein C, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1] using a multiplex ELISA array platform every 6-8 hours in patients undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies. We found that the blood levels of IL-6 and CRP increased significantly 24 to 48 hours prior to the onset of fever. In addition, we showed that frequent biomarker monitoring is feasible using a bedside micro sample test device. The results of this pilot study suggest that serial monitoring of IL-6 and CRP levels using a bedside device may be useful in the prediction of NF.

This study investigated the efficacy of ABT-263 against a panel of patient-derived pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) xenografts and utilized cell and molecular approaches to identify biomarkers that predict in vivo ABT-263 sensitivity. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The in vivo efficacy of ABT-263 was tested against a panel of 31 patient-derived ALL xenografts composed of MLL-, BCP-, and T-ALL subtypes. Basal gene expression profiles of ALL xenografts were analyzed and confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR, protein expression and BH3 profiling. An in vitro coculture assay with immortalized human mesenchymal cells was utilized to build a predictive model of in vivo ABT-263 sensitivity. RESULTS: ABT-263 demonstrated impressive activity against pediatric ALL xenografts, with 19 of 31 achieving objective responses. Among BCL2 family members, in vivo ABT-263 sensitivity correlated best with low MCL1 mRNA expression levels. BH3 profiling revealed that resistance to ABT-263 correlated with mitochondrial priming by NOXA peptide, suggesting a functional role for MCL1 protein. Using an in vitro coculture assay, a predictive model of in vivo ABT-263 sensitivity was built. Testing this model against 11 xenografts predicted in vivo ABT-263 responses with high sensitivity (50%) and specificity (100%).

Our objective was to assess both the feasibility and the efficacy of PSZ prophylaxis in clinical practice. From March 2010 to September 2010, all patients admitted to our unit for chemotherapy for acute leukemia or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation received optimized PSZ prophylaxis 200 mg four times daily with cola soda. PSZ trough concentrations (Cmin) were monitored at days 5, 7, 14, and 21. The incidence of IFDs was determined and compared to that of a historical control group. Thirty-five consecutive patients were prospectively included. PSZ prophylaxis was interrupted for 29% of them at day 14 and 51% of them at day 21. The main limitations were impracticality of oral feeding (29%) and occurrence of suspected IFDs (23%). PSZ median Cmin were 0.47, 0.40, 0.24, 0.36 mug/mL at days 5, 7, 14, and 21, respectively. Eighty percent of patient results were lower than the target Cmin of 0.5 mug/ml on day 14, the higher-risk period associated with neutropenia. Four probable breakthrough IFDs (11%) were diagnosed in 2010; no clear association between PSZ Cmin and occurrence of infection was observed. The incidence of IFDs was unchanged (historical control group: 9.7%; P = 0.72). Implementation of systematic PSZ prophylaxis did not significantly decrease the incidence of IFDs at our center. PSZ interruptions related to mucositis and too low Cmin were the main limitations to its use.","['(c) The Author 2014.

The relative rarity of these tumors is a major obstacle to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to tumor aggressiveness and drug resistance, and consequently to the development of novel therapies. By simultaneously activating Kras and deleting p53 (Trp53) in thyroid follicular cells, we have generated a novel mouse model that develops papillary thyroid cancer invariably progressing to PDTC. In several cases, tumors further progress to anaplastic carcinomas. The poorly differentiated tumors are morphologically and functionally similar to their human counterparts and depend on MEK/ERK signaling for proliferation. Using primary carcinomas as well as carcinoma-derived cell lines, we also demonstrate that these tumors are intrinsically resistant to apoptosis due to high levels of expression of the Bcl2 family members, Bcl2a1 (Bcl2a1a) and Mcl1, and can be effectively targeted by Obatoclax, a small-molecule pan-inhibitor of the Bcl2 family. Furthermore, we show that Bcl2 family inhibition synergizes with MEK inhibition as well as with doxorubicin in inducing cell death. Thus, our studies in a novel, relevant mouse model have uncovered a promising druggable feature of aggressive thyroid cancers.",['(c) 2014 Society for Endocrinology.'],"['Champa, Devora', 'Russo, Marika A', 'Liao, Xiao-Hui', 'Refetoff, Samuel', 'Ghossein, Ronald A', 'Di Cristofano, Antonio']","['Champa D', 'Russo MA', 'Liao XH', 'Refetoff S', 'Ghossein RA', 'Di Cristofano A']","['Department of Developmental and Molecular BiologyAlbert Einstein College of Medicine, Price Center for Genetic and Translational Medicine, 1301 Morris Park Avenue, Room 302, Bronx, New York 10461, USADepartments of MedicinePediatrics and Committee on GeneticsUniversity of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USADepartment of PathologyMemorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Developmental and Molecular BiologyAlbert Einstein College of Medicine, Price Center for Genetic and Translational Medicine, 1301 Morris Park Avenue, Room 302, Bronx, New York 10461, USADepartments of MedicinePediatrics and Committee on GeneticsUniversity of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USADepartment of PathologyMemorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Developmental and Molecular BiologyAlbert Einstein College of Medicine, Price Center for Genetic and Translational Medicine, 1301 Morris Park Avenue, Room 302, Bronx, New York 10461, USADepartments of MedicinePediatrics and Committee on GeneticsUniversity of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USADepartment of PathologyMemorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Developmental and Molecular BiologyAlbert Einstein College of Medicine, Price Center for Genetic and Translational Medicine, 1301 Morris Park Avenue, Room 302, Bronx, New York 10461, USADepartments of MedicinePediatrics and Committee on GeneticsUniversity of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USADepartment of PathologyMemorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA Department of Developmental and Molecular BiologyAlbert Einstein College of Medicine, Price Center for Genetic and Translational Medicine, 1301 Morris Park Avenue, Room 302, Bronx, New York 10461, USADepartments of MedicinePediatrics and Committee on GeneticsUniversity of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USADepartment of PathologyMemorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Developmental and Molecular BiologyAlbert Einstein College of Medicine, Price Center for Genetic and Translational Medicine, 1301 Morris Park Avenue, Room 302, Bronx, New York 10461, USADepartments of MedicinePediatrics and Committee on GeneticsUniversity of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USADepartment of PathologyMemorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Developmental and Molecular BiologyAlbert Einstein College of Medicine, Price Center for Genetic and Translational Medicine, 1301 Morris Park Avenue, Room 302, Bronx, New York 10461, USADepartments of MedicinePediatrics and Committee on GeneticsUniversity of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USADepartment of PathologyMemorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA antonio.dicristofano@einstein.yu.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140710,England,Endocr Relat Cancer,Endocrine-related cancer,9436481,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2-related protein A1)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 2)', 'QN4128B52A (obatoclax)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Indoles', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1/antagonists & inhibitors', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['cell death', 'mouse model', 'thyroid cancer']",2014/07/12 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2014/07/12 06:00'],"['2014/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['ERC-14-0268 [pii]', '10.1530/ERC-14-0268 [doi]']",ppublish,Endocr Relat Cancer. 2014 Oct;21(5):755-67. doi: 10.1530/ERC-14-0268.

Hence, this study aimed to study the spheroid cells from VX2 rabbit buccal squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and assess their CSC characteristics. Five adult male New Zealand white outbred rabbits were used to generate VX2 rabbit buccal SCC. Sphere-forming cell culture was performed for the VX2 rabbit buccal SCC specimens. The self-renewal capability; cluster of designation (CD) 44, CD133, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1), B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (Bmi-1), Nestin, octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4) and reduced expression protein-1 (Rex-1) expression with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); chemoresistance to cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil; and in vivo tumorigenicity of spheroid cell transplantation in nude mice were evaluated to determine the CSC characteristics of the resulting spheroid cells. We successfully obtained spheroid cells from the VX2 rabbit OSCC tissues. The spheroid cells exhibited CSC traits, including the expression of CSC and stem cell markers (CD44, Bmi-1, Nestin, Oct4 and Rex-1), capacity to generate new spheroid colonies within 1 week of reseeding from single-dissociated spheroid cells, chemoresistance capacity and generation of tumour xenografts (with histological features resembling those of the original VX2 rabbit buccal SCC) from the transplantation of 10(3) undifferentiated spheroid cells into nude mice.

Based on our hypothesis that this clinical resistance to ondansetron is associated with ABCB1 genetic polymorphisms, we investigated whether ABCB1 gene variations affect the efficacy of ondansetron in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. METHODS: AML patients (n = 215) treated for 3 days with high-dose cytarabine were enrolled in this study. Thirty minutes before the beginning of chemotherapy, 8 mg ondansetron was administered intravenously, followed by 24 mg by continuous infusion and 8 mg intravenously, once per day, until 2 days after chemotherapy. Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting occurrence in the acute and delayed phases was calculated. ABCB1 and CYP2D6 polymorphisms were analyzed by allele-specific matrix-assisted laser desorption. Basic clinical characteristics of the AML patients were collected from medical records. FINDINGS: No differences in genotype distribution frequencies of ABCB1 polymorphisms and haplotypes were observed in patients with different CYP2D6-predicted phenotypes. During the acute phase, patients with the CG haplotype (C3435T and G2677T) were associated with a high risk of grade 3/4 nausea and vomiting (P = 0.003 and P = 0.026, respectively). After adjustment for age, sex, smoking status, alcohol drinking status, body surface area, body mass index, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-Performance Status, multivariate survival analysis implicated the CG haplotype as a predictive marker of the risk of grade 3/4 chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in AML patients (P = 0.003 and P = 0.039, respectively). In addition, a significant association between the 3435CC genotype and grade 3/4 vomiting in AML patients was observed (P = 0.016). However, no association between these ABCB1 gene polymorphisms and ondansetron efficacy was found in the delayed phase. IMPLICATIONS: These findings suggest that ABCB1 gene polymorphisms are associated with antiemetic efficacy of ondansetron in the acute phase after high-dose cytarabine chemotherapy in AML patients.","['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

Successful implantation relies on the dynamic interplay of estrogen and progesterone, but the key mediators underlying embryo implantation are not fully understood. Here we show that transcription factor early growth response 1 (Egr1) is regulated by estrogen as a downstream target through leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway in mouse uterus. Egr1 is localized in the subluminal stromal cells surrounding the implanting embryo on day 5 of pregnancy. Estrogen rapidly, markedly, and transiently enhances Egr1 expression in uterine stromal cells, which fails in estrogen receptor alpha knock-out mouse uteri. STAT3 is phosphorylated by LIF and subsequently recruited on Egr1 promoter to induce its expression. Our results of Egr1 expression under induced decidualization in vivo and in vitro show that Egr1 is rapidly induced after deciduogenic stimulus. Egr1 knockdown can inhibit in vitro decidualization of cultured uterine stromal cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation data show that Egr1 is recruited to the promoter of wingless-related murine mammary tumor virus integration site 4 (Wnt4). Collectively, our study presents for the first time that estrogen regulates Egr1 expression through LIF-STAT3 signaling pathway in mouse uterus, and Egr1 functions as a critical mediator of stromal cell decidualization by regulating Wnt4.","['(c) 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Liang, Xiao-Huan', 'Deng, Wen-Bo', 'Li, Ming', 'Zhao, Zhen-Ao', 'Wang, Tong-Song', 'Feng, Xu-Hui', 'Cao, Yu-Jing', 'Duan, En-Kui', 'Yang, Zeng-Ming']","['Liang XH', 'Deng WB', 'Li M', 'Zhao ZA', 'Wang TS', 'Feng XH', 'Cao YJ', 'Duan EK', 'Yang ZM']","['From the College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.', 'From the College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.', 'College of Life Science, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361005, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Biology, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Science, Beijing 100101, China, and.', 'Department of Biology, Shantou University, Shantou 515063, China.', 'College of Life Science, Xiamen University, Xiamen 361005, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Biology, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Science, Beijing 100101, China, and.', 'State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Biology, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Science, Beijing 100101, China, and.', 'From the College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China, zmyang@scau.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140710,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Egr1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Estrogens)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Wnt4 Protein)', '0 (Wnt4 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA Primers', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1/genetics/*metabolism', '*Embryo Implantation', 'Estrogens/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Wnt4 Protein/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Early Growth Response Protein 1 (Egr1)', 'Embryo Implantation, Uterus, Decidualization', 'Estrogen', 'Mouse', 'STAT3', 'Transcription Factor']",2014/07/12 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2014/07/12 06:00'],"['2014/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)32030-5 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.588897 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2014 Aug 22;289(34):23534-45. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.588897.

In this study, we established and described the biological characteristics of a rare atypical chronic myeloid (aCML) leukemia cell line (NT-1). Mononuclear cells were isolated from the bone marrow of a patient with atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (Ph(-)/bcr(-)/abl(-)), and were passaged by liquid culture. Cells were maintained without any cytokines for over 1 year, and named NT-1. This cell line was extensively characterized using morphological assays, flow cytometry, cytogenetic analysis, clonogenic culture, quantitative fluorescent PCR, short tandem repeating sequence PCR (STR-PCR) and array-CGH. Its tumorigenic capacity was also examined in nude mice. The NT-1 cell line had morphological features of chronic myeloid leukemia and major myeloid markers (CD13, CD33, CD11b). Additionally, NT-1 expressed progenitor cells and natural killer cell-related antigens such as CD34, CD117, CD56. Cytogenetic analysis initially demonstrated two abnormalities: 47, xx, +8 and 47, xx, +8 accompanied by t(5;12)(q31;p13) translocation. The one-year passage process did not alter the karyotype. NT-1 cells maintained the same morphology, immunophenotyping and cytogenetic features as primary leukemia cells, which was strongly supported by STR-PCR results. Neither Epstein-Barr virus nor mycoplasma was detected in the NT-1 line. In addition, NT-1 cells showed high tumorigenic capacity in nude mice. NT-1 is a new atypical chronic myeloid leukemia cell line with the +8 and t(5,12) translocation, and exhibits high tumorigenicity in nude mice.

Furthermore, the potential for adverse events with longer-term therapy may result in dose adjustments, treatment discontinuation, or nonadherence, all of which may negatively affect treatment efficacy and QoL. However, instruments to specifically measure the impact of symptom burden and treatment on health-related QoL in patients with CML have not been widely available until recently. The FACT-Leu is a validated tool that measures leukemia-specific and more general QoL concerns. Other tools specific to CML, including the MDASI-CML and the EORTC QLQ-CML24, are undergoing validation. Here, we describe TKI therapy-related symptom burden and its effect on adherence and treatment response, outline instruments to measure symptom burden and QoL in CML, and summarize the available clinical data on QoL of patients on TKI therapy. QoL is an aspect of CML disease management that will continue to gain prominence in the coming years. We believe that the instruments developed now will have a role in informing treatment decisions in routine practice and allowing clinicians to proactively address issues related to symptom burden and QoL.","['(c) 2014 S.

METHODS: FISH and CCA were performed in 100 patients who were diagnosed with MDS by conventional detection of bone marrow smear and bone marrow biopsy, and were followed up. RESULTS: Forty-eight (48%) patients showed chromosomal abnormalities. The positive rate of -5/5q-, 20q-, +8, -7/7q-, and -Y was 16%, 15%, 12%, 11%, and 5%, respectively, and that of CCA was 11%. The positive rate of molecular genetics abnormalities detected by FISH was obviously higher than that of CCA (P<0.01) and the combination of FISH and CCA increased the detection rate to 49%. The follow-up showed that the prognosis of patients with normal FISH results was significantly better than the abnormal ones. A correlation between complex karyotypes and poor prognosis was observed. Abnormality of -7/7q- was found closely correlated with the higher risk of acute leukemia and death. CONCLUSION: Chromosomal abnormalities have been found in 49 MDS patients. Common chromosomal abnormalities in MDS patients include -5/5q-, 20q-, +8 and -7/7q-. FISH combined with CCA can improve the detection rate of chromosomal aberrations in MDS. FISH is more sensitive than CCA for detection and can be used as an important basis for prognostic assessment for MDS.",,"['Cao, Pengfei', 'Li, Yuan', 'Li, Xiaolin', 'Zhang, Guoping', 'Chen, Fangping']","['Cao P', 'Li Y', 'Li X', 'Zhang G', 'Chen F']","['Department of Hematology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410008; Cancer Research Institute, Central South University, Changsha 410078,China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

QoL is impaired during maintenance treatment, but little is known about QoL during induction therapy. Identification of patients with poor QoL during induction will provide opportunities for early interventions, and may subsequently improve future QoL. This national multi-center study aimed to assess QoL and its determinants during ALL induction treatment. METHODS: Proxy reports of the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ) and the PedsQL cancer version were collected. Child, treatment, and parental characteristics were analyzed as potential determinants in a multiple regression model. RESULTS: One hundred thirty parents of children participated (response rate 82 %), median child age was 5.7 years and 48 % were female. QoL, as measured with the CHQ, was significantly lower than the norm, the effect sizes were large, and the differences were clinically relevant. Physical QoL was more often affected than psychosocial QoL. Regression models could be constructed for 4/ 10 CHQ scales and 6/ 8 PedsQL cancer scales, accounting for 7 to 36 % of the variance in scores. Impaired QoL was most often associated with older children, girls, and time since diagnosis. Also, father respondents seem to have a lower QoL perception compared to mother respondents although this needs to be confirmed in future research.

METHODS: The ESTELLE study included 747 cases of CL [636 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 100 of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML)] diagnosed in France in 2010-2011 and 1,421 population controls frequency-matched with the cases on age and gender. Data were obtained from structured telephone questionnaires administered to mothers. The odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals were estimated using unconditional regression models adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: CL was not associated with difficulty in becoming pregnant [OR 0.9 (0.7-1.2)], in vitro fertilisation [OR 0.6 (0.3-1.5)] or the use of any fertility treatment [OR 0.8 (0.5-1.1)] for the index pregnancy. CL was not significantly associated with becoming pregnant on contraception [OR 1.2 (0.8-1.8)], but a positive association was observed for third generation oral contraception [OR 4.3 (1.2-16.2)]; however, the result is based on small numbers. Folic acid supplementation during pregnancy was not associated with CL, but an inverse borderline association was observed for supplementation initiated in the 3 months preceding pregnancy [OR 0.7 (0.5-1.0)]. In addition, maternal histories of stillbirth and miscarriage were associated with ALL [OR 2.6 (1.1-5.9)] and AML [OR 1.8 (1.1-2.8)], respectively.

Leukemia is a type of malignant hematopoietic tumor in hematopoietic stem cells. There have been no relevant reports about ASP's effect in regulating the aging of leukemia cells. In this study, human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) KG1alpha cell lines in logarithmic growth phase were taken as the study object, and were divided into the ASP group, the cytarabine (Ara-C) group, the ASP + Ara-C group and the control group. The groups were respectively treated with different concentration of ASP, Ara-C and ASP + Ara-C for different periods, with the aim to study the effect of ASP combined with Ara-C in regulating the aging of human acute myeloid leukemia KG1alpha cell lines and its relevant mechanism. The results showed that ASP, Ara-C and ASP + Ara-C could obviously inhibit KG1alpha cell proliferation in vitro, block the cells in G0/G1 phase. The cells showed the aging morphological feature. The percentage of positive stained aging cells was dramatically increased, and could significantly up-regulate the expression of aging-related proteins P16 and RB, which were more obvious in the ASP + Ara-C group. In conclusion, the aging mechanism of KG1alpha cell induced by ASP and Ara-C may be related to the regulation of the expression of aging-related proteins, suggesting that the combined administration of ASP and anticancer drugs plays a better role in the treatment of leukemia .",,"['Xu, Chun-Yan', 'Geng, Shan', 'Liu, Jun', 'Zhu, Jia-Hong', 'Zhang, Xian-Ping', 'Jiang, Rong', 'Wang, Ya-Ping']","['Xu CY', 'Geng S', 'Liu J', 'Zhu JH', 'Zhang XP', 'Jiang R', 'Wang YP']",,['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi,Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica,8913656,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)']",IM,"['Aging/*drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Angelica sinensis/*chemistry', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Polysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2014/07/12 06:00,2014/07/30 06:00,['2014/07/12 06:00'],"['2014/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi. 2014 Apr;39(7):1260-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The overall survival was 91.7% at 1 year, 86.9% at 2 years and 81.6% at 5 years. Relative survival did not differ from overall survival even for infants. Survival was lower among infants for lymphoblastic leukaemia and astrocytoma, but higher for neuroblastoma.

Methylation of the DNA leads to the repression of gene expression, while histone modification can result in both activation and inhibition of the transcription depending on the type and site of modification. These mechanisms are confirmed to have important pathogenetic role during the process of leukemogenesis. In distinct subtypes of leukemia specific alterations of the DNA methylation profile, histone code and typical changes of the microRNA expression levels have been observed. The importance of them is inhered in their promising potential clinical applications. In order to achieve further improvement in the therapeutic results of leukemia, prognostic classification has to be further improved. With the help of the epigenetic alterations, subgroups could be differentiated within the known prognostic groups. Changes in the DNA methylation pattern, histone code and microRNA expression levels correlate with the success of the treatment in many cases, moreover they could provide help to predict chemoresistance or detect the minimal residual disease following chemotherapy.

Single-cell mutation profiling strongly supported the clonal architecture implied by the analysis of bulk material. In addition, it resolved the clonal assignment of single nucleotide variants that had been initially ambiguous and identified areas of previously unappreciated complexity. Accordingly, we find that many of the key assumptions underlying the analysis of tumor clonality by deep sequencing of unfractionated material are valid.

The devastating spread of the virus in young women in these countries appears disproportional to overall risk of infection. Regions with high prevalence of HIV-1 are often also highly endemic for other pathogenic viruses including HSV, CMV and HTLV. We propose that acquisition by HIV-1 of the envelope glycoproteins of other viruses, in a process we call ""natural pseudotyping,"" expands the cellular tropism of HIV-1, enabling it to infect female genital epithelial cells directly and thereby dramatically increasing risk of infection during sexual intercourse. In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate that when HIV-1 co-infects T cells along with the gammaretrovirus xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV), progeny HIV-1 particles are produced capable of infecting primary vaginal, ectocervical and endocervical epithelial cells. These cell types are normally resistant to HIV-1 infection. Infection of primary genital cells was neutralized by antisera against the XMRV glycoprotein, confirming that infection was mediated by the XMRV glycoprotein acquired through pseudotyping of HIV. Inhibition by AZT showed that active replication of HIV-1 occurred in these cells and ruled out non-specific endocytic uptake of the virus. These results demonstrate that natural pseudotyping can expand the tropism of HIV-1 to include genital epithelial cells and have potential implications for sexual transmission of the virus.",,"['Tang, Yuyang', 'George, Alvin', 'Nouvet, Franklin', 'Sweet, Stephanie', 'Emeagwali, Nkiruka', 'Taylor, Harry E', 'Simmons, Glenn', 'Hildreth, James E K']","['Tang Y', 'George A', 'Nouvet F', 'Sweet S', 'Emeagwali N', 'Taylor HE', 'Simmons G', 'Hildreth JE']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, College of Biological Sciences, University of California Davis, Davis, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, College of Biological Sciences, University of California Davis, Davis, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, College of Biological Sciences, University of California Davis, Davis, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of California Davis, Davis, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Center for AIDS Health Disparities Research, Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Center for AIDS Health Disparities Research, Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Center for AIDS Health Disparities Research, Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, College of Biological Sciences, University of California Davis, Davis, California, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140710,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Neutralizing/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/virology', 'Cell Line', 'Cervix Uteri/*cytology', '*Coitus', 'Epithelial Cells/*virology', 'Female', 'HIV Infections/*transmission', 'HIV-1/immunology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Vagina/*cytology', 'Viral Tropism', 'Virus Replication', 'Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/physiology']",,,2014/07/11 06:00,2015/03/04 06:00,['2014/07/11 06:00'],"['2014/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0101367 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-06140 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jul 10;9(7):e101367. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0101367. eCollection 2014.,,,"['U54 CA163066/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA163069/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA163072/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '8DP1HD075625/DP/NCCDPHP CDC HHS/United States']",PMC4092063,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, polymer-based vectors are more robust and allow cell- and tissue-specific deliveries via conjugation of ligands, but are comparatively inefficient. The design of hybrid gene delivery agents comprising both virally derived and synthetic materials (nanobiovectors) represents a promising approach to development of safe and efficient gene therapy vectors. Non-infectious murine leukemia virus-like particles (M-VLPs) were electrostatically complexed with chitosan (chi) to replace the function of the viral envelope protein. At optimal fabrication conditions and compositions, ranging from 6 to 9mug chitosan/10(9) M-VLPs at 10x10(9)M-VLPs/ml to 40mug chitosan/10(9) M-VLPs at 2.5x10(9)M-VLPs/ml, chi/M-VLPs were ~300-350nm in diameter and exhibited efficient transfection similar to amphotropic MLV vectors. In addition, these nanobiovectors were non-cytotoxic and provided sustained transgene expression for at least three weeks in vitro.

Therefore, the present study questioned whether APCs may be abnormal in the peripheral blood (PB) of acute leukemia (AL) patients, particularly the levels of CD1d. To improve the understanding of the role of CD1d on APCs, the levels of CD1d on monocytes were analyzed in healthy controls, AL patients and AL patients with complete remission (CR). In addition, the correlation between the number of CD3(+)CD56(+) T lymphocytes and levels of CD1d on monocytes was analyzed. Flow cytometry was used to determine the levels of CD1d on monocytes and lymphocytes. A significant decrease was observed in the levels of CD1d on monocytes in the PB of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients compared with the healthy controls. Simultaneously, significantly different levels of CD1d on monocytes were identified between the CR-AML and the CR-ALL patients; the levels of CD1d on monocytes remained low in the CR-AML patients, while the levels of CD1d on monocytes recovered in the CR-ALL patients. A significantly negative correlation was observed between the number of CD3(+)CD56(+) T lymphocytes and the levels of CD1d on monocytes in AL patients.

Previous findings have suggested that POGLUT1 promotes the proliferation of U937 human tissue lymphoma cells. Furthermore, POGLUT1 has been identified in other tissues, including the mammary glands, lymph nodes, intestine, liver and spleen. In the present study, in order to investigate the function and target of POGLUT1 in BT474 breast cancer cells, the effect of POGLUT1 on cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and key proteins in the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 signaling pathway was investigated in BT474 cells. The overexpression of POGLUT1 in the presence of TGF-beta1 was found to significantly enhance cell viability. Flow cytometric and quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed that POGLUT1 had an effect on the cell cycle and inhibited the TGF-beta1-induced transcriptional upregulation of p16, a major cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI). Furthermore, phosphorylated (p)-Smad3, which has a key role in mediating the TGF-beta antiproliferative response, was greatly inhibited by exogenous POGLUT1, suggesting a role for POGLUT1 in the TGF-beta1-mediated signaling pathway in the BT474 cell cycle. However, no significant changes were observed in the expression of other CDKIs or in cell apoptosis. The findings of the present study show that the increase in BT474 cell viabilty induced by POGLUT1 is associated with POGLUT1-induced inhibition of the transcriptional upregulation of p16 by TGF-beta1, which may be a result of the inhibition of p-Smad3.",,"['Jin, Gang', 'Cao, Zhigang', 'Sun, Xilin', 'Wang, Kai', 'Huang, Tao', 'Shen, Baozhong']","['Jin G', 'Cao Z', 'Sun X', 'Wang K', 'Huang T', 'Shen B']","[""Department of Medical Imaging, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang 150001, P.R.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the immune mechanism underlying the effect of interferon (IFN)-gamma on GVT following allogeneic HSCT in breast cancer therapy. An in situ breast cancer mouse model was established by injecting 5x10(4) 4T1 cells into the mammary fat pads of BALB/c mice. The 4T1 cells were transfected with the firefly luciferase reporter gene in order to monitor the tumor progression in real time. An allogeneic HSCT model was then established by transplanting bone marrow mononuclear cells from C57BL/6 mice to the BALB/c mice. To investigate the influence of T lymphocyte proliferation following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, the levels of CD3(+)CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells were determined. In addition, IFN-gamma and granzyme B expression levels in splenic lymphocytes were analyzed using flow cytometry. Allogeneic HSCT was found to significantly promote the proliferation and cytotoxicity of CTLs and suppress the growth of breast cancer. Furthermore, the secretory levels of IFN-gamma and granzyme B by T cells were elevated following allogeneic HSCT. These results indicated that alloreactive T cells increased the secretion of IFN-gamma, which promoted the alloresponse of donor CTLs.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on the clinical data of 37 pediatric patients with hematologic malignancies that consisted of 14 cases of acute lymphocyte leukemia, 9 cases of acute myeloid leukemia, 5 cases of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, 3 cases of chronic myeloid leukemia, 2 cases of acute mixed leukemia, 3 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome, and 1 case of lymphosarcomatous leukemia. Thirty-seven children with hematologic malignancies received UCBT from unrelated donors (34 cases) and related donors (3 cases). Grafts were 6/6 HLA-matched in 5 cases, 5/6 HLA-matched in 12 cases, 4/6 HLA-matched in 11 cases, and 3/6 HLA-matched in 9 cases. Before transplantation, these patients received rabbit antithymocyte globulin-containing conditioning regimen. The myeloablative conditioning regimen was given in 36 cases and the reduced-intensity conditioning regimen in one case. The median age of transplantation was 5.7 years, and the median weight was 20 kg. The grafts that contained a median of 6.2x10(7) total nucleated cells (TNC)/kg and 2.7x10(5) CD34(+) cells/kg were infused. RESULTS: The median times to neutrophil engraftment and platelet engraftment were 12 days and 25 days, respectively, and the rates of neutrophil engraftment and platelet engraftment were 95% and 78%, respectively. The rate of neutrophil engraftment was positively correlated with the number of CD34(+) cells (P=0.011), while the rate of platelet engraftment was correlated with the numbers of CD34(+) cells and TNC (P=0.001; P=0.014). The incidence rates of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease were 49% and 11%, respectively. The median follow-up was 54 months. The 5-year transplant-related mortality, overall survival, and disease-free survival were 27%, 57.4% and 41%, respectively.

This study investigated neurologic morbidity and its effect on quality of life in long-term survivors of childhood ALL. METHODS: Prospective, single institution, cross-sectional, institutional review board-approved study of long-term ALL survivors. Participants were recruited from institutional clinics. Participants answered an investigator-administered questionnaire followed by evaluation by a neurologist. Quality of life (QOL) was also assessed. RESULTS: Of the 162 participants recruited over a 3-year period, 83.3% reported at least one neurologic symptom of interest, 16.7% had single symptom, 11.1% had two symptoms, and 55.6% had three or more symptoms. Symptoms were mild and disability was low in the majority of participants with neurologic symptoms. Median age at ALL diagnosis was 3.9 years (0.4-18.6), median age at study enrollment was 15.7 years (6.9-28.9), and median time from completion of ALL therapy was 7.4 years (1.9-20.3). On multivariable analyses, female sex correlated with presence of dizziness, urinary incontinence, constipation, and neuropathy; use of >/=10 doses of triple intrathecal chemotherapy correlated with urinary incontinence, back pain, and neuropathy; cranial radiation with ataxia; history of ALL relapse with fatigue; and CNS leukemia at diagnosis with seizures. Decline in mental QOL was associated with migraine and tension type headaches, while physical QOL was impaired by presence of dizziness and falls. Overall, good QOL and physical function was maintained by a majority of participants. CONCLUSIONS: Neurologic symptoms were present in 83% long-term ALL survivors. Symptoms related morbidity and QOL impairment is low in majority of survivors. Female sex, >/=10 doses of intrathecal chemotherapy, and history of ALL relapse predispose to impaired QOL. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: This study will educate survivors and their care providers regarding cancer or treatment-related neurologic symptoms and morbidity.

However, randomised trials in which it was combined with standard induction chemotherapy in adults have produced conflicting results. We did a meta-analysis of individual patient data to assess the efficacy of adding gemtuzumab ozogamicin to induction chemotherapy in adult patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. METHODS: We searched PubMed for reports of randomised controlled trials published in any language up to May 1, 2013, that included an assessment of gemtuzumab ozogamicin given to adults (aged 15 years and older) in conjunction with the first course of intensive induction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia (excluding acute promyelocytic leukaemia) compared with chemotherapy alone. Published data were supplemented with additional data obtained by contacting individual trialists. The primary endpoint of interest was overall survival. We used standard meta-analytic techniques, with an assumption-free (or fixed-effect) method. We also did exploratory stratified analyses to investigate whether any baseline features predicted a greater or lesser benefit from gemtuzumab ozogamicin. FINDINGS: We obtained data from five randomised controlled trials (3325 patients); all trials were centrally randomised and open label, with overall survival as the primary endpoint. The addition of gemtuzumab ozogamicin did not increase the proportion of patients achieving complete remission with or without complete peripheral count recovery (odds ratio [OR] 0.91, 95% CI 0.77-1.07; p=0.3). However, the addition of gemtuzumab ozogamicin significantly reduced the risk of relapse (OR 0.81, 0.73-0.90; p=0.0001), and improved overall survival at 5 years (OR 0.90, 0.82-0.98; p=0.01). At 6 years, the absolute survival benefit was especially apparent in patients with favourable cytogenetic characteristics (20.7%; OR 0.47, 0.31-0.73; p=0.0006), but was also seen in those with intermediate characteristics (5.7%; OR 0.84, 0.75-0.95; p=0.005). Patients with adverse cytogenetic characteristics did not benefit (2.2%; OR 0.99, 0.83-1.18; p=0.9). Doses of 3 mg/m(2) were associated with fewer early deaths than doses of 6 mg/m(2), with equal efficacy. INTERPRETATION: Gemtuzumab ozogamicin can be safely added to conventional induction therapy and provides a significant survival benefit for patients without adverse cytogenetic characteristics. These data suggest that the use of gemtuzumab ozogamicin should be reassessed and its licence status might need to be reviewed. FUNDING: None.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to investigate the profile of 11q23 abnormalities in adult Chinese patients with hematological malignancies. In this study, 11q23 abnormalities were detected by cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) approaches in 77 out of a total of 2,404 adult Chinese patients with leukemia, lymphoma, and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). 11q23 abnormalities were found in 5.31 % of the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases, 5.71 % of the acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) cases, 2.94 % of lymphoma cases, and 1.24 % of MDS cases. Of the patients with 11q23 abnormalities, 59.74 % showed rearrangement or deletion of the MLL gene by FISH; a novel 11q23 rearrangement, der(6)t(6;11)(q23;q23), was discovered in one case. Our data showed that t(11;19)(q23;p13.1) was the most frequent translocation in AML patients and t(4;11)(q21;q23) was the most frequent translocation in ALL patients. FLT-ITD mutations were detected in three out of 33 AML patients with 11q23 abnormalities (9.09 %). The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis further showed that the 11q23 aberration was a poor prognostic factor for AML. The median survival times in the 11q23 aberration subgroup, the normal karyotype subgroup, and the subgroup with other abnormalities were 7.4, 11.3, and 16.8 months, respectively (P = 0.0464).

METHODS: Ninety patients with ALL were studied in three stages, including newly diagnosed patients, patients on maintenance therapy, and 1 to 12 months after cessation of therapy. Baseline antibody titers were assessed in all participants. Postimmunization antibody titers to DTP/Td and MMR vaccines were evaluated 3 weeks after vaccination. RESULTS: Patients on maintenance therapy had considerable decreased in seropositivity rate; they achieved seroconversion rate of 100% for diphtheria and tetanus and of 71.4% for pertussis following DTP/Td vaccination. In patients after one month off therapy, the seroconversion rates for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis were 71.4%, 80%, and 100%, respectively. The amounts of seroconversion in patients after 3 months off therapy were 66.5%, 80%, and 66.5% for measles, mumps, and rubella, respectively.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 127 Lebanese acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients, of whom 117 were treated following the St Jude's Children Research Hospital protocol. Genotyping was performed using real-time PCR or restriction fragment length polymorphism. MTX levels were measured using a polarization fluorescence assay from Roche. MTX clearance was estimated on the basis of all available MTX levels measured after high-dose MTX treatment during the consolidation phase. RESULTS: Five variants in four genes (MTHFR, ABCB1, ABCC2, and TYMS) were shown to be associated with toxicity, but neither was associated with MTX pharmacokinetic parameters. For instance, during the consolidation phase, a statistically significant association was found between MTHFR rs1801133 variant allele carriers and a decrease in hemoglobin levels [odds ratio (OR)=3.057; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.217; 7.680]. In addition, a statistically significant association was found among neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count<500) and variant allele carriers of ABCB1 rs1045642 (OR=5.174; 95% CI: 1.674; 15.989) and ABCB1 rs1128503 (OR=3.364; 95% CI: 1.257; 9.004), respectively. ABCC2 rs717620 variant allele carriers needed significantly more time to reach a MTX level below 0.1 micromol/l (beta=5.122; 95% CI: 1.412; 8.831). During the continuation phase, a statistically significant association was found between ABCC2 rs717620 and TYMS 28-bp tandem repeats carriers with the need to decrease weekly MTX doses (beta=-4.905; 95% CI: -9; -0.809 and beta=-5.770; 95% CI: -10.138; -1.403), respectively. CONCLUSION: Genotyping for MTHFR, ABCB1, ABCC2, and TYMS polymorphisms may be useful in identifying patients at risk of increased MTX toxicity and the need for dose optimization before treatment initiation.",,"['Zgheib, Nathalie K', 'Akra-Ismail, Maya', 'Aridi, Carol', 'Mahfouz, Rami', 'Abboud, Miguel R', 'Solh, Hassan', 'Muwakkit, Samar A']","['Zgheib NK', 'Akra-Ismail M', 'Aridi C', 'Mahfouz R', 'Abboud MR', 'Solh H', 'Muwakkit SA']","[""aDepartment of Pharmacology and Toxicology, American University of Beirut bDepartment of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Children's Cancer Center of Lebanon cDepartment of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pharmacogenet Genomics,Pharmacogenetics and genomics,101231005,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ABCC2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Liver-Specific Organic Anion Transporter 1)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 2)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Organic Anion Transporters)', '0 (Reduced Folate Carrier Protein)', '0 (SLC19A1 protein, human)', '0 (SLCO1B1 protein, human)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lebanon', 'Liver-Specific Organic Anion Transporter 1', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/chemistry', 'Methotrexate/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 2', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Organic Anion Transporters/metabolism', 'Pharmacogenetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Reduced Folate Carrier Protein/metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2014/07/10 06:00,2014/09/05 06:00,['2014/07/10 06:00'],"['2014/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/FPC.0000000000000069 [doi]', '01213011-201408000-00002 [pii]']",ppublish,Pharmacogenet Genomics. 2014 Aug;24(8):387-96. doi: 10.1097/FPC.0000000000000069.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little is known about their role in leukemogenesis. The purpose of this study is to analyze the expression pattern of miR-29a/29b and its target genes Mcl-1 (myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) in myeloid leukemia. METHODS: Quantitative real-time PCR was used for detecting genes expression level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 10 cases with newly diagnosed, untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 14 cases with newly diagnosed, untreated chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase, and 14 healthy individual (HI) served as controls. Correlation between the relative expression levels of different genes have been analyzed. RESULTS: Significant lower expression of miR-29a/29b and higher expression level of two potential target genes Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 were found in PBMCs from AML and CML patients compared with HI group. In addtion, miR-29a expression in AML was significantly lower than that in CML. Moreover, negative correlation between miR-29a/29b and its target genes have been found. While, positive correlation between relative expression level of miR-29a and miR-29b or Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 were presented in the total 38 research objects. CONCLUSION: Down-regulated miR-29a and miR-29b, and accompanying up-regulated Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 are the common feature in myeloid leukemias.

Primary thrombocytosis is very rare in children; reactive thrombocytosis is frequently observed in children with infections, anemia, and many other causes. Aims and Objectives. To identify the etiology of thrombocytosis in children and to analyze platelet indices (MPV, PDW, and PCT) in children with thrombocytosis. Study Design. A prospective observational study. Material and Methods. A total of 1000 patients with thrombocytosis (platelet > 400 x 10(9)/L) were studied over a period of 2 years. Platelet distribution width (PDW), mean platelet volume (MPV), and plateletcrit (PCT) were noted. Results. Of 1000 patients, 99.8% had secondary thrombocytosis and only two children had primary thrombocytosis (chronic myeloid leukemia and acute myelogenous leukemia, M7). The majority of the children belonged to the age group of 1month to 2 years (39.7%) and male to female ratio was 1.6 : 1. Infection with anemia (48.3%) was the most common cause of secondary thrombocytosis followed by iron deficiency alone (17.2%) and infection alone (16.2%). Respiratory infection (28.3%) was the predominant infectious cause observed. Thrombocytosis was commonly associated with IDA among all causes of anemia and severity of thrombocytosis increased with severity of anemia (P = 0.021). With increasing platelet count, there was a decrease in MPV (<0.001). Platelet count and mean PDW among children with infection and anemia were significantly higher than those among children with infection alone and anemia alone. None were observed to have thromboembolic manifestations. Conclusions. Primary thrombocytosis is extremely rare in children than secondary thrombocytosis. Infections in association with anemia are most commonly associated with reactive thrombocytosis and severity of thrombocytosis increases with severity of anemia.",,"['Subramaniam, Nathiya', 'Mundkur, Suneel', 'Kini, Pushpa', 'Bhaskaranand, Nalini', 'Aroor, Shrikiran']","['Subramaniam N', 'Mundkur S', 'Kini P', 'Bhaskaranand N', 'Aroor S']","['Department of Paediatrics, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal University, Manipal, Karnataka 576104, India.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal University, Manipal, Karnataka 576104, India.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal University, Manipal, Karnataka 576104, India.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal University, Manipal, Karnataka 576104, India.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal University, Manipal, Karnataka 576104, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140129,Egypt,ISRN Hematol,ISRN hematology,101567023,,,,,,2014/07/10 06:00,2014/07/10 06:01,['2014/07/10 06:00'],"['2013/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2014/389257 [doi]'],epublish,ISRN Hematol. 2014 Jan 29;2014:389257. doi: 10.1155/2014/389257. eCollection 2014.,,,,PMC4004071,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

None of the current therapies has been shown to be universally effective or able to reverse advanced pulmonary vascular disease, characterized by plexiform vascular lesions, or to prevent right ventricular failure in advanced PAH. It is thus unlikely that only one factor, pathway, or gene mutation will explain all forms and cases. Pediatric oncologists recognized a need for intensified, collaborative research within their field more than 40 years ago and implemented major clinical and translational networks worldwide to achieve evidence-based ""tailored therapies."" The similarities in the pathobiology (e.g., increased proliferation and resistance to apoptosis in vascular cells and perivascular inflammation) and the uncertainties in the proper treatment of both cancer and pulmonary hypertension (PH) have led to the idea of building interdisciplinary networks among PH centers to achieve rapid translation of basic research findings, optimal diagnostic algorithms, and significant, sustained treatment results. Such networks leading to patient registries, clinical trials, drug development, and innovative, effective therapies are urgently needed for the care of children with PH. This article reviews the current status, limitations, and recent developments in the field of pediatric PH.

Moreover patients with CNS localization are often asymptomatic, while sometimes show meningeal signs and symptoms or, extremely rarely, signs of cranial nerve impairment. CASE REPORT: Here we report on a patient with refractory AML who suddenly developed strabismus and diplopia. Both neurological and ophtalmologic examinations were suggestive of a bilateral VI cranial nerve palsy. Noteworthy, both a cranial CT and MRI were substantially normal, while a rachicentesis was performed and cerebrospinal fluid examination was clearly suggestive of a meningeal involvement by AML. CONCLUSIONS: This is to our knowledge the first reported case in which the clinical picture of meningeal localization in an AML patient was dominated by an isolated abducens cranial nerve impairment.

Oral lesions are a common complication in these patients affecting oral health status. AIM: This study was conducted to evaluate and assess the oral health status of newly diagnosed leukemic pediatric patients during induction phase and its correlation to outcome of induction therapy. MATERIAL METHODS: Oral examinations was done in 33 children between the age group of 5-15 years with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myloblastic leukemia (AML), who were undergoing chemotherapy. Oral Hygiene Index- Simplified, (OHI-S) decayed missing filled teeth index (def/DMFT), Loe and Sillness index for gingiva, and complete blood count at first and fourth week of induction phase were recorded for each patient. The changes in the oral health status were analyzed with Wilcoxon signed rank test.

AIMS: In this study, we have tried to correlate the presenting features, risk scores and treatment response with the BCR-ABL variants detected in our patients. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A cross-sectional unicentric hospital-based study on 80 patients diagnosed to have CML by bone marrow cytogenetics and confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: RT-PCR for BCR-ABL was performed on consecutive patients with CML attending the CML clinic from January 2010 to December 2010. The medical charts of these patients were analyzed after a follow-up of 18 months in a retrospective manner. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Box plot and histogram was used to see the distribution of variables. t-test was performed to enumerate the difference between risk scores in two populations of patients carrying two different BCR-ABL transcript variants. RESULTS: Nearly 56.25% of patients had b3a2 (e14a2) while 41.25% of patients showed b2a2 (e13a2) transcripts. The rest 2.5% (two patients) expressed the rare e19b2 variant. Patients with b2a2 presented with higher Sokal, Hasford and European Treatment and Outcomes Study score than their b3a2 counterpart. Different parameters such as the platelet count, leukocyte count, hemoglobin and splenomegaly showed a minor difference between the groups.

Shortly thereafter, more potent BCR-ABL inhibitors (dasatinib and nilotinib) were introduced for use in patients resistant to or intolerant of imatinib. All three drugs are now approved for initial therapy for chronic phase CML. Response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment is assessed with standardized quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (Q-RTPCR) and/or cytogenetics at 3, 6 and 12 months. Clinical trials have clearly demonstrated that early and deeper cytogenetic and molecular response to TKI therapy is associated with lower rate of disease progression and improved long-term outcomes. In recent times, molecular response as determined by BCR-ABL transcript levels at defined time points is rapidly gaining popularity as a predictive marker for subsequent outcomes in CML. Optimal response is defined as BCR-ABL transcript levels of </=10% at 3 months, <1% at 6 months, and </=0.1% from 12 months onward while >10% at 6 months and >1% from 12 months onward define failure. Patients who do not achieve molecular milestones at 3 or 6 months with 3 months being highly predictive are less likely to achieve cytogenetic responses eventually; early identification of such patients who have a low probability of achieving an adequate response are thus candidates for alternative treatment.

We determined whether expression of interleukin-15 (IL-15) in a nonsecretory, membrane-bound form could sustain NK cell growth. We linked the human IL15 gene to that encoding CD8alpha transmembrane domain (mbIL15). After retroviral transduction, human NK cells expressed mbIL15 on the cell surface; IL-15 secretion was negligible. Survival of mbIL15-NK cells without interleukin-2 (IL-2) after 7-day culture was vastly superior to that of mock-transduced NK cells (P < .001, n = 15) and of NK cells expressing nonmembrane-bound IL-15 (P = .025, n = 9); viable mbIL15-NK cells were detectable for up to 2 months. In immunodeficient mice, mbIL15-NK cells expanded without IL-2 and were detectable in all tissues examined (except brain) in much higher numbers than mock-transduced NK cells (P < .001). Expansion further increased with IL-2. The primary mechanism of mbIL15 stimulation was autocrine; it activated IL-15 signaling and antiapoptotic signaling. NK cells expressing mbIL15 had higher cytotoxicity against leukemia, lymphoma, and solid tumor cells in vitro and against leukemia and sarcoma cells in xenograft models. Thus, mbIL15 confers independent growth to NK cells and enhances their antitumor capacity.

CD25 is a leukemic stem cell marker and a conspicuous prognostic marker for overall/relapse-free survival in AML. Rare occurrence of genetic alterations among PIM family members imposes a substantial hurdle in formulating a compelling patient stratification strategy for the clinical development of selective PIM inhibitors in cancer. Here we show that CD25, a bona fide STAT5 regulated gene, is a mechanistically relevant predictive biomarker for sensitivity to PIM kinase inhibitors. Alone or in combination with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, PIM inhibitors can suppress STAT5 activation and significantly shorten the half-life of MYC to achieve substantial growth inhibition of high CD25-expressing AML cells. Our results highlight the importance of STAT5 and MYC in rendering cancer cells sensitive to PIM inhibitors. Because the presence of a CD25-positive subpopulation in leukemic blasts correlates with poor overall or relapse-free survival, our data suggest that a combination of PIM inhibitors with chemotherapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitors could improve long-term therapeutic outcomes in CD25-positive AML.",['(c) 2014 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Guo, Zhuyan', 'Wang, Anlai', 'Zhang, Weidong', 'Levit, Mikhail', 'Gao, Qiang', 'Barberis, Claude', 'Tabart, Michel', 'Zhang, Jingxin', 'Hoffmann, Dietmar', 'Wiederschain, Dmitri', 'Rocnik, Jennifer', 'Sun, Fangxian', 'Murtie, Josh', 'Lengauer, Christoph', 'Gross, Stefan', 'Zhang, Bailin', 'Cheng, Hong', 'Patel, Vinod', 'Schio, Laurent', 'Adrian, Francisco', 'Dorsch, Marion', 'Garcia-Echeverria, Carlos', 'Huang, Shih-Min A']","['Guo Z', 'Wang A', 'Zhang W', 'Levit M', 'Gao Q', 'Barberis C', 'Tabart M', 'Zhang J', 'Hoffmann D', 'Wiederschain D', 'Rocnik J', 'Sun F', 'Murtie J', 'Lengauer C', 'Gross S', 'Zhang B', 'Cheng H', 'Patel V', 'Schio L', 'Adrian F', 'Dorsch M', 'Garcia-Echeverria C', 'Huang SM']","['Sanofi Oncology, Discovery and Early Development, Cambridge, MA;', 'Sanofi Oncology, Discovery and Early Development, Cambridge, MA;', 'Sanofi Oncology, Discovery and Early Development, Cambridge, MA;', 'Sanofi Oncology, Discovery and Early Development, Cambridge, MA;', 'Sanofi Oncology, Discovery and Early Development, Cambridge, MA;', 'Sanofi, Lead Generation and Candidate Realization, Waltham, MA; and.', 'Sanofi Oncology, Discovery and Early Development, Vitry-Sur-Seine, France.', 'Sanofi Oncology, Discovery and Early Development, Cambridge, MA;', 'Sanofi Oncology, Discovery and Early Development, Cambridge, MA;', 'Sanofi Oncology, Discovery and Early Development, Cambridge, MA;', 'Sanofi Oncology, Discovery and Early Development, Cambridge, MA;', 'Sanofi Oncology, Discovery and Early Development, Cambridge, MA;', 'Sanofi Oncology, Discovery and Early Development, Cambridge, MA;', 'Sanofi Oncology, Discovery and Early Development, Cambridge, MA;', 'Sanofi Oncology, Discovery and Early Development, Cambridge, MA;', 'Sanofi Oncology, Discovery and Early Development, Cambridge, MA;', 'Sanofi Oncology, Discovery and Early Development, Cambridge, MA;', 'Sanofi, Lead Generation and Candidate Realization, Waltham, MA; and.', 'Sanofi Oncology, Discovery and Early Development, Vitry-Sur-Seine, France.', 'Sanofi Oncology, Discovery and Early Development, Cambridge, MA;', 'Sanofi Oncology, Discovery and Early Development, Cambridge, MA;', 'Sanofi Oncology, Discovery and Early Development, Vitry-Sur-Seine, France.', 'Sanofi Oncology, Discovery and Early Development, Cambridge, MA;']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20140708,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (IL2RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PIM1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', '*Blast Crisis/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Proteolysis/*drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2014/07/10 06:00,2014/11/11 06:00,['2014/07/10 06:00'],"['2014/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35543-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-01-551234 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Sep 11;124(11):1777-89. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-01-551234.

Here, we report a metabolomics study that identified a distinct glucose metabolism signature with 400 AML patients and 446 healthy controls. The glucose metabolism signature comprises a panel of 6 serum metabolite markers, which demonstrated prognostic value in cytogenetically normal AML patients. We generated a prognosis risk score (PRS) with 6 metabolite markers for each patient using principal component analysis. A low PRS was able to predict patients with poor survival independently of well-established markers. We further compared the gene expression patterns of AML blast cells between low and high PRS groups, which correlated well to the metabolic pathways involving the 6 metabolite markers, with enhanced glycolysis and tricarboxylic [corrected] acid cycle at gene expression level in low PRS group. In vitro results demonstrated enhanced glycolysis contributed to decreased sensitivity to antileukemic agent arabinofuranosyl cytidine (Ara-C), whereas inhibition of glycolysis suppressed AML cell proliferation and potentiated cytotoxicity of Ara-C. Our study provides strong evidence for the use of serum metabolites and metabolic pathways as novel prognostic markers and potential therapeutic targets for AML.",['(c) 2014 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Chen, Wen-Lian', 'Wang, Jing-Han', 'Zhao, Ai-Hua', 'Xu, Xin', 'Wang, Yi-Huang', 'Chen, Tian-Lu', 'Li, Jun-Min', 'Mi, Jian-Qing', 'Zhu, Yong-Mei', 'Liu, Yuan-Fang', 'Wang, Yue-Ying', 'Jin, Jie', 'Huang, He', 'Wu, De-Pei', 'Li, Yan', 'Yan, Xiao-Jing', 'Yan, Jin-Song', 'Li, Jian-Yong', 'Wang, Shuai', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun', 'Wang, Bing-Shun', 'Chen, Zhu', 'Chen, Sai-Juan', 'Jia, Wei']","['Chen WL', 'Wang JH', 'Zhao AH', 'Xu X', 'Wang YH', 'Chen TL', 'Li JM', 'Mi JQ', 'Zhu YM', 'Liu YF', 'Wang YY', 'Jin J', 'Huang H', 'Wu DP', 'Li Y', 'Yan XJ', 'Yan JS', 'Li JY', 'Wang S', 'Huang XJ', 'Wang BS', 'Chen Z', 'Chen SJ', 'Jia W']","['Key Laboratory of Systems Biomedicine of Ministry of Education, Shanghai Center for Systems Biomedicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) and State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, SJTU School of Medicine, Shanghai, China;

Several genetically engineered mouse models have been generated, either mimicking genetic aberrations or deregulated gene expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The usefulness of such models in the study of the human disease may potentially be hampered by species-specific biological differences in the target cell of the oncogenic transformation. Specifically, do the genetic lesions or the deregulated expression of leukemia-associated genes faithfully recapitulate the spectrum of lymphoproliferations in humans? Do the CLL-like lymphoproliferations in the mouse have the phenotypic, histological, genetic, and clinical features of the human disease? Here we compare the various CLL mouse models with regard to disease phenotype, penetrance, and severity. We discuss similarities and differences of the murine lymphoproliferations compared with human CLL. We propose that the Emu-TCL1 transgenic and 13q14-deletion models that have been comprehensively studied at the levels of leukemia phenotype, antigen-receptor repertoire, and disease course show close resemblance to the human disease. We conclude that modeling CLL-associated genetic dysregulations in mice can provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and generate valuable tools for the development of novel therapies.",['(c) 2014 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Simonetti, Giorgia', 'Bertilaccio, Maria Teresa Sabrina', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Klein, Ulf']","['Simonetti G', 'Bertilaccio MT', 'Ghia P', 'Klein U']","['Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, NY;', 'Lymphoid Malignancy Unit, Division of Molecular Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy;', 'B cell Neoplasia Unit, Division of Molecular Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy; Clinical Unit of Lymphoid Malignancies, Department of Onco-Hematology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy; and.', 'Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, NY; Department of Pathology and Cell Biology and Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University, New York, NY.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140708,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Mammalian/genetics', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*therapy', 'Mice, Inbred NZB', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Models, Genetic', 'Phenotype', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Tumor Microenvironment/genetics']",,,2014/07/10 06:00,2015/04/29 06:00,['2014/07/10 06:00'],"['2014/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39830-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-05-577122 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Aug 14;124(7):1010-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-05-577122.

In the present study, by combining fluorescent EMSA (electrophoretic mobility-shift assay) with MS, we reveal the presence of hnRNP K (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K) in molecular complexes that PU.1 forms on the CD11b promoter during the agonist-induced maturation of AML (acute myeloid leukaemia)-derived cells along both the granulocytic and the monocytic lineages. Although hnRNP K and PU.1 act synergistically during granulocytic differentiation, hnRNP K seems to have a negative effect on PU.1 activity during monocytic maturation. Since hnRNP K acts as a docking platform, integrating signal transduction pathways to nucleic acid-directed processes, it may assist PU.1 in activating or repressing transcription by recruiting lineage-specific components of the transcription machinery. It is therefore possible that hnRNP K plays a key role in the mechanisms underlying the specific targeting of protein-protein interactions identified as mediators of transcriptional activation or repression and may be responsible for the block of haemopoietic differentiation.",,"['Nika, Ervin', 'Brugnoli, Federica', 'Piazzi, Manuela', 'Lambertini, Elisabetta', 'Grassilli, Silvia', 'Bavelloni, Alberto', 'Piva, Roberta', 'Capitani, Silvano', 'Bertagnolo, Valeria']","['Nika E', 'Brugnoli F', 'Piazzi M', 'Lambertini E', 'Grassilli S', 'Bavelloni A', 'Piva R', 'Capitani S', 'Bertagnolo V']","['*Section of Anatomy and Histology, Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Via Fossato di Mortara 70, 44121 Ferrara, Italy.', '*Section of Anatomy and Histology, Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Via Fossato di Mortara 70, 44121 Ferrara, Italy.', 'daggerCell Signalling Laboratory, Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Via Irnerio 48, 40126 Bologna, Italy.', 'double daggerDepartment of Biomedical and Specialty Surgical Sciences, University of Ferrara, Via Fossato di Mortara 74, 44121 Ferrara, Italy.', '*Section of Anatomy and Histology, Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Via Fossato di Mortara 70, 44121 Ferrara, Italy.', 'section signSC Laboratory of Musculoskeletal Cell Biology, Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute, Via di Barbiano 1/10, 40136 Bologna, Italy.', 'double daggerDepartment of Biomedical and Specialty Surgical Sciences, University of Ferrara, Via Fossato di Mortara 74, 44121 Ferrara, Italy.', '*Section of Anatomy and Histology, Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Via Fossato di Mortara 70, 44121 Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein K)', '0 (ITGAM protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', '146410-60-8 (HNRNPK protein, human)']",IM,"['CD11b Antigen/genetics/*metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Granulocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein K', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Monocytes/*metabolism/pathology', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ribonucleoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2014/07/10 06:00,2014/11/02 06:00,['2014/07/10 06:00'],"['2014/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/02 06:00 [medline]']","['BJ20140358 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20140358 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2014 Oct 1;463(1):115-22. doi: 10.1042/BJ20140358.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This heterogeneity seems to arise from fluctuations of Nanog expression in individual cells, but a thorough characterization of these fluctuations and their impact on the pluripotent state is still lacking. Here, we have used a novel fluorescent reporter to investigate the temporal dynamics of NANOG expression in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), and to dissect the lineage potential of mESCs at different NANOG states. Our results show that stochastic NANOG fluctuations are widespread in mESCs, with essentially all expressing cells showing fluctuations in NANOG levels, even when cultured in ground-state conditions (2i media). We further show that fluctuations have similar kinetics when mESCs are cultured in standard conditions (serum plus leukemia inhibitory factor) or ground-state conditions, implying that NANOG fluctuations are inherent to the pluripotent state. We have then compared the developmental potential of low-NANOG and high-NANOG mESCs, grown in different conditions, and confirm that mESCs are more susceptible to enter differentiation at the low-NANOG state. Further analysis by gene expression profiling reveals that low-NANOG cells have marked expression of lineage-affiliated genes, with variable profiles according to the signalling environment. By contrast, high-NANOG cells show a more stable expression profile in different environments, with minimal expression of lineage markers. Altogether, our data support a model in which stochastic NANOG fluctuations provide opportunities for mESCs to explore multiple lineage options, modulating their probability to change functional state.",['(c) 2014.

Such therapy has not been available to UCBT recipients, however, due to the low numbers of available UCB T cells and the limited capacity for ex vivo expansion of cytolytic cells. We have developed a novel strategy to expand UCB T cells to clinically relevant numbers in the context of exogenous cytokines.

Moreover, UCB T cells were modified to both express the CD19-specific CAR, 1928z, and secrete IL-12. 1928z/IL-12 UCB T cells retained a central memory-effector phenotype and had increased antitumor efficacy in vitro. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of 1928z/IL-12 UCB T cells resulted in significantly enhanced survival of CD19(+) tumor-bearing SCID-Beige mice.

Its expression and activity are frequently elevated in cancer, and have been shown to correlate with poor prognosis. Efforts to target eIF4E have thus yielded much interest, with some clinical success. AREAS COVERED: We provide an overview of eIF4E function and regulation, and its role in hematological malignancies and solid tumors. Activation of eIF4E via upstream signaling pathways that are frequently deregulated in cancer and the role of eIF4E phosphorylation are discussed. We present an updated review of different approaches to target eIF4E function in the lab and in the clinic. EXPERT OPINION: The prospect of effectively targeting eIF4E in cancer is very attractive, because eIF4E is a common downstream node on which multiple oncogenic signaling pathways converge. However, efforts to do so have yielded limited clinical success so far. While active-site inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin show some promise, and inhibitors of eIF4E phosphorylation may emerge as clinical candidates, the only drug to date that has demonstrated antitumor activity associated with eIF4E inhibition in patients is ribavirin. Further studies will certainly aid the design of better compounds and rational combination therapies.",,"['Pettersson, Filippa', 'Del Rincon, Sonia V', 'Miller, Wilson H Jr']","['Pettersson F', 'Del Rincon SV', 'Miller WH Jr']","['McGill University, Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Jewish General Hospital, Segal Cancer Centre , Montreal, Quebec H3T 1E2 , Canada +1 514 340 8222, Ext. 4365 ; +1 514 340 8717 ; wmiller@ldi.jgh.mcgill.ca.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20140708,England,Expert Opin Ther Targets,Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,101127833,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Drug Design', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Prognosis', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['M4/M5 acute myeloid leukemia', 'cancer', 'eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E', 'mRNA translation', 'metastasis', 'ribavirin']",2014/07/10 06:00,2015/03/31 06:00,['2014/07/10 06:00'],"['2014/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14728222.2014.937426 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Ther Targets. 2014 Sep;18(9):1035-48. doi: 10.1517/14728222.2014.937426.

Ca2+ uptake can occur through the recently discovered mitochondrial uniporter channel (MCU) but whether the MCU is involved in shaping Ca2+ signals and downstream responses to physiological levels of receptor stimulation is unknown. Here, we show that modest stimulation of leukotriene receptors with the pro-inflammatory signal LTC4 evokes a series of cytoplasmic Ca2+ oscillations that are rapidly and faithfully propagated into mitochondrial matrix. Knockdown of MCU or mitochondrial depolarisation, to reduce the driving force for Ca2+ entry into the matrix, prevents the mitochondrial Ca2+ rise and accelerates run down of the oscillations. The loss of cytoplasmic Ca2+ oscillations appeared to be a consequence of enhanced Ca2+-dependent inactivation of InsP3 receptors, which arose from the loss of mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering. Ca2+ dependent gene expression in response to leukotriene receptor activation was suppressed following knockdown of the MCU. In addition to buffering Ca2+ release, mitochondria also sequestrated Ca2+ entry through store-operated Ca2+ channels and this too was prevented following loss of MCU. MCU is therefore an important regulator of physiological pulses of cytoplasmic Ca2+.",,"['Samanta, Krishna', 'Douglas, Sophie', 'Parekh, Anant B']","['Samanta K', 'Douglas S', 'Parekh AB']","['Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140708,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (mitochondrial calcium uniporter)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Channels/genetics/*metabolism', 'Calcium Signaling/*physiology', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ion Transport', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rats', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2014/07/09 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/07/09 06:00'],"['2014/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0101188 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-20224 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jul 8;9(7):e101188. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0101188. eCollection 2014.,,,['Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],PMC4086884,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are many signaling pathways involved in cytokine induced apoptosis of many cancers but their role remains unclear in some cancers such as leukemia. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the involvement of the nitric oxide (NO) and p53 tumor suppressor gene in apoptotic pathways induced by cytokines in leukemic cell lines. METHODS: Leukemic cell lines, Kasumi-1 (AML-M2) and Molt- 4 (ALL) were treated with cytokines, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). The effect of cytokines on the induction cell apoptosis was analysed by flow cytometry. In addition, nitric oxide production and p53 protein levels were measured by using the Griess method and Western blot, respectively. RESULTS: Upon cytokine treatment, there was a significant increase in the percentage of cell apoptosis in both leukemic cell lines. The highest apoptosis was shown in 40 U/ml IFN-gamma treated cells. In addition, nitric oxide and p53 protein increased in IFN-gamma treated cells. There was a reduction of apoptosis and p53 level after adding the inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, SMT.

Although co-administration of arsenic trioxide (ATO) with ATRA has emerged as an effective option to treat APL, the molecular basis of this effect remains unclear. METHODS: Four leukaemia cancer human models (HL60, THP-1, NBR4 and NBR4-R2 cells) were treated either with ATO alone or ATO plus ATRA. Cancer cell survival was monitored by trypan blue exclusion and DEVDase activity assays. Gene and protein expression changes were assessed by RT-PCR and western blot. RESULTS: ATO induced an antioxidant response characterised by Nrf2 nuclear translocation and enhanced transcription of downstream target genes (that is, HO-1, NQO1, GCLM, ferritin). In cells exposed to ATO plus ATRA, the Nrf2 nuclear translocation was prevented and cytotoxicity was enhanced. HO-1 overexpression reversed partially the cytotoxicity by ATRA-ATO in HL60 cells. The inhibitory effects of ATRA on ATO-mediated responses were not observed in either the ATRA-resistant NB4-R2 cells or in NB4 cells pre-incubated with the RARalpha antagonist Ro-41-52-53. CONCLUSIONS: The augmented cytotoxicity observed in leukaemia cells following combined ATO-ATRA treatment is likely due to inhibition of Nrf2 activity, thus explaining the efficacy of combined ATO-ATRA treatment in the APL therapy.",,"['Valenzuela, M', 'Glorieux, C', 'Stockis, J', 'Sid, B', 'Sandoval, J M', 'Felipe, K B', 'Kviecinski, M R', 'Verrax, J', 'Buc Calderon, P']","['Valenzuela M', 'Glorieux C', 'Stockis J', 'Sid B', 'Sandoval JM', 'Felipe KB', 'Kviecinski MR', 'Verrax J', 'Buc Calderon P']","['Toxicology and Cancer Biology Research Group (GTOX), Louvain Drug Research Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Avenue Mounier, 73 bte B1.73.09, Brussels 1200, Belgium.', 'Toxicology and Cancer Biology Research Group (GTOX), Louvain Drug Research Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Avenue Mounier, 73 bte B1.73.09, Brussels 1200, Belgium.', 'de Duve Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels 1200, Belgium.', 'Toxicology and Cancer Biology Research Group (GTOX), Louvain Drug Research Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Avenue Mounier, 73 bte B1.73.09, Brussels 1200, Belgium.', 'Toxicology and Cancer Biology Research Group (GTOX), Louvain Drug Research Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Avenue Mounier, 73 bte B1.73.09, Brussels 1200, Belgium.', 'Toxicology and Cancer Biology Research Group (GTOX), Louvain Drug Research Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Avenue Mounier, 73 bte B1.73.09, Brussels 1200, Belgium.', 'Toxicology and Cancer Biology Research Group (GTOX), Louvain Drug Research Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Avenue Mounier, 73 bte B1.73.09, Brussels 1200, Belgium.', 'Toxicology and Cancer Biology Research Group (GTOX), Louvain Drug Research Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Avenue Mounier, 73 bte B1.73.09, Brussels 1200, Belgium.', '1] Toxicology and Cancer Biology Research Group (GTOX), Louvain Drug Research Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Avenue Mounier, 73 bte B1.73.09, Brussels 1200, Belgium [2] Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Arturo Prat, Casilla 121, Iquique, Chile.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140708,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (NFE2L2 protein, human)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (HMOX1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/*metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2014/07/09 06:00,2014/10/18 06:00,['2014/07/09 06:00'],"['2014/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/05 00:00 [revised]', '2014/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/18 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc2014380 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2014.380 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2014 Aug 26;111(5):874-82. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2014.380.

Although, so far no clear cause can be found for ALL the most commonly recognized and strongest causal factor is infection. However, an interesting question is how viral infection may be responsible for genetic changes that lead to lymphoid cell transformation. A plausible mechanism by which infection might impact the process of leukemogenesis via genetic alteration is through: oxidative stress/DNA damage which is closely linked with inflammation, aberrant expression of AID/ABOBEC family enzymes which may be responsible for massive mutation introduction and alteration of DNA methylation, leading to changes in the expression of hematopoietic genes. In this review we propose several specific molecular mechanisms which link infection with all the above-mentioned processes. The most likely event which links common virus infection with ALL pathogenesis is aberrant expression of AID/APOBEC. This event may be directly responsible for the introduction of point mutations (as the result of cytosine or 5-methylcytosine deamination and formation of G:U or G:T misspairs) as well as changes in DNA methylation status.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Bcl-2 is a key protein that inhibits the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. First-generation BH3 mimetics such as navitoclax (ABT-263) had a broad range of inhibitory activity against Bcl-2 family members, including Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Bcl-w. This drug demonstrated antitumor activity in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL); however, on-target Bcl-XL inhibition led to dose-dependent thrombocytopenia and posed a barrier to maximizing the activity of this agent. Through an elegant reengineering of navitoclax, ABT-199 was developed as a Bcl-2-selective small molecule inhibitor. In preclinical studies, ABT-199 was shown to have greater than 100-fold selectivity for Bcl-2 over Bcl-XL. This selectivity has been consistent with the early results of the ongoing phase 1 clinical trial of ABT-199 in which the drug has demonstrated high rates of activity in relapsed/refractory CLL and NHL without dose-dependent thrombocytopenia. On-target tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) has been observed in a subset of patients treated with ABT-199, but changes in initial dosing and stepwise dose escalation have now been implemented to mitigate this risk.

Structural and modeling studies reveal that the hydroxyindole carboxylic acid anchors the inhibitor to the SHP2 active site, while interactions of the oxalamide linker and the phenylthiophene tail with residues in the beta5-beta6 loop contribute to 11a-1's binding potency and selectivity. Evidence suggests that 11a-1 specifically attenuates the SHP2-dependent signaling inside the cell.

One of the main reasons for the continued high mortality is due to the challenge to punctual recognize and diagnose this disease, as specific cutaneous signs can vary or even be missing early in its evolution - especially in case of simultaneous first manifestation of an acute leukemia. CASE PRESENTATION: An untypical case of necrotizing fasciitis disease in a young patient with the first diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia is presented. After her induction chemotherapy the only presenting clinical sign was fever in the presence of severe neutropenia without an evident infectious focus. After a few days a painless confluent, erythematous, pustular skin rash with a central necrosis on lateral thigh appeared. Escherichia coli was isolated from blood cultures. Surgical debridement was performed and showed subcutaneous tissue, fascia and underlying muscle around the site of initial cutaneous manifestation with typical necrosis on exploration. But, initially taken skin biopsy did not show any typical histopathological findings like bacteria or inflammatory cells confirming necrotizing fasciitis. Nevertheless, the intraoperative findings were impressive and highly indicative for a necrotizing soft tissue infection, so that the patient was treated according to clinical guidelines with extensive recurrent surgical debridement, broad-spectrum antibiotics and intensive care therapy. After recovering from NF, she successfully underwent further chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation. CONCLUSION: The presented case highlights the risk of potential misinterpretation, delayed diagnosis and treatment of necrotizing fasciitis in patients presenting with an untypical clinical and histopathological manifestation of necrotizing fasciitis as a result of severe neutropenia following chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia.",,"['Brumann, Mareen', 'Bogner, Viktoria', 'Volkl, Andreas', 'Sotlar, Karl', 'Euler, Ekkehard', 'Mutschler, Wolf']","['Brumann M', 'Bogner V', 'Volkl A', 'Sotlar K', 'Euler E', 'Mutschler W']","['Department of Trauma Surgery, University Hospital Munich, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Nussbaumstr. 20, Munich 80336, Germany.', 'Department of Trauma Surgery, University Hospital Munich, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Nussbaumstr. 20, Munich 80336, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Munich, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Ziemsenstr. 1, Munich 80336, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Munich, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Thalkirchnerstr. 36, Munich 80337, Germany.', 'Department of Trauma Surgery, University Hospital Munich, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Nussbaumstr. 20, Munich 80336, Germany.', 'Department of Trauma Surgery, University Hospital Munich, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Nussbaumstr. 20, Munich 80336, Germany.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20140626,England,Patient Saf Surg,Patient safety in surgery,101319176,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Diagnostic difficulties', 'Granulocytopenia', 'Necrotizing fasciitis', 'Soft tissue infection']",2014/07/09 06:00,2014/07/09 06:01,['2014/07/09 06:00'],"['2014/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/09 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/1754-9493-8-28 [doi]', '1754-9493-8-28 [pii]']",epublish,Patient Saf Surg. 2014 Jun 26;8:28. doi: 10.1186/1754-9493-8-28. eCollection 2014.,,,,PMC4084793,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cytokine granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is commonly used therapeutically to augment neutrophil recovery following chemo/radiation therapy for malignancy, thereby decreasing infection risk. Although best known as a potent inducer of myelopoiesis, we previously reported that G-CSF also promotes the delivery of leukocytes to sites of inflammation by stimulating expression of potent E-selectin ligands, including an uncharacterized approximately 65-kDa glycoprotein. To identify this ligand, we performed integrated biochemical analysis and mass spectrometry studies of G-CSF-treated primary human myeloid cells. Our studies show that this novel E-selectin ligand is a glycoform of the heavy chain component of the enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO), a well-known lysosomal peroxidase. This specialized MPO glycovariant, referred to as ""MPO-E-selectin ligand"" (MPO-EL), is expressed on circulating G-CSF-mobilized leukocytes and is naturally expressed on blood myeloid cells in patients with febrile leukocytosis. In vitro biochemical studies show that G-CSF programs MPO-EL expression on human blood leukocytes and marrow myeloid cells via induction of N-linked sialofucosylations on MPO, with concomitant cell surface display of the molecule. MPO-EL is catalytically active and mediates angiotoxicity on human endothelial cells that express E-selectin. These findings thus define a G-CSF effect on MPO chemical biology that endows unsuspected functional versatility upon this enzyme, unveiling new perspectives on the biology of G-CSF and MPO, and on the role of E-selectin receptor/ligand interactions in leukocyte migration and vascular pathology.",,"['Silvescu, Cristina I', 'Sackstein, Robert']","['Silvescu CI', 'Sackstein R']","['Departments of Dermatology andHarvard Skin Disease Research Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115; and.', ""Departments of Dermatology andHarvard Skin Disease Research Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115; andMedicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115;Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115 rsackstein@partners.org.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140707,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (E-Selectin)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '28RYY2IV3F (Fucose)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'GZP2782OP0 (N-Acetylneuraminic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biocatalysis/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'E-Selectin/*metabolism', 'Fucose/metabolism', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myeloid Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'N-Acetylneuraminic Acid/metabolism', 'Peroxidase/*metabolism', 'Polysaccharides/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['glycosylation', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'leukemia']",2014/07/09 06:00,2014/10/01 06:00,['2014/07/09 06:00'],"['2014/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1320833111 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1320833111 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Jul 22;111(29):10696-701. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1320833111.

In vitro, the affinity for binding c-Myb is approximately doubled when KIX is in complex with MLL, which suggests a positive cooperative binding mechanism, and the affinity for MLL is also slightly increased when KIX is first bound by c-Myb. Expanding the scope of recent NMR and computational studies, we explore the allosteric mechanism at a detailed molecular level that directly connects the microscopic structural dynamics to the macroscopic shift in binding affinities. To this end, we have performed molecular dynamics simulations of free KIX, KIX-c-Myb, MLL-KIX, and MLL-KIX-c-Myb using a topology-based Go-like model. Our results capture an increase in affinity for the peptide in the allosteric site when KIX is prebound by a complementary effector and both peptides follow an effector-independent folding-and-binding mechanism. More importantly, we discover that MLL binding lowers the entropic cost for c-Myb binding, and vice versa, by stabilizing the L12-G2 loop and the C-terminal region of the alpha3 helix on KIX.

Its function, however, is largely unknown. Previous reports have demonstrated that skNAC binds to m-Bop/Smyd1, a multi-functional protein that regulates myogenesis both through the control of transcription and the modulation of sarcomerogenesis, and that both proteins undergo nuclear-to-cytoplasmic translocation at the later stages of myogenic differentiation. Here, we show that skNAC binds to the E3 SUMO ligase mammalian Mms21/Nse2 and that knockdown of Nse2 expression inhibits specific aspects of myogenic differentiation, accompanied by a partial blockade of the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic translocation of the skNAC-Smyd1 complex, retention of the complex in promyelocytic leukemia (PML)-like nuclear bodies and disturbed sarcomerogenesis. In addition, we show that the skNAC interaction partner Smyd1 contains a putative sumoylation motif and is sumoylated in muscle cells, with depletion of Mms21/Nse2 leading to reduced concentrations of sumoylated Smyd1. Taken together, our data suggest that the function, specifically the balance between the nuclear and cytosolic roles, of the skNAC-Smyd1 complex might be regulated by sumoylation.",['(c) 2014.

Although major components in A. vulgaris EO have been shown to inhibit growth of different cancer cells, as pure compounds or part of other plants extracted oil, no information is known about its anti-proliferative activities. Therefore, the current investigation has evaluated the toxicity of the plant extracted oil from buds (AVO-b) and leaves (AVO-l) and characterized their growth inhibitory effects on cancer cells. METHODS: AVO-b and AVO-l from A. vulgaris L. were extracted by hydrodistillation, and their effect on the viability of human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia and various other cancer cell lines was tested using MTT assay. Flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis, DNA fragmentation assay, caspases enzymatic activities and Western blotting were used to determine the apoptotic pathway triggered by their action on HL-60 cells. RESULTS: Low concentrations of AVO-b and AVO-l inhibited the growth of HL-60 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Employing flow cytometric, DNA fragmentation and caspase activation analyses, demonstrated that the cytotoxic effect of the oils is mediated by a caspase-dependent apoptosis. Kinetic studies in the presence and absence specific caspase inhibitors showed that activation of caspase-8 was dependent and subsequent to the activation of caspases-9 and -3. In addition, the essential oil caused a disruption of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsim), increased the release of cytochrome c to the cytosol, and altered the expression of certain members of Bcl-2 family (Bcl-2, Bax and Bid), Apaf-1 and XIAP. Interestingly, low doses of AVO-b and AVO-1 also induced apoptosis in various cancer cell lines, but not in noncancerous cells. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that the EO-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells is mediated by caspase-dependent pathways, involving caspases-3, -9, and -8, which are initiated by Bcl-2/Bax/Bid-dependent loss of DeltaPsim leading to release of cytochrome c to the cytoplasm to activate the caspase cascade. The finding that AVO-b and AVO-l are more efficient to induce apoptosis in different cancer cell lines than noncancerous cells, suggests that A. vulgaris might be a promising source for new anticancer agents.",,"['Saleh, Ayman M', 'Aljada, Ahmad', 'Rizvi, Syed A A', 'Nasr, Amre', 'Alaskar, Ahmed S', 'Williams, Jack D']","['Saleh AM', 'Aljada A', 'Rizvi SA', 'Nasr A', 'Alaskar AS', 'Williams JD']","['College of Medicine, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences (KSAU-HS), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. salehay@ksau-hs.edu.sa.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140707,England,BMC Complement Altern Med,BMC complementary and alternative medicine,101088661,"['0 (Oils, Volatile)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Artemisia/*chemistry', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects', 'Oils, Volatile/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism']",,,2014/07/09 06:00,2014/11/15 06:00,['2014/07/09 06:00'],"['2014/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1472-6882-14-226 [pii]', '10.1186/1472-6882-14-226 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Complement Altern Med. 2014 Jul 7;14:226. doi: 10.1186/1472-6882-14-226.,,,,PMC4227289,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Without support, these families will finally give up treatment for their children. Our hospital has sought several ways to fund the uncompensated care for children without insurance or from low-income families. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The annual hospital financial report and donated patients' medical records from 2005 to 2011 were reviewed for extracting data, including disease type, and sources and amounts of donations. Files with information on uncompensated care were also reviewed. Uncompensated care was defined as the sum of a hospital's ""bad debt"" and the charity care it provides. RESULTS: The total expense of uncompensated care increased from 813 597 RMB in 2005 to 4 415 967 RMB in 2011, with a percentage of total budget ranging from 0.24% to 1.6% from 2005 to 2011. The hospital's bad debt accounts for 17.6% of the uncompensated care charge on average per year. The charity care was from: 1) donations from common warm-hearted persons, companies, and institutions after media reporting; 2) governmental charity organizations; 3) non-governmental charity organizations; and 4) special funding from contributions solicited by hospital, media, and governmental charity organizations' collaboration. Leukemia and congenital heart disease were the 2 leading types of diseases benefitted from the uncompensated care from 2005 to 2011. CONCLUSIONS: Uncompensated care is still an indispensable complementary supporting measure for pediatric care access in China. Children from rural-to-urban migrant families should be considered as a target population for the government to focus on.",,"['Zhang, Weifang', 'Wang, Xuefei', 'Li, Jinzhong', 'Xu, Zhuopu']","['Zhang W', 'Wang X', 'Li J', 'Xu Z']","[""Department of Administration, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Administration, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Administration, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China (mainland)."", 'Guanghua School of Law, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China (mainland).']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140708,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,,IM,"['Child', 'China', '*Family', 'Health Care Costs', '*Hospitals', 'Humans', 'Insurance, Health/*economics', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Uncompensated Care/*economics']",,,2014/07/09 06:00,2014/12/19 06:00,['2014/07/09 06:00'],"['2014/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/19 06:00 [medline]']","['890368 [pii]', '10.12659/MSM.890368 [doi]']",epublish,Med Sci Monit. 2014 Jul 8;20:1162-7. doi: 10.12659/MSM.890368.,,,,PMC4099210,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A potentially increased risk of unsuspected tonsillar malignancy in adult patients presenting with peritonsillar abscess (PTA) was noted in a recent review. Furthermore, a literature search revealed several case reports concerning tonsillar malignancy presenting as PTA. Thus, the aim of the current study was to explore the prevalence of tonsillar malignancy in adult patients with PTA. A retrospective review of all adult patients undergoing tonsillectomy due to PTA from January 2001 to December 2012 at the Ear-Nose-Throat Department was performed. In 275 consecutive adult patients with PTA (median age 40 years, range 30-89 years), we identified one patient with unsuspected tonsillar malignancy (prevalence 0.3 %); a 40-year-old, previously healthy, male was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia. Reviewing the literature, we identified 13 cases of tonsillar malignancy presenting as PTA (median age 49 years, range 2-66 years). Our data represents the only series of histological examined tonsillectomy specimens from PTA patients reported in the literature. We identified one case of unsuspected tonsillar malignancy in this relatively small series. We find it important to stress, that we had no knowledge of this patient before designing the study. Hence, the prevalence of 0.3 % is unbiased in this respect. More, and preferably, larger studies are needed to determine the prevalence with greater certainty. At present, no definitive conclusions can be made, but clinicians should be aware that PTA infrequently masquerade tonsillar malignancy.",,"['Rokkjaer, Malene Sine', 'Klug, Tejs Ehlers']","['Rokkjaer MS', 'Klug TE']","['Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Holstebro Hospital, Laegardvej 12, 7500, Holstebro, Denmark, malrok@rm.dk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20140708,Germany,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,9002937,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peritonsillar Abscess/*pathology/*surgery', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tonsillar Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*surgery', '*Tonsillectomy', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/07/09 06:00,2016/03/05 06:00,['2014/07/09 06:00'],"['2014/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00405-014-3186-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol. 2015 Sep;272(9):2439-44. doi: 10.1007/s00405-014-3186-0.

Due to major differences between the murine and human NK cell receptor system, a non-human primate model would be helpful to evaluate the efficiency of NK-cell based therapies prior to clinical applications. In humans, B7-H6 has been shown to facilitate the elimination of lymphoma cells through the interaction with its receptor NKp30. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a new world monkey readily used in biomedical research due to its easy management and proximity to humans. In this study, we demonstrated the expression of B7-H6 antigen in marmoset B-lymphoblastoid cell lines. In addition, a method was established to isolate B- or NK-cells from peripheral blood of marmosets with purities of up to 97%We detected the expression of B7-H6 in lymphoma cells and for the first time in leukemic blasts of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Marmoset NK cells were shown to lyse marmoset B lymphoblastoid cell line (B-LCL) cells by up to 28.4% and human B-LCL cells by up to 20%. This effect was abrogated when the NK cells were pre-treated with an anti-NKp30 specific antibody. Also, marmoset NK cells were able to lyse primary leukemic AML cells and lymphoma cells by up to 8.3 and 20.3%respectively. Stimulation of marmoset NK cells with recombinant B7-H6 induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and proliferation rates. Furthermore, the secretion of IL-1beta, IL-8, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha was significantly increased upon B7-H6 stimulation. In conclusion, we demonstrated that non-human primate NK cells have similar mechanisms for the lysis of tumor cells as human NK cells.

Protein kinase C-beta (PKC-beta) is immediately downstream of BCR and has been shown to be essential to CLL cell survival and proliferation in vivo. We therefore evaluated sotrastaurin (AEB071), an orally administered potent PKC inhibitor, on CLL cell survival both in vitro and in vivo. AEB071 shows selective cytotoxicity against B-CLL cells in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, AEB071 attenuates BCR-mediated survival pathways, inhibits CpG-induced survival and proliferation of CLL cells in vitro, and effectively blocks microenvironment-mediated survival signaling pathways in primary CLL cells. Furthermore, AEB071 alters beta-catenin expression, resulting in decreased downstream transcriptional genes as c-Myc, Cyclin D1, and CD44. Lastly, our preliminary in vivo studies indicate beneficial antitumor properties of AEB071 in CLL. Taken together, our results indicate that targeting PKC-beta has the potential to disrupt signaling from the microenvironment contributing to CLL cell survival and potentially drug resistance.

We found that several delivery modes of a model retroviral Ag, including natural infection, preferentially expanded initially rare high-avidity CD4(+) T cell clonotypes, known to mediate protection. In contrast, the same Ag vectored by human adenovirus serotype 5 induced clonotypic expansion irrespective of avidity, eliciting a predominantly low-avidity response. Nonselective clonotypic expansion was caused by relatively weak adenovirus serotype 5-vectored Ag presentation and was reproduced by replication-attenuated retroviral vaccines. Mechanistically, the potency of Ag presentation determined the speed and, consequently, completion of the CD4(+) T cell response. Whereas faster completion retained the initial advantage of high-avidity clonotypes, slower completion permitted uninhibited accumulation of low-avidity clonotypes. These results highlighted the importance of Ag presentation patterns in determining the clonotypic composition of vaccine-induced T cell responses and ultimately the efficacy of vaccination.",,"['Thorborn, Georgina', 'Ploquin, Mickael J', 'Eksmond, Urszula', 'Pike, Rebecca', 'Bayer, Wibke', 'Dittmer, Ulf', 'Hasenkrug, Kim J', 'Pepper, Marion', 'Kassiotis, George']","['Thorborn G', 'Ploquin MJ', 'Eksmond U', 'Pike R', 'Bayer W', 'Dittmer U', 'Hasenkrug KJ', 'Pepper M', 'Kassiotis G']","['Division of Immunoregulation, Medical Research Council National Institute for Medical Research, London NW7 1AA, United Kingdom;', 'Division of Immunoregulation, Medical Research Council National Institute for Medical Research, London NW7 1AA, United Kingdom;', 'Division of Immunoregulation, Medical Research Council National Institute for Medical Research, London NW7 1AA, United Kingdom;', 'Division of Immunoregulation, Medical Research Council National Institute for Medical Research, London NW7 1AA, United Kingdom;', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen 45147, Germany;', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen 45147, Germany;', 'Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, MT 59840;', 'Department of Immunology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195; and.', 'Division of Immunoregulation, Medical Research Council National Institute for Medical Research, London NW7 1AA, United Kingdom; Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London W2 1PG, United Kingdom gkassio@nimr.mrc.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140707,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, OX40)', '0 (Tnfrsf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Affinity/*immunology', 'Antigen Presentation/immunology', 'Antigens, Viral/*immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Clonal Selection, Antigen-Mediated/*immunology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Products, env/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology', 'Receptors, OX40/genetics', 'Viral Vaccines/immunology']",,,2014/07/09 06:00,2014/10/22 06:00,['2014/07/09 06:00'],"['2014/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/22 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1400667 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1400667 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2014 Aug 15;193(4):1567-77. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1400667.

The current study examined whether the NT5C3 polymorphisms could affect chemotherapy outcomes in 103 Korean AML patients. METHODS: Forty-seven single nucleotide polymorphisms in NT5C3 were genotyped using the Illumina GoldenGate genotyping assay. The genetic effects of the polymorphisms on the outcome of chemotherapy were analyzed using chi and logistic regression models. RESULTS: Although none of the NT5C3 polymorphisms was associated with a complete remission rate, a common single nucleotide polymorphism, rs3750117, showed a significant association with induction rate after the first course of chemotherapy (Pcorr=0.004 and odds ratio=11.28) in AML patients. In addition, NT5C3 expression levels were significantly increased in patients with risk allele homozygote.

Outside of the identification of rarely occurring epidermal growth factor receptor and v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog mutations via candidate gene sequencing, mutations in common cancer genes have yet to be observed. Only a single thymoma genome sequence has been previously reported, with no mutations in known cancer genes identified. Thus, we attempted to identify somatic driver mutations in a cytogenetically normal thymoma. A stage IVB type B3 thymoma from a 47-year-old male of Asian descent with no history of myasthenia gravis or other autoimmune condition was genomically evaluated. Exome sequencing and low-pass whole-genome sequencing was performed to identify somatic point mutations, copy number changes and structural variants. Mutations in known tumor suppressors DNMT3A (p.G728D) and ASXL1 (p.E657fs), consistent with mutations of known consequence in acute myeloid leukemia, were identified. Contrary to a previous report, this finding suggests the genetic etiology of thymomas may not be fundamentally distinct from other tumor types.

In Korea, maintenance operations in petrochemical plants are typically performed by temporary employees hired as contract workers. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate cancer risk in temporary maintenance workers in a refinery/petrochemical complex in Korea. METHODS: Subjects consisted of 14 698 male workers registered in a regional petrochemical plant maintenance workers union during 2002-2007. Cancer mortality and incidence were identified by linking with the nationwide death and cancer registries during 2002-2007 and 2002-2005, respectively. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for each cancer. RESULTS: Increased SMR 3.61 (six cases, 95% CI: 1.32-7.87) and SIR 3.18 (five cases, 95% CI: 1.03-7.42) were observed in oral and pharyngeal cancers.

OBJECTIVES: We aim to critically appraise epidemiologic studies to date, and to suggest future research and actions to protect workers in semiconductor industry. METHODS: Epidemiologic studies were identified through electronic database searches, review of reference lists of relevant published works, and expert consultations, and were narratively reviewed. RESULTS: Most evidence suggests reproductive risks from fabrication jobs, including spontaneous abortion (SAB), congenital malformation, and reduced fertility. Although chemicals have been suspected as causal agents, knowledge of the likely contribution(s) from specific exposures is still limited. Evidence of cancer risk seems to be equivocal.

Although qualitative assays for detecting leukemia-specific CD43 exist, there is a need to develop quantitative assays for the same. Here, we developed two novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), 2C8 and 8E10, recognizing different epitopes on CD43. These clones are capable of pairing with YG5, another mAb against JL1 epitope, because they were selectively obtained using sandwich ELISA. Antigens recognized by 2C8 and 8E10 were confirmed as CD43 by western blotting using the CD43-hFC recombinant protein. When expression on various leukemic cell lines was investigated, 2C8 and 8E10 displayed a disparity in the distribution of the epitope. Enzyme assays revealed that these mAbs recognized a sialic acid-dependent epitope on CD43. Using normal thymus and lymph node paraffin-embedded tissues, we confirmed a difference in the epitopes recognized by the two mAbs that was predicted based on the maturity of the cells in the tissue.

Parkin becomes localized to depolarized mitochondria in a PINK1-dependent manner and polyubiquitinates multiple mitochondrial outer membrane proteins. This permits ubiquitin-binding proteins (e.g., p62 and NBR1) to target impaired mitochondria to autophagosomes via Atg8/LC3II. Bcl-2 family proteins regulate mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization during apoptosis and can also influence macroautophagy via interactions with Beclin-1. Here, we show that Parkin-dependent mitophagy is antagonized by prosurvival members of the Bcl-2 family (e.g., Bcl-xL and Mcl-1) in a Beclin-1-independent manner. Bcl-2 proteins suppressed mitophagy through inhibition of Parkin translocation to depolarized mitochondria. Consistent with this, Parkin translocation to mitochondria was enhanced by BH3-only proteins or a BH3-only mimetic. Taken together with their role as regulators of apoptosis-associated mitochondrial permeabilization, as well as mitochondrial fission/fusion dynamics, this suggests that Bcl-2 family proteins act as global regulators of mitochondrial homeostasis.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

LAM- PCR for the first time provided evidence that leukemia in gene therapy treated patients originated from provirus induced overexpression of a neighboring proto-oncogene. The high sensitivity and specificity of LAM-PCR compared to existing methods like inverse PCR and ligation mediated (LM)-PCR is achieved by an initial preamplification step (linear PCR of 100 cycles) using biotinylated vector specific primers which allow subsequent reaction steps to be carried out on solid phase (magnetic beads). LAM-PCR is currently the most sensitive method available to identify unknown DNA which is located in the proximity of known DNA. Recently, a variant of LAM-PCR has been developed that circumvents restriction digest thus abrogating retrieval bias of integration sites and enables a comprehensive analysis of provirus locations in host genomes.

At the same time, studies were also performed on normal, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The first stages of apoptosis, connected with externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS), were evaluated after comparing the viability of tested cell lines treated with DOX-TRF conjugate or free DOX. Morphological changes of nuclei connected with apoptosis were analyzed by double staining Hoechst 33258/propidium iodide.

Inhibin (a non-steroidal glycoprotein hormone of gonadal origin) can be used as marker of fertility. The current study was conducted to evaluate inhibin levels in ALL patients and to estimate its correlation with some antioxidants in these in comparison with control subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted on sixty patients with ALL and thirty children as controls. Fasting blood samples were taken from each subject and analyzed for haemoglobin, serum protein, vitamin E and C, in addition to glutathione and inhibin. RESULTS: The results of the study showed highly significant decreases (p<0.001) in haemoglobin, glutathione and inhibin levels with significant decreases (p<0.05) in serum protein and vitamin E levels for patients group in comparison with controls while there was no significant differences in vitamin C. Moreover, there were significant correlations between inhibin levels and serum protein, glutathione and both vitamins (E and C) in the ALL patient group (r= 0.81, 0.80, 0.77 and 0.69, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The present results indicated infertility in patients with ALL demonstrated by low inhibin level as a consequence of abnormality in anti-oxidative metabolism due to the cancer process. So, it can be suggested the need for routine measurement of inhibin for leukemic patients to estimate the action of hormones of gonadal origin.",,"['Mehde, Atheer Awad', 'Mehdi, Wesen Adel', 'Zainulabdeen, Jwan Abdulmohsin', 'Abdulbari, Alaa Shawqi']","['Mehde AA', 'Mehdi WA', 'Zainulabdeen JA', 'Abdulbari AS']","['Department of Acceptable Analysis, Health and Medical Technical College, university of Baghdad, Baghdad, Iraq E-mail : waadmwa@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '57285-09-3 (Inhibins)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers/*blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infertility/blood/*diagnosis', 'Inhibins/*blood', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/complications/pathology', 'Prognosis']",,,2014/07/08 06:00,2015/03/04 06:00,['2014/07/08 06:00'],"['2014/07/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.12.4843 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2014;15(12):4843-6. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.12.4843.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The gene sequence for BCR/ABL mRNA was found from the GeneBank. The target gene site on the BCR/ABL mRNA were selected according to Max-Planck-Institute (MPI) and rational siRNA design rules, the secondary structure of the candidate targeted mRNA was predicted, the relevant thermodynamic parameters were analyzed, and the targeted gene sequences were compared with BLAST to eliminate any sequences with significant homology. Inhibition of proliferation was evaluated by MTT assay and colony-formation inhibiting test. Apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry (FCM) and the morphology of apoptotic cells was identified by Giemsa-Wright staining. Western blotting was used to analyze the expression of BCR/ABL fusion protein in K562 cells after siRNA treatment. RESULTS: The mRNA local secondary structure calculated by RNA structure software, and the optimal design of specific siRNA were contributed by bioinformatics rules. Five sequences of BCR/ABL siRNAs were designed and synthesized in vitro. Three sequences, siRNA1384, siRNA1276 and siRNA1786, which showed the most effective inhibition of K562 cell growth, were identified among the five candidate siRNAs, with a cell proliferative inhibitory rate nearly 50% after exposure to 12.5 nmol/L~50 nmol/L siRNA1384 for 24,48 and 72 hours. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of siRNA1384, siRNA1276 and siRNA1786 for 24 hours were 46.6 nmol/L, 59.3 nmol/L and 62.6 nmol/L, respectively, and 65.668 nmol/L, 76.6 nmol/L, 74.4 nmol/L for 72 hours. The colony-formation inhibiting test also indicated that, compared with control, cell growth of siRNA treated group was inhibited. FCM results showed that the rate of cell apoptosis increased 24 hours after transfecting siRNA. The results of annexinV/PI staining indicated that the rate of apoptosis imcreased (1.53%, 15.3%, 64.5%, 57.5% and 21.5%) following treamtne with siRNAs (siRNA34, siRNA372, siRNA1384, siRNA1276 and siRNA1786). Morphological analysis showed td typical morphologic changes of apoptosis such as shrunken, fragmentation nucleus as well as ""apoptotic bodies"" after K562 cell exposure to siRNA. Western blot analysis showed that BCR/ABL protein was reduced sharply after a single dose of 50 nmol/L siRNA transfection. CONCLUSIONS: Proliferation of K562 cells was remarkbly inhibited by siRNAs (siRNA1384, siRNA1276 and siRNA1786) in a concentration-dependent manner in vitro, with effective induction of apoptosis at a concentration of 50 nmol/L. One anti-leukemia mechanism in K562 cells appeared that BCR/ABL targeted protein was highly down-regulated.

To investigate whether the BTG1 deletions occur in other BCR-ABL1-positive acute leukemias besides BCP-ALL, we analyzed 44 leukemia cases harboring the BCR-ABL1 transcript [32 BCP-ALL, six mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL), and six chronic myeloid leukemia in B-lineage blast crisis (CML-BC)] by array-based comparative genomic hybridization and reverse transcription-PCR. BTG1 deletions were present in 31.8% of BCR-ABL1-positive acute leukemia patients, including 31.3% of BCP-ALL (10/32), 33.3% of MPAL (2/6), and 33.3% of CML-BC (B-lineage) (2/6) patients. Of note, the intragenic deletion breakpoints, mapping to 5 different positions at the proximal end of the breakpoint, clustered tightly within exon 2 of BTG1, which were located within a stretch of 20 bp from nucleotide 284 to nucleotide 304 and led to truncated BTG1 transcripts. There were no significant differences in the median white blood cell count, hemoglobin concentration, platelet count, bone marrow blast count, sex, age, or overall complete remission rate between patients with and without BTG1 deletions. Taken together, our data suggest that BTG1 deletions might play a role in leukemogenesis of BCP-ALL as well as of BCR-ABL1-positive MPAL and CML-BC (B-lineage).",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Conversely, the suppression of non-malignant tissues is one of the leading characteristics of the course of ALL. Both the non-malignant suppression and malignant cell survival may be partly affected by soluble factors within the bone marrow (BM) environment. Here, we aimed to identify proteins in BM plasma of children with ALL that may contribute to ALL aggressiveness and/or the microenvironment-mediated survival of ALL cells. LBMp (leukemic bone marrow plasma) at the time of ALL diagnosis was compared to control plasma of bone marrow (CBMp) or peripheral blood (CPBp) using a cytokine antibody array. The cytokine antibody array enabled simultaneous detection of 79 proteins per sample. Candidate proteins exhibiting significantly different profiles were further analyzed and confirmed by ELISA. mRNA expression of one of the candidate proteins (TIMP1) was studied using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR). The cytokine antibody array experiments identified 23 proteins that differed significantly (p<0.05); of these, two proteins (TIMP1 and LIF) withstood the Bonferroni correction. In contrast, little difference was observed between CBMp and CPBp. At the diagnosis of ALL, changes in the soluble microenvironment are detectable in BM plasma.

In this study, we aimed to identify GPCRs that might contribute to the self-renewal of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). METHODS: The expression levels of pluripotent genes and GPCR gene were detected in E14 mESCs using PCR array and RT-PCR. Immunofluorescent staining was used to examine the expression of pluripotent markers and the receptor translocation. Western blot analysis was used to detect phosphorylation of signal proteins. Knock-down of receptor was conducted to confirm its role in pluripotency maintenance. RESULTS: In leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-free medium, mESCs lost the typical morphology of pluripotency, accompanied by markedly decreases in expression of somatostatin receptor type 2 (SSTR2), as well as the pluripotency biomarkers Oct4, Sox2, Rex1 and Nanog. Addition of the SSTR2 agonist octreotide or seglitide (0.1-30 mumol/L) in LIF-free medium dose-dependently promoted the self-renewal of mESCs, whereas the SSTR2 antagonist S4 (0.03-3 mumol/L) dose-dependently blocked octreotide-induced self-renewal. Knock-down of SSTR2 significantly decreased the self-renewal of mESCs even in the presence of LIF. Addition of LIF (1000 U/mL) or octreotide (1 mumol/L) in LIF-free medium significantly increased both phosphorylation and nuclear ocalization of STAT3.

The PubMed database, The Cochrane Library, conference proceedings, EMBASE databases, and references of published trials and review articles were searched. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of the trials and extracted data. Hazard ratios (HRs) for disease-free survival (DFS) and odds ratios (OR) for 5-year DFS were pooled using the STATA package. Ultimately, six trials involving 515 patients with pediatric T-ALL were analyzed. The pooled HR (1.07 [0.32, 3.56], p = 0.91) for DFS and OR (1.30 [0.52, 3.27], p = 0.57) for 5-year DFS showed that the TLX3-positive group showed no statistically significant difference with the TLX3-negative group.

The blood is then separated into its various components through apheresis; buffy coat cells are thereafter treated with 8-methoxypsoralen before exposure to ultraviolet light and finally reinfused into the patient. There is a general agreement that this treatment has an anti-GVHD effect, but the mechanisms of action behind this effect are only partly understood. However, altered maturation of dendritic cells (DC) and thereby indirect modulation of T-cell reactivity seems to be one important mechanism together with DC-presentation of antigens derived from apoptotic donor T cells and induction of regulatory T cells. The treatment has been best studied in patients with chronic GVHD (both pediatric and adult patients), but most studies are not randomized and it is difficult to know whether the treatment is more effective than the alternatives. The clinical studies of ECP in adults with acute GVHD are few and not randomized; it is not possible to judge whether this treatment should be a preferred second- or third-line treatment. There is no evidence for increased risk of leukemia relapse or suppression of specific graft versus leukemia reactivity by this treatment, so specific antileukemic immunotherapy may still be possible. Thus, even though the treatment seems effective in patients with GVHD, further clinical (especially randomized) as well as biological studies with careful standardization of the treatment are needed before it is possible to conclude how ECP should be used in acute and chronic GVHD.",,"['Bruserud, Oystein', 'Tvedt, Tor Henrik Anderson', 'Paulsen, Petter Quist', 'Ahmed, Aymen Bushra', 'Gedde-Dahl, Tobias', 'Tjonnfjord, Geir E', 'Slastad, Heidi', 'Heldal, Dag', 'Reikvam, Hakon']","['Bruserud O', 'Tvedt TH', 'Paulsen PQ', 'Ahmed AB', 'Gedde-Dahl T', 'Tjonnfjord GE', 'Slastad H', 'Heldal D', 'Reikvam H']","['Section for Hematology, Institute of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway, oystein.bruserud@haukeland.no.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20140705,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,,IM,"['Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Photopheresis/*methods', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,2014/07/06 06:00,2014/11/11 06:00,['2014/07/06 06:00'],"['2013/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-014-1578-z [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2014 Aug;63(8):757-77. doi: 10.1007/s00262-014-1578-z.

However, its role in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a malignant counterpart of normal progenitor B cells, is not fully understood. Here we show that SOX4 is highly expressed in human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. To systematically study the function of Sox4 in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, we established a genetically defined mouse leukemia model by transforming progenitor B cells carrying a floxed Sox4 allele and inducing deletion of the allele by the self-excising Cre recombinase. This model allowed us to work with two groups of leukemic cells that had either one copy or both copies of Sox4 deleted. We found that depletion of Sox4 in transformed cells in vitro reduced cell growth in vitro and the progression of leukemia in vivo. Moreover, depletion of Sox4 in leukemic cells in vivo prolonged the survival of the mice, suggesting that it could be a potential target in acute lymphoblastic leukemia therapy. Our microarray and bioChIP studies revealed that Tcf7l1 was the key gene directly regulated by Sox4. Knockdown of Tcf7l1 reduced cell proliferation, just as did knockout of Sox4, and ectopic expression of Tcf7l1 could reverse the effect of Sox4 knockout on cell proliferation. These data suggest that Sox4 and Tcf7l1 form a functional axis that promotes the progression of BCR-ABL-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Ma, Haiqing', 'Mallampati, Saradhi', 'Lu, Yue', 'Sun, Baohua', 'Wang, Enze', 'Leng, Xiaohong', 'Gong, Yun', 'Shen, Haifa', 'Yin, C Cameron', 'Jones, Dan', 'Amin, Hesham M', 'You, M James', 'Zweidler-McKay, Patrick', 'Ma, Yupo', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Arlinghaus, Ralph B', 'Glassman, Armand', 'Sun, Xiaoping']","['Ma H', 'Mallampati S', 'Lu Y', 'Sun B', 'Wang E', 'Leng X', 'Gong Y', 'Shen H', 'Yin CC', 'Jones D', 'Amin HM', 'You MJ', 'Zweidler-McKay P', 'Ma Y', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Arlinghaus RB', 'Glassman A', 'Sun X']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and the Center for Stem Cell and Developmental Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC), Houston, TX, USA Department of Oncology, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Zhuhai, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and the Center for Stem Cell and Developmental Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC), Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Carcinogenesis, The University of Texas MDACC, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and the Center for Stem Cell and Developmental Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC), Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and the Center for Stem Cell and Developmental Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC), Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MDACC, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MDACC, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Nanomedicine, Houston Methodist Research Institute, TX, and Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MDACC, Houston, TX, USA.', 'School of Health Sciences, The University of Texas MDACC, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MDACC, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MDACC, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The University of Texas MDACC, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stony Brook University Medical Center, Stony Brook, NY, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MDACC, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MDACC, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, and Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, The University of Texas Houston Health Science Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and the Center for Stem Cell and Developmental Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC), Houston, TX, USA xsun@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140704,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SOXC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factor 7-Like 1 Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'SOXC Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factor 7-Like 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Burden/genetics']",,,2014/07/06 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2014/07/06 06:00'],"['2014/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2014.104695 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2014.104695 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2014 Oct;99(10):1591-8. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2014.104695.

The best strategies and timing of administration of lymphocytes are unclear. We analyzed 155 patients who relapsed after allogeneic stem cell transplantation with disease detectable only by molecular methods and who subsequently received lymphocytes. Transplants were performed in first chronic phase (n=125) or in advanced disease (n=29) from identical siblings (n=84) or unrelated donors (n=71) between 1986 and 2003. They received lymphocytes either during molecular relapse (n=85) or upon progression to more advanced disease (1993 to 2004). The median interval from relapse to lymphocyte infusion was 210 (0-1673) days. The median follow up after it was 46 (3-135) months. Overall survival was 76+/-4% at five years after lymphocyte infusions (89+/-8% with sibling donors and 63+/-13% with unrelated donors (P=0.003)). Survival was 69+/-14% when lymphocytes were given within six months of the detection of molecular relapse and 81+/-10% (P=0.061) when given later; 81+/-11% if given at molecular relapse versus 71+/-12% (P=0.26) with more advanced disease. In multivariate analysis survival was worse if the donor was unrelated (HR 2.54 (95% CI: 1.15-5.53), P=0.021) and better with lymphocyte infusions beyond six months from molecular relapse (HR 0.4 (95%CI: 0.19-0.84), P=0.018).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the cause of death, place of death and PC utilization of older adults (age 60 years or above) suffering from AML. METHODS: Patients were recruited retrospectively from two hematology units in Hong Kong, which consisted of one university department with Bone Marrow Transplant service, and one regional hospital with hematology specialty service. Collaboration with PC unit was established. Elderly AML patients referred to PC service were included. Medical records of all identified patients would be reviewed retrospectively by two PC physicians. RESULTS: From October 2011 to April 2013, 156 hematological cancer patients were referred for PC; 43 elderly AML patients were included into data analysis. The median time from AML diagnosis to death was 9.1 months. Up to 46.5% patients received supportive care alone since diagnosis. More than half of elderly AML patients died in acute ward and hematology units (53.5 %), while 30.2 % died in PC settings. Overall, 51.2% of patients spent the whole period of their final month of life in-hospital. Infection-related diagnoses contributed to 51.2% of deaths. Median time from AML diagnosis to first PC consultation was 1.0 month. PC service includes psychosocial support (100%), hospice in-patient care (30.2%), homecare (60.5%), PC outpatient clinic (14.0%) and bereavement care (93.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Elderly AML patients carry dismal prognosis with their final phase of disease mostly hospitalized in acute care settings. Infections and bleeding could complicate course of illness and lead to rapid deterioration. PC collaboration remains important in psychosocial support and coverage of dying AML patients in non-hospice settings.",,"['Cheng, Hon-Wai Benjamin', 'Li, Cho-Wing', 'Chan, Kwok-Ying', 'Au, Ho-Yan', 'Chan, Pan-Fong', 'Sin, Yim-Ching', 'Szeto, Yan', 'Sham, Mau-Kwong']","['Cheng HW', 'Li CW', 'Chan KY', 'Au HY', 'Chan PF', 'Sin YC', 'Szeto Y', 'Sham MK']","['Palliative Medical Unit, Grantham Hospital, 125 Wong Chuk Hang Road, Aberdeen, Hong Kong, SAR, China, benchw@hkstar.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140705,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aging', 'Female', 'Home Care Services/statistics & numerical data', 'Hong Kong', 'Hospice Care/*statistics & numerical data', 'Hospices', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'Palliative Care/*statistics & numerical data', 'Prognosis', 'Referral and Consultation', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Terminally Ill']",,,2014/07/06 06:00,2015/06/09 06:00,['2014/07/06 06:00'],"['2014/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00520-014-2333-x [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2015 Jan;23(1):111-6. doi: 10.1007/s00520-014-2333-x.

We retrospectively collected data of 477 patients who were aged over 60 years at the time of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) diagnosis.

In the induction group, the complete remission (CR) rate was 58.3 %, and treatment-related death was 15.4 %. Successful induction was related to good performance [Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG <2)] [hazard ratio (HR) 3.215; P = 0.002]. Mortality correlated with failure to achieve CR (HR 4.059; P < 0.001) and poor performance status (ECOG >2) (HR 2.731; P = 0.035). In CR patients, poor karyotype and absence of consolidation (HR 2.313; P = 0.003) correlated with mortality. More than one cycle of consolidation was associated with better OS (P < 0.001). Lack of salvage therapy was associated with mortality in patients who did not achieve CR (HR 3.223; P = 0.005).

Overexpression of FANCF in K562 drug-sensitive cells partially reproduced the drug-resistant phenotype.

Here, we identify a connection between miR-155 and Notch signaling in this context. Loss of Notch signaling in the bone marrow (BM) niche alters hematopoietic homeostasis and leads to lethal myeloproliferative-like disease. Mechanistically, Notch signaling represses miR-155 expression by promoting binding of RBPJ to the miR-155 promoter. Loss of Notch/RBPJ signaling upregulates miR-155 in BM endothelial cells, leading to miR-155-mediated targeting of the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) inhibitor kappaB-Ras1, NF-kappaB activation, and increased proinflammatory cytokine production. Deletion of miR-155 in the stroma of RBPJ(-/-) mice prevented the development of myeloproliferative-like disease and cytokine induction. Analysis of BM from patients carrying myeloproliferative neoplasia also revealed elevated expression of miR-155. Thus, the Notch/miR-155/kappaB-Ras1/NF-kappaB axis regulates the inflammatory state of the BM niche and affects the development of myeloproliferative disorders.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Furthermore, Quantitative Structure-Activity relationships (QSAR) model is conducted to predict the toxicities (EC50 values) of various ILs toward the Leukemia rat cell line IPC-81. Four parameters selected by the heuristic method (HM) are used to perform the studies of multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector machine (SVM). The squared correlation coefficient (R(2)) and the root mean square error (RMSE) of training sets by two QSAR models are 0.918 and 0.959, 0.258 and 0.179, respectively.

Here, we show that aberrant overexpression of the Ellis Van Creveld (EVC) family is responsible for cellular Hedgehog (HH) activation, which provides the pro-survival ability of ATL cells. Using microarray, quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry we have demonstrated that EVC is significantly upregulated in ATL and human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-1)-infected cells. Epigenetic marks, including histone H3 acetylation and Lys4 trimethylation, are specifically accumulated at the EVC locus in ATL samples. The HTLV-1 Tax participates in the coordination of EVC expression in an epigenetic fashion. The treatment of shRNA targeting EVC, as well as the transcription factors for HH signaling, diminishes the HH activation and leads to apoptotic death in ATL cell lines. We also showed that a HH signaling inhibitor, GANT61, induces strong apoptosis in the established ATL cell lines and patient-derived primary ATL cells. Therefore, our data indicate that HH activation is involved in the regulation of leukemic cell survival. The epigenetically deregulated EVC appears to play an important role for HH activation. The possible use of EVC as a specific cell marker and a novel drug target for HTLV-1-infected T-cells is implicated by these findings. The HH inhibitors are suggested as drug candidates for ATL therapy. Our findings also suggest chromatin rearrangement associated with active histone markers in ATL.","['(c) 2014 The Authors.

RESULTS: Here, we explore whether chromatin conformation can be used to classify human leukemia. We map the conformation of the HOXA gene cluster in a panel of cell lines with 5C chromosome conformation capture technology, and use the data to train and test a support vector machine classifier named 3D-SP. We show that 3D-SP is able to accurately distinguish leukemias expressing MLL-fusion proteins from those expressing only wild-type MLL, and that it can also classify leukemia subtypes according to MLL fusion partner, based solely on 5C data.

Previously, using an integrated genomic analysis of matched diagnosis-relapse paired samples, we identified overactivation of the Wnt pathway as a possible mechanism of recurrence. To validate these findings and document whether Wnt inhibition may sensitize cells to chemotherapy, we analysed the expression of activated beta-catenin (and its downstream target BIRC5) using multiparameter phosphoflow cytometry and tested the efficacy of a recently developed Wnt inhibitor, iCRT14, in ALL cell lines and patient samples. We observed increased activation of beta-catenin at relapse in 6/10 patients. Furthermore, treatment of leukaemic cell lines with iCRT14 led to significant downregulation of Wnt target genes and combination with traditional chemotherapeutic drugs resulted in a synergistic decrease in viability as well as a significant increase in apoptotic cell death. Finally, pre-treatment of purified blasts from patients with relapsed leukaemia with the Wnt inhibitor followed by exposure to prednisolone, restored chemosensitivity in these cells. Our results demonstrate that overactivation of the Wnt pathway may contribute to chemoresistance in relapsed childhood ALL and that Wnt-inhibition may be a promising therapeutic approach.",['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Dandekar, Smita', 'Romanos-Sirakis, Eleny', 'Pais, Faye', 'Bhatla, Teena', 'Jones, Courtney', 'Bourgeois, Wallace', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Raetz, Elizabeth A', 'Hermiston, Michelle L', 'Dasgupta, Ramanuj', 'Morrison, Debra J', 'Carroll, William L']","['Dandekar S', 'Romanos-Sirakis E', 'Pais F', 'Bhatla T', 'Jones C', 'Bourgeois W', 'Hunger SP', 'Raetz EA', 'Hermiston ML', 'Dasgupta R', 'Morrison DJ', 'Carroll WL']","['NYU Cancer Institute, NYU Langone Medical Center, New York, NY.', 'NYU Cancer Institute, NYU Langone Medical Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Staten Island University Hospital.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California School of Medicine, San Francisco, California.', 'NYU Cancer Institute, NYU Langone Medical Center, New York, NY.', 'NYU Cancer Institute, NYU Langone Medical Center, New York, NY.', 'NYU School of Medicine.', 'University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado.', 'NYU Cancer Institute, NYU Langone Medical Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California School of Medicine, San Francisco, California.', 'NYU Cancer Institute, NYU Langone Medical Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, NYU Langone Medical Center, New York, NY.', 'NYU Cancer Institute, NYU Langone Medical Center, New York, NY.', 'NYU Cancer Institute, NYU Langone Medical Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Pathology, NYU Langone Medical Center, New York, NY.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140704,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism', 'Wnt Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['Wnt inhibition', 'acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'chemosensitivity', 'phosphoflow cytometry', 'relapse']",2014/07/06 06:00,2014/11/19 06:00,['2014/07/05 06:00'],"['2014/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.13011 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2014 Oct;167(1):87-99. doi: 10.1111/bjh.13011.

Human NB4 cell line appears to be a suitable in vitro model to express the characteristics of APL. In this work, we have investigated the effects of esculetin, a coumarin derivative with antioxidant properties, on the viability, the induction of apoptosis and the expression of apoptotic factors in NB4 cells. Cells treated with esculetin at several concentrations (20-500 muM) and for different times (5-24 h) showed a concentration- and time-dependent viability decrease with increased subdiploid DNA production. Esculetin inhibited cell cycle progression and induced DNA fragmentation. Moreover, annexin-V-FITC cytometry assays suggested that increased toxicity is due to both early and late apoptosis. This apoptosis process is be mediated by activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9. Treatments with progressively increasing concentrations (from 100 muM to 500 muM) of esculetin produced a reduction of Bcl2/Bax ratio in NB4 cells at 19 h, without affecting p53 levels. Proapoptotic action of esculetin involves the ERK MAP kinase cascade since increased levels of phosphorylated ERK were observed after those treatments. Increments in the levels of phosphorylated-Akt were also observed. Additionally, esculetin induced the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential with a release of cytochrome c into the cytosol which starts at 6 h of treatment with esculetin and increases up to 24 h. Esculetin induced an increase in superoxide anion at long times of treatment and a reduction of peroxides at short times (1 h) with an observed increase at 2-4 h of treatment. No significant changes in NO production was observed. Esculetin reduced the GSH levels in a time-dependent manner.

It has the potential, when interpreted carefully and in relation to the clinical history, to provide very useful information to assist in diagnosis and management. Clinicians are often alerted to the presence of a primary haematological disorder by abnormalities in the FBC. For the purpose of this review these diseases will not be discussed in detail but the reader will be alerted to pointers which might indicate primary blood disorders throughout the text. The haematology laboratory in large teaching hospitals will often provide up to 1,500 automated FBC analyses each day. These are individually checked for 'flags' provided by the analyser which indicate values outside the normal range. It is clearly essential that clinical information is provided with the request as this will influence how the result is handled by scientific and medical staff. Furthermore, significant abnormalities will generate a blood film request and the report will be most useful when interpreted in light of the patient's working diagnosis. In cases where a diagnosis is not yet known, even brief information on presentation, for example 'collapse with hypotension', 'fever on return to UK', 'weight loss and anorexia', can all be important and help the lab provide clinicians with guidance. This short review aims to provide physicians with a workable guide to the interpretation of some of the commoner findings in the full blood count. Some of these will be very familiar to you but some will not. This review is not meant to be exhaustive as the rare minutiae will obscure the essential core material.

Dunal (Ashwagandha) is used over centuries in the ayurvedic medicines in India. Withaferin A, a withanolide, is the major compound present in leaf extract of the plant which shows anticancer activity against leukemia, breast cancer and colorectal cancer. It arrests the ovarian cancer cells in the G2/M phase in dose dependent manner. In the current study we show the effect of Withaferin A on cell cycle regulation of colorectal cancer cell lines HCT116 and SW480 and its effect on cell fate. Treatment of these cells with this compound leads to apoptosis in a dose dependent manner. It causes the G2/M arrest in both the cell lines. We show that Withaferin A (WA) causes mitotic delay by blocking Spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) function. Apoptosis induced by Withaferin A is associated with proteasomal degradation of Mad2 and Cdc20, an important constituent of the Spindle Checkpoint Complex. Further overexpression of Mad2 partially rescues the deleterious effect of WA by restoring proper anaphase initiation and keeping more number of cells viable.

As the inhibition for those tumor-associated mutant IDH proteins may induce differentiation of those cancer cells, these tumor-associated mutant IDH proteins can be treated as a drug target proteins for a differentiation therapy against cancers. In this study, we aim to identify the potent TCM compounds from the TCM Database@Taiwan as lead compounds of IDH2 R140Q mutant inhibitor. Comparing to the IDH2 R140Q mutant protein inhibitor, AGI-6780, the top two TCM compounds, precatorine and abrine, have higher binding affinities with target protein in docking simulation. After MD simulation, the top two TCM compounds remain as the same docking poses under dynamic conditions. In addition, precatorine is extracted from Abrus precatorius L., which represents the cytotoxic and proapoptotic effects for breast cancer and several tumor lines.

An Analysis of a Series of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Patients.,FC04-7,10.7860/JCDR/2014/7994.4405 [doi],"UNLABELLED: Backgorund: Angiogenesis is associated with growth, dissemination and metastasis of tumours. Measurement of Microvascular Density (MVD) is a quantitative method of assessment of angiogenesis and would give a proportional co relate of the angiogenic process in tumours. The aim of this study is to measure the MVD by using CD34 staining in various phases of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) and type of CML (Granulocytic/Granulocytic Megakaryocytic) (G/GM) and to co-relate micro vascular densities with the grade of fibrosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bone marrow biopsy specimens of 30 CML patients and 20 non-CML (controls) cases that required bone marrow biopsy were subjected to CD34 staining and H&E staining. The mean MVD in CD34 slides was assessed by selecting hot spots and MVD was measured in these fields in high power (40 x magnification) and the mean MVD was calculated by taking the average of four hot spots per field. Grade of fibrosis and phase of CML, type (G/GM) were assessed in H&E slides. The controls were matched with respect to age and gender. RESULTS: Among 30 patients with CML, 21 were in chronic phase, five in accelerated and four in blast crisis. A normal distribution was obtained for MVD of both CML cases and controls using tests for normality. Comparison of mean MVD between CML and controls by student t-test showed a significant increase in MVD of CML cases (p = 0. 00026). However, no significant difference in MVD between the three phases viz, Chronic, accelerated and blast crisis phase (p = 0. 302) was obtained by using one way ANOVA. Comparison of Grade of fibrosis with MVD using independent t-test showed no significant difference in MVD between low (Grade1&2) and high grade (Grade 3&4) (p = . 805). No significant difference in MVD was obtained between G and GM types of CML using independent t-test (p = 0. 381). CONCLUSION: The study shows that there is a significant increase in MVD in CML cases than controls but no significant difference in MVD could be demonstrated between different phases of CML, histological types of CML and grades of fibrosis in CML.",,"['Mahadevan, Krishnan Kulumani', 'Basu, Debdatta', 'Kumar, Swarup']","['Mahadevan KK', 'Basu D', 'Kumar S']","['Intern, JIPMER , Pondicherry, India .', 'Professor, Department of Pathology, JIPMER , Pondicherry, India .', 'Intern, JIPMER , Pondicherry, India .']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140515,India,J Clin Diagn Res,Journal of clinical and diagnostic research : JCDR,101488993,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Angiogenesis', 'CD34 (Cluster of differentiation)', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)', 'MVD (Microvascular Density)']",2014/07/06 06:00,2014/07/06 06:01,['2014/07/05 06:00'],"['2013/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7860/JCDR/2014/7994.4405 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Diagn Res. 2014 May;8(5):FC04-7. doi: 10.7860/JCDR/2014/7994.4405.

We and others have previously shown that FDA-approved statins, which are used to control hypercholesterolemia and target the mevalonate pathway (MVA), can trigger tumor-selective apoptosis. Our goal was to identify other FDA-approved drugs that synergize with statins to further enhance the anticancer activity of statins in vivo. Using a screen composed of other FDA approved drugs, we identified dipyridamole, used for the prevention of cerebral ischemia, as a potentiator of statin anticancer activity. The statin-dipyridamole combination was synergistic and induced apoptosis in multiple myeloma and AML cell lines and primary patient samples, whereas normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells were not affected. This novel combination also decreased tumor growth in vivo. Statins block HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), the rate-limiting enzyme of the MVA pathway. Dipyridamole blunted the feedback response, which upregulates HMGCR and HMG-CoA synthase 1 (HMGCS1) following statin treatment. We further show that dipyridamole inhibited the cleavage of the transcription factor required for this feedback regulation, sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 2 (SREBF2, SREBP2). Simultaneously targeting the MVA pathway and its restorative feedback loop is preclinically effective against hematologic malignancies.

TET2 mutations occurred in 7.6 % of the patients and were an independent marker of poor prognosis (p = 0.024). TET2 and IDH1/2 mutations strongly associated with aberrations in the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A. Functional studies confirmed previous work that neither nonsense truncations, nor missense TET2 mutations, induced 5-hydroxymethylcytosine formation. In addition, we now show that mutant TET2 forms did not act in a dominant negative manner when co-expressed with the wild-type protein. Finally, as loss-of-function TET2 mutations predicted poor outcome, we questioned whether low TET2 mRNA expression in cases of AML without TET2 mutations would affect overall survival.

In this study, we examined the anticancer effects of LG on the human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) HL60 and KG-1 cells. Our results showed that LG inhibited cell proliferation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner in both HL60 and KG-1 cells. The IC50s of LG in HL60 and KG-1 cells were 3.5 and 8.0 muM, respectively. Treatment with LG increased the proportions of annexin V-stained and sub-G1-phase HL60 and KG-1 cells. Moreover, activation of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways was involved in LG-induced AML cell apoptosis, accompanied by dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and Bcl-xL), upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bak, PUMA, DR4, and DR5), and increased caspase-2, -3, -8, and -9 activation. Our results also indicated that LG could induce monocytic differentiation in both HL60 and KG-1 cells, confirmed by morphological changes, nitroblue tetrazolium reduction assays, nonspecific esterase assays, and increased CD14 expression. After blocking LG-induced ERK and Sp1 expression using the ERK-specific inhibitor PD98059, monocytic differentiation in both HL60 and KG-1 cells decreased, suggesting that LG-induced differentiation proceeded through an ERK/Sp1 signaling axis.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Diagnosis is based on a careful examination of the blood smear and immunophenotyping of the tumour cells, with a panel of four markers being used specifically to screen for hairy cells (CD11c, CD25, CD103 and CD123). In 2011, the V600E mutation of the BRAF gene in exon 15 was identified in HCL; being present in HCL, it is absent in the variant form of HCL (HCL-v) and in splenic red pulp lymphoma (SRPL), two entities related to HCL. The management of patients with HCL has changed in recent years. A poorer response to purine nucleoside analogues (PNAs) is observed in patients with more marked leukocytosis, bulky splenomegaly, an unmutated immunoglobulin variable heavy chain (IgVH) gene profile, use of VH4-34 or with TP53 mutations. We present the recommendations of a group of 11 experts belonging to a number of French hospitals. This group met in November 2013 to examine the criteria for managing patients with HCL. The ideas and proposals of the group are based on a critical analysis of the recommendations already published in the literature and on an analysis of the practices of clinical haematology departments with experience in managing these patients.

These interactions have been primarily attributed to the hyperforin-mediated induction of some pharmacokinetic mechanisms. However, as previously demonstrated by our group, hypericin induces the expression of two ABC transporters: multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Because cisplatin (CDDP) and mitoxantrone (MTX) are potential substrates of ABC transporters, we investigated the effect of 24h hypericin pre-treatment on the cytotoxicity of CDDP and MTX in human cancer cell lines. CDDP-sensitive and -resistant ovarian adenocarcinoma cell lines A2780/A2780cis, together with HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells and ABCG2-over-expressing cBCRP subclone, were used in our experiments. We present CDDP cytotoxicity attenuated by hypericin pre-treatment in both A2780 and A2780cis cells and MTX cytotoxicity in HL-60 cells. In contrast, hypericin potentiated MTX-induced death in cBCRP cells. Interestingly, hypericin did not restore cell proliferation in rescued cells. Nevertheless, hypericin did increase the expression of MRP1 transporter in A2780 and A2780cis cells indicating the impact of hypericin on certain resistance mechanisms. Additionally, our results indicate that hypericin may be the potential substrate of BCRP transporter. In conclusion, for the first time, we report the ability of hypericin to affect the onset and/or progress of CDDP- and MTX-induced cell death, despite strong cell cycle arrest. Thus, hypericin represents another SJW metabolite that might be able to affect the effectiveness of anti-cancer drugs and that could interact with ABC transporters, particularly with BCRP.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In T-ALL, there is an early T-cell progenitor (ETP) subgroup that has a very high risk for relapse. In this study, we used mitochondrial BH3 profiling to determine antiapoptotic protein dependencies in T-ALL. We found that T-ALL cell lines and primary patient samples are dependent upon BCL-XL, except when the cancer bears an ETP phenotype, in which case it is BCL-2 dependent. These distinctions directly relate to differential sensitivity to the BH3 mimetics ABT-263 and ABT-199, both in vitro and in vivo. We thus describe for the first time a change of antiapoptotic protein dependence that is related to the differentiation stage of the leukemic clone. Our findings demonstrate that BCL-2 is a clinically relevant target for therapeutic intervention with ABT-199 in ETP-ALL. SIGNIFICANCE: ETP T-ALL is a treatment-resistant subtype of T-ALL for which novel targeted therapies are urgently needed. We have discovered, through BH3 profiling, that ETP-ALL is BCL-2 dependent and is very sensitive to in vitro and in vivo treatment with ABT-199, a drug well tolerated in clinical trials.",['(c)2014 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Chonghaile, Triona Ni', 'Roderick, Justine E', 'Glenfield, Cian', 'Ryan, Jeremy', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Wood, Brent', 'DeAngelo, Daniel J', 'Stone, Richard', 'Harris, Marian', 'Gutierrez, Alejandro', 'Kelliher, Michelle A', 'Letai, Anthony']","['Chonghaile TN', 'Roderick JE', 'Glenfield C', 'Ryan J', 'Sallan SE', 'Silverman LB', 'Loh ML', 'Hunger SP', 'Wood B', 'DeAngelo DJ', 'Stone R', 'Harris M', 'Gutierrez A', 'Kelliher MA', 'Letai A']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Genetics, The Smurfit Institute, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Benioff Children's Hospital, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California."", ""Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/BMT, University of Colorado School of Medicine and Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, Colorado."", 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Department of Pathology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.

Given the potential role for cancer stem cells in relapse, targeting of the leukemia-initiating cell (LIC) in AML may provide improved outcome following remission induction. However, due to overlap in their self-renewal program with normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), therapeutic targeting of the LIC may have an adverse effect on long-term hematopoietic recovery. Here we used a mouse model of relapsed AML to explore whether the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)1alpha inhibitor echinomycin can be used to treat relapsed AML without affecting host HSCs. We show that echinomycin cured 40% to 60% of mice transplanted with relapsed AML. Bone marrow cells from the cured mice displayed normal composition of HSCs and their progenitors and were as competent as those isolated from nonleukemic mice in competitive repopulation assays. Importantly, in mice with complete remission, echinomycin appeared to completely eliminate LICs because no leukemia could be propagated in vivo following serial transplantation. Taken together, our data demonstrate that in a mouse model of relapsed AML, low-dose echinomycin selectively targets LICs and spares normal hematopoiesis.",['(c) 2014 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Wang, Yin', 'Liu, Yan', 'Tang, Fei', 'Bernot, Kelsie M', 'Schore, Reuven', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Zheng, Pan', 'Liu, Yang']","['Wang Y', 'Liu Y', 'Tang F', 'Bernot KM', 'Schore R', 'Marcucci G', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Zheng P', 'Liu Y']","[""Center for Cancer and Immunology Research, Children's Research Institute, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC;"", ""Center for Cancer and Immunology Research, Children's Research Institute, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC;"", ""Center for Cancer and Immunology Research, Children's Research Institute, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC;"", 'Department of Biology, North Carolina A&T State University, Greensboro, NC;', ""Center for Cancer and Immunology Research, Children's Research Institute, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC;"", 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine and the Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH; and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine and the Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH; and.', ""Center for Cancer and Immunology Research, Children's Research Institute, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC; Division of Pathology and Sheik Zayed Institute for Surgical Innovation, Children's Research Institute, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC."", ""Center for Cancer and Immunology Research, Children's Research Institute, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC;""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140703,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Hif1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '512-64-1 (Echinomycin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Echinomycin/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2014/07/06 06:00,2015/04/29 06:00,['2014/07/05 06:00'],"['2014/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)39843-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-12-544221 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Aug 14;124(7):1127-35. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-12-544221.

Lymphoma and leukemia, melanoma, and lung carcinoma are the most common primary malignancies to cause breast metastasis; metastasis of soft tissue sarcoma to the breast is very rare. Here, we report a case of primary lower-extremity myxoid liposarcoma with the development of a solitary metastasis to the breast. To the best of our knowledge, no isolated case reports of solitary breast metastasis by myxoid liposarcoma have been previously reported in the English-language literature. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient, a 66-year-old woman, had been previously diagnosed with myxoid liposarcoma of the right thigh. At 21 months after complete surgical resection of the primary tumor with negative margins, a palpable tumor was identified in the patient's left breast. Needle biopsy revealed the presence of metastatic liposarcoma; positron emission tomography/computed tomography examination confirmed the metastasis as solitary, and no local recurrence of the primary tumor was identified. The patient underwent lumpectomy with negative margins and did not provide consent for adjuvant chemotherapy. As with the biopsy specimen and the total cleavage specimen, myxoid liposarcoma with metastasis to the breast was diagnosed. No recurrence or new metastases were observed five years after resection of the metastatic breast lesion. CONCLUSIONS: We have presented an extremely rare case of a solitary metastatic breast tumor arising from myxoid liposarcoma of the lower limbs. There is no standard treatment for the management of solitary breast metastasis from myxoid liposarcoma. Therefore, treatment should be guided by consideration of an individual patient's overall condition.",,"['Yokouchi, Masahiro', 'Nagano, Satoshi', 'Kijima, Yuko', 'Yoshioka, Takako', 'Tanimoto, Akihide', 'Natsugoe, Shoji', 'Komiya, Setsuro']","['Yokouchi M', 'Nagano S', 'Kijima Y', 'Yoshioka T', 'Tanimoto A', 'Natsugoe S', 'Komiya S']","['Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, 8-35-1 Sakuragaoka, Kagoshima 890-8520, Japan. masahiro@m3.kufm.kagoshima-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140704,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,,IM,"['Aged', 'Breast Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*secondary/*surgery', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Liposarcoma, Myxoid/*pathology', 'Radiography', 'Thigh/*pathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2014/07/06 06:00,2015/02/28 06:00,['2014/07/05 06:00'],"['2014/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/28 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-14-482 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-14-482 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2014 Jul 4;14:482. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-14-482.,,,,PMC4089553,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of our review is to summarize the current state of knowledge on miR-29 family members. METHODS: We performed literature searches involving miR-29 family members and their relationship to individual hematological malignancies, namely acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). We also searched for subgroups of hematological malignancies, e.g. multiple myeloma, that are regarded as members of the acute or chronic types of leukemias. RESULTS: A number of genes appear to be regulated by miR-29 family members in various physiological and pathological situations. In our view regulation of Tcl-1, Mcl-1 and DNA methyltransferases is relevant in case of hematological malignancies, hence these are the focus of this review. miR-29 family members also function during normal T-cell and B-cell development.

METHODS: Based on a search of the English literature for MUD transplant in Philadelphia-negative ALL, this review first compares the treatment outcomes of myeloablative allo-HSCT with MUD and MSD, followed by a mini-review of studies of non-myeloablative, reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) allo-HSCT in ALL, and finally measures to improve outcome of MUD allo-HSCT. RESULTS: Publications are inevitably confounded by inclusion of Philadelphia-positive cases, patients beyond CR1, and mismatched unrelated donors in addition to heterogeneity in the length of follow-up. Despite these limitations, the overall data showed that MUD allo-HSCT resulted in comparable survivals with matched related donor (MRD) transplant. Moreover, Asian studies reported a lower transplant-related mortality (TRM) than Western studies. As graft failure is infrequent even in the MUD setting, acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) remains a major cause of TRM. In addition, RIC allo-HSCT produced promising long-term disease-free survival (DFS) with a low TRM in adult ALL if transplanted in CR1. DISCUSSION: Potential ways to reduce TRM further include antifungal prophylaxis and optimal management of life-threatening non-infective interstitial pneumonitis. Moreover, harnessing graft-versus-leukemia effect with hypomethylating agents warrants clinical trial. CONCLUSION: Myeloablative MUD allo-HSCT resulted in comparable survivals with MRD transplant.

The demethylating, dose-dependent effect of arsenic trioxide (As2O3) on several tumor-related genes has already been postulated. However, whether such a demethylating effect also applies to the TMS1 gene in chronic myeloid leukemia cell line K562 cells has not been studied so far. The aim of the present study was to detect the methylation status of the TMS1 gene in K562 cells and the demethylation effect of As2O3 on TMS1 as well as TMS1 apoptosis-associated protein Bcl-2/Bax and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) expression. METHODS: TMS1 mRNA expression in K562 cells and normal bone marrow was determined by reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the DNA methylation status of the TMS1 promoter in K562 cells treated with different concentrations of As2O3 for 48 h was determined by methylation-specific PCR. RT-PCR and Western blot were used to detect TMS1 and DNMT expression. We also assessed TMS1-associated apoptosis protein Bcl-2/Bax expression by Western blot and apoptosis rates by flow cytometry using annexin V/propidium iodide double staining. RESULTS: In K562 cells, TMS1 was completely methylated and both TMS1 mRNA and protein showed a low expression, but 2 mumol/l As2O3 could significantly restore the expression of the TMS1 gene both at mRNA and protein level (p < 0.01) by fully reversing DNA methylation. As2O3 decreased mRNA and protein expression of DNMT1 (p < 0.05) in a dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometry showed that in the experimental group (2 mumol/l As2O3), cell apoptosis was significantly increased compared with the control group (no As2O3; p < 0.05). In the experimental group, Western blot showed that the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was significantly decreased; however, the proapoptotic protein Bax was markedly increased and the Bcl-2/Bax ratio was markedly reduced (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: As2O3 could restore the expression of TMS1 by inhibiting DNMT to reverse the hypermethylation and induced apoptosis of K562 cells by downregulation of Bcl-2/Bax expression.","['(c) 2014 S.

In this study, we evaluated EPZ-5676 in combination with standard of care (SOC) agents for acute leukemias as well as other chromatin-modifying drugs in cellular assays with three human acute leukemia cell lines: MOLM-13 (MLL-AF9), MV4-11 (MLL-AF4), and SKM-1 (non-MLL-r). Studies were performed to evaluate the antiproliferative effects of EPZ-5676 combinations in a cotreatment model in which the second agent was added simultaneously with EPZ-5676 at the beginning of the assay, or in a pretreatment model in which cells were incubated for several days in the presence of EPZ-5676 prior to the addition of the second agent. EPZ-5676 was found to act synergistically with the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) SOC agents cytarabine or daunorubicin in MOLM-13 and MV4-11 MLL-r cell lines. EPZ-5676 is selective for MLL-r cell lines as demonstrated by its lack of effect either alone or in combination in the nonrearranged SKM-1 cell line. In MLL-r cells, the combination benefit was observed even when EPZ-5676 was washed out prior to the addition of the chemotherapeutic agents, suggesting that EPZ-5676 sets up a durable, altered chromatin state that enhances the chemotherapeutic effects. Our evaluation of EPZ-5676 in conjunction with other chromatin-modifying drugs also revealed a consistent combination benefit, including synergy with DNA hypomethylating agents. These results indicate that EPZ-5676 is highly efficacious as a single agent and synergistically acts with other chemotherapeutics, including AML SOC drugs and DNA hypomethylating agents in MLL-r cells.","['Copyright (c) 2014 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental', 'Therapeutics.']","['Klaus, Christine R', 'Iwanowicz, Dorothy', 'Johnston, Danielle', 'Campbell, Carly A', 'Smith, Jesse J', 'Moyer, Mikel P', 'Copeland, Robert A', 'Olhava, Edward J', 'Scott, Margaret Porter', 'Pollock, Roy M', 'Daigle, Scott R', 'Raimondi, Alejandra']","['Klaus CR', 'Iwanowicz D', 'Johnston D', 'Campbell CA', 'Smith JJ', 'Moyer MP', 'Copeland RA', 'Olhava EJ', 'Scott MP', 'Pollock RM', 'Daigle SR', 'Raimondi A']","['Epizyme Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Epizyme Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Epizyme Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Epizyme Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Epizyme Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Epizyme Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Epizyme Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Epizyme Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Epizyme Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Epizyme Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Epizyme Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Epizyme Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts araimondi@epizyme.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140703,United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (EPZ-5676)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DOT1L protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Benzimidazoles/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Growth Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Methylation/drug effects', 'Methyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",,,2014/07/06 06:00,2014/09/30 06:00,['2014/07/05 06:00'],"['2014/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['jpet.114.214577 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.114.214577 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2014 Sep;350(3):646-56. doi: 10.1124/jpet.114.214577.

Recurrent mutations in DNA-modifying enzymes were identified in acute myeloid leukemia and linked to distinct DNA methylation signatures. In addition, discovery of Tet enzymes provided new mechanisms for the reversal of DNA methylation. Advances in base-resolution profiling of DNA methylation have enabled a more comprehensive understanding of the methylome landscape in the genome. This review will summarize and discuss the key questions in the function of DNA methylation in the hematopoietic system, including where and how DNA methylation regulates diverse biological processes in the genome as elucidated by recent studies.","['Copyright (c) 2014 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Relapsed or refractory disease that is resistant to ATRA is a clinically significant problem. To identify the molecular mechanism that bridges ATRA differentiation and resistance in cancer, we selected the multidrug-resistant leukemia cell line HL-60[R] by exposing it to ATRA, followed by sequential increases of one-half log concentration. A cytotoxicity analysis revealed that HL-60[R] cells were highly resistant to ATRA, doxorubicin, and etoposide. A comparative genome hybridization analysis of HL-60[R] cells identified gains of 4q34, 9q12, and 19q13 and a loss of Yq12 compared with in the parental HL-60 cell line. Transcriptional profiles and functional pathway analyses further demonstrated that 7 genes (FEN1, RFC5, EXO1, XRCC5, PARP1, POLR2F, and GTF2H3) that were relatively up-regulated in HL-60[R] cells and repressed in cells with ATRA-induced differentiation were related to mismatch repair in eukaryotes, DNA double-strand break repair, and nucleotide excision repair pathways.

Similar to normal hematopoiesis, leukemia is also hierarchically organized and a subpopulation of leukemic cells, the leukemic stem cells (LSCs), is responsible for disease initiation and maintenance and gives rise to more differentiated malignant cells. Although genetically abnormal, LSCs share many characteristics with normal HSCs, including quiescence, multipotency and self-renewal. Normal HSCs reside in a specialized microenvironment in the bone marrow (BM), the so-called HSC niche that crucially regulates HSC survival and function. Many cell types including osteoblastic, perivascular, endothelial and mesenchymal cells contribute to the HSC niche. In addition, the BM functions as primary and secondary lymphoid organ and hosts various mature immune cell types, including T and B cells, dendritic cells and macrophages that contribute to the HSC niche. Signals derived from the HSC niche are necessary to regulate demand-adapted responses of HSCs and progenitor cells after BM stress or during infection. LSCs occupy similar niches and depend on signals from the BM microenvironment. However, in addition to the cell types that constitute the HSC niche during homeostasis, in leukemia the BM is infiltrated by activated leukemia-specific immune cells. Leukemic cells express different antigens that are able to activate CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. It is well documented that activated T cells can contribute to the control of leukemic cells and it was hoped that these cells may be able to target and eliminate the therapy-resistant LSCs. However, the actual interaction of leukemia-specific T cells with LSCs remains ill-defined. Paradoxically, many immune mechanisms that evolved to activate emergency hematopoiesis during infection may actually contribute to the expansion and differentiation of LSCs, promoting leukemia progression.

We identified a set of microRNAs whose expression is altered upon BAG3 knockdown. Our primary objective was to examine the relationships between BAG3, miR-29b and Mcl-1, an antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein, in ovarian cancer cells. METHODS: Ovarian cancer cells were cultured and their responsiveness to paclitaxel was tested. Microarray analysis was performed to identify microRNAs differentially expressed in ES2 BAG3 knockdown ovarian cancer cells and their control cells. Primary ovarian cancer tissues were obtained from 56 patients operated on for ovarian cancer. The patients' clinical and pathological data were obtained from their medical records. RESULTS: BAG3 knockdown increased the chemosensitivity to paclitaxel of ES2 ovarian clear cell carcinoma cells to a greater degree than AMOC2 serous adenocarcinoma cells. qRT-PCR analysis showed that miR-29b expression was significantly upregulated in primary cancer tissue expressing low levels of BAG3, as compared to tissue expressing high levels. Moreover, levels of miR-29b correlated significantly with progression-free survival. Upregulation of miR-29b also reduced levels of Mcl-1 and sensitized ES2 cells to low-dose paclitaxel. CONCLUSIONS: BAG3 knockdown appears to downregulate expression of Mcl-1 through upregulation of miR-29b, thereby increasing the chemosensitivity of ovarian clear cell carcinoma cells. This suggests that BAG3 is a key determinant of the responsiveness of ovarian cancer cells, especially clear cell carcinoma, to paclitaxel and that BAG3 may be a useful therapeutic target for the treatment of ovarian cancer.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Patients with an eligible first primary MCC (n = 787) had more than double the expected number of subsequent primary cancers (SIR = 2.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.84-2.60; P<0.001).

Significantly increased bi-directional relative risks were found for melanoma, lip cancer, head and neck cancer, lung cancer, myelodysplastic diseases, and cancer with unknown primary site.

Pemetrexed arrests cell cycle by inhibiting three enzymes in purine and pyrimidine synthesis that are necessary for DNA synthesis. Pemetrexed also promotes apoptosis in target cells, but little is known about its mechanism in cancer cells. We have previously shown that pemetrexed can result in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and it can lead to downstream apoptosis. In this study, we further elucidate this mechanism. Our data show that pemetrexed increases Noxa expression through activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) upregulation. Furthermore, pemetrexed induces apoptosis by activating the Noxa-Usp9x-Mcl-1 pathway. Inhibition of Noxa by small interfering RNA (siRNA) promotes Usp9x (ubiquitin-specific peptidase 9, X-linked) expression. Moreover, downregulation of the deubiquitinase Usp9x by pemetrexed results in downstream reduction of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) expression. Mechanistically, Noxa upregulation likely reduces the availability of Usp9x to Mcl-1, thereby promoting its ubiquitination and degradation, leading to the apoptosis of neoplastic cells. Thus, our findings demonstrate that Noxa-Usp9x-Mcl-1 axis may contribute to pemetrexed-induced apoptosis in human lung cancer cells.",,"['Yan, J', 'Zhong, N', 'Liu, G', 'Chen, K', 'Liu, X', 'Su, L', 'Singhal, S']","['Yan J', 'Zhong N', 'Liu G', 'Chen K', 'Liu X', 'Su L', 'Singhal S']","['School of Life Sciences, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'School of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'School of Life Sciences, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Central Hospital of Xinwen Mining Group, Xintai, China.', 'School of Life Sciences, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'School of Life Sciences, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Surgery, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140703,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glutamates)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (USP9X protein, human)', '04Q9AIZ7NO (Pemetrexed)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/genetics/*metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Glutamates/*pharmacology', 'Guanine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Pemetrexed', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2014/07/06 06:00,2015/06/05 06:00,['2014/07/04 06:00'],"['2013/12/31 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/17 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2014281 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2014.281 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2014 Jul 3;5:e1316. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2014.281.,,,,PMC4123075,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Autophagosomes, unique double-membraned organelles, are characteristic for autophagy, a bulk degradation mechanism with cytoprotective and homeostatic function. Both, WIPI-1 and WIPI-2 are aberrantly expressed in several solid tumors, linking these genes to carcinogenesis. We now found that the expression of WIPI-1 was significantly reduced in a large cohort of 98 primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient samples (complex karyotypes; t(8;21); t(15,17); inv(16)). In contrast, the expression of WIPI-2 was only reduced in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a distinct subtype of AML (t(15,17)). As AML cells are blocked in their differentiation, we tested if the expression levels of WIPI-1 and WIPI-2 increase during all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced neutrophil differentiation of APL. According to the higher WIPI-1 expression in granulocytes compared with immature blast cells, WIPI-1 but not WIPI-2 expression was significantly induced during neutrophil differentiation of NB4 APL cells. Interestingly, the induction of WIPI-1 expression was dependent on the transcription factor PU.1, a master regulator of myelopoiesis, supporting our notion that WIPI-1 expression is reduced in AML patients lacking proper PU-1 activity. Further, knocking down WIPI-1 in NB4 cells markedly attenuated the autophagic flux and significantly reduced neutrophil differentiation. This result was also achieved by knocking down WIPI-2, suggesting that both WIPI-1 and WIPI-2 are functionally required and not redundant in mediating the PI3P signal at the onset of autophagy in NB4 cells. In line with these data, downregulation of PI3KC3 (hVPS34), which generates PI3P upstream of WIPIs, also inhibited neutrophil differentiation. In conclusion, we demonstrate that both WIPI-1 and WIPI-2 are required for the PI3P-dependent autophagic activity during neutrophil differentiation, and that PU.1-dependent WIPI-1 expression is significantly repressed in primary AML patient samples and that the induction of autophagic flux is associated with neutrophil differentiation of APL cells.",,"['Brigger, D', 'Proikas-Cezanne, T', 'Tschan, M P']","['Brigger D', 'Proikas-Cezanne T', 'Tschan MP']","['1] Division of Experimental Pathology, Institute of Pathology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland [2] Graduate School for Cellular and Biomedical Sciences, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Autophagy Laboratory, Interfaculty Institute for Cell Biology, Eberhard Karls University Tuebingen, Germany.', '1] Division of Experimental Pathology, Institute of Pathology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland [2] Graduate School for Cellular and Biomedical Sciences, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland [3] Department of Medical Oncology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140703,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Autophagy-Related Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Phosphate-Binding Proteins)', '0 (WIPI1 protein, human)', '0 (WIPI2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class III Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Autophagy', 'Autophagy-Related Proteins', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Class III Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/*cytology/metabolism', 'Phosphate-Binding Proteins', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/07/06 06:00,2015/06/05 06:00,['2014/07/04 06:00'],"['2014/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/13 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2014261 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2014.261 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2014 Jul 3;5:e1315. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2014.261.,,,,PMC4123064,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are highly stable in aqueous solutions as well as physiological media. In particular, oleic acid capped iron oxide particles (core diameter = 11 +/- 1 nm) were modified by a ligand exchange process in a one pot synthesis with dPG and dPGS bearing phosphonate as anchor groups. Dynamic light scattering measurements performed in water and different biological media demonstrate that the hydrodynamic diameter of the particles is only slightly increased by the ligand exchange process resulting in a final diameter of less than 30 nm and that the particles are stable in these media. It is also revealed by magnetic resonance studies that their magnetic relaxivity is reduced by the surface modification but it is still sufficient for high contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Additionally, incubation of dPGS functionalized iron oxide nanoparticles with human umbilical vein endothelial cells showed a 50% survival at 85 nM (concentration of nanoparticles). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies demonstrate that the dPGS functionalized iron oxide nanoparticles inhibit L-selectin ligand binding whereas the particles containing only dPG do not show this effect. Experiments in a flow chamber with human myelogenous leukemia cells confirmed L-selectin inhibition of the dPGS functionalized iron oxide nanoparticles and with that the L-selectin mediated leukocyte adhesion.

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy, safety and quality of life (QoL) in CML patients treated with imatinib or hydroxyurea. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted on 40 patients with pathologically confirmed CML in an in-patient department of Mahavir Cancer Sansthan and Research Centre (tertiary care cancer hospital) in India. Patients were divided into two groups (group A: Imatinib consuming patients and group B: Hydroxyurea consuming patients). Complete blood count was done every month to assess the efficacy and safety/toxicity profile of these drugs. The results were analyzed 12 months after completion of treatment. QoL was assessed by The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QoL Questionnaire core 30. Hematological response was analyzed using kaplan-meier survival analysis. Chi-square test was applied to assess the association of two regimens with complete hematological response, hematological and non-hematological toxicity. White blood cell (WBC) was noted each month in every patient of each group and analyzed by generalized linear mode (repeated measures) analysis of variance (ANOVA). Independent t-test was used to compare changes in QoL between treatment groups. FINDINGS: At the end of treatment, significant improvement (P = 0.001) in hematological response was observed in the group A (95%) compared to group B (30%). WBC count analyzed at each month of treatment by ANOVA achieved better results for patients treated with imatinib (P = 0.0001). The hematological toxicity was higher in imatinib group while non-hematological toxicity was higher in the hydroxyurea group; however only little toxicities such as nausea and constipation were statistically significant. QoL assessment of patients related to functional scale showed significantly better results in group A (P = 0.046). CONCLUSION: The study showed that imatinib has better profile compared to hydroxyurea, with siginificant statistical differences in terms of efficacy, non-hematological toxicity and QoL in CML patients. Even with such better efficacy and safety profile, pharmacoeconomic evaluation needs to be done to justify and support the use of imatinib for CML patients in India.",,"['Jain, Parveen', 'Das, V N R', 'Ranjan, Alok', 'Chaudhary, Rahul', 'Pandey, Krishna']","['Jain P', 'Das VN', 'Ranjan A', 'Chaudhary R', 'Pandey K']","['Department of Pharmacy Practice, National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPER), Hajipur, India.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences (ICMR), Patna, India.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences (ICMR), Patna, India.', 'Department of Clinical Oncology, Mahavir Cancer Institute and Research Centre, Patna, India.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences (ICMR), Patna, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,J Res Pharm Pract,Journal of research in pharmacy practice,101614023,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Hydroxyurea', 'Imatinib', 'quality of life']",2014/07/06 06:00,2014/07/06 06:01,['2014/07/04 06:00'],"['2014/07/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/2279-042X.128145 [doi]', 'JRPP-2-156 [pii]']",ppublish,J Res Pharm Pract. 2013 Oct;2(4):156-61. doi: 10.4103/2279-042X.128145.,,,,PMC4076923,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most patients with this disorder experience progressive worsening of blood cytopenias, with an increasing need for transfusion. The more advanced and severe the disorder, the greater the risk that it will progress to acute myeloid leukemia. Therapy is typically based on the patient's risk category, age, and performance status. Supportive care alone is a major option for lower-risk, older patients with MDS or those with comorbidities. The only potentially curative treatment option is hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, which is typically used to treat high-risk, younger patients. OBJECTIVE: To describe and compare the hematologic complications, healthcare utilization, and costs of supportive care in patients with MDS aged <50 years and in older patients aged >/=50 years. METHODS: Using the i3/Ingenix LabRx claims database, this retrospective study included patients who were continuously enrolled (ie, 6 months preindex through 1 year postindex) in the study and who had an initial claim of MDS (index date) between February 1, 2007, and July 31, 2008. Patients treated with hypomethylating agents or thalidomide analogues were excluded. Claims included information on office visits, medical procedures, hospitalizations, drug use, and tests performed. The hematologic complications, costs, and utilization analyses were stratified by age into 2 age-groups-patients aged <50 years and those aged >/=50 years. The MDS-related diagnoses, utilization, and costs were analyzed postindex. The data used in this study spanned the period from August 1, 2006, to July 31, 2009. RESULTS: We identified 1133 newly diagnosed patients with MDS who received supportive care only during the study period; of these, 19.5% were younger than age 50 years. These younger patients included more females (62.0% vs 52.5%; P = .011) and had fewer comorbidities (mean Charlson comorbidy index, 1.2 vs 2.4; P <.001) and physician office visits than those aged >/=50 years. Postindex, compared with the older patients, the younger patients had less use of erythropoietin therapy and fewer transfusions, anemia diagnoses, and potential complications of neutropenia and pneumonia diagnoses; however, more diagnoses of neutropenia and of decreased white blood cell counts were seen in the younger patients than in the older patients (P </=.034 for all comparisons). Furthermore, younger patients had fewer mean office visits in the postindex period than older patients (17.5 vs 24.2, respectively; P <.001) and fewer hospitalizations (32.1% vs 44.6%, respectively; P = .004), but they had a longer (although not statistically significant) mean length of hospital stay (21 vs 14 days, respectively; P = .131). Mean total healthcare charges were $96,277 (median, $21,287) in younger patients compared with $84,102 (median, $39,402) in older patients, although this difference, too, was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: MDS is associated with frequent and prolonged hospitalizations, frequent outpatient visits, and high costs in younger and in older patients who are receiving supportive care. Although this study shows that younger patients aged <50 years do not have significantly higher costs overall, a small proportion may have a higher healthcare utilization and cost-related burden of MDS than patients aged >/=50 years.",,"['Powers, Annette', 'Faria, Claudio', 'Broder, Michael S', 'Chang, Eunice', 'Cherepanov, Dasha']","['Powers A', 'Faria C', 'Broder MS', 'Chang E', 'Cherepanov D']","['Senior Director of Health Economics and Outcomes Research, Eisai Inc, Woodcliff Lake, NJ.', 'Director of Health Economics and Outcomes Research, Eisai Inc, Woodcliff Lake, NJ.', 'President, Outcomes Research, Partnership for Health Analytic Research, LLC, Beverly Hills, CA.', 'Chief Statistician, Outcomes Research, Partnership for Health Analytic Research, LLC, Beverly Hills, CA.', 'Associate Director, Outcomes Research, Partnership for Health Analytic Research, LLC, Beverly Hills, CA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am Health Drug Benefits,American health & drug benefits,101479877,,,,,,2012/11/01 00:00,2012/11/01 00:01,['2014/07/04 06:00'],"['2014/07/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Am Health Drug Benefits. 2012 Nov;5(7):455-65.,,,,PMC4031699,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study reports isolation and structural identification of six pennogenyl saponins obtained from P. quadrifolia rhizomes. The four spirostan saponins were obtained from P. quadrifolia for the first time. The cytotoxic effects of the sub-fractions and six compounds isolated from the plant extract were evaluated on tumour cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ethanol extract from the rhizomes of P. quadrifolia were partinioned using column chromatography. The saponins were isolated from the obtained sub-fractions by isocratic RP HPLC and their structures were determined by means of 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy and MALDI TOF MS. The cytotoxic effects of the sub-fractions and the isolated compounds were tested against human promyelocytic leukaemia cells (HL-60), human cervical adenocarcinoma cells (HeLa) and human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) using the [(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay.

DNA methyltransferase 3-like (DNMT3L) is an epigenetic regulator expressed in prospermatogonia, growing oocytes, and embryonic stem (ES) cells. Here, we demonstrate that DNMT3L enhances the interaction of repressive epigenetic modifiers, including histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), SET domain, bifurcated 1 (SETDB1), DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), and tripartite motif-containing protein 28 (TRIM28; also known as TIF1beta and KAP1) in ES cells and orchestrates retroviral silencing activity with TRIM28 through mechanisms including, but not limited to, de novo DNA methylation. Ectopic expression of DNMT3L in somatic cells causes methylation-independent retroviral silencing activity by recruitment of the TRIM28/HDAC1/SETDB1/DNMT3A/DNMT3L complex to newly integrated Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV) proviral DNA. Concurrent with this recruitment, we also observed the accumulation of histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) and heterochromatin protein 1 gamma (HP1gamma), as well as reduced H3K9 and H3K27 acetylation at Mo-MuLV proviral sequences. Ectopic expression of DNMT3L in late-passage mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) recruited cytoplasmically localized HDAC1 to the nucleus. The formation of this epigenetic modifying complex requires interaction of DNMT3L with DNMT3A as well as with histone H3. In fetal testes at embryonic day 17.5, endogenous DNMT3L also enhanced the binding among TRIM28, DNMT3A, SETDB1, and HDAC1. We propose that DNMT3L may be involved in initiating a cascade of repressive epigenetic modifications by assisting in the preparation of a chromatin context that further attracts DNMT3A-DNMT3L binding and installs longer-term DNA methylation marks at newly integrated retroviruses. IMPORTANCE: Almost half of the mammalian genome is composed of endogenous retroviruses and other retrotransposable elements that threaten genomic integrity. These elements are usually subject to epigenetic silencing. We discovered that two epigenetic regulators that lack enzymatic activity, DNA methyltransferase 3-like (DNMT3L) and tripartite motif-containing protein 28 (TRIM28), collaborate with each other to impose retroviral silencing. In addition to modulating de novo DNA methylation, we found that by interacting with TRIM28, DNMT3L can attract various enzymes to form a DNMT3L-induced repressive complex to remove active marks and add repressive marks to histone proteins. Collectively, these results reveal a novel and pivotal function of DNMT3L in shaping the chromatin modifications necessary for retroviral and retrotransposon silencing.","['Copyright (c) 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

In this study, we revisited the role of Tax SUMOylation using a strategy based on the targeting of Ubc9, the unique E2 SUMO-conjugating enzyme. We show that either a catalytically inactive form of Ubc9 (Ubc9-C93S) or Ubc9 small interfering RNA (siRNA) dramatically reduces Tax conjugation to endogenous SUMO-1 or SUMO-2/3, demonstrating that as expected, Tax SUMOylation is under the control of the catalytic activity of Ubc9. We further report that a non-SUMOylated Tax protein produced in 293T cells is still able to activate either a transfected or an integrated NF-kappaB reporter promoter and to induce expression of an NF-kappaB-regulated endogenous gene. Importantly, blocking Ubc9 activity in T cells also results in the production of a non-SUMOylated Tax that is still fully functional for the activation of a NF-kappaB promoter. These results provide the definitive evidence that Tax SUMOylation is not required for NF-kappaB-driven gene induction. IMPORTANCE: Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 is able to transform CD4(+) T lymphocytes. The viral oncoprotein Tax plays a key role in this process by promoting cell proliferation and survival, mainly through permanent activation of the NF-kappaB pathway. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms involved in NF-kappaB pathway activation by Tax is therefore a key issue to understand HTLV-1-mediated transformation. Tax SUMOylation was initially proposed to be critical for Tax-induced NF-kappaB promoter activation, which was challenged by our later observation that a low-level-SUMOylated Tax mutant was still functional for activation of NF-kappaB promoters. To clarify the role of Tax SUMOylation, we set up a new approach based on the inhibition of the SUMOylation machinery in Tax-expressing cells. We show that blocking the SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 abolishes Tax SUMOylation and that a non-SUMOylated Tax still activates NF-kappaB promoters in either adherent cells or T cells.","['Copyright (c) 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

In the gammaretroviruses, typified by Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV), gag and pol are in the same reading frame, separated by a UAG stop codon, and termination codon readthrough is required for expression of the viral Gag-Pol fusion protein. Here, we investigated the effect on MuLV replication of modulating readthrough efficiency. We began by manipulating the readthrough signal in the context of an infectious viral clone to generate a series of MuLV variants in which readthrough was stimulated or reduced. In carefully controlled infectivity assays, it was found that reducing the MuLV readthrough efficiency only 4-fold led to a marked defect and that a 10-fold reduction essentially abolished replication. However, up to an approximately 8.5-fold stimulation of readthrough (up to 60% readthrough) was well tolerated by the virus. These high levels of readthrough were achieved using a two-plasmid system, with Gag and Gag-Pol expressed from separate infectious clones. We also modulated readthrough by silencing expression of eukaryotic release factors 1 and 3 (eRF1 and eRF3) or by introducing aminoglycosides into the cells. The data obtained indicate that gammaretroviruses tolerate a substantial excess of viral Gag-Pol synthesis but are very sensitive to a reduction in levels of this polyprotein. Thus, as is also the case for ribosomal frameshifting, antiviral therapies targeting readthrough with inhibitory agents are likely to be the most beneficial. IMPORTANCE: Many pathogenic RNA viruses and retroviruses use ribosomal frameshifting or stop codon readthrough to regulate expression of their replicase enzymes. These translational ""recoding"" processes are potential targets for antiviral intervention, but we have only a limited understanding of the consequences to virus replication of modulating the efficiency of recoding, particularly for those viruses employing readthrough. In this paper, we describe the first systematic analysis of the effect of increasing or decreasing readthrough efficiency on virus replication using the gammaretrovirus MuLV as a model system. We find unexpectedly that MuLV replication is only slightly inhibited by substantial increases in readthrough frequency, but as with other viruses that use recoding strategies, replication is quite sensitive to even modest reductions. These studies provide insights into both the readthrough process and MuLV replication and have implications for the selection of antivirals against gammaretroviruses.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Csibra et al.'],"['Csibra, Eszter', 'Brierley, Ian', 'Irigoyen, Nerea']","['Csibra E', 'Brierley I', 'Irigoyen N']","['Division of Virology, Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Virology, Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Virology, Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom ni236@cam.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140702,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Codon, Terminator)', '0 (Fusion Proteins, gag-pol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Codon, Terminator/*genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, gag-pol/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/physiology', 'Mice', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Retroviridae Infections/*veterinary/virology', 'Rodent Diseases', '*Virus Replication']",,,2014/07/06 06:00,2015/01/23 06:00,['2014/07/04 06:00'],"['2014/07/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/23 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00898-14 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00898-14 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2014 Sep;88(18):10364-76. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00898-14.

We examined the direct effect of lenalidomide on CLL-cell proliferation induced by CD154-expressing accessory cells in media containing interleukin-4 and -10. Treatment with lenalidomide significantly inhibited CLL-cell proliferation, an effect that was associated with the p53-independent upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21(WAF1/Cip1) (p21). Silencing p21 with small interfering RNA impaired the capacity of lenalidomide to inhibit CLL-cell proliferation. Silencing cereblon, a known molecular target of lenalidomide, impaired the capacity of lenalidomide to induce expression of p21, inhibit CD154-induced CLL-cell proliferation, or enhance the degradation of Ikaros family zinc finger proteins 1 and 3. We isolated CLL cells from the blood of patients before and after short-term treatment with low-dose lenalidomide (5 mg per day) and found the leukemia cells were also induced to express p21 in vivo.

This is the first comprehensive phospho-flow study of both constitutive and cytokine-induced pSTAT3, pSTAT5, pAKT and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) expression in malignant plasma cells of patients with monoclonal gammopathies. In diagnostic BM samples from 65 patients with multiple myeloma (MM), interleukin (IL)-6-induced pSTAT3 proved to be a new and independent prognostic biomarker for improved survival. When combined with the International Staging System, 6 subgroups demonstrated stratified median survivals from 9 to 72 months (chi(2)=34.3; P<0.0001). In contrast, constitutive expression of pSTAT3, pSTAT5, pAKT and pERK did not assist the differential diagnosis nor determine prognosis.

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) CD38 is a marker of unfavorable prognosis and a central factor in the pathogenetic network underlying the disease: activation of CD38 regulates genetic pathways involved in proliferation and movement. Here we show that CD38 is enzymatically active in primary CLL cells and that its forced expression increases disease aggressiveness in a xenograft model. The effect is completely lost when using an enzyme-deficient version of CD38 with a single amino-acid mutation. Through the enzymatic conversion of NAD into ADPR (ADP-ribose) and cADPR (cyclic ADP-ribose), CD38 increases cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentrations, positively influencing proliferation and signaling mediated via chemokine receptors or integrins. Consistently, inhibition of the enzymatic activities of CD38 using the flavonoid kuromanin blocks CLL chemotaxis, adhesion and in vivo homing. In a short-term xenograft model using primary cells, kuromanin treatment traps CLL cells in the blood, thereby increasing responses to chemotherapy.

Using primers unique for either isoform, we found that both PKCzeta and PKMzeta were expressed in a subset of paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) cases carrying a TCF3 (E2A) chromosomal rearrangement. Combined PKCzeta and PKMzeta (PKC/Mzeta) protein as well as phosphorylation levels were elevated in ALL cases, especially TCF3-rearranged precursor B-ALL cases, compared with normal bone marrow (P<0.01). Furthermore, high PKC/Mzeta expression in primary ALL cells was associated with increased sensitivity to 6-thioguanine and 6-mercaptopurine (P<0.01), thiopurines used in ALL treatment. PKCzeta is believed to stabilize mismatch-repair protein MSH2, facilitating thiopurine responsiveness in T-ALL. However, PKC/Mzeta knockdown in a TCF3-rearranged cell line model decreased MSH2 expression but did not induce thiopurine resistance, indicative that the link between high PKC/Mzeta levels and thiopurine sensitivity in paediatric precursor B-ALL is not directly causal.

Patients were enrolled between 1992 and 2008 (median follow-up: 7.6 years). Eleven cross-validated SNPs were significantly associated with risk of relapse across protocols. SNP and biologic pathway level analyses associated relapse risk with leukemia aggressiveness, glucocorticosteroid pharmacology/response and drug transport/metabolism pathways. Classification and regression tree analysis identified three distinct risk groups defined by end of induction residual leukemia, white blood cell count and variants in myeloperoxidase (MPO), estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), lamin B1 (LMNB1) and matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP7) genes, ATP-binding cassette transporters and glucocorticosteroid transcription regulation pathways.

PLZF also affects key elements for cell cycle progression, such as cyclin A, and can affect the tumourigenicity of various cancers. Thus far, the behaviour of PLZF in thyroid carcinoma remains unclear. METHODS: We analysed the expression profile of PLZF in different types of benign and malignant thyroid lesions as well as in normal thyroid tissue. Specifically, we examined PLZF expression in normal thyroid (N; n = 4), adenomatous lesion (AL; n = 5), follicular adenoma (FA; n = 2), papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC; n = 20), and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC; n = 3) samples. PLZF expression was estimated by western blotting and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. RESULTS: PLZF was expressed in all samples of thyroid lesions examined. In N, AL, and FA, PLZF was mainly localized in the nucleus. In contrast, in PTC and ATC, PLZF was mainly expressed in the cytosol with high intensity. In more detail, the cytoplasmic IHC scores in PTC with capsular invasion (CI) and lymph node (LN) metastasis were higher than those in PTC without CI and LN metastasis.

This research aims to improve the knowledge on these topics. Thus, HRQoL between central nervous system (CNST) and non-central nervous system (non-CNST) adolescent cancer survivors was compared. The influence of selected factors (gender and years since diagnosis) on HRQoL was also analysed. In a cross-sectional design, 78 survivors (12-20 years) who were >/= 1 year free of oncological treatment answered the self-reported version of the KIDSCREEN-52. HRQoL mean scores of CNST survivors were lower in comparison with non-CNST in physical well-being and social support and peers dimensions. Furthermore, female gender was also related to lower HRQoL scores for both types of tumours in physical well-being and autonomy dimensions. Additionally, scores on psychological well-being, social support and peers, parent relations and home life and school environment dimensions decrease with length of time from diagnosis. Therefore, diagnosis of CNST and gender were related to lower HRQoL among survivors in some dimensions, whereas time from diagnosis was related to impaired HRQoL in other features.

To prevent alloimmunization or when alloimmunization is present, phenotype-matched and antigen-negative RBCs are transfused. To increase the probability of a phenotypic match, donors and recipients should share the same racial and/or ethnic background. Because the majority of patients with SCD are of African and Hispanic or Latino descent, a donor base of racial and ethnic minority donors providing an adequate supply of antigen-negative RBC units that can be phenotypically matched is required to meet the needs of frequently transfused patients. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The New York Blood Center began the PreciseMatch program in 2005 to increase donations among African American and Hispanic/Latino donors by 150 incremental units per month. To evaluate the program, we conducted a systematic analysis of program documentation, focus group results, and collections data by race and ethnicity over time. RESULTS: The program achieved 75% of the operationalized goal of a 150-unit-per-month increase; 75% of donors were first-time donors, with deferral rates at new drives as high as 50%. Significant time and effort was involved in cultivating the community connections that facilitated new drives. CONCLUSIONS: Although PreciseMatch fell short of targets, it served as a foundation for relationships with diverse communities. Further research is needed to understand better how to increase minority donation using existing infrastructure and in the face of market pressures to collect blood as efficiently as possible.",['(c) 2014 New York Blood Center.

SUMMARY ANSWER: Children born after ART showed no overall increase in the rate of cancer when compared with children born as a result of spontaneous conception. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Children born after ART have more adverse perinatal outcomes, i.e. preterm births, low birthweights and birth defects. Previous studies have shown divergent results regarding the risk of cancer among children born after ART. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A retrospective Nordic population-based cohort study was performed, comprising all children born after ART in Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Norway between 1982 and 2007. The mean (+/-standard deviation) follow-up time was 9.5 (4.8) years. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Children born after ART (n = 91 796) were compared with a control group of children born after spontaneous conception. This control group was almost 4-fold the size of the ART group (n = 358 419) and matched for parity, year of birth and country. Data on perinatal outcomes and cancer were obtained from the National Medical Birth Registries, the Cancer Registries, the Patient Registries and the Cause of Death Registries. The cancer diagnoses were divided into 12 main groups. Hazard ratios (HRs) and adjusted HR were calculated. Adjustments were carried out for country, maternal age, parity, sex, gestational age and birth defects. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: There was no significant increase in overall cancer rates among children born after ART when compared with children born after spontaneous conception (adjusted HR 1.08; 95% CI 0.91-1.27). Cancer, of any form, was found among 181 children born after ART (2.0/1000 children, 21.0/100 000 person-years) compared with 638 children born after spontaneous conception (1.8/1000 children, 18.8/100 000 person-years). Leukaemia was the most common type of cancer (n = 278, 0.62/1000 children) but no significantly increased incidence was found among children born after ART. An increased risk was observed for 2 of 12 cancer groups. They were central nervous system tumours (adjusted HR 1.44; 95% CI 1.01-2.05) and malignant epithelial neoplasms (adjusted HR 2.03; 95% CI 1.06-3.89); the absolute risks were 0.46/1000 and 0.15/1000 children, respectively, corresponding to an absolute increased risk of 0.14/1000 and 0.08/1000 children, respectively. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: As this is an observational study, the main limitation is the fact that it is not possible to adjust for all potential confounders. We were not able to control for confounders such as socio-economic status and perinatal factors, such as Apgar score, which other studies have suggested affect cancer rates. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The results of this large population-based cohort study are in agreement with most previously published studies. The main findings are reassuring for couples undergoing ART, children born after ART and clinicians working with ART. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: No conflict of interest was reported. The study was supported by grants from The European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE), Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden, the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, the Danish Agency of Science, Technology and Innovation and the Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology (NFOG).","['(c) The Author 2014.

Here we assessed the ability of high-resolution single telomere length analysis (STELA), combined with an experimentally derived definition of telomere dysfunction, to predict the clinical outcome of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). We defined the upper telomere length threshold at which telomere fusions occur and then used the mean of the telomere 'fusogenic' range as a prognostic tool. Patients with telomeres within the fusogenic range had a significantly shorter overall survival (P < 0.0001; Hazard ratio [HR] = 13.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 11.6-106.4) and this was preserved in early-stage disease patients (P < 0.0001, HR=19.3, 95% CI = 17.8-802.5). Indeed, our assay allowed the accurate stratification of Binet stage A patients into those with indolent disease (91% survival at 10 years) and those with poor prognosis (13% survival at 10 years). Furthermore, patients with telomeres above the fusogenic mean showed superior prognosis regardless of their IGHV mutation status or cytogenetic risk group. In keeping with this finding, telomere dysfunction was the dominant variable in multivariate analysis.

The relative expression levels of Tiam1 mRNA in the Tiam1 siRNA group at 24, 48 and 72 h after transfection were 0.30 +/- 0.04, 0.09 +/- 0.01 and 0.09 +/- 0.006, respectively, significantly lower than that of the untreated group (P < 0.05 for all). The expression level of Tiam1 protein at 24 h after Tiam1 siRNA transfection in the EC9706 cells was 0.11 +/- 0.02, significantly lower than that in the un-treated group (0.44 +/- 0.05) and control siRNA group (0.44 +/- 0.04, P < 0.05 for all). The percentages of G0/G1 cells in the Tiam1 siRNA group, untreated group and control siRNA group were (54.48 +/- 2.14)%, (40.69 +/- 1.85)% and (41.78 +/- 1.31)%, respectively (P < 0.01). The percentages of S phase cells in the Tiam1 siRNA group, untreated group and control siRNA group were (27.18 +/- 1.65)%, (32.32 +/- 1.15)% and (30.35 +/- 1.09)%, respectively (P < 0.01). The expression levels of cyclin D1 protein in the untreated group, control siRNA group and Tiam1 siRNA group were 0.43 +/- 0.02, 0.41 +/- 0.01 and 0.11 +/- 0.02, respectively (P < 0.05). The expression levels of p27 protein in the untreated group, control siRNA group and Tiam1 siRNA group were 0.10 +/- 0.01, 0.09 +/- 0.02 and 0.20 +/- 0.02, respectively (P < 0.05). The ratios of early apoptotic cells in the untreated group, control siRNA group and Tiam1 siRNA group were (10 +/- 0.9)%, (10 +/- 0.5)% and (27 +/- 0.7)%, respectively (P < 0.01). The expression levels of Mcl-1 protein in EC9706 cells of untreated group, control siRNA group and Tiam1 siRNA group were 0.47 +/- 0.12, 0.48 +/- 0.13 and 0.16 +/- 0.02, respectively (P < 0.05). The expression levels of Bcl-2 protein in EC9706 cells of the untreated group, control siRNA group and Tiam1 siRNA group were 0.49 +/- 0.08, 0.50 +/- 0.05 and 0.04 +/- 0.03, respectively (P < 0.05). The caspase-3 activities in the untreated group, control siRNA group and Tiam1 siRNA group were 2.3 +/- 0.09, 2.3 +/- 0.10 and 16.0 +/- 1.50, respectively; and that of caspase-9 were 2.3 +/- 0.08, 2.3 +/- 0.11 and 14.5 +/- 0.9, respectively (P < 0.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Tiam1 siRNA can significantly inhibit the proliferation of esophageal cancer EC9706 cells, induce cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis. These effects are related to the regulation of the expressions of cell cycle-related genes (cyclin D1 and p27) and cell apoptosis-related genes (Mcl-1, Bcl-1, caspase-3 and caspase-9) by Tiam1 siRNA.",,"['Liu, Huaimin', 'Jiang, Lifeng', 'Liu, Xiaoli']","['Liu H', 'Jiang L', 'Liu X']","['Department of Integrated Traditional and Western Medicine, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University; Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou 450003, China.', 'Department of Integrated Traditional and Western Medicine, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University; Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou 450003, China.

Forty-one patients had acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 38 had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Two patients with myeloid blast crises of CML and three with lymphoid blast crises were included in the AML and ALL subgroups, respectively. Median age was 48 years (range 13-77). FLAD was well tolerated with negligible, nonhematological toxicity. Six patients (7.5 %) died before response evaluation. Forty-seven patients achieved hematologic complete response (CR). Complete remission rate was 53 and 65 % among AML and ALL patients, respectively. No CR was recorded among 11 refractory AML patients. Twenty-four patients (30 %) underwent HSCT. Nine patients received stem cells from an HLA identical sibling, and 15 from an alternative donor (3 unrelated matched, 12 haploidentical sibling). Median overall survival in AML and ALL patients receiving FLAD therapy was 9 and 8 months, respectively. A 5-year projected OS for patients receiving the whole program (FLAD + HSCT) was 24 % for AML patients (median survival 43 months), 28 % for ALL patients treated in relapse (median survival 15 months), and 0 % for ALL patients treated for refractory disease.

AIM: This study sought to explore the predictors of fatigue in a population with haematological malignancy. METHODS: Consecutive outpatients and inpatients attending a haematology centre completed the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale, and clinical, treatment and demographic information were noted. RESULTS: Of 180 patients, fatigue was present in 69%, and causing considerable distress in 26%. Univariate analysis revealed fatigue was associated with poor performance status, low haemoglobin, feeling sad, worried, irritable and nervous. Multivariate modeling revealed that those factors predictive of fatigue were poor performance status, having active disease, feeling sad and irritable, while haemoglobin level was not predictive of fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: Fatigue is a multidimensional symptom in patients with haematological malignancy whose presence must prompt a holistic assessment of potential contributors that goes beyond correction of haemoglobin levels.","['(c) 2014 The Authors; Internal Medicine Journal (c) 2014 Royal Australasian', 'College of Physicians.']","['Zordan, R', 'Manitta, V', 'Nandurkar, H', 'Cole-Sinclair, M', 'Philip, J']","['Zordan R', 'Manitta V', 'Nandurkar H', 'Cole-Sinclair M', 'Philip J']","[""Centre for Palliative Care, St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Australia,Intern Med J,Internal medicine journal,101092952,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anxiety/*epidemiology/etiology/psychology', 'Depression/*epidemiology', 'Fatigue/*epidemiology/etiology/psychology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/*epidemiology/psychology', 'Lymphoma/complications/*epidemiology/psychology', 'Middle Aged', 'Pain/*epidemiology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prevalence', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Risk Factors', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Stress, Psychological']",['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'fatigue', 'haemo-oncology']",2014/07/06 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/07/04 06:00'],"['2013/11/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/imj.12517 [doi]'],ppublish,Intern Med J. 2014 Oct;44(10):1013-7. doi: 10.1111/imj.12517.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the rapid development of molecular biological techniques, plenty of gene mutations were found to have close relationships with the transformation from MDS to AML. SRSF2 is a RNA splicing-related gene, which mutation may prompt a poor prognosis, and have a higher rate of progressing to AML. DNMT3A plays an important role in DNA methylation, its mutation often indicate a worse overall survival and a more rapid progression to AML. ASXL1 regulates the synthesis of histone, which frameshift mutations are molecular marks of an adverse outcome. IDH contains IDH1 and IDH2, which are related with the Krebs cycle. Patients with IDH1 mutation have a shorter overall survival and a higher risk of AML transformation than that of patients with wild-type IDH1, while IDH2 was a poor prognostic factor for overall survival in patients with lower-risk MDS. Another gene related with DNA methylation is TET2, which is the most frequently mutated gene in MDS known so far and it may act as tumor-suppressor gene, but the opinions on its impact on patients' outcomes are still controversial. Some studies show that its mutations relate to a shorter time to progression to AML.

Despite the different origin of cells, there is considerable overlap between T-LGL and CLPD-NK in terms of clinical presentation and treatment. Majority of these patients are asymptomatic and may not need treatment. When significant cytopenias occur, the application of immunosuppressive therapy often should be considered. In contrast, aggressive NK cell leukemia and the rare CD56(+) aggressive T-LGL leukemia have a fulminant clinical course and an earlier age of onset, therefore, more intensive combination chemotherapy is required, followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

The inhibitory effect of realgar on the cell growth were detected by MTT method. The morphological changes of SU-DHL-4 were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The apoptosis of SU-DHL-4 cells treated with realgar were detected by flow cytometry with Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining and DNA agarose gel electrophoresis. The cell cycle was examined by flow cytometry with PI staining. The expressions of apoptosis-related proteins (BCL-2 , Caspase-3,BAX) were detected by Western blot. The results showed that the realgar at the concentration of 20, 40, 80 micromol/L all could inhibit the proliferation of SU-DHL-4 (P < 0.05), and in a certain time and concentration range, the inhibition rate was enhanced in a time and dose dependent manner(r = 0.982). Flow cytometric test results showed that realgar could induce SU-DHL-4 cell apoptosis after treating for 48 hours, and the apoptosis rate increased with the increasing of drug concentration (P < 0.05). After treating SU-DHL-4 cells with Realgar for 48 h, the cell cycle was blocked in the S phase (P < 0.05). TEM results revealed that when treated with realgar for 48 h, the typically apoptosis morphology-apoptotic bodies were observed in all drug-treated group, furthermore, some necrotic cells in the 80 micromol/L group were observed. After intervened by realgar for 48 h, the DNA Ladder pattern was seen according to agarose gel electrophoresis. Western blot showed that the expression of Bcl-2 protein was down-regulated while the expressions of BAX and Caspase-3 protein were up-regulated when treating SU-DHL-4 cells with realgar for 48 h. It is concluded that realgar can inhibit cell growth and induce cell apoptosis, which may be related with up-regulation of Caspase-3 and BAX expression and down-regulation the of BCL-2 expression.",,"['Shi, Li-Li', 'Zhu, Hua-Chao', 'Zhang, Mei', 'Liu, Yang-Feng', 'Wang, Yuan', 'Zhao, Jing', 'Lei, Fei', 'He, Peng-Cheng']","['Shi LL', 'Zhu HC', 'Zhang M', 'Liu YF', 'Wang Y', 'Zhao J', 'Lei F', 'He PC']","[""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University Medical College, Xi'an 710061, Shaanxi Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University Medical College, Xi'an 710061, Shaanxi Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University Medical College, Xi'an 710061, Shaanxi Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University Medical College, Xi'an 710061, Shaanxi Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University Medical College, Xi'an 710061, Shaanxi Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University Medical College, Xi'an 710061, Shaanxi Province, China."", 'Stomatologic Medical College of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu Province, China.', ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University Medical College, Xi'an 710061, Shaanxi Province, China.

ABL mutation was detected by nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by direct sequencing. The clinical characteristics of the two cases were analyzed. The results showed that both cases were resistant to imatinib presented V299L mutation. Out of them 1 case achieved complete haematological response (CHR) after treatment with nilotinib for 6 months and another case abstained obvious molecular response after using nilotinib for 7 month. V299L mutation of both cases was turned into negative after the treatment with nilotinib.

The cell apoptosis and proliferation inhibition rate were measured by CCK-8 kit, and IC50 of two drugs was calculated by using SPSS software. Pro-apoptosis effect of E.coli-L-Asp and Erwinia-L-Asp on REH and Jurkat cell lines was also determined by flow cytometry with Annexin V/PI double staining. Concentration changes of 4 amino acids (Asn, Aspa, Gln, and Glu) before and after medication were detected by using high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay. The results showed that both REH and Jurkat cell lines were sensitive to L-Asp drugs from two different strains, and E.coli-L-Asp and Erwinia-L-Asp displayed the inhibition effect on the proliferation of Jurkat and REH cell lines in dose-dependent and time-dependent manners. The inhibition cell of proliferation and cell apoptosis in Erwinia-L-Asp group were higher than those in E.coli-L-Asp group after 24 hours (P < 0.05) . However, after treatment of REN and Jurkat cells with 2 kind of L-Asp for 48 hours, the inhibition of cell proliferation and apoptosis rates were not significantly different between the 2 L-Asp drugs (P > 0.05). The Asn in medium could be depleted by two different L-Asp drugs with low concentration. Both the two L-Asp drugs had the same capability to deplete the Asn surrounding leukemia cells (P > 0.05). The Gln in medium could be depleted by two L-Asp drugs with high concentration. The hydrolysis effect of Erwinia-L-Asp on Gln was stronger than that of E.coli-L-Asp (P < 0.05). It is concluded that in a certain range of concentrations, E.coli-L-Asp and Erwinia-L-Asp exert anti-leukemia effect in dose-dependent manner.

The inhibition effect of brucine on growth of THP-1 cells was measured by CCK-8 method. Morphological changes of THP-1 cells treated with brucine was detected by acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB)double staining. Annexin-V/PI double labeling method was used to assay the apoptosis rate of THP-1 cells. The effect of brucine on THP-1 cell cycle distribution was detected by PI single staining. RT-PCR was used to detect the expression of BCL-2 and BAX. The results showed that the brucine could inhibit the THP-1 cell growth in concentration and time-dependent manners at the range of 50 to 400 microg/ml. The cells stained with AO/EB revealed that the brucine induced the nuclear chromatin condensation. After the THP-1 cells were treated with brucine of 400microg/ml for 48 hours, most nucleic were stained as orange-red, and condensed, displaying the late apoptotic cell morphology. Annexin-V/PI detection showed that brucine could induce apoptosis of THP-1 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Compared with the control group, more cells in brucine-treated group were arrested at G0/G1 phase in a concentration-dependent manner. RT-PCR detection revealed that the expression of BCL-2 was down-regulated strikingly and BAX was up-regulated. It is concluded that brucine can efficiently inhibit cell growth and block THP-1 cells in G0/G1 phase.

Based on the previous work of the setup of methylation-specific quantitative PCR system for ID4 gene, this study was designed to investigate the relation between the quantitative indicator of methylation density, percentage of methylation reference(PMR) value, and different disease status of AL. PMR of ID4 was detected by MS-PCR in bone marrow (BM) samples of 17 healthy persons and 54 AL patients in the status of newly diagnosis, complete remission and disease relapse. The results showed that at different disease status, PMR value in newly diagnosed group was significantly lower than that in complete remission group (P = 0.031). Among serial samples, PMR value remained very low at the status of patients with continuous complete remission (<1.5 per thousand), and increased along with the accumulation of tumor cells at relapse. In 1 relapse case, the abnormal rise of PMR value occurred prior to morphological relapse. PMR value seemed to be related to body tumor cell load.

The leukemia KG-1a, U937 and K562 cells were treated with 5-Aza-CdR. The results indicated that TIG1 gene expressed at a high level in cases of NC, but expressed at a low level in patients with AL. TIG1 gene was unmethylated in NC, but frequently methylated in AL. Aberrant methylation rate of TIG1 in AL was 75% (40/53). The expression of TIG1 in unmethylated patients was higher than that in methylated patients. Hypermethylation of TIG1 promoter CpG islands was detected in all the cell lines. 5-Aza-CdR treatment led to the hypomethylation of TIG1 promoter CpG islands.

A total of 31 patients with CML in blastic crisis in Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University school of Medicine from 2009 January to 2014 January were enrolled in this study. Out of 31 CML patients, 24 cases were patients with myeloid blast crisis and other 7 cases were patients with lymphoblastic crisis. The clinical data, blast cell percentage in peripheral blood and bone marrow, eosinophil and basophil percentage, immunophenotype, cytogenetic characteristics and prognosis were analyzed. The results indicated that there was no significant difference of blastic cell percentage in peripheral blood and bone marrow of CML with myeloid blast crisis, and the eosinophil and basophil cells could be easily detected. The ratio of blastic cells in BM was higher than that in PB in lymphoid blastic crisis of CML, eosinophil and basophil cells were rare. 7 cases of CML with lymphoid blastic crisis were B ALL with CD10, CD19, CD34, HLA-DR expression, and 2 cases with CD13 and CD33 expression.

The expression of P2XR in each cell population was detected by real time RT-PCR. The results showed that macrophages,M1-like and M2-like macrophages moderately expressed P2XR except for P2X5R. The expression of P2XR varied with the development of leukemia. The expression of P2X1R and P2X7R in peritoneal macrophages increased steadily; the expression of P2X2R and P2X3R decreased at late stage of leukemia;the expression of P2X4R slightly decreased at intermediate stage;the expression of P2X6R kept unchanged. At intermediate stage of leukemia, the expression of P2XR in M1-like and M2-like peritoneal macrophages varied. M1-like macrophages expressed higher level of P2X1R than M2-like macrophages, whereas M2-like macrophages expressed higher level of P2X7R than M1-like macrophages, which suggested that the expression of P2XR were related to the activation states.

It is caused by mutation in the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor gene (LIFR; 151443) on chromosome 5p13. We provide the clinical follow-up and molecular aspects of six new patients who carried the same novel mutation in the LIFR gene (p.Arg692X) and three patients carried a common haplotype at the LIFR locus supporting a founder effect in the Turkish population. The probable pathogenesis of the features is also discussed. Osseous findings in the presence of other above-mentioned morbid conditions should raise the suspicion of SWS in neonates especially in Arabic and Eastern Mediterranean countries with high rate of consanguineous marriages like in Turkey.

In the present study, we demonstrate that the activation of the ATM-NF-kappaB pathway, resulting from increased IL-6 expression, plays a central role in augmented chemoresistance in lung cancer cell lines. This result was supported by the increased expressions of Bcl-2, Mcl-1, Bcl-xl, and the upregulation of MDR-associated protein ABCG2. The higher level of IL-6 reveals not only higher ATM/NF-kappaB activity but also increased expressions of ABCG2, Bcl-2, Mcl-1 and Bcl-xl. Most importantly, lung cancer cells themselves upregulated IL-6 secretion by activating the p38/NF-kappaB pathway through treatment with cisplatin and camptothecin. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that chemotherapeutic agents increase IL-6 expression, hence activating the ATM/NF-kappaB pathway, augmenting anti-apoptotic protein expression and contributing to MDR. This indicates that both IL-6 and ATM are potential targets for the treatment of chemotherapeutic resistance in lung cancer.","['(c) 2014 The Authors.

The present study was designed to examine for the first time the mechanism of resistance to erufosine in malignant cells with permanently reduced expression of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein. Bearing in mind the high number of malignancies with reduced level of this tumor-suppressor, this investigation was deemed important for using erufosine, alone or in combination, in patients with compromised RB1 gene expression. For this purpose, clones of the leukemic T-cell line SKW-3 were used, which had been engineered to constantly express differently low Rb levels. The alkylphosphocholine induced apoptosis, stimulated the expression of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 and inhibited the synthesis of cyclin D3, thereby causing a G2 phase cell cycle arrest and death of cells with wild type Rb expression. In contrast, Rb-deficiency impeded the changes induced by erufosine in the expression of these proteins and abrogated the induction of G2 arrest, which was correlated with reduced antiproliferative and anticlonogenic activities of the compound. In conclusion, analysis of our results showed for the first time that the Rb signaling pathway is essential for mediating the antineoplastic activity of erufosine and its efficacy in patients with malignant diseases may be predicted by determining the Rb status.",,"['Zaharieva, Maya M', 'Kirilov, Milen', 'Chai, Minquang', 'Berger, Stefan M', 'Konstantinov, Spiro', 'Berger, Martin R']","['Zaharieva MM', 'Kirilov M', 'Chai M', 'Berger SM', 'Konstantinov S', 'Berger MR']","['Toxicology and Chemotherapy Unit, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Biology of the Cell I, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Biology of the Cell I, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Central Institute of Mental Health, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Laboratory for Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Chemotherapy, Department for Pharmacology, Pharmacotherapy and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Medical University of Sofia, Sofia, Bulgaria.', 'Toxicology and Chemotherapy Unit, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140702,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CCND3 protein, human)', '0 (CDKN1B protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin D3)', '0 (Organophosphates)', '0 (Quaternary Ammonium Compounds)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (erucylphospho-N,N,N-trimethylpropylammonium)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin D3/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects/genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Organophosphates/*pharmacology', 'Quaternary Ammonium Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/genetics']",,,2014/07/06 06:00,2015/02/24 06:00,['2014/07/03 06:00'],"['2014/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0100950 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-07007 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jul 2;9(7):e100950. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0100950. eCollection 2014.,,,,PMC4079453,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with graded concentrations (2, 5, 10, 20, and 40 microg/cm(2)) of suspension of fine particles for 24h. For coculture experiment, HUVECs were incubated alone, with CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells (Teff), or with Tregs in the presence of anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies for 48 hours, and then were stimulated with or without suspension of fine particles for 24 hours. The expression of adhesion molecules and inflammatory cytokines was examined. RESULTS: Adhesion molecules, including vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL-) 6 and IL-8, were increased in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, the adhesion of human acute monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1) to endothelial cells was increased and NF- kappa B activity was upregulated in HUVECs after treatment with fine particles.

Here, we assessed the antitumor activity of the anti-CD38 antibody SAR650984. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Activity of SAR650984 was examined on lymphoma, leukemia and multiple myeloma cell lines, primary multiple myeloma samples, and multiple myeloma xenograft models in immunodeficient mice. RESULTS: We identified a humanized anti-CD38 antibody with strong proapoptotic activity independent of cross-linking agents, and potent effector functions including complement-dependent cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), equivalent in vitro to rituximab in CD20+ and CD38+ models. This unique antibody, termed SAR650984, inhibited the ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity of CD38, likely through an allosteric antagonism as suggested by 3D structure analysis of the complex. In vivo, SAR650984 was active in diverse NHL, ALL, and multiple myeloma CD38+ tumor xenograft models. SAR650984 demonstrated single-agent activity comparable with rituximab or cyclophosphamide in Daudi or SU-DHL-8 lymphoma xenograft models with induction of the proapoptotic marker cleaved capase-7. In addition, SAR650984 had more potent antitumor activity than bortezomib in NCI-H929 and Molp-8 multiple myeloma xenograft studies. Consistent with its mode of action, SAR650984 demonstrated potent proapoptotic activity against CD38+ human primary multiple myeloma cells. CONCLUSION: These results validate CD38 as a therapeutic target and support the current evaluation of this unique CD38-targeting functional antibody in phase I clinical trials in patients with CD38+ B-cell malignancies.",['(c)2014 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Deckert, Jutta', 'Wetzel, Marie-Cecile', 'Bartle, Laura M', 'Skaletskaya, Anna', 'Goldmacher, Victor S', 'Vallee, Francois', 'Zhou-Liu, Qing', 'Ferrari, Paul', 'Pouzieux, Stephanie', 'Lahoute, Charlotte', 'Dumontet, Charles', 'Plesa, Adriana', 'Chiron, Marielle', 'Lejeune, Pascale', 'Chittenden, Thomas', 'Park, Peter U', 'Blanc, Veronique']","['Deckert J', 'Wetzel MC', 'Bartle LM', 'Skaletskaya A', 'Goldmacher VS', 'Vallee F', 'Zhou-Liu Q', 'Ferrari P', 'Pouzieux S', 'Lahoute C', 'Dumontet C', 'Plesa A', 'Chiron M', 'Lejeune P', 'Chittenden T', 'Park PU', 'Blanc V']","['Research and Development, ImmunoGen, Inc., Waltham, Massachusetts. jutta.deckert@immunogen.com.', 'Oncology Business Division, Sanofi R&D, Vitry-sur-Seine, France.', 'Research and Development, ImmunoGen, Inc., Waltham, Massachusetts.', 'Research and Development, ImmunoGen, Inc., Waltham, Massachusetts.', 'Research and Development, ImmunoGen, Inc., Waltham, Massachusetts.', 'SCP LGCR/Structure Design & Informatics/Structural Biology, Sanofi R&D, Vitry-sur-Seine, France.', 'Biorealization/Operations and Protein Tools, Sanofi R&D, Vitry-sur-Seine, France.', 'Biorealization/Operations and Protein Tools, Sanofi R&D, Vitry-sur-Seine, France.', 'SCP LGCR/Structure Design & Informatics/Structural Biology, Sanofi R&D, Vitry-sur-Seine, France.', 'Oncology Business Division, Sanofi R&D, Vitry-sur-Seine, France.', 'Hematology Laboratory, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre Benite, France and CRCL, INSERM 1052-CNRS 5286, Lyon, France.', 'Hematology Laboratory, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre Benite, France and CRCL, INSERM 1052-CNRS 5286, Lyon, France.', 'Oncology Business Division, Sanofi R&D, Vitry-sur-Seine, France.', 'Oncology Business Division, Sanofi R&D, Vitry-sur-Seine, France.', 'Research and Development, ImmunoGen, Inc., Waltham, Massachusetts.', 'Research and Development, ImmunoGen, Inc., Waltham, Massachusetts.', 'Oncology Business Division, Sanofi R&D, Vitry-sur-Seine, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140701,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'R30772KCU0 (isatuximab)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Rituximab', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2014/07/06 06:00,2015/07/08 06:00,['2014/07/03 06:00'],"['2014/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-14-0695 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-0695 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2014 Sep 1;20(17):4574-83. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-0695.

Engagement of surface immunoglobulin by antigen is a key driver of malignant cells with outcome influenced by the nature of the cell, the level of stimulation and the microenvironment. Analysis of surface immunoglobulin-mediated signaling in the two major disease subsets defined by IGHV mutational status reveals bifurcation of responses toward proliferation or anergy. Mutated chronic lymphocytic leukemia, generally of relatively good prognosis, is mainly, but not exclusively, driven towards anergy in vivo. In contrast, unmutated chronic lymphocytic leukemia shows less evidence for anergy in vivo retaining more responsiveness to surface immunoglobulin M-mediated signaling, possibly explaining increased tumor progression. Expression and function of surface immunoglobulin M in unmutated chronic lymphocytic leukemia appear rather homogeneous, but mutated chronic lymphocytic leukemia exhibits a highly heterogeneous profile that may relate to further variable clinical behavior within this subset. Anergy should increase susceptibility to apoptosis but, in leukemic cells, this may be countered by overexpression of the B-cell lymphoma-2 survival protein. Maintained anergy spreads to chemokines and adhesion molecules, restraining homing and migration. However, anergy is not necessarily completely benign, being able to reverse and regenerate surface immunoglobulin M-mediated responses. A two-pronged attack on proliferative and anti-apoptotic pathways may succeed. Increased understanding of how chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells are driven to anergy or proliferation should reveal predictive biomarkers of progression and of likely response to kinase inhibitors, which could assist therapeutic decisions.",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Packham, Graham', 'Krysov, Serge', 'Allen, Alex', 'Savelyeva, Natalia', 'Steele, Andrew J', 'Forconi, Francesco', 'Stevenson, Freda K']","['Packham G', 'Krysov S', 'Allen A', 'Savelyeva N', 'Steele AJ', 'Forconi F', 'Stevenson FK']","['Cancer Research UK Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, UK fs@soton.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens/immunology/metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Clonal Anergy/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/immunology/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",,,2014/07/06 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2014/07/03 06:00'],"['2014/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2013.098384 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2013.098384 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2014 Jul;99(7):1138-48. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2013.098384.,,,"['13-0267/Worldwide Cancer Research/United Kingdom', 'CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",PMC4077074,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of the 617 subjects studied, 399 (64.7%) carried JAK2 (V617F), 140 (22.7%) had a CALR exon 9 indel, 25 (4.0%) carried an MPL (W515) mutation, and 53 (8.6%) had nonmutated JAK2, CALR, and MPL (so-called triple-negative PMF). Patients with CALR mutation had a lower risk of developing anemia, thrombocytopenia, and marked leukocytosis compared with other subtypes. They also had a lower risk of thrombosis compared with patients carrying JAK2 (V617F). At the opposite, triple-negative patients had higher incidence of leukemic transformation compared with either CALR-mutant or JAK2-mutant patients. Median overall survival was 17.7 years in CALR-mutant, 9.2 years in JAK2-mutant, 9.1 years in MPL-mutant, and 3.2 years in triple-negative patients. In multivariate analysis corrected for age, CALR-mutant patients had better overall survival than either JAK2-mutant or triple-negative patients. The impact of genetic lesions on survival was independent of current prognostic scoring systems. These observations indicate that driver mutations define distinct disease entities within PMF.

In this study, we measured 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) levels in 206 clinically and molecularly well-characterized younger adult AML patients (</=60 years) included in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche dell'Adulto (EORTC/GIMEMA) AML-12 06991 clinical trial and correlated the 5hmC levels with mutational status and overall survival (OS). In healthy control cells, 5hmC levels were confined to a narrow range (1.5-fold difference), whereas in AML cells, a much wider range was detected (15-fold difference). We identified 3 5hmC subpopulations in our patient cohort (low, intermediate, and high). The low 5hmC group consisted almost entirely of patients with TET2 or IDH mutations. As expected, TET2 and IDH mutated patients had significantly lower levels of 5hmC compared with patients without mutated TET2 and IDH1/2 (both P < .001). Interestingly, high 5hmC levels correlated with inferior OS (high vs intermediate 5hmC: P = .047, hazard ratio [HR] = 1.81).

Disease was preceded by an increased abundance of plasma cells, presumably reflecting their enhanced survival capacity in vivo. Plasmacytomas of each genotype expressed high levels of v-abl and frequently harbored a rearranged c-myc gene, probably as a result of chromosome translocation. As in human multiple myelomas, elevated expression of cyclin D genes was common, and p53 deregulation was rare.

Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the dose-risk relation. Through the literature search up to August 2013, we identified 18 studies, 10 case-control and 8 cohorts, carried out in a total of 7142 leukemia cases. We derived pooled meta-analytic estimates using random-effects models, taking into account the correlation between estimates, and we performed a dose-risk analysis using a class of nonlinear random-effects meta-regression models. Stratified analyses were carried out on leukemia subtypes and groups, in order to identify possible etiologic differences. Compared with nondrinkers, the relative risks (RRs) for all leukemia were 0.94 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.85-1.03], 0.90 (95% CI, 0.80-1.01) and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.81-1.02) for any, light (</= 1 drink/day) and moderate to heavy (>1 drink/day) alcohol drinking, respectively. The summary RRs for any alcohol drinking were 1.47 (95% CI, 0.47-4.62) for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 0.94 (95% CI 0.77-1.15) for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 1.02 (95% CI, 0.86-1.21) for acute myeloid leukemia and 0.93 (95% CI 0.75-1.14) for chronic myeloid leukemia. The subgroup analysis on geographical area for all leukemia combined showed RRs of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.76-0.93), 0.92 (95% CI, 0.83-1.01) and 1.32 (95% CI, 1.02-1.70) for studies conducted in America, Europe and Asia, respectively.

X-ray diffraction analysis, (1)H NMR and CD spectra all suggested that the interactions between the benzene ring of the Xxx1 residue and the alkyl groups of oxazoline2 contribute to the stability of the folded structure of these analogs. Substituting fluorines for the hydrogens progressively weakened those interactions through reducing the pi-electron density, thereby mediating transformation from the folded to square structure. As a result, [(F(5))Phe]ASC preferred the square form more than the other analogs did. Also contributing to the preference for the square form may be the hindrance of the rotation around the Calpha-Cbeta bond by the two ortho-fluoro substituents of [(F(5))Phe]ASC. These findings demonstrate that the structure of ASC can be modulated by using fluorine as an electron-withdrawing group.","['Copyright (c) 2014 European Peptide Society and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Asano, Akiko', 'Yamada, Takeshi', 'Doi, Mitsunobu']","['Asano A', 'Yamada T', 'Doi M']","['Osaka University of Pharmaceutical Sciences, 4-20-1, Nasahara, Takatsuki, Osaka, 569-1094, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20140701,England,J Pept Sci,Journal of peptide science : an official publication of the European Peptide Society,9506309,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '47E5O17Y3R (Phenylalanine)', '86701-12-4 (ascidiacyclamide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', '*Drug Design', 'Halogenation', 'Humans', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular', 'Peptides/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Peptides, Cyclic/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Phenylalanine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Folding', 'Protein Stability']",['NOTNLM'],"['1H NMR', 'CD spectrum', 'anisotropic effect', 'ascidiacyclamide', 'crystal structure', 'fluorine', 'inductive electron withdrawal', 'phenylalanine', 'ring-current effect']",2014/07/06 06:00,2015/06/02 06:00,['2014/07/03 06:00'],"['2014/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/14 00:00 [revised]', '2014/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/psc.2668 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pept Sci. 2014 Oct;20(10):794-802. doi: 10.1002/psc.2668.

METHODS: Kasumi-1 cells were treated with 200 nmol/L TPA, different concentrations of As(2)O(3) alone and combined with 200 nmol/L TPA. The proliferative inhibition rates were determined with CCK-8. Annexin V was adopted to detect apoptosis. Colony formation assay was used to determine the cloning efficiency. Flow cytometry was used to detect the cell differentiation and cell cycle changes. Western blot was employed to detect the expression of P38 and p-P38. RESULTS: The proliferation inhibition rates of Kasumi-1 cells by TPA combined with different concentrations of As(2)O(3) (0.2, 2.0 and 20.0 mmol/L)for 48 h were (25.56 +/- 7.29)%, (60.63 +/- 6.64)%, and (73.37 +/- 2.15)%, the apoptosis rates were (61.65 +/- 2.62)%, (75.39 +/- 1.04)%, and (89.95 +/- 1.46)%, and the colony formation rates were (76.17 +/- 2.06)%, (38.50 +/- 1.87)%, and (18.53 +/- 2.20)%, respectively, compared with the different concentrations of As(2)O(3) alone groups, the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). Cells treated with both TPA and As(2)O(3) expressed more CD11b antigens compared with the cells exposed to As(2)O(3) alone. TPA treated Kasumi-1 cells were arrested at G1 phase compared with the control group, while As(2)O(3) increased the percentage of Kasumi-1 cells in the G2 phase. Combination treatment increased the expression of p-P38 of Kasumi-1 cells compared with the cells exposed to As(2)O(3) alone.

METHODS: The mRNA expression of RelB in CD5(+) CD19(+) CLL cells from BM was analyzed by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). The RelB activity was examined by electromobility shift assay (EMSA) and an ELISA-based NF-kappaB family transcription factor activity assay. CLL cells were classified into RelB+ and RelB- groups according to RelB activity. The frequencies of cell death of CLL cells cultured with human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) after treatment with PS-341, MG-132 or fludarabine were determined by PI staining. RESULTS: RelB mRNA expression and RelB activity could be detected in CLL cells at variable levels. Fludarabine (10 mumol/L), MG-132 (1 mumol/L) and PS-341 (1 mumol/L) could induce cell death of RelB+ and RelB- CLL cells co-cultured with hBMSCs in a time dependent manner. There was no significant difference in the fludarabine sensitivity between RelB+ and RelB- CLL cells, and the frequencies of cell death of RelB+ and RelB- CLL cells were (61.11 +/- 6.91)% and (67.57 +/- 9.45)%, respectively, when treated with fludarabine for 72 h. RelB+ CLL cells were more sensitive to MG-132 than RelB- CLL cells for 72 h, and the frequencies of cell death were (66.22 +/- 3.39)% and (51.07 +/- 5.93)%, respectively. RelB+ CLL cells were more sensitive to PS-341 than RelB- CLL cells for 24 and 48 h treatment, and the frequencies of cell death of RelB+ and RelB- CLL cells were (75.50 +/- 4.66)% and (66.32 +/- 10.20)% for 24 h, (92.11 +/- 3.14)% and (85.84 +/- 5.81)% for 48 h treatment, respectively. CONCLUSION: The alternative NF-kappaB activity was detected in bone marrow derived CLL cells.

The differences of clinical outcome and adverse events among the patients treated with decitabine combined with DAG regimen, CAG regimen or ""3+7"" regimen were analyzed. RESULTS: Among 19 patients in decitabine treatment group, 5 (26.3%) achieved complete remission (CR), 4 (21.1%) partial remission (PR), with overall response rate (ORR) of 47.4 %. Of 26 patients in CAG regimen group, 8 (30.8%) achieved CR, 1 (3.8%) PR, with ORR of 34.6%. Of 22 patients in ""3+7"" regimen group, 4 (18.2%) achieved CR, with ORR of 18.2%. The ORR of decitabine group was significantly higher than that of ""3+7"" group (P<0.05). However, no significant difference of ORR was observed among the three groups (P>0.05).

The consequences are life threatening with multiorgan impairment, and severe electrolyte imbalances. During refeeding, glucose-involved insulin secretion causes abrupt reverse of lipolysis and a switch from catabolism to anabolism. This creates a sudden cellular demand for electrolytes (phosphate, potassium, and magnesium) necessary for synthesis of adenosine triphosphate, glucose transport, and other synthesis reactions, resulting in decreased serum levels. Laboratory findings and multiorgan impairment similar to refeeding syndrome also are observed in acute thiamine deficiency. The aim of this study was to determine whether thiamine deficiency was responsible for the electrolyte imbalance caused by tubular electrolyte losses. METHODS: We describe two patients with leukemia who developed acute thiamine deficiency with an electrolyte pattern suggestive of refeeding syndrome, severe lactic acidosis, and evidence of proximal renal tubular dysfunction. RESULTS: A single thiamine administration led to rapid resolution of the tubular dysfunction and normalization of acidosis and electrolyte imbalance. This demonstrated that thiamine deficiency was responsible for the electrolyte imbalance, caused by tubular electrolyte losses. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that, despite sharing many laboratory similarities, refeeding syndrome and acute thiamine deficiency should be viewed as separate entities in which the electrolyte abnormalities reported in cases of refeeding syndrome with thiamine deficiency and refractory lactic acidosis may be due to renal tubular losses instead of a shifting from extracellular to intracellular compartments. In oncologic and malnourished patients, individuals at particular risk for developing refeeding syndrome, in the presence of these biochemical abnormalities, acute thiamine deficiency should be suspected and treated because it promptly responds to thiamine administration.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We attempted to define whether this subset of T cells were related to leukemia relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). METHODS: The frequency of CD4+CD25-CD69+ T cells among the CD4+ T cell population from the bone marrow of relapsed patients, patients with positive minimal residual disease (MRD+) and healthy donors was examined by flow cytometry. The CD4+CD25-CD69+ T cells were also stained with the intracellular markers to determine the cytokine (TGF-beta, IL-2 and IL-10) secretion. RESULTS: The results showed that the frequency of CD4+CD25-CD69 + T cells was markedly increased in patients in the relapsed group and the MRD + group compared to the healthy donor group. The percentage of this subset of T cells was significantly decreased after effective intervention treatment. We also analyzed the reconstitution of CD4+CD25-CD69+ T cells at various time points after allo-HSCT, and the results showed that this subset of T cells reconstituted rapidly and reached a relatively higher level at +60 d in patients compared to controls. The incidence of either MRD+ or relapse in patients with a high frequency of CD4+CD25-CD69+ T cells (>7%) was significantly higher than that of patients with a low frequency of CD4+CD25-CD69+ T cells at +60 d, +90 d and +270 d after transplant. However, our preliminary data indicated that CD4+CD25-CD69+ T cells may not exert immunoregulatory function via cytokine secretion. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first clinical evidence of a correlation between non-traditional CD4+CD25-CD69+ Tregs and leukemia relapse after allo-HSCT and suggests that exploration of new methods of adoptive immunotherapy may be beneficial.

Bosutinib and ponatinib have also become available as second line options. With five agents from which to choose, selecting a TKI has become a challenge. Multiple tests are now available to determine a patient's disease status, making the ideal monitoring strategy unclear.

However, the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. We tested here the hypothesis that aberrant epigenetic modifications in the NOTCH3 promoter region might account for its upregulation in cancer cells. We compared DNA and histone methylation status of NOTCH3 promoter region in human normal blood cells and T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cell lines, differentially expressing NOTCH3. We found that histone methylation, rather than DNA hypomethylation, contributes towards establishing an active chromatin status of NOTCH3 promoter in NOTCH3 overexpressing cancer cells. We discovered that the chromatin regulator protein BORIS/CTCFL plays an important role in regulating NOTCH3 gene expression. We observed that BORIS is present in T-ALL cell lines as well as in cell lines derived from several solid tumors overexpressing NOTCH3. Moreover, BORIS targets NOTCH3 promoter in cancer cells and it is able to induce and to maintain a permissive/active chromatin conformation. Importantly, the association between NOTCH3 overexpression and BORIS presence was confirmed in primary T-ALL samples from patients at the onset of the disease. Overall, our results provide novel insights into the determinants of NOTCH3 overexpression in cancer cells, by revealing a key role for BORIS as the main mediator of transcriptional deregulation of NOTCH3.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Despite this success, hypersensitivity remains a significant problem, often requiring the termination of asparaginase. Failure to complete the entire asparaginase therapy course due to clinical hypersensitivity, subclinical hypersensitivity (i.e., silent inactivation), or other treatment-related toxicity is associated with poor ALL outcomes. Thus, it is critical to rapidly identify patients who develop clinical/subclinical hypersensitivity and switch these patients to an alternate asparaginase formulation.

A key function of the UPR is to restore ER homeostasis, but prolonged or unsolved ER stress can lead to apoptosis. MLL1 (Mixed Lineage Leukemia 1, also named ALL-1 or HRX), a histone H3K4 methyltransferase in mammals, plays important roles in leukemogenesis, transcriptional regulation, cell cycle and development. Here, we find that Mll1 deficiency enhances UPR and apoptosis induced by the glycosylation inhibitor TM (tunicamycin). The abnormal regulation of the UPR appears to be caused by a defect in protein glycosylation. Furthermore, Mll1 directly binds to the promoters of H6pd, Galnt12 and Ugp2, which regulates H3K4 trimethylation and the subsequent expression of these genes. The knockdown of H6pd, Galnt12 or Ugp2 enhances TM-induced apoptosis in Mll1(+/+)MEF cells, whereas the ectopic expression of these proteins inhibits TM-induced apoptosis in Mll1(-/-) MEF cells.

It is distinguished from other anti-B-lymphocyte antigen CD20 (anti-CD20) therapeutic antibodies in current clinical use by its type II properties and glycoengineered Fc region. In vitro these unique properties translate into higher rates of antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and direct cell death compared to rituximab, and obinutuzumab demonstrates improved efficacy in human lymphoma xenograft models and whole blood lymphocyte depletion assays. FDA approval was based upon results from a randomized phase III trial comparing treatment with single-agent chlorambucil to the combination of chlorambucil and either rituximab or obinutuzu-mab. The obinutuzumab arm resulted in higher rates of complete remission and significant improvements in progression-free survival versus either comparator regimen. The majority of patients in the obinutuzumab and chlorambucil arm finished all six planned treatment cycles, and therapy was well tolerated. Toxicities of obinutuzumab are similar to those of other anti-CD20 antibodies, although infusion-related reactions and neutropenia appear to be more common. This trial establishes chemoimmunotherapy with obinutuzumab and chlorambucil as an attractive treatment option for CLL patients, particularly those with comorbid medical illnesses or advanced age. Obinutuzumab remains under study in combination with both chemotherapy and novel agents for CLL and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, where it is expected to find additional clinical applications.","['Copyright 2014 Prous Science, S.A.U. or its licensors.

Therefore, interfering with these biochemical processes could lead to the discovery of novel anticancer agents. METHODS: Co-immunoprecipitation, western blotting, microscopy, DNA binding, invasion, and soft agar assays as well as a mouse model were used to investigate the mechanism by which the natural product Withacnistin (Wit) inhibits STAT 3/5 tyrosine phosphoryaltion and activation. RESULTS: Wit blocks EGF- and IL-6-stimulated binding of STAT3 and STAT5 to EGFR and gp130. Wit inhibits EGF-, PDGF-, IL-6-, IFNbeta-, and GM-CSF-stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT5 but not of EGFR or PDGFR. The inhibition of P-STAT3 and P-STAT5 occurred rapidly, within minutes of Wit treatment and growth factor stimulation. Wit also inhibits STAT3 nuclear translocation, DNA binding, promoter transcriptional activation, and it suppresses the expression levels of STAT3 target genes such as Bcl-xL and Mcl-1. Finally, Wit induces apoptosis, inhibits anchorage-dependent and -independent growth and invasion, and causes breast tumour regression in an ErbB2-driven transgenic mouse model. CONCLUSIONS: These data warrant further development of Wit as a novel anticancer drug for targeting tumours that harbour hyperactivated STAT3 and STAT5.",,"['Zhang, X', 'Blaskovich, M A', 'Forinash, K D', 'Sebti, S M']","['Zhang X', 'Blaskovich MA', 'Forinash KD', 'Sebti SM']","['Drug Discovery Department, Chemical Biology and Molecular Medicine Program, Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.', 'Drug Discovery Department, Chemical Biology and Molecular Medicine Program, Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.', 'Drug Discovery Department, Chemical Biology and Molecular Medicine Program, Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.', '1] Drug Discovery Department, Chemical Biology and Molecular Medicine Program, Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL 33612, USA [2] Department of Molecular Medicine, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33612, USA [3] Department of Oncologic Sciences, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140701,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (withacnistin)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'Z30RAY509F (Ergosterol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Ergosterol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism', 'Interferon-beta/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",,,2014/07/02 06:00,2014/10/18 06:00,['2014/07/02 06:00'],"['2014/04/14 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/18 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc2014349 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2014.349 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2014 Aug 26;111(5):894-902. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2014.349.

We identified 728 proteins and quantified 655 proteins using isobaric tag-labeled extracts. Four strategies were used to identify disease-related proteins. First, we integrated our CLL proteome with published gene expression data of normal B-cells and CLL cells to highlight proteins with preferential expression in the transcriptome of CLL. Second, as CLL's outcome is heterogeneous, our quantitative proteomic data were used to indicate heterogeneously expressed proteins. Third, we used the quantitative data to identify proteins with differential abundance in poor prognosis CLL samples. Fourth, hierarchical cluster analysis was applied to identify hidden patterns of protein expression. These strategies identified 63 proteins, and 4 were investigated in a CLL cohort (39 patients).

It is expressed in several cell types and is involved in a broad range of physiological and pathological processes, such as cell adhesion, cell activation and chemoattraction, cell cycle, apoptosis, and cell growth and differentiation. However, this molecule raises special interest due to its role in regulating cancer cell activities. Galectin-3 has high affinity for beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosamine branched glycans, which are formed by the action of the beta1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (Mgat5). Mgat5-related changes in protein/lipid glycosylation on cell surface lead to alterations in the clustering of membrane proteins through lattice formation, resulting in functional advantages for tumor cells. Galectin-3 presence enhances migration and/or invasion of many tumors. Galectin-3-dependent clustering of integrins promotes ligand-induced integrin activation, leading to cell motility. Galectin-3 binding to mucin-1 increases transendothelial invasion, decreasing metastasis-free survival in an experimental metastasis model. Galectin-3 also affects endothelial cell behavior by regulating capillary tube formation. This lectin is found in the tumor stroma, suggesting a role for microenvironmental galectin-3 in tumor progression. Galectin-3 also seems to be involved in the recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages, possibly contributing to angiogenesis and tumor growth.

It is a heterogeneous disease characterized by clonal proliferation and the accumulation of CD5(+) mature B lymphocytes. However, the normal counterpart from which the latter cells arise has not yet been identified. CD27 expression and gene expression profiling data suggest that CLL cells are related to memory B-cells. In vitro, memory B-cells differentiate into plasma cells when stimulated with CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG). The objective of the present study was therefore to investigate the ability of CpG, in the context of CD40 ligation, to induce the differentiation of CLL B-cells into antibody-secreting cells (ASCs). CD20(+)CD38(-) CLL B-cells were stimulated with a combination of CpG, CD40 ligand and cytokines (CpG/CD40L/c) in a two-step, 7-day culture system. We found that the CpG/CD40L/c culture system prompted CLL B-cells to differentiate into CD19(+)CD20(+)CD27(+)CD38(-)ASCs. These cells secreted large amounts of IgM and had the same shape as plasma cells. However, only IgMs secreted by ASCs that had differentiated from unmutated CLL B-cells were poly/autoreactive. Class-switch recombination (CSR) to IgG and IgA was detected in cells expressing the activation-induced cytidine deaminase gene (AICDA). Although these ASCs expressed high levels of the transcription factors PRDM1 (BLIMP1), IRF4, and XBP1s, they did not downregulate expression of PAX5. Our results suggest that CLL B-cells can differentiate into ASCs, undergo CSR and produce poly/autoreactive antibodies. Furthermore, our findings may be relevant for (i) identifying the normal counterpart of CLL B-cells and (ii) developing novel treatment strategies in CLL.",,"['Ghamlouch, Hussein', 'Ouled-Haddou, Hakim', 'Guyart, Aude', 'Regnier, Aline', 'Trudel, Stephanie', 'Claisse, Jean-Francois', 'Fuentes, Vincent', 'Royer, Bruno', 'Marolleau, Jean-Pierre', 'Gubler, Brigitte']","['Ghamlouch H', 'Ouled-Haddou H', 'Guyart A', 'Regnier A', 'Trudel S', 'Claisse JF', 'Fuentes V', 'Royer B', 'Marolleau JP', 'Gubler B']","['EA4666, Department of Immunology, Universite de Picardie Jules Verne , Amiens , France.', 'EA4666, Department of Immunology, Universite de Picardie Jules Verne , Amiens , France.', 'EA4666, Department of Immunology, Universite de Picardie Jules Verne , Amiens , France.', ""EA4666, Department of Immunology, Universite de Picardie Jules Verne , Amiens , France ; Service d'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire, Department of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Regional Universitaire d'Amiens , Amiens , France."", ""EA4666, Department of Immunology, Universite de Picardie Jules Verne , Amiens , France ; Laboratoire d'Oncobiologie Moleculaire, Department of Molecular Oncobiology, Centre Hospitalier Regional Universitaire d'Amiens , Amiens , France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire, Department of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Regional Universitaire d'Amiens , Amiens , France."", 'EA4666, Department of Immunology, Universite de Picardie Jules Verne , Amiens , France.', ""EA4666, Department of Immunology, Universite de Picardie Jules Verne , Amiens , France ; Service d'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire, Department of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Regional Universitaire d'Amiens , Amiens , France."", ""EA4666, Department of Immunology, Universite de Picardie Jules Verne , Amiens , France ; Service d'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire, Department of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Regional Universitaire d'Amiens , Amiens , France."", ""EA4666, Department of Immunology, Universite de Picardie Jules Verne , Amiens , France ; Laboratoire d'Oncobiologie Moleculaire, Department of Molecular Oncobiology, Centre Hospitalier Regional Universitaire d'Amiens , Amiens , France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140616,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell differentiation', 'CD20', 'CpG oligodeoxynucleotide', 'antibody-secreting cells', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'memory B cell', 'poly/autoreactive IgM']",2014/07/02 06:00,2014/07/02 06:01,['2014/07/02 06:00'],"['2014/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2014.00292 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2014 Jun 16;5:292. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2014.00292. eCollection 2014.,,,,PMC4058906,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fresh aliquots of 161 BM and 147 PB stem-cell allografts from North American donors randomly assigned to donate BM or PB stem cells and numbers of transplanted cells were correlated with overall survival (OS), relapse, and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). RESULTS: Patients with evaluable grafts were similar to all BMTCTN 0201 patients. The numbers of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and naive T cells (Tns) in BM allografts were independently associated with OS in multivariable analyses including recipient and donor characteristics, such as human leukocyte antigen mismatch, age, and use of antithymocyte globulin. BM recipients of > median number of pDCs, naive CD8(+) T cells (CD8Tns), or naive CD4(+) T cells (CD4Tns) had better 3-year OS (pDCs, 56% v 35%; P = .025; CD8Tns, 56% v 37%; P = .012; CD4Tns, 55% v 37%; P = .009). Transplantation of more BM Tns was associated with less grade 3 to 4 acute GvHD but similar rates of relapse. Transplantation of more BM pDCs was associated with fewer deaths resulting from GvHD or from graft rejection. Analysis of PB grafts did not identify a donor cell subset significantly associated with OS, relapse, or GvHD. CONCLUSION: Donor immune cells in BM but not PB stem-cell grafts were associated with survival after unrelated-donor allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. The biologic activity of donor immune cells in allogeneic transplantation varied between graft sources. Donor grafts with more BM-derived Tns and pDCs favorably regulated post-transplantation immunity in allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.",['(c) 2014 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],"['Waller, Edmund K', 'Logan, Brent R', 'Harris, Wayne A C', 'Devine, Steven M', 'Porter, David L', 'Mineishi, Shin', 'McCarty, John M', 'Gonzalez, Corina E', 'Spitzer, Thomas R', 'Krijanovski, Oleg I', 'Linenberger, Michael L', 'Woolfrey, Ann', 'Howard, Alan', 'Wu, Juan', 'Confer, Dennis L', 'Anasetti, Claudio']","['Waller EK', 'Logan BR', 'Harris WA', 'Devine SM', 'Porter DL', 'Mineishi S', 'McCarty JM', 'Gonzalez CE', 'Spitzer TR', 'Krijanovski OI', 'Linenberger ML', 'Woolfrey A', 'Howard A', 'Wu J', 'Confer DL', 'Anasetti C']","['Edmund K.

The primary objective of this study was to use propensity score matching to compare outcomes after these anatomic resection approaches for stage I non-small-cell lung cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective data set including 392 segmentectomy patients and 800 lobectomy patients was used to identify matched segmentectomy and lobectomy cohorts (n = 312 patients per group) using a propensity score matching algorithm that accounted for confounding effects of preoperative patient variables. Primary outcome variables included freedom from recurrence and overall survival. Factors affecting survival were assessed by Cox regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier estimates. RESULTS: Perioperative mortality was 1.2% in the segmentectomy group and 2.5% in the lobectomy group (P = .38). At a mean follow-up of 5.4 years, comparing segmentectomy with lobectomy, no differences were noted in locoregional (5.5% v 5.1%, respectively; P = 1.00), distant (14.8% v 11.6%, respectively; P = .29), or overall recurrence rates (20.2% v 16.7%, respectively; P = .30). Furthermore, when comparing segmentectomy with lobectomy, no significant differences were noted in 5-year freedom from recurrence (70% v 71%, respectively; P = .467) or 5-year survival (54% v 60%, respectively; P = .258). Segmentectomy was not found to be an independent predictor of recurrence (hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.40) or overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.52). CONCLUSION: In this large propensity-matched comparison, lobectomy was associated with modestly increased freedom from recurrence and overall survival, but the differences were not statistically significant. These results will need further validation by prospective, randomized trials (eg, Cancer and Leukemia Group B 140503 trial).",['(c) 2014 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],"['Landreneau, Rodney J', 'Normolle, Daniel P', 'Christie, Neil A', 'Awais, Omar', 'Wizorek, Joseph J', 'Abbas, Ghulam', 'Pennathur, Arjun', 'Shende, Manisha', 'Weksler, Benny', 'Luketich, James D', 'Schuchert, Matthew J']","['Landreneau RJ', 'Normolle DP', 'Christie NA', 'Awais O', 'Wizorek JJ', 'Abbas G', 'Pennathur A', 'Shende M', 'Weksler B', 'Luketich JD', 'Schuchert MJ']","['Rodney J.

Historic obstacles to the use of (225)Ac have been the difficulty in finding suitable chelators to stably attach it to targeting vehicles such as peptides and monoclonal antibodies, the low specific activities of the products, and the lack of cost-effective radiolabeling procedures. We initially solved the first problem with a procedure involving 2 chemical steps that has been used as a standard in preclinical and clinical studies. However, this procedure involves the loss of 90% of the input (225)Ac. A more efficient, economical process is needed to facilitate the more widespread use of (225)Ac. METHODS: We conjugated representative antibodies with 2 forms of DOTA as well as other chelators as controls. We developed conditions to radiolabel these constructs in 1 chemical step and characterized their stability, immunoreactivity, biodistribution, and therapeutic efficacy in healthy and tumor-bearing mice. RESULTS: DOTA-antibody constructs were labeled to a wide range of specific activities in 1 chemical step at 37 degrees C. Radiochemical yields were approximately 10-fold higher, and specific activities were up to 30-fold higher than with the previous approach. The products retained immunoreactivity and were stable to serum challenge in vitro and in mice. Labeling kinetics of DOTA-antibody constructs linked through a benzyl isothiocyanate linkage were more favorable than those linked through an N-hydroxysuccinimide linkage. Tissue distribution was similar but not identical between the constructs. The constructs produced specific therapeutic responses in a mouse model of acute myeloid leukemia. CONCLUSION: We have characterized an efficient, 1-step radiolabeling method that produces stable, therapeutically active conjugates of antibodies with (225)Ac at high specific activity. We propose that this technology greatly expands the possible clinical applications of (225)Ac monoclonal antibodies.","['(c) 2014 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.']","['Maguire, William F', 'McDevitt, Michael R', 'Smith-Jones, Peter M', 'Scheinberg, David A']","['Maguire WF', 'McDevitt MR', 'Smith-Jones PM', 'Scheinberg DA']","['Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.', 'Department of Radiology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York; and Department of Radiology, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York.', 'Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York d-scheinberg@ski.mskcc.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140630,United States,J Nucl Med,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",0217410,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', 'NIK1K0956U (Actinium)']",IM,"['Actinium/*therapeutic use', 'Alpha Particles/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Stability', '*Isotope Labeling', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*radiotherapy', 'Quality Control', 'Radioimmunotherapy/*methods', 'Tissue Distribution']",['NOTNLM'],"['225Ac', 'actinium-225', 'monoclonal antibody', 'radioimmunotherapy', 'alpha-emitting radionuclide']",2014/07/02 06:00,2014/11/05 06:00,['2014/07/02 06:00'],"['2014/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['jnumed.114.138347 [pii]', '10.2967/jnumed.114.138347 [doi]']",ppublish,J Nucl Med. 2014 Sep;55(9):1492-8. doi: 10.2967/jnumed.114.138347.

We used the multiple primary standardized incidence ratio session of SEER*stat software to calculate the risk of second primary malignancies in patients with AML. RESULTS: Among 5,091 patients, 148 patients developed a total of 160 second primary malignancies, with an observed/expected (O/E) ratio of 1.17, (95% confidence interval=0.99-1.36), and an excess risk of 15.47 per 10,000 population. The risk of all-site cancer, cancer of gastrointestinal system, and oral and pharyngeal cancer in different age groups was found to be significantly higher among patients with AML compared to that of general US population.

In particular, little is known about microRNAs in the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) signaling network. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using microRNA microarray, the microRNA profiles of 16 HER2-positive breast carcinomas were compared with those of five luminal-type breast carcinomas. Additionally, two frozen, ERBB2-amplified gastric carcinomas were compared with their adjacent normal tissue samples. MicroRNAs that were differentially expressed according to the HER2 status in breast and gastric carcinomas were identified as the HER2 microRNA signature. RESULTS: MiR-337 and miR-302f were commonly overexpressed in HER2-postive breast and gastric cancer. MiR-139 and miR-129 were commonly underexpressed in HER2-positive breast and gastric cancer. A concordant pattern of microRNA expression was noted between discovery sets and the majority of candidate microRNAs (two out of three) in three validation sets. CONCLUSION: Our study identified novel microRNAs that were differentially expressed according to the HER2 status across different tumor types.","['Copyright(c) 2014 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']","['Kang, Han Sung', 'Jang, Sang-Geun', 'Kwon, Sun Young', 'Park, Young Soo', 'Green, Jeffrey E', 'Kim, Hark Kyun', 'Ro, Jungsil']","['Kang HS', 'Jang SG', 'Kwon SY', 'Park YS', 'Green JE', 'Kim HK', 'Ro J']","['National Cancer Center, Goyang, Republic of Korea.', 'National Cancer Center, Goyang, Republic of Korea.', 'Keimyung University DongSan Medical Center, Daegu, Republic of Korea.', 'Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, U.S.A.', 'National Cancer Center, Goyang, Republic of Korea jungsro@ncc.re.kr hkim@ncc.re.kr.', 'National Cancer Center, Goyang, Republic of Korea jungsro@ncc.re.kr hkim@ncc.re.kr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ERBB2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Breast Neoplasms/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*enzymology/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*HER2', '*breast cancer', '*gastric cancer', '*miR-129', '*miR-139']",2014/07/02 06:00,2014/08/22 06:00,['2014/07/02 06:00'],"['2014/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/22 06:00 [medline]']",['34/7/3807 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2014 Jul;34(7):3807-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Anticancer Res. 2015 May;35(5):3109.

When he achieved the third complete response, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells of one-mismatch female donor were transplanted at the age of 50 years. Post-transplant acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease was treated by increased immunosuppression. At the age of 59, the patient was diagnosed with lower bile duct cancer and underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy with lymph node dissection. Pathological findings revealed a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the bile duct. Additional fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed female patterns of the tumor cells, which suggested that the tumor cells originated from the donor. The patient had a satisfactory recovery, and received adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1.

Medicinal plants are a rich source for the discovery of new drugs against leukemia and other types of cancers. To this end, we subjected the Jamaican ball moss (Tillandsia recurvata) and its cycloartanes, as well as some analogs, to in vitro screening against a number of leukemia cell lines. The WST-1 anti-proliferation assay was used to determine the anticancer activity of ball moss and two cycloartanes isolated from ball moss and four of their analogs against four leukemia cell lines (HL-60, K562, MOLM-14, monoMac6). Ball moss crude methanolic extract showed activity with a 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) value of 3.028 mug/ml against the Molm-14 cell line but was ineffective against HL-60 cells. The six cycloartanes tested demonstrated varying activity against the four leukemia cancer cell lines with IC50 values ranging from 1.83 muM to 18.3 muM. Five out of the six cycloartanes demonstrated activity, while one was inactive against all four cell lines. The preliminary activity demonstrated by the Jamaican ball moss and its cycloartanes against selected leukemia cell lines continues to throw light on the broad anticancer activity of ball moss. Further studies to evaluate the efficacy of these molecules in other leukemia cell lines are required in order to validate the activity of these molecules, as well as to determine their mechanisms of action and ascertain the activity in vivo in order to establish efficacy and safety profiles.","['Copyright(c) 2014 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']","['Lowe, Henry I C', 'Toyang, Ngeh J', 'Watson, Charah T', 'Ayeah, Kenneth N N', 'Bryant, Joseph']","['Lowe HI', 'Toyang NJ', 'Watson CT', 'Ayeah KN', 'Bryant J']","['Bio-Tech R & D Institute, Kingston, Jamaica Educational and Scientific Corporation, Wellington, FL, U.S.A.

Cell apoptosis was determined by measuring caspase-3/7 activity. The effect on protein synthesis was assessed using an in vitro cell-free translation assay system. RESULTS: In vitro, YPC-10157 exhibited marked cell growth inhibition and induced apoptosis. In vivo, YPC-10157 had a strong antitumor effect on xenograft models of human colon cancer and leukemia. Moreover, YPC-10157 and its derivatives inhibited protein synthesis and their inhibitory activity on protein synthesis significantly correlated regarding cell growth.

However, the role of CTCs in early breast cancer management is not yet clearly defined. The aim of this study was to assess the CTC-positivity rate in patients undergoing chemotherapy depending on breast cancer stage in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting. We evaluated the ability to confirm therapy response by CTC analysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: CTCs isolated from blood by means of immunomagnetic separation were further characterized by means of reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EPCAM), mucin 1 (MUC1) and v-erb-b2 avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (HER2) transcripts with the AdnaTest. This prospective study included 179 patients; altogether 419 blood samples were evaluated. Patients with primary tumors were divided into neoadjuvant (n=38), and adjuvant (n=100) groups. Forty-one patients with MBC were evaluated under palliative treatment. RESULTS: CTC positivity was described in 35% of patients with early breast cancer without detected metastases before neoadjuvant chemotherapy; similarly, a 26% positivity rate was found in the adjuvant group. In patients with MBC, we detected CTCs in 43% of them. After completing the therapy, the CTC positivity rate decreased to 5% in the neoadjuvant group, to 13% in the adjuvant group and to 12% in the MBC group. CTC positivity after the therapy may classify a subgroup of patients at high risk of developing metastatic disease. This was even true when a patient was evaluated as being CTC-negative before chemotherapy. The multivariate analysis evaluating the correlation of CTC positivity with clinicopathological characteristics such as tumor size, nodal involvement, hormone receptor status, HER2 expression and number of metastatic sites revealed no statistically significant relationships. CONCLUSION: CTC status may have a significant impact on early BC management.","['Copyright (c) 2014 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']","['Usiakova, Zuzana', 'Mikulova, Veronika', 'Pinterova, Daniela', 'Brychta, Milan', 'Valchar, Josef', 'Kubecova, Martina', 'Tesarova, Petra', 'Bobek, Vladimir', 'Kolostova, Katarina']","['Usiakova Z', 'Mikulova V', 'Pinterova D', 'Brychta M', 'Valchar J', 'Kubecova M', 'Tesarova P', 'Bobek V', 'Kolostova K']","['Oncology Clinic, Third Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Clinical Biochemistry, Allergology and Immunology, General Faculty Hospital, First Faculty of Medicine, Third Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Tumor Biology, Third Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Radiotherapy and Oncology Clinic, Faculty Hospital Kralovske Vinohrady, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Radiotherapy and Oncology Clinic, Faculty Hospital Kralovske Vinohrady, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Radiotherapy and Oncology Clinic, Faculty Hospital Kralovske Vinohrady, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Oncology Clinic, Third Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Laboratory Genetics, Faculty Hospital Kralovske Vinohrady, Prague, Czech Republic Department of Histology and Embryology, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Tumor Biology, Third Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic katarina.kolostova@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Breast Neoplasms, Male/diagnosis/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/metabolism/*pathology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tumor Burden']",['NOTNLM'],"['CTC', 'breast cancer', 'chemotherapy', 'circulating tumor cells']",2014/07/02 06:00,2015/02/24 06:00,['2014/07/02 06:00'],"['2014/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [medline]']",['28/4/605 [pii]'],ppublish,In Vivo. 2014 Jul-Aug;28(4):605-14.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we screened for FLT3-ITD mutations in 171 APL patients, treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and anthracycline-based chemotherapy. We identified FLT3-ITD mutations in 35 patients (20 %). FLT3-ITD mutations were associated with higher white blood cell counts (P < 0.0001), relapse-risk score (P = 0.0007), higher hemoglobin levels (P = 0.0004), higher frequency of the microgranular morphology (M3v) subtype (P = 0.03), and the short PML/RARA (BCR3) isoform (P < 0.0001). After a median follow-up of 38 months, FLT3-ITD(positive) patients had a lower 3-year overall survival rate (62 %) compared with FLT3-ITD(negative) patients (82 %) (P = 0.006). The prognostic impact of FLT3-ITD on survival was retained in multivariable analysis (hazard ratio: 2.39, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.17-4.89; P = 0.017). Nevertheless, complete remission (P = 0.07), disease-free survival (P = 0.24), and the cumulative incidence of relapse (P = 0.94) rates were not significantly different between groups. We can conclude that FLT3-ITD mutations are associated with several hematologic features in APL, in particular with high white blood cell counts.

Immunoblot analysis showed the activation of caspase-12 and caspase-9 and of the two effector caspase-3 and -7, suggesting that cell death occurred in a caspase-dependent manner. Interestingly we did not observe mitochondrial involvement in the process of cell death. Measures on semipurified proteasome from RS4;11 and SEM cell extracts demonstrated that chymotrypsin-, trypsin- and caspase-like activity decreased in the presence of CP. Moreover, we found an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and a remarkable increase of ER stress markers: GRP78, CHOP, and the spliced form of XBP1. Accordingly, the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide significantly protected cancer cells from CP-induced cell death, suggesting that protein synthesis machinery was involved. In well agreement with results obtained on stabilized cell lines, CP induced ER-stress and apoptosis also in primary cells from B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients.

However, in some patients the drug resistance can emerge too rapidly and a previous treatment with chemotherapy drugs can lead to formation of resistance. AIM: To evaluate the influence of drugs that were used prior to the imatinib on the performance of the functional activity of bone marrow cells from chronic myeloid leukemia patients and their individual responses to therapy. METHODS: Bone marrow aspirate from 57 patients, who were getting busulfan (19 patients) or hydroxycarbamide (38 patients) prior to imatinib was studied with cytogenetic and tissue culture methods in vitro. RESULTS: Obtained data suggested that pretreatment with busulfan, regardless of duration, negatively affects the response to further therapy with imatinib. Instead, after using hydroxycarbamide as a previous therapy for six month, there was optimal response to imatinib. In those cases when duration of pretreatment with hydroxycarbamide was increased to a year or more, there was a suboptimal response and a resistance to imatinib therapy. In addition, there was a positive correlation between the number of cell aggregates (colonies and clusters) in semisolid agar and the duration of a prior treatment with hydroxycarbamide, if previous therapy did not exceed 20 months. With an increase of pretreatment terms to 21 months or more, such a correlation was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that chemotherapeutic agents (busulfan and hydroxycarbamide) may additionally contribute to the accumulation of mutations in the genome of leukemic cell clone affecting the behavior of these cells in vitro.",,"['Zhaleiko, I O', 'Perekhrestenko, T P', 'Bilko, D I', 'Dyagil, I S', 'Bilko, N M']","['Zhaleiko IO', 'Perekhrestenko TP', 'Bilko DI', 'Dyagil IS', 'Bilko NM']","['Centre of Molecular and Cell Research of the National University ""Kyiv-Mohyla Academy"", Kyiv 04655, Ukraine.', 'SI ""Institute of Hematology and Transfusiology"" of the NAMS of Ukraine, Kyiv 04060, Ukraine.', 'Centre of Molecular and Cell Research of the National University ""Kyiv-Mohyla Academy"", Kyiv 04655, Ukraine.', 'National Research Center for Radiation Medicine, NAMS of Ukraine, Kyiv, Ukraine.', 'Centre of Molecular and Cell Research of the National University ""Kyiv-Mohyla Academy"", Kyiv 04655, Ukraine.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects', 'Busulfan/pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2014/07/02 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2014/07/02 06:00'],"['2014/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']",['6928 [pii]'],ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2014 Jun;36(2):112-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Of 46 patients registered, 44 were eligible and assessable; 38 (86%) completed induction, 29 (66%) underwent surgical resection, and 20 (45% of eligible, 69% surgical, and 91% of those initiating consolidation therapy) completed consolidation docetaxel; 28 of 29 (97%) underwent a complete (R0) resection; 2 (7%) died of adult respiratory distress syndrome. In resected patients, 21 of 29 (72%) had a pathologic complete or nearly complete response. The known site of first recurrence was local in 2, local-systemic in 1, and systemic in 10, with 7 in the brain only. The 3-year progression-free survival was 56%, and 3-year overall survival was 61%. CONCLUSIONS: Although trimodality therapy provides excellent R0 and local control, only 66% of patients underwent surgical resection and only 45% completed the treatment regimen. Even in this subset, distant recurrence continues to be a major problem, particularly brain-only relapse. Future strategies to improve treatment outcomes in this patient population must increase the effectiveness of systemic therapy and reduce the incidence of brain-only metastases.","['Copyright (c) 2014 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

Traditionally, SK has been measured in bulk cell lysates, but this technique obscures the cellular heterogeneity present in this pathway. For this reason, SK activity was measured in single cells loaded with a fluorescent sphingosine reporter. An automated capillary electrophoresis (CE) system enabled rapid separation and quantification of the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated sphingosine reporter in single cells. SK activity was measured in tissue-cultured cells derived from chronic myelogenous leukemia (K562), primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from three patients with different forms of leukemia, and enriched leukemic blasts from a patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Significant intercellular heterogeneity existed in terms of the degree of reporter phosphorylation (as much as an order of magnitude difference), the amount of reporter uptake, and the metabolites formed. In K562 cells, the average amount of reporter converted to the phosphorylated form was 39 +/- 26% per cell. Of the primary PBMCs analyzed, the average amount of phosphorylated reporter was 16 +/- 25%, 11 +/- 26%, and 13 +/- 23% in a chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patient, an AML patient, and a B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL) patient, respectively. These experiments demonstrated the challenge of studying samples comprised of multiple cell types, with tumor blasts present at 5 to 87% of the cell population. When the leukemic blasts from a fourth patient with AML were enriched to 99% of the cell population, 19 +/- 36% of the loaded sphingosine was phosphorylated. Thus, the diversity in SK activity remained even in a nearly pure tumor sample. These enriched AML blasts loaded significantly less reporter (0.12 +/- 0.2 amol) relative to that loaded into the PBMCs in the other samples (>/=1 amol). The variability in SK signaling may have important implications for SK inhibitors as therapeutics for leukemia and demonstrates the value of single-cell analysis in characterizing the nature of oncogenic signaling in cancer.",,"['Dickinson, Alexandra J', 'Hunsucker, Sally A', 'Armistead, Paul M', 'Allbritton, Nancy L']","['Dickinson AJ', 'Hunsucker SA', 'Armistead PM', 'Allbritton NL']","['Department of Chemistry, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140701,Germany,Anal Bioanal Chem,Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,101134327,"['EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.- (sphingosine kinase)']",IM,"['Electrophoresis, Capillary', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/*metabolism']",,,2014/07/02 06:00,2015/06/09 06:00,['2014/07/02 06:00'],"['2014/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/06 00:00 [revised]', '2014/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00216-014-7974-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Bioanal Chem. 2014 Nov;406(27):7027-36. doi: 10.1007/s00216-014-7974-6.

Because some patients present with EG a few days prior to developing life-threatening septicemia, it is important that EG be diagnosed correctly. Imatinib side effects such as edema are usually tolerable, and imatinib is widely used to treat Philadelphia-chromosome-positive leukemia, particularly in those with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and neutropenic patients undergoing imatinib therapy are expected to increase in number.

Little is known about the intrinsic mechanisms that are essential for forming memory B cells or endowing them with the ability to rapidly differentiate upon reexposure while maintaining the population over time. Histone modifications have been shown to regulate lymphocyte development, but their role in regulating differentiation and maintenance of B-cell subsets during an immune response is unclear. Using stage-specific deletion of monocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (MOZ), a histone acetyltransferase, we demonstrate that mutation of this chromatin modifier alters fate decisions in both primary and secondary responses. In the absence of MOZ, germinal center B cells were significantly impaired in their ability to generate dark zone centroblasts, with a concomitant decrease in both cell-cycle progression and BCL-6 expression. In contrast, there was increased differentiation to IgM and low-affinity IgG1(+) memory B cells. The lack of MOZ affected the functional outcome of humoral immune responses, with an increase in secondary germinal centers and a corresponding decrease in secondary high-affinity antibody-secreting cell formation. Therefore, these data provide strong evidence that manipulating epigenetic modifiers can regulate fate decisions during humoral responses, and thus could be targeted for therapeutic intervention.",,"['Good-Jacobson, Kim L', 'Chen, Yunshun', 'Voss, Anne K', 'Smyth, Gordon K', 'Thomas, Tim', 'Tarlinton, David']","['Good-Jacobson KL', 'Chen Y', 'Voss AK', 'Smyth GK', 'Thomas T', 'Tarlinton D']","['Divisions of Immunology,Departments of Medical Biology and jacobson@wehi.edu.au tarlinton@wehi.edu.au.', 'Departments of Medical Biology andBioinformatics, and.', 'Departments of Medical Biology andDevelopment and Cancer, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia; and.', 'Bioinformatics, andMathematics and Statistics, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC 3010, Australia.', 'Departments of Medical Biology andDevelopment and Cancer, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia; and.', 'Divisions of Immunology,Departments of Medical Biology and jacobson@wehi.edu.au tarlinton@wehi.edu.au.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140616,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Chromatin)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (MOZ protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromatin/immunology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunospot Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*immunology', 'Germinal Center/*immunology', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/*immunology', 'Immunologic Memory/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",,,2014/07/01 06:00,2014/09/24 06:00,['2014/07/01 06:00'],"['2014/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['1402485111 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1402485111 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Jul 1;111(26):9585-90. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1402485111.

Our review is based on 25 articles regarding novel diagnostic and therapeutic methods as well as prognostic factors, released between 1992 and 2011. Those articles focus mostly on molecular and cytogenetic testing allowing revolutionary methods of patient classification and individual therapy for this highly heterogeneous group of disorders. Implementation of molecular genetic testing to evaluate the type of leukaemia allowed paediatric oncologists and haematologists to adjust the intensity of treatment, improve outcome, minimize toxicity of therapies and considerably lower the risk of side effects.

A 6-month home-based intervention, with written and video instruction, was supervised with weekly calls from an exercise coach. Pre- and poststudy testing addressed strength, flexibility, fitness, and motor function. RESULTS: Seventeen patients enrolled (participation 63%).

Assessment is usually done qualitatively. OBJECTIVES: To assess CD5 expression levels by quantitative flow cytometry immunophenotyping and to determine possible differences among various small B-cell neoplasms. DESIGN: We performed 4-color flow cytometry analysis on specimens of peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate and quantified CD5 expression in various small B-cell lymphomas and leukemias. We also assessed CD5 levels in peripheral blood samples of healthy blood donors. RESULTS: Cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma had higher levels of CD5 compared with control B cells (P < .001). Cases of marginal zone lymphoma and hairy cell leukemia had CD5 levels similar to control B cells (P = .35 and P = .14, respectively), whereas cases of follicular lymphoma and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma had significantly lower CD5 levels than control B cells (P < .001 and P = .04, respectively). In B-cell neoplasms, a high level of CD5 expression was correlated with a homogeneous pattern of positive events, whereas lower CD5 levels were correlated with heterogeneous patterns of positive events. CONCLUSIONS: Using flow cytometric immunophenotypic analysis to quantify CD5 levels can aid in diagnosis. CD5 expression levels are higher in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma, and expression is observed in a homogeneous pattern, as compared with other B-cell neoplasms that are either negative for CD5 or express CD5 at lower levels with a heterogeneous pattern.

Oxasqualenoid natural products are implicated as potent biologically active molecules, particularly with regard to demonstrating significant cytotoxicity. Characteristic features of oxasqualenoids containing tetrahydrofuran fragments include the presence of a cis- and/or trans-2,5-disubstituted pattern in tetrahydrofuran moieties, and molecular symmetry is often noticed as well. Given their unique structural features combined with their bioactivity, two representative examples from this class of natural products, eurylene and teurilene, have been briefly reviewed. Eurylene, with reported cytotoxicity against lymphocytic leukemia, contains two non-adjacent linked cis- and trans-2,5-disubstituted tetrahydrofuran rings and a combined total of eight stereogenic centres. It is a chiral molecule due to the lack of a C2 axis of symmetry. Teurilene shows a prominent cytotoxicity on KB cells and has three adjacently linked 2,5-disubstituted tetrahydrofurans. A distinctive achiral facet is observed in teurilene, despite having eight stereocentres, due to the presence of meso symmetry (Cs).

METHODS: This is a case report. RESULTS: A 57-year-old man presented with bilateral conjunctival hyperemia and chemosis associated with pain. He also complained of having fatigue, general weakness, and disequilibrium. His visual acuity was 20/20 bilaterally. His intraocular pressures were 34 mm Hg oculus dexter (OD) and 35 mm Hg oculus sinister (OS). His anterior segments were noted for moderate conjunctival injection, deep anterior chambers with +2 anterior chamber cells and flare, no abnormalities of iris structures, and mild nuclear sclerosis. His optic discs showed vertical cup-to-disc ratios of 0.4 oculus dexter and 0.7 oculus sinister. On B-scan ultrasonography, mild fluid in the sub-Tenon space and a thickening of the uvea were observed in both eyes. The patient was diagnosed with bilateral diffuse anterior scleritis and secondary glaucoma. Systemic evaluation revealed adult T-PLL with pulmonary, abdominal, and pelvic adenopathy; pleural effusion; and central nervous system (CNS) involvement. He was treated with systemic alemtuzumab and intrathecal alternating cytarabine/hydrocortisone and methotrexate/hydrocortisone. His lymphadenopathy decreased in size and the pleural effusion, scleritis, and secondary glaucoma resolved; however, his CNS disease was unresponsive.

Role of the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis in acute myeloid leukaemia].,593-604,10.1684/bdc.2014.1925 [doi],"CXCR4, receptor of the chemokine SDF-1 (stromal cell-derived factor 1) plays a major role in the normal hematopoiesis but also in the biology of the leukaemic cell. This receptor is expressed on the surface of blasts and is a key molecule in ""the anchoring"" of the leukaemic stem cell (LSC) within the bone marrow niche. The interactions of the LSC with the bone marrow microenvironment promote survival signals and drug resistance. Recent flow cytometry analyses reported that CXCR4 expression levels have a major prognostic impact in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). CXCR4 expression is associated with poor prognosis and can be useful to stratify patients, according to their phenotype, in order to establish risk-adapted strategies. Newly diagnosed AML are now routinely stratified according to molecular markers which guide prognosis and treatment. Many leukaemia are composed of multiples subclones with differential susceptibility to treatment and specific targeted therapies are missing. Despite therapeutic improvements for the treatment of AML, long term survival remains poor. Targeting CXCR4 is a novel promising approach of therapy. CXCR4 antagonists are used in combination with chemotherapy in preclinical and clinical studies. This review summarises our current knowledge regarding the key role of CXCR4 in AML and discusses how targeting this pathway could provide an interesting approach to eradicate the LSC.",,"['Tavernier, Emmanuelle', 'Aanei, Carmen', 'Solly, Francoise', 'Flandrin-Gresta, Pascale', 'Campos, Lydia', 'Guyotat, Denis']","['Tavernier E', 'Aanei C', 'Solly F', 'Flandrin-Gresta P', 'Campos L', 'Guyotat D']","[""Institut de cancerologie Lucien-Neuwirth, Service d'hematologie, 108 bis, avenue Albert-Raimond, 42270 Saint-Priest-en-Jarez, France, Universite Jean-Monnet, UMR 5239, Laboratoire de biologie moleculaire de la cellule, 42000 Saint-Etienne, France."", ""CHU Saint-Etienne, Hopital Nord, laboratoire d'hematologie, 42270 Saint-Priest-en-Jarez, France."", ""Universite Jean-Monnet, UMR 5239, Laboratoire de biologie moleculaire de la cellule, 42000 Saint-Etienne, France, CHU Saint-Etienne, Hopital Nord, laboratoire d'hematologie, 42270 Saint-Priest-en-Jarez, France."", ""Universite Jean-Monnet, UMR 5239, Laboratoire de biologie moleculaire de la cellule, 42000 Saint-Etienne, France, CHU Saint-Etienne, Hopital Nord, laboratoire d'hematologie, 42270 Saint-Priest-en-Jarez, France."", ""Universite Jean-Monnet, UMR 5239, Laboratoire de biologie moleculaire de la cellule, 42000 Saint-Etienne, France, CHU Saint-Etienne, Hopital Nord, laboratoire d'hematologie, 42270 Saint-Priest-en-Jarez, France."", ""Institut de cancerologie Lucien-Neuwirth, Service d'hematologie, 108 bis, avenue Albert-Raimond, 42270 Saint-Priest-en-Jarez, France, Universite Jean-Monnet, UMR 5239, Laboratoire de biologie moleculaire de la cellule, 42000 Saint-Etienne, France.""]",['fre'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,France,Bull Cancer,Bulletin du cancer,0072416,"['0 (ACKR3 protein, human)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Movement/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemokine CXCL12/*physiology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, CXCR/metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR4/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Microenvironment/physiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['CXCR4', 'SDF-1', 'acute myeloid leukaemia', 'prognostic factors', 'therapeutic target']",2014/07/01 06:00,2014/08/26 06:00,['2014/07/01 06:00'],"['2014/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['bdc.2014.1925 [pii]', '10.1684/bdc.2014.1925 [doi]']",ppublish,Bull Cancer. 2014 Jun;101(6):593-604. doi: 10.1684/bdc.2014.1925.,,CXCR4 : nouvelle cible therapeutique de la cellule leucemique?

In the present study, a hemagglutinin (BSH, B. speciosus hemagglutinin) was isolated from its fruiting bodies and enzymatic properties were also tested. The chromatographic procedure utilized comprised anion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose, cation exchange chromatography on CM-Cellulose, cation exchange chromatography on SP-Sepharose, and gel filtration by FPLC on Superdex 75. The hemagglutinin was a homodimer which was estimated to be approximately 31 kDa in size. The activity of BSH was stable up to 60 degrees C, while there was a precipitous drop in activity when the temperature was elevated to 70 degrees C. BSH retained 25% hemagglutinating activity when exposed to 100 mM NaOH and 25 mM HCl. The activity was potently inhibited by 1.25 mM Hg(2+) and slightly inhibited by Fe(2+), Ca(2+), and Pb(2+).

Cancer and cardiovascular diseases are the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to synthesize the evidence evaluating the association between obesity and 13 cancers shown previously to be significantly associated with obesity. Methods. Relevant papers from a previously conducted review were included in this paper. In addition, database searches of Medline and Embase identified studies published from the date of the search conducted for the previous review (January, 2007) until May, 2011. The reference lists of relevant studies and systematic reviews were screened to identify additional studies. Relevance assessment, quality assessment, and data extraction for each study were conducted by two reviewers independently. Meta-analysis was performed for men and women separately using DerSimonian and Laird's random effects model. Results. A total of 98 studies conducted in 18 countries from 1985 to 2011 were included. Data extraction was completed on the 57 studies judged to be of strong and moderate methodological quality. Results illustrated that obese men were at higher risk for developing colon (Risk Ratio (RR), 1.57), renal (1.57), gallbladder (1.47), pancreatic (1.36), and malignant melanoma cancers (1.26). Obese women were at higher risk for esophageal adenocarcinoma (2.04), endometrial (1.85), gallbladder (1.82), renal (1.72), pancreatic (1.34), leukemia (1.32), postmenopausal breast (1.25), and colon cancers (1.19). Conclusions. The results of this meta-analysis illustrate a significant, positive, and, for some cancers, strong association between obesity and cancer incidence. Given that approximately 23% of Canadians are obese, a significant proportion of cancer in Canada could be avoided if obesity was eliminated or significantly reduced.",,"['Dobbins, M', 'Decorby, K', 'Choi, B C K']","['Dobbins M', 'Decorby K', 'Choi BC']","['School of Nursing, McMaster University, 1280 Main Street West, 3N25G, Hamilton, ON, Canada L8N 3Z5.', 'School of Nursing, McMaster University, 1280 Main Street West, 3N25G, Hamilton, ON, Canada L8N 3Z5.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Community Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada K1H 8M5.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20130404,United States,ISRN Prev Med,ISRN preventive medicine,101612035,,,,,,2013/01/01 00:00,2013/01/01 00:01,['2014/07/01 06:00'],"['2013/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2013/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.5402/2013/680536 [doi]'],epublish,ISRN Prev Med. 2013 Apr 4;2013:680536. doi: 10.5402/2013/680536. eCollection 2013.,,,,PMC4062857,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When only one drug is considered, the problem is a univariate one and has been well-studied. However, in the multidimensional setting, that is, in the presence of combinations of agents, estimation of the ED becomes more difficult. This study is focused on the plug-in logistic regression estimator of the multidimensional ED. We discuss consistency of such estimators and focus on the problem of simultaneous confidence regions. We develop a bootstrap algorithm to estimate confidence regions for the multidimensional ED. Through simulation, we show that the proposed method gives 95% confidence regions, which have better empirical coverage than the previous method for moderate to large sample sizes.

The most widely used prognostic scoring system (International Prognostic Scoring System [IPSS]) was recently revised (IPSS-R). The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic relevance of flow cytometry (FC) in the context of the IPSS-R. Bone marrow aspirates were analysed by FC in 159 patients with MDS. A flow score was calculated by applying the flow cytometric scoring system (FCSS). Patients were assigned to IPSS and IPSS-R risk groups. The FCSS correlated with the World Health Organization classification, IPSS and IPSS-R risk groups. Mild flow cytometric abnormalities were associated with significantly better overall survival (OS) and lower risk of disease evolution. The presence of aberrant myeloid progenitors was associated with transfusion dependency and disease progression. Most importantly, the FCSS identified prognostic subgroups within the IPSS-R cytogenetic good risk and low risk group. Flow cytometric analysis in patients with MDS provides additional prognostic information and is complementary to the IPSS-R. The addition of a flow cytometric score next to the clinical parameters within the IPSS-R is a further refinement of prognostication of patients with MDS.",['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Alhan, Canan', 'Westers, Theresia M', 'Cremers, Eline M P', 'Cali, Claudia', 'Witte, Birgit I', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'van de Loosdrecht, Arjan A']","['Alhan C', 'Westers TM', 'Cremers EM', 'Cali C', 'Witte BI', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'van de Loosdrecht AA']","['Department of Haematology, Cancer Centre Amsterdam, VU University Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140630,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*mortality/*pathology/therapy', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['IPSS-R', 'flow cytometry', 'myelodysplastic syndromes', 'prognosis']",2014/07/01 06:00,2014/11/19 06:00,['2014/07/01 06:00'],"['2014/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.12994 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2014 Oct;167(1):100-9. doi: 10.1111/bjh.12994.

Active human beta-papillomavirus (beta-HPV) infection has been found in OTR skin lesions, suggesting its possible involvement in skin carcinogenesis. Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) has also been reported in cases of skin cancer. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the potential correlations between patient clinical features and skin cancer development, and the presence of beta-HPV and MCPyV DNA and protein markers in skin lesions and hair bulbs from patients with CLL. METHODS: The clinical features of 293 patients with CLL were analysed according to the presence or absence of skin lesions. beta-HPV and MCPyV infection was investigated in skin lesions and hair bulbs from the study cohort by both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis and immunohistochemical screening. RESULTS: No significant correlations were observed between any of the analysed haematological parameters and the development of skin cancer. PCR analysis revealed the presence of beta-HPV and MCPyV DNA in skin lesions, and 83% of positivity for MCPyV DNA in hair bulbs, while systematic immunohistochemical analysis of all the lesions failed to detect any expression of the viral proteins beta-HPV E4, L1 or MCPyV LTAg. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the data indicate that carriage of beta-HPV and MCPyV in the lesional skin and hair bulbs from patients with CLL without any evident reactivation at skin tumour sites most likely represents coincidental rather than causal infection. This contrasts with previous findings in relation to OTR-derived skin lesions.",['(c) 2014 British Association of Dermatologists.'],"['Peretti, A', 'Borgogna, C', 'Rossi, D', 'De Paoli, L', 'Bawadekar, M', 'Zavattaro, E', 'Boldorini, R', 'De Andrea, M', 'Gaidano, G', 'Gariglio, M']","['Peretti A', 'Borgogna C', 'Rossi D', 'De Paoli L', 'Bawadekar M', 'Zavattaro E', 'Boldorini R', 'De Andrea M', 'Gaidano G', 'Gariglio M']","['Virology Unit, Department of Translational Medicine, Novara Medical School, via Solaroli 17, 28100, Novara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141026,England,Br J Dermatol,The British journal of dermatology,0004041,,IM,"['Aged', 'Betapapillomavirus/isolation & purification', 'Cohort Studies', 'Eyebrows/*virology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications', 'Male', 'Merkel cell polyomavirus/isolation & purification', 'Papillomavirus Infections/*complications', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polyomavirus Infections/*complications', 'Skin Diseases, Viral/*complications', 'Skin Neoplasms/complications']",,,2014/07/01 06:00,2015/08/19 06:00,['2014/07/01 06:00'],"['2014/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjd.13215 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Dermatol. 2014 Dec;171(6):1525-8. doi: 10.1111/bjd.13215.

The Glivec International Patient Assistance Program (GIPAP) is a patient-access program sponsored by Novartis Oncology and administered by The Max Foundation (MAX) that provides imatinib free of charge to patients in resource-restricted countries who are not able to afford this treatment. PROCEDURES: GIPAP highlights a cohort of children (n = 3,188) with CML that provides novel insight into international trends in diagnosis, treatment, and survival. These trends can be compared to outcomes in developed nations to crudely assess the impact of an extended access program for CML treatment such as GIPAP. RESULTS: Overall survival values for children treated for CML within the GIPAP (89%) suggest that imatinib is very effective in middle and low-income countries. CONCLUSIONS: This may allow for increased international awareness within the scientific community to consider possible reasons for the differences in overall survival in pediatric CML within the United States versus other nations with fewer resources.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Sadak, Karim Thomas', 'Fultz, Kara', 'Mendizabal, Adam', 'Reaman, Gregory', 'Garcia-Gonzalez, Pat', 'Levine, Paul H']","['Sadak KT', 'Fultz K', 'Mendizabal A', 'Reaman G', 'Garcia-Gonzalez P', 'Levine PH']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Minnesota Children's Hospital, Minneapolis, Minnesota; Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20140629,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Global Health', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['childhood chronic myeloid leukemia', 'international cohort survivor']",2014/07/01 06:00,2014/11/07 06:00,['2014/07/01 06:00'],"['2013/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25120 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Oct;61(10):1774-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25120.

Additionally, IKZF1 deletions and mutations identify high-risk biological subsets of childhood ALL [Georgopoulos et al. Cell 1995;83(2):289-299; Mullighan et al. N Engl J Md 2009;360(5):470-480]. PROCEDURES: To discover the underlying pathways modulated by Ikaros we performed gene expression and gene ontology analysis in IKZF1 deleted primary B-ALL pediatric patient samples. To validate downstream targets we performed qPCR on individual patient samples. We also created IKZF1 knockdown B-ALL cell lines with over 50% reduction of Ikaros, mimicking haplosufficient Ikaros deletions, and again performed qPCR to investigate the downstream targets. Finally, to understand the association of Ikaros deletion with a poor prognosis we challenged our IKZF1 knockdown cell lines with chemotherapy and compared responses to IKZF1 wild-type controls. RESULTS: We report a specific gene expression signature of 735 up-regulated and 473 down-regulated genes in IKZF1 deleted primary B-ALL pediatric patient samples. Gene ontology studies revealed an up-regulation of genes associated with cell adhesion, cytoskeletal regulation, and motility in IKZF deleted patient samples. Validated up-regulated target genes in IKZF1 deleted patient samples included CTNND1 and PVRL2 (P = 0.0003 and P = 0.001), and RAB3IP and SPIB (P = 0.005 and P = 0.032) were down-regulated. In further studies in IKZF1 knockdown cell lines, apoptosis assays showed no significant chemoresistance. CONCLUSION: IKZF1 knockdown alone does not impart intrinsic chemotherapy resistance suggesting that the association with a poor prognosis may be due to additional lesions, microenvironmental interactions with the bone marrow niche, or other factors.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Vitanza, Nicholas A', 'Zaky, Wafik', 'Blum, Roy', 'Meyer, Julia A', 'Wang, Jinhua', 'Bhatla, Teena', 'Morrison, Debra J', 'Raetz, Elizabeth A', 'Carroll, William L']","['Vitanza NA', 'Zaky W', 'Blum R', 'Meyer JA', 'Wang J', 'Bhatla T', 'Morrison DJ', 'Raetz EA', 'Carroll WL']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Laura and Isaac Perlmutter Cancer Center at New York University Langone Medical Center, New York, New York.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140629,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Child', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcriptome']",['NOTNLM'],"['Ikaros', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'adhesion', 'molecular biology of ALL', 'molecular genetics']",2014/07/01 06:00,2014/11/07 06:00,['2014/07/01 06:00'],"['2014/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25119 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Oct;61(10):1779-85. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25119.

The combination of dasatinib with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) was supposed to be effective for leukemia therapy. Taking full advantage of novel nano-biotechnology, we have developed a robust electrochemical cytosensing approach to profile the therapeutic effects of dasatinib and TRAIL by probing the activity of caspase-3 from apoptotic CML cells. The sensor was on a base of a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) modified with nano-materials composed of Au nanoparticles (AuNPs), poly(dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride) (PDDA), and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Then the platform immobilized the biotinylated DEVD-peptide (biotin-Gly-Asp-Gly-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-Gly-Cys) via the strong bonding between AuNPs and the thiol group (Au-S bond). In particular, the sensor was then constructed with the environmentally friendly alkaline phosphatase (ALP) via the specific interaction between the biotin and streptavidin, and could retest detection indirectly for caspase-3 sensing by detecting the differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) signal of enzymatic catalysis product, ascorbic acid (AA). The results indicated that either dasatinib or TRAIL could successfully induce the apoptosis of CML cells, while the combination of dasatinib and TRAIL resulted in an improved therapeutic effect, suggesting a novel optimized strategy for CML therapy. This novel electrochemical sensing strategy exhibits attractive advantages of environmental benignity, simple performance, high stability, and may be readily expanded to evaluate other cancer therapeutic effects.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Among various members of the bromodomain and extra terminal domain family, BRD4 is found to be an important target for many diseases such as cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma, Burkitt's lymphoma, etc. Therefore, in this study an attempt has been made to screen compounds from NCI Diversity, Drug Bank and Toslab Databases targeting the Kac binding site of BRD4 using molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, MM-PB/GBSA binding free energy calculations and steered molecular dynamics simulations. Using virtual screening and docking, we have identified 11 inhibitors. These new inhibitors exhibit binding energy values higher than that of the (+)JQ1 inhibitor which is effective against BRD4. However, due to the toxicity of (+)JQ1, the designing of new inhibitors becomes significantly important. Thus, these new 11 ligands were systematically analyzed using other computational investigations. Results reveal that the compounds ZINC01411240, ZINC19632618 and ZINC04818522 could be potential drug candidates for targeting BRD4. It can also be seen from the results that there is a linear relationship between the results obtained from the SMD simulation and free energy obtained from the MM-PBSA/GBSA approach.

Correlative studies measured putative AML leukemia initiating cells (AML-LIC) before and after treatment. PROCEDURE: Patients with <400 mg/m(2) prior anthracycline received bortezomib combined with idarubicin (12 mg/m(2) days 1-3) and low-dose cytarabine (100 mg/m(2) days 1-7) (Arm A). Patients with >/=400 mg/m(2) prior anthracycline received bortezomib with etoposide (100 mg/m(2) on days 1-5) and high-dose cytarabine (1 g/m(2) every 12 hours for 10 doses) (Arm B). RESULTS: Forty-six patients were treated with 58 bortezomib-containing cycles. The dose finding phase of Arm B established the recommended Phase 2 dose of bortezomib at 1.3 mg/m(2) on days 1, 4, and 8 with Arm B chemotherapy. Both arms were closed after failure to meet predetermined efficacy thresholds during the first stage of the two-stage design. The complete response (CR + CRp) rates were 29% for Arm A and 43% for Arm B. Counting additional CRi responses (CR with incomplete neutrophil recovery), the overall CR rates were 57% for Arm A and 48% for Arm B. The 2-year overall survival (OS) was 39 +/- 15%. Correlative studies showed that LIC depletion after the first cycle was associated with clinical response. CONCLUSION: Bortezomib is tolerable when added to chemotherapy regimens for relapsed pediatric AML, but the regimens did not exceed preset minimum response criteria to allow continued accrual. This study also suggests that AML-LIC depletion has prognostic value.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Horton, Terzah M', 'Perentesis, John P', 'Gamis, Alan S', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Gerbing, Robert B', 'Ballard, Jennifer', 'Adlard, Kathleen', 'Howard, Dianna S', 'Smith, Franklin O', 'Jenkins, Gaye', 'Kelder, Angele', 'Schuurhuis, Gerrit J', 'Moscow, Jeffrey A']","['Horton TM', 'Perentesis JP', 'Gamis AS', 'Alonzo TA', 'Gerbing RB', 'Ballard J', 'Adlard K', 'Howard DS', 'Smith FO', 'Jenkins G', 'Kelder A', 'Schuurhuis GJ', 'Moscow JA']","[""Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers at Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140629,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Boronic Acids/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Bortezomib', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/drug therapy', 'Pyrazines/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Rabbits', 'Salvage Therapy/methods', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'AraC', 'Velcade', 'pediatric oncology', 'relapse']",2014/07/01 06:00,2014/11/07 06:00,['2014/07/01 06:00'],"['2014/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25117 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Oct;61(10):1754-60. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25117.

We found that a significant proportion of primary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) samples showed PIM1 and PIM2 expression by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Therefore, we investigated the effects of a novel ATP-competitive pan-PIM inhibitor, AZD1897, on AML cell growth and survival. PIM inhibition showed limited single agent activity in AML cell lines and primary AML cells, including those with or without FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation. However, significant synergy was seen when AZD1897 was combined with the Akt inhibitor AZD5363, a compound that is in early-phase clinical trials. AML cells from putative leukaemia stem cell subsets, including CD34+38- and CD34+38+ fractions, were equivalently affected by dual PIM/Akt inhibition when compared with bulk tumour cells. Analysis of downstream signalling pathways showed that combined PIM/Akt inhibition downregulated mTOR outputs (phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and S6) and markedly reduced levels of the anti-apoptotic protein MCL1.

This raises the questions: What do inflammatory tissues provide to promote mutagenesis? And what is the nature of mutagenesis? We determined that mineral oil-induced plasmacytomas produce large amounts of endogenous retroelements--ecotropic and polytropic murine leukemia virus and intracisternal A particles. Therefore, plasmacytoma formation might occur, in part, by de novo insertion of these retroelements, induced or helped by the inflammation. We recovered up to ten de novo insertions in a single plasmacytoma, mostly in genes with common retroviral integration sites. Additional integrations accompany tumor evolution from a solid tumor through several generations in cell culture. The high frequency of de novo integrations into cancer genes suggests that endogenous retroelements are coresponsible for plasmacytoma formation and progression in BALB/c mice.","['(c) 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The aim of this study is to validate the conclusions obtained from our model protein studies on a pharmaceutical protein. Interferon alpha-2a (IFNA2) is available as a therapeutic treatment for numerous immune-compromised disorders including leukemia and hepatitis C, and APs have been used in its multi-dose formulation. Similar to Cyt c, APs induced IFNA2 aggregation, demonstrated by the loss of soluble monomer and increase in solution turbidity. The extent of IFNA2 aggregation increased with the increase in AP concentration. IFNA2 aggregation also depended on the nature of AP, and followed the order m-cresol>phenol>benzyl alcohol>phenoxyethanol.

However, the underlying epigenetic mechanisms remain largely unknown. The goal of the study was to explore microRNAome alterations induced by ionizing radiation (IR) in murine thymus, and to determine the role of IR-inducible microRNA (miRNA/miR) in the development of leukemia. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We used the well-established C57BL/6 mouse model and miRNA microarray profiling to identify miRNAs that are differentially expressed in murine thymus in response to irradiation. TIB152 human leukemia cell line was used to determine the role of estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha) in miR-27b transcription. The biological effects of ectopic miR-27b on leukemogenesis were measured by western immunoblotting, cell viability, apoptosis, and cell cycle analyses. RESULTS: Here, we have shown that IR triggers the differential expression of miR-27b in murine thymus tissue in a dose-, time- and sex-dependent manner. miR-27b was significantly down-regulated in leukemia cell lines CCL119 and TIB152. Interestingly, ERalpha was overexpressed in those 2 cell lines, and it was inversely correlated with miR-27b expression. Therefore, we used TIB152 as a model system to determine the role of ERalpha in miR-27b expression and the contribution of miR-27b to leukemogenesis. beta-Estradiol caused a rapid and transient reduction in miR-27b expression reversed by either ERalpha-neutralizing antibody or ERK1/2 inhibitor. Ectopic expression of miR-27b remarkably suppressed TIB152 cell proliferation, at least in part, by inducing S-phase arrest. In addition, it attenuated the expression of cyclin A2, although it had no effect on the levels of PCNA, PPARgamma, CDK2, p21, p27, p-p53, and cleaved caspase-3. CONCLUSION: Our data reveal that beta-estradiol/ERalpha signaling may contribute to the down-regulation of miR-27b in acute leukemia cell lines through the ERK1/2 pathway, and that miR-27b may function as a tumor suppressor that inhibits cell proliferation by targeting cyclin A2.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We report a case of a 12-year-old boy who experienced a relapse of ALL in the pancreas after a bone marrow transplant. METHODS: Clinical data, including course of illness, laboratory results, and imaging studies are included. The patient presented with acute pancreatitis, suspected to be secondary to gallstones, with ampullary obstruction. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a distended gallbladder and intra- and extra-hepatic biliary dilatation with a cutoff at the pancreatic head, but with no evidence of gallstones. RESULTS: Ultrasound-guided biopsy of the pancreas revealed ALL in the pancreas. Systematic chemotherapy was recommended, but was declined by the parents. The patient died one week later.

Indeed, expression of the multidrug resistance protein ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2) confers chemoresistance to CSCs, where it serves as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target. Here, we show that afatinib, a small-molecule inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases EGFR, HER2, and HER4, preferentially eliminated side population cells with CSC character, in both cell lines and patient-derived leukemia cells, by decreasing ABCG2 expression. In these cells, afatinib also acted in parallel to suppress self-renewal capacity and tumorigenicity. Combining afatinib with the DNA-damaging drug topotecan enhanced the antitumor effect of topotecan in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic investigations suggested that ABCG2 suppression by afatinib did not proceed by proteolysis through the ubiquitin-dependent proteosome, lysosome, or calpain. Instead, we found that afatinib increased DNA methyltransferase activity, thereby leading to methylation of the ABCG2 promoter and to a decrease in ABCG2 message level. Taken together, our results advocate the use of afatinib in combination with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs to improve efficacy by improving CSC eradication.",['(c)2014 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Wang, Xiao-kun', 'He, Jie-hua', 'Xu, Jing-hong', 'Ye, Sheng', 'Wang, Fang', 'Zhang, Hui', 'Huang, Zhen-cong', 'To, Kenneth Kin Wah', 'Fu, Li-wu']","['Wang XK', 'He JH', 'Xu JH', 'Ye S', 'Wang F', 'Zhang H', 'Huang ZC', 'To KK', 'Fu LW']","['State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.

No biological differences (cytogenetics by fluorescent in situ hybridization, IGHV, ZAP-70, CD38, NOTCH1, SF3B1) were found across age groups. Elderly patients (>70 years; n=367) presented more frequently with advanced disease (Binet C/Rai III-IV: 10/12% versus 5/5%; P<0.001), were treated less frequently (23.8% versus 41.9% at 3 years; P<0.001) and in most cases did not receive highly effective regimens and thus had a lower overall response rate (49% with 14% having complete responses versus 69% with 31% having complete responses; P<0.001). The elderly patients also had a shorter overall survival (6.6 versus 13.3 years; P<0.001) and higher disease-unrelated mortality (34.9% versus 6.9% at 10 years; P<0.001). However, disease-attributable mortality was not significantly different between younger and older patients. A combination of Binet stage, ZAP-70 level, beta2-microglobulin concentration and comorbidity identified two risk groups (low-risk: 0-1 parameters; high-risk: 2-4 parameters) with different overall survivals (median: 6.8 versus 11.4 years, P<0.001). In patients requiring treatment, comorbidity at treatment (Cumulative Illness Rating Scale-T>4; hazard ratio 2.2, P<0.001) and response (treatment failure versus response: hazard ratio 1.60, P<0.04) were the most important prognostic factors for overall survival. In conclusion, in our series, elderly patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia did not present with any biological features distinct from those of younger patients, but did have a poorer clinical outcome.

The decision and timing to offer a second transplant after graft failure is challenging. With the aim of addressing this issue, we analyzed engraftment kinetics and outcomes of 1268 patients (73% children) with acute leukemia (64% acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 36% acute myeloid leukemia) in remission who underwent single-unit umbilical cord blood transplantation after a myeloablative conditioning regimen. The median follow-up was 31 months. The overall survival rate at 3 years was 47%; the 100-day cumulative incidence of transplant-related mortality was 16%. Longer time to engraftment was associated with increased transplant-related mortality and shorter overall survival. The cumulative incidence of neutrophil engraftment at day 60 was 86%, while the median time to achieve engraftment was 24 days. Probability density analysis showed that the likelihood of engraftment after umbilical cord blood transplantation increased after day 10, peaked on day 21 and slowly decreased to 21% by day 31. Beyond day 31, the probability of engraftment dropped rapidly, and the residual probability of engrafting after day 42 was 5%. Graft failure was reported in 166 patients, and 66 of them received a second graft (allogeneic, n=45). Rescue actions, such as the search for another graft, should be considered starting after day 21. A diagnosis of graft failure can be established in patients who have not achieved neutrophil recovery by day 42. Moreover, subsequent transplants should not be postponed after day 42.",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Ruggeri, Annalisa', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Sormani, Maria Pia', 'Sanz, Guillermo', 'Sanz, Jaime', 'Volt, Fernanda', 'Michel, Gerard', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Diaz De Heredia, Cristina', ""O'Brien, Tracey"", 'Arcese, William', 'Iori, Anna Paola', 'Querol, Sergi', 'Kogler, Gesine', 'Lecchi, Lucilla', 'Pouthier, Fabienne', 'Garnier, Federico', 'Navarrete, Cristina', 'Baudoux, Etienne', 'Fernandes, Juliana', 'Kenzey, Chantal', 'Eapen, Mary', 'Gluckman, Eliane', 'Rocha, Vanderson', 'Saccardi, Riccardo']","['Ruggeri A', 'Labopin M', 'Sormani MP', 'Sanz G', 'Sanz J', 'Volt F', 'Michel G', 'Locatelli F', 'Diaz De Heredia C', ""O'Brien T"", 'Arcese W', 'Iori AP', 'Querol S', 'Kogler G', 'Lecchi L', 'Pouthier F', 'Garnier F', 'Navarrete C', 'Baudoux E', 'Fernandes J', 'Kenzey C', 'Eapen M', 'Gluckman E', 'Rocha V', 'Saccardi R']","[""Eurocord, Hospital Saint Louis, AP-HP, and IUH University Paris VII, France Hospital Saint Antoine, Service d'Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire, AP-HP, UPMC University of Paris 06, UMR-S 938, CEREST-TC EBMT, France Cord Blood Committee EBMT, University of Genova, Italy annalisa.ruggeri@sls.aphp.fr."", ""Hospital Saint Antoine, Service d'Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire, AP-HP, UPMC University of Paris 06, UMR-S 938, CEREST-TC EBMT, France."", 'Biostatistics Unit, Department of Health Sciences (DISSAL), University of Genova, Italy.', 'Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Eurocord, Hospital Saint Louis, AP-HP, and IUH University Paris VII, France.', ""Hopital d'Enfants de la Timone, Marseille, France."", 'Dipartimento di Oncoematologia Pediatrica, Ospedale Bambino Gesu, IRCSS, Rome/University of Pavia, Italy.', ""Servicio de Hematologia y Oncologia Pediatricas, Hospital Universitario Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Sydney Children's Hospital, Sydney, Australia."", 'Rome Transplant Network, University Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Universita La Sapienza, Dip.

However, the relative risks and benefits of alloHCT compared with novel nontransplant therapies continue to be the source of considerable uncertainty. We will perform a prospective biologic assignment trial to compare RIC alloHCT with nontransplant therapies based on donor availability. Primary outcome is 3-year overall survival. Secondary outcomes include leukemia-free survival, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness. Four hundred patients will be enrolled over roughly 3 years. Planned subgroup analyses will evaluate key biologic questions, such as the impact of age and response to hypomethylating agents on treatment effects.

Mcl-1 is an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member that is often over expressed in breast tumors, correlating with poor survival. In breast cancer, it was been previously shown that epidermal growth factor receptors up-regulate Mcl-1 but the role of estrogen in increasing Mcl-1 expression was unknown. In ERalpha positive cell lines MCF-7 and ZR-75, estrogen treatment increased Mcl-1 expression at both the protein and mRNA level. In two ERalpha negative cell lines, SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-231, estrogen failed to increase in Mcl-1 protein expression. We found that ERalpha antagonists decreased estrogen mediated Mcl-1 expression at both the protein and mRNA level. Upon knockdown of ERalpha, Mcl-1 mRNA expression after estrogen treatment was also decreased. We also found that ERalpha binds to the Mcl-1 promoter at a region upstream of the translation start site containing a half ERE site. Streptavidin-pull down assay showed that both ERalpha and transcription factor Sp1 bind to this region. These results suggest that estrogen is involved in regulating Mcl-1 expression specifically through a mechanism involving ERalpha.",,"['Schacter, Jennifer L', 'Henson, Elizabeth S', 'Gibson, Spencer B']","['Schacter JL', 'Henson ES', 'Gibson SB']","['Department of Biochemistry and Medical Genetics, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada; Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology, CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Medical Genetics, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada; Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology, CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Medical Genetics, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada; Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology, CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140627,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (ESR1 protein, human)', '0 (Estrogen Antagonists)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)', '0 (Estrogens)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Estrogen Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha/genetics/metabolism', 'Estrogens/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Gene Order', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Response Elements', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/metabolism']",,,2014/06/28 06:00,2015/10/08 06:00,['2014/06/28 06:00'],"['2013/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0100364 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-39286 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jun 27;9(6):e100364. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0100364. eCollection 2014.,,,,PMC4074091,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the impact of VEGFA gene diversity on the clinical outcome of patients with this disease. A VEGFA haplotype conformed by positions rs699947 (-1540C>A), rs833061 (-460T>C) and rs2010963 (405C>G) and two additional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs3025039 (936C>T) and rs25648 (1032C>T), were analysed in 239 patients at the time of their CLL diagnosis. Here, we showed that homozygosity for rs699947/rs833061/rs2010963 ACG haplotype (ACG+/+ genotype) correlated with a reduced survival in CLL patients (ACG+/+ vs other genotypes: HR = 2.3, p = 0.002; recessive model). In multivariate analysis, the ACG+/+ genotype was identified as a novel independent prognostic factor (HR = 2.1, p = 0.005). Moreover, ACG homozygosity subdivided patients with CLL with otherwise indolent parameters into prognostic subgroups with different outcomes. Specifically, patients carrying the ACG+/+ genotype with mutated IgVH, very low and low-risk cytogenetics, initial clinical stage, CD38 negative status or early age at diagnosis showed a shorter survival (ACG+/+ vs other genotypes: HR = 3.5, p = 0.035; HR = 3.4, p = 0.001; HR = 2.2, p = 0.035; HR = 3.4, p = 0.0001 and HR = 3.1, p = 0.009, respectively).

With that advance, CML has been largely managed as a chronic condition, with daily medication and frequent monitoring. Optimizing monitoring methods and identifying factors associated with response and long-term outcomes has thus been a major clinical research focus. Given the improved understanding of surveillance techniques in CML and the advent of several recently approved second- and third-generation TKIs, there have been recent updates to clinical practice guidelines. The dramatic change in survival for patients with CML treated with TKIs compared with previous therapies and the subsequent incremental therapeutic improvements have led to uniquely well-supported approaches and surveillance of patients on TKI therapy. Measurement of RNA for BCR-ABL1 via quantitative PCR (qPCR) is the cornerstone of disease management. Efforts to maximize utility and scheduling of molecular monitoring and the care plans based on results of that monitoring are at the heart of current investigations. Study designs of major clinical studies in CML will incorporate new goals of therapy and molecular monitoring methods.",,"['Savona, Michael R']",['Savona MR'],"['Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN USA Email:michael.savona@vanderbilt.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Community Support Oncol,The Journal of community and supportive oncology,101621609,,,,,,2014/06/28 06:00,2014/06/28 06:01,['2014/06/28 06:00'],"['2014/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.12788/jcso.0042 [doi]'],ppublish,J Community Support Oncol. 2014 May;12(5):171-8. doi: 10.12788/jcso.0042.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study provides new insights on the mechanisms cooperating in driving MSI2 over-expression and progression of Ph-positive CML. RESULTS: Herein we describe a t(7;11)(p15;p15) originating a NUP98 fusion with HOXA13, at 7p15, in a 39 year-old man in blast crisis of Ph-positive CML. Both MSI2 and HOXA9 were evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR in our patient and in a series of haematological malignancies. Up-regulation of both genes emerged only in the presence of NUP98/HOXA13 gene fusion. However, over-expression of MSI2, but not HOXA9, was found in 2 cases of Ph + blast crisis with additional chromosome aberrations other than t(7;11). To determine the mechanisms underlying MSI2 over-expression in our patient we performed Chromatin Immunoprecipitation and found that NUP98/HOXA13 fusion protein deregulates MSI2 gene by binding its promoter. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first molecular characterization of NUP98/HOXA13 fusion in blast crisis of Ph + CML. Our findings suggest cooperative mechanisms of MSI2 over-expression driven by HOXA proteins and strongly supports MSI2 as a prognostic marker and a candidate in target treatment of CML.",,"['Di Giacomo, Danika', 'Pierini, Valentina', 'Barba, Gianluca', 'Ceccarelli, Veronica', 'Vecchini, Alba', 'Mecucci, Cristina']","['Di Giacomo D', 'Pierini V', 'Barba G', 'Ceccarelli V', 'Vecchini A', 'Mecucci C']","['Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, University of Perugia, Polo Unico S.

To define genotype/phenotype relationships of clinical relevance, we studied 308 patients with MDS, MDS/MPN, or acute myeloid leukemia evolving from MDS. Unsupervised statistical analysis, including the World Health Organization classification criteria and somatic mutations, showed that MDS associated with SF3B1-mutation (51 of 245 patients, 20.8%) is a distinct nosologic entity irrespective of current morphologic classification criteria. Conversely, MDS with ring sideroblasts with nonmutated SF3B1 segregated in different clusters with other MDS subtypes. Mutations of genes involved in DNA methylation, splicing factors other than SF3B1, and genes of the RAS pathway and cohesin complex were independently associated with multilineage dysplasia and identified a distinct subset (51 of 245 patients, 20.8%). No recurrent mutation pattern correlated with unilineage dysplasia without ring sideroblasts. Irrespective of driver somatic mutations, a threshold of 5% bone marrow blasts retained a significant discriminant value for identifying cases with clonal evolution.

To elucidate whether there is a genetic component to the mechanism of asparaginase-induced immune responses, we imputed human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles in patients of European ancestry enrolled on leukemia trials at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (n = 541) and the Children's Oncology Group (n = 1329). We identified a higher incidence of hypersensitivity and anti-asparaginase antibodies in patients with HLA-DRB1*07:01 alleles (P = 7.5 x 10(-5), odds ratio [OR] = 1.64; P = 1.4 x 10(-5), OR = 2.92, respectively). Structural analysis revealed that high-risk amino acids were located within the binding pocket of the HLA protein, possibly affecting the interaction between asparaginase epitopes and the HLA-DRB1 protein. Using a sequence-based consensus approach, we predicted the binding affinity of HLA-DRB1 alleles for asparaginase epitopes, and patients whose HLA genetics predicted high-affinity binding had more allergy (P = 3.3 x 10(-4), OR = 1.38). Our results suggest a mechanism of allergy whereby HLA-DRB1 alleles that confer high-affinity binding to asparaginase epitopes lead to a higher frequency of reactions.

Recently, HIV has been reported to enhance TC renin expression. We hypothesized that HIV induces and maintains high renin expression to promote its own replication in TCs. Renin enhanced HIV replication in TCs in a dose-dependent manner. (P)RR-deficient TCs, as well as those lacking renin, displayed attenuated NF-kappaB activity and HIV replication. TCs treated with renin and Hpr displayed activation of the (P)RR-PLZF protein signaling cascade. Renin, HIV, and Hpr activated the PI3K pathway. Both renin and Hpr cleaved Agt (a renin substrate) to Ang I and also cleaved Gag polyproteins (protease substrate) to p24. Furthermore, aliskiren, a renin inhibitor, reduced renin- and Hpr-induced cleavage of Agt and Gag polyproteins. These findings indicate that renin contributes to HIV replication in TCs via the (P)RR-PLZF signaling cascade and through cleavage of the Gag polyproteins.",['(c) 2014 Society for Leukocyte Biology.'],"['Chandel, Nirupama', 'Ayasolla, Kamesh', 'Lan, Xiqian', 'Rai, Partab', 'Mikulak, Joanna', 'Husain, Mohammad', 'Malhotra, Ashwani', 'McGowan, Joseph', 'Singhal, Pravin C']","['Chandel N', 'Ayasolla K', 'Lan X', 'Rai P', 'Mikulak J', 'Husain M', 'Malhotra A', 'McGowan J', 'Singhal PC']","['Center of Immunology and Inflammation, Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, North Shore LIJ Hofstra Medical School, Manhasset, New York, USA; and.', 'Center of Immunology and Inflammation, Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, North Shore LIJ Hofstra Medical School, Manhasset, New York, USA; and.', 'Center of Immunology and Inflammation, Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, North Shore LIJ Hofstra Medical School, Manhasset, New York, USA; and.', 'Center of Immunology and Inflammation, Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, North Shore LIJ Hofstra Medical School, Manhasset, New York, USA; and.', 'Unit of Clinical and Experimental Immunology, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, Rozzano, Milan, Italy.', 'Center of Immunology and Inflammation, Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, North Shore LIJ Hofstra Medical School, Manhasset, New York, USA; and.', 'Center of Immunology and Inflammation, Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, North Shore LIJ Hofstra Medical School, Manhasset, New York, USA; and.', 'Center of Immunology and Inflammation, Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, North Shore LIJ Hofstra Medical School, Manhasset, New York, USA; and.', 'Center of Immunology and Inflammation, Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, North Shore LIJ Hofstra Medical School, Manhasset, New York, USA; and psinghal@nshs.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140626,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (ATP6AP2 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.23.15 (Renin)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Vacuolar Proton-Translocating ATPases)']",IM,"['HIV-1/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Proteolysis/drug effects', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/deficiency/metabolism', 'Renin/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/*virology', 'Vacuolar Proton-Translocating ATPases/deficiency/metabolism', 'Virus Replication/*drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['Aspartyl protease', 'Vitamin D receptors']",2014/06/28 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/06/28 06:00'],"['2014/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['JLB.2A0414-192R [pii]', '10.1189/JLB.2A0414-192R [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2014 Oct;96(4):601-9. doi: 10.1189/JLB.2A0414-192R.

As current MRD-detecting methods such as flow cytometry or patient-specific qPCR are complex or difficult to standardize in the clinical laboratory, sequencing may enhance clinical prognostication. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We sequenced IGH in paired pretreatment and day 29 post-treatment samples using residual material from consecutive, unselected samples from the Children's Oncology Group AALL0932 trial to measure MRD as compared with flow cytometry. We assessed the impact of ongoing recombination at IGH on MRD detection in post-treatment samples. Finally, we evaluated a subset of cases with discordant MRD results between flow cytometry and sequencing. RESULTS: We found clonal IGH rearrangements in 92 of 98 pretreatment patient samples. Furthermore, while ongoing recombination of IGH was evident, index clones typically prevailed in MRD-positive post-treatment samples, suggesting that clonal evolution at IGH does not contribute substantively to tumor fitness. MRD was detected by sequencing in all flow cytometry-positive cases with no false-negative results. In addition, in a subset of patients, MRD was detected by sequencing, but not by flow cytometry, including a fraction with MRD levels within the sensitivity of flow cytometry. We provide data that suggest that this discordance in some patients may be due to the phenotypic maturation of the transformed cell. CONCLUSION: Our results provide strong support for HTS of IGH to enhance clinical prognostication in B-ALL.",['(c)2014 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Wu, David', 'Emerson, Ryan O', 'Sherwood, Anna', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Angiolillo, Anne', 'Howie, Bryan', 'Vogt, Jennifer', 'Rieder, Mark', 'Kirsch, Ilan', 'Carlson, Christopher', 'Williamson, David', 'Wood, Brent L', 'Robins, Harlan']","['Wu D', 'Emerson RO', 'Sherwood A', 'Loh ML', 'Angiolillo A', 'Howie B', 'Vogt J', 'Rieder M', 'Kirsch I', 'Carlson C', 'Williamson D', 'Wood BL', 'Robins H']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, Washington.', 'Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, Washington.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California.', ""Children's National Medical Center, The George Washington University of Medicine, Washington, DC."", 'Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, Washington.', 'Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, Washington.', 'Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, Washington.', 'Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, Washington.', 'Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, Washington.', 'Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, Washington.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington. hrobins@fhcrc.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140626,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['Disease-Free Survival', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain/genetics', '*High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/complications/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual/etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis']",,,2014/06/28 06:00,2015/07/08 06:00,['2014/06/28 06:00'],"['2014/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-13-3231 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-3231 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2014 Sep 1;20(17):4540-8. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-3231.

To identify the mechanism for epidermotropism of lymphoma cells, total RNAs were obtained from skin biopsies of epidermis and dermis of MF and ATLL patients by means of laser capture microdissection, and used for subsequent complementary DNA (cDNA) microarray experiments. This procedure has made it possible for us to observe and evaluate the regional environment of MF and ATLL. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed that the cDNAs could be clearly differentiated into MF and ATLL. CCL27 was expressed in the dermis generated from keratinocytes, CCR4/CCR6/CCR7/CCR10/cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen (CLA) lymphoma cells in the dermis, and CCL21 in the extracellular matrix (stroma). Lymphotoxin (LT) beta and CCL21 expression was significantly higher and that of CCR10 relatively for MF, while CCR4 and CLA expression was relatively higher for ATLL. In the epithelium, keratinocytes expressed CCL20/CCL27, and lymphoma cells CCR4/CCR6/CCR10, while CCR4, CCR6, CCL20 and CCL27 expression was relatively higher for ATLL than MF. The dermis of MF, but not that of ATLL, showed correlation between CCR7 and CCL21. These findings support the suggestion that chemokines and chemokine receptors are involved in the pathogenesis of MF and ATLL, indicate that cutaneous homing seems to be different for MF and ATLL, and point to the possibility that cutaneous T-cell lymphomas originate in regulatory T cells, especially in the case of ATLL.",,"['Hashikawa, Keiko', 'Yasumoto, Shinichiro', 'Nakashima, Kazutaka', 'Arakawa, Fumiko', 'Kiyasu, Junichi', 'Kimura, Yoshizo', 'Saruta, Hiroshi', 'Nakama, Takekuni', 'Yasuda, Kaori', 'Tashiro, Kosuke', 'Kuhara, Satoru', 'Hashimoto, Takashi', 'Ohshima, Koichi']","['Hashikawa K', 'Yasumoto S', 'Nakashima K', 'Arakawa F', 'Kiyasu J', 'Kimura Y', 'Saruta H', 'Nakama T', 'Yasuda K', 'Tashiro K', 'Kuhara S', 'Hashimoto T', 'Ohshima K']","['Department of Dermatology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Japan.', 'Cell Innovator, Inc., Venture Business Laboratory of Kyushu University, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Gene Technics, Department of Genetic Resources Technology, Graduate School of Genetic Resources Technology, Faculty of Agriculture, Kyushu University, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Gene Technics, Department of Genetic Resources Technology, Graduate School of Genetic Resources Technology, Faculty of Agriculture, Kyushu University, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140626,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (CCL27 protein, human)', '0 (CCR10 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL27)', '0 (Receptors, CCR10)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Chemokine CCL27/*genetics/metabolism', 'Dermis/metabolism/pathology', 'Epidermis/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Humans', 'Keratinocytes/metabolism', 'Laser Capture Microdissection/*methods', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycosis Fungoides/*genetics/pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Receptors, CCR10/*genetics/metabolism', 'Skin Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Young Adult']",,,2014/06/28 06:00,2015/02/24 06:00,['2014/06/28 06:00'],"['2014/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2014.2524 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2014 Sep;45(3):1200-8. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2014.2524.

Therefore, we tested the in vitro response to ofatumumab (OFA) and rituximab (RTX) in 75 CLL samples with clearly defined p53 or ATM inactivation. Using standard conditions allowing complement-dependent cytotoxicity, i.e., 10 mug/mL of antibodies and 20% active human serum, we observed clear differences among the tested genetic categories: ATM-mutated samples (n = 17) represented the most sensitive, wild-type samples (n = 31) intermediate, and TP53-mutated samples (n = 27) the most resistant group (ATM-mut vs. TP53-mut: P = 0.0005 for OFA and P = 0.01 for RTX). The response correlated with distinct levels of CD20 and critical complement inhibitors CD55 and CD59; CD20 level median was the highest in ATM-mutated and the lowest in TP53-mutated samples (difference between the groups P < 0.01), while the total level of complement inhibitors (CD55 plus CD59) was distributed in the opposite manner (P < 0.01). Negligible response to both OFA and RTX was noted in all cultures (n = 10) tested in the absence of active serum, which strongly indicated that complement-dependent cytotoxicity was a principal cell death mechanism.

Since senescence has been recognized as a physiological barrier against tumorigenesis, senescence-based therapy could represent a new strategy against CML. DNA demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC) was reported to induce cellular senescence but underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Here, we report that exposure to DAC triggers senescence in chronic leukemia cell lines as evidenced by increased senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity and lysosomal mass, accompanied by an up-regulation of cell cycle-related genes. We provide evidence that DAC is able to decrease telomere length, to reduce telomerase activity and to decrease human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) expression through decreased binding of c-myc to the hTERT promoter. Altogether, our results reveal the role of c-myc in telomere-dependent DAC-induced senescence and therefore provide new clues for improving chronic human leukemia treatments.","['Copyright (c) 2014 Neoplasia Press, Inc.

Imatinib mesylate is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that specifically targets the BCR-ABL protein and induces hematological remission in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Unfortunately, the majority of CML patients treated with imatinib develop resistance under prolonged therapy. We here investigated the methylation profile of SOCS-3 gene and its downstream effects in a BCR-ABL positive CML cells resistant to imatinib. MATERIALS AND METHODS: BCR-ABL positive CML cells resistant to imatinib (K562-R) were developed by overexposure of K562 cell lines to the drug. Cytotoxicity was determined by MTS assays and IC50 values calculated. Apoptosis assays were performed using annexin V-FITC binding assays and analyzed by flow cytometry. Methylation profiles were investigated using methylation specific PCR and sequencing analysis of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 genes. Gene expression was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR, and protein expression and phosphorylation of STAT1, 2 and 3 were examined by Western blotting. RESULTS: The IC50 for imatinib on K562 was 362 nM compared to 3,952 nM for K562-R (p=0.001). Percentage of apoptotic cells in K562 increased upto 50% by increasing the concentration of imatinib, in contrast to only 20% in K562-R (p<0.001). A change from non-methylation of the SOCS-3 gene in K562 to complete methylation in K562-R was observed. Gene expression revealed down- regulation of both SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 genes in resistant cells. STAT3 was phosphorylated in K562-R but not K562. CONCLUSIONS: Development of cells resistant to imatinib is feasible by overexposure of the drug to the cells. Activation of STAT3 protein leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation in imatinib resistant BCR-ABL due to DNA methylation of the SOCS-3 gene. Thus SOCS-3 provides a suitable candidate for mechanisms underlying the development of imatinib resistant in CML patients.",,"['Al-Jamal, Hamid A N', 'Jusoh, Siti Asmaa Mat', 'Yong, Ang Cheng', 'Asan, Jamaruddin Mat', 'Hassan, Rosline', 'Johan, Muhammad Farid']","['Al-Jamal HA', 'Jusoh SA', 'Yong AC', 'Asan JM', 'Hassan R', 'Johan MF']","['Department of Haematology, School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Kelantan, Malaysia E-mail : faridjohan@usm.my.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (SOCS3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression/genetics', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes, abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/*genetics', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",,,2014/06/28 06:00,2015/03/31 06:00,['2014/06/28 06:00'],"['2014/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.11.4555 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2014;15(11):4555-61. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.11.4555.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, identification of intrinsic resistance molecules against Cisplatin is vital to estimate the success of therapy. Bag-1 (Bcl-2-associated anthanogene) is one anti-apoptotic protein involved in drug resistance impacting on therapeutic efficiency. Elevated levels of this protein are related with increase cell proliferation rates, motility and also cancer development. For this reason, we aimed to understand the role of Bag-1 expression in Cisplatin- induced apoptosis in HeLa cervix cancer cells. Cisplatin decreased cell viability in time- and dose-dependent manner in wt and Bag-1L+HeLa cells. Although, 10 muM Cisplatin treatment induced cell death within 24h by activating caspases in wt cells, Bag-1L stable transfection protected cells against Cisplatin treatment. To assess the potential protective role of Bag-1, we first checked the expression profile of interacting anti-apoptotic partners of Bag-1. We found that forced Bag-1L expression prevented Cisplatin-induced apoptosis through acting on Mcl-1 expression, which was reduced after Cisplatin treatment in wt HeLa cells. This mechanism was also supported by the regulation of heat shock protein (Hsp) family members, Hsp90 and Hsp40, which were involved in the regulation Bag-1 interactome including several anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members and c-Raf.",,"['Ozfiliz, Pelin', 'Arisan, Elif Damla', 'Coker-Gurkan, Ajda', 'Obakan, Pinar', 'Eralp, Tugce Nur', 'Dinler-Doganay, Gizem', 'Palavan-Unsal, Narcin']","['Ozfiliz P', 'Arisan ED', 'Coker-Gurkan A', 'Obakan P', 'Eralp TN', 'Dinler-Doganay G', 'Palavan-Unsal N']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Science and Letters, Istanbul Kultur University, Atakoy, Turkey E-mail : d.arisan@iku.edu.tr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2-associated athanogene 1 protein)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Down-Regulation/*genetics', 'Female', 'HeLa Cells', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics']",,,2014/06/28 06:00,2015/03/31 06:00,['2014/06/28 06:00'],"['2014/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.11.4475 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2014;15(11):4475-82. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.11.4475.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Prospective, longitudinal design. SETTING: Two cancer centers in the southwestern United States. SAMPLE: 36 children (aged 3-14 years) newly diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. METHODS: Symptoms were measured using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale at six specific time points during treatment. Biochemical changes in oxidative stress were measured by oxidized PC in the CSF. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Childhood cancer symptoms, oxidized PC. FINDINGS: Significant differences were found in the number of symptoms experienced during the three phases of treatment. Symptom trajectory changes and influence of the oxidative stress pathway on symptom experiences were identified.

These procedures are often equipment-intensive and may not be practised in developing countries with limited resources. Hence, it is not clear what would be the most effective strategy to manage hyperleukocytosis and prevent TLS. PROCEDURE: All children </=12 years, diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and hyperleukocytosis (WBC count >100 x 10(9)/l) were administered L-asparginase (L-asp, 6,000 U/m(2), i.m.) along with standard supportive care consisting of hydration, oral allopurinol administration and alkalization. The complete blood counts and biochemical parameters were monitored for 72 h. After 48 h, if the WBC count was >100 x 10(9)/l, a repeat dose of L-asp was administered. RESULTS: Twenty-one children (9 boys and 12 girls) with hyperleukocytic ALL were treated with L-asp. The median age of the children was 5.3 years (range 2-11 years). The median initial WBC count was 249 x 10(9)/l (range 151-476 x 10(9)/l). Twenty children received only one dose of L-asp. The mean reduction in WBC count achieved by treatment was 15.7, 42.0, 61.0, 76.4, 85.5 and 90.8% at 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 h, respectively. None of the patients developed TLS.

In Italy, SENTIERI Project (Epidemiological study of residents in National Priority Contaminated Sites, NPCSs) was implemented to study major health outcomes for residents in 44 NPCSs. METHODS: The Italian Association of Cancer Registries (AIRTUM) records cancer incidence in 23 NPCSs. For each NPCSs, the incidence of all malignant cancers combined and 35 cancer sites (coded according to ICD-10), was analysed (1996-2005). The observed cases were compared to the expected based on age (5-year period,18 classes), gender, calendar period (1996-2000; 2001-2005), geographical area (North-Centre and Centre-South) and cancer sites specific rates. Standardized Incidence Ratios (SIR) with 90% Confidence Intervals were computed. RESULTS: In both genders an excess was observed for overall cancer incidence (9% in men and 7% in women) as well as for specific cancer sites (colon and rectum, liver, gallblad-der, pancreas, lung, skin melanoma, bladder and Non Hodgkin lymphoma). Deficits were observed for gastric cancer in both genders, chronic lymphoid leukemia (men), malignant thyroid neoplasms, corpus uteri and connective and soft-tissue tumours and sarcomas (women). DISCUSSION: This report is, to our knowledge, the first one on cancer risk of residents in NPCSs. The study, although not aiming to estimate the cancer burden attributable to the environment as compared to occupation or life-style, supports the credibility of an etiologic role of environmental exposures in contaminated sites. Ongoing analyses focus on the interpretation of risk factors for excesses of specific cancer types overall and in specific NPCSs in relation to the presence of carcinogenic pollutants.",,"['Comba, Pietro', 'Ricci, Paolo', 'Iavarone, Ivano', 'Pirastu, Roberta', 'Buzzoni, Carlotta', 'Fusco, Mario', 'Ferretti, Stefano', 'Fazzo, Lucia', 'Pasetto, Roberto', 'Zona, Amerigo', 'Crocetti, Emanuele']","['Comba P', 'Ricci P', 'Iavarone I', 'Pirastu R', 'Buzzoni C', 'Fusco M', 'Ferretti S', 'Fazzo L', 'Pasetto R', 'Zona A', 'Crocetti E']","['Dipartimento di Ambiente e Connessa Prevenzione Primaria, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of nilotinib, 600 mg, and dasatinib, 100 mg, each compared to imatinib, 400 mg, as first-line therapy in chronic myeloid leukemia in Colombia from a third-party payer's perspective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using a Markov model to evaluate a hypothetical cohort of one hundred 55 year-old patients with newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase, and the time horizon for the baseline case was established as being until the end of life. Progression-free life-years saved were considered the primary outcome. Transition probabilities for major molecular response, disease progression to accelerated phase or blast crisis, and chronic myeloid leukemia related deaths were analyzed in the model for each arm. A 3% discount rate was applied to all costs and patient outcomes. Model robustness was evaluated using both univariate and multivariate Montecarlo sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Nilotinib was higher in expected progression-free life-years saved (15.21 vs. 12.64 for imatinib), followed by dasatinib (14.91 vs. 14.54 for imatinib). Imatinib had lower total lifetime costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was US$ 33,120.36 in the nilotinib arm and US$ 514,939.08 in the dasatinib arm per progression-free life-years (PF-LYs) saved, each compared to imatinib. When analyzing nilotinib versus dasatinib indirectly, nilotinib was found to be dominant due to higher efficacy (2.25 PF-LYs) and lower costs (US$ 44,674) in the baseline case. The average estimated cost to manage disease progression per year was US$ 101,978.78, considered to be the threshold. CONCLUSION: In Colombia, using PF-LYs as the efficacy outcome, nilotinib is highly cost-effective when compared to imatinib and dominant vs. dasatinib in first-line therapy for CML in chronic phase.",,"['Romero, Martin', 'Chavez, Diana', 'De Los Rios, Magali', 'Alvis-Guzman, Nelson']","['Romero M', 'Chavez D', 'De Los Rios M', 'Alvis-Guzman N']","['Fundacion Salutia, Centro de Investigaciones en Economia, Gestion y Tecnologias en Salud, Bogota, D.C., Colombia.', 'Fundacion Salutia, Centro de Investigaciones en Economia, Gestion y Tecnologias en Salud, Bogota, D.C., Colombia.', 'External Advisory Consultant in Hematology, Bogota, D.C., Colombia.', 'Grupo de Investigacion en Economia de la Salud, Universidad de Cartagena, Cartagena, Colombia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Colombia,Biomedica,Biomedica : revista del Instituto Nacional de Salud,8205605,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Benzamides/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Colombia', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Dasatinib', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*economics', 'Piperazines/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/*economics/*therapeutic use']",,,2014/06/28 06:00,2015/03/31 06:00,['2014/06/28 06:00'],"['2012/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0120-41572014000100008 [pii]', '10.1590/S0120-41572014000100008 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomedica. 2014 Jan-Mar;34(1):48-59. doi: 10.1590/S0120-41572014000100008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

T-ALL comprises about 15% of pediatric and 25% of adult ALL cases. Even if the prognosis of T-ALL has improved especially in the childhood due to the use of new intensified treatment protocols, the outcome of relapsed patients who are resistant to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs or who relapse is still poor. For this reason, there is a need for novel and less toxic targeted therapies against signaling pathways aberrantly activated in T-ALL, such as the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Small molecules designed to target key components of this signaling axis have proven their efficacy both in vitro and in vivo in pre-clinical settings of T-ALL. In particular, different classes of mTOR inhibitors have been disclosed by pharmaceutical companies, and they are currently being tested in clinical trials for treating T-ALL patients. One of the most promising approaches for the treatment of T-ALL seems to be the combination of mTOR inhibitors with traditional chemotherapeutic agents. This could lead to a lower drug dosage that may circumvent the systemic side effects of chemotherapeutics. In this review, we focus on the different classes of mTOR inhibitors that will possibly have an impact on the therapeutic arsenal we have at our disposal against T-ALL.",,"['Evangelisti, Camilla', 'Evangelisti, Cecilia', 'Chiarini, Francesca', 'Lonetti, Annalisa', 'Buontempo, Francesca', 'Bressanin, Daniela', 'Cappellini, Alessandra', 'Orsini, Ester', 'McCubrey, James A', 'Martelli, Alberto M']","['Evangelisti C', 'Evangelisti C', 'Chiarini F', 'Lonetti A', 'Buontempo F', 'Bressanin D', 'Cappellini A', 'Orsini E', 'McCubrey JA', 'Martelli AM']","['Institute of Molecular Genetics, National Research Council, Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics, National Research Council, Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Human Social and Health Sciences, University of Cassino, Cassino, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20140626,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Humans', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,,2014/06/28 06:00,2015/02/24 06:00,['2014/06/28 06:00'],"['2014/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2014.2525 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2014 Sep;45(3):909-18. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2014.2525.

About 70% of the glycosphingolipids in human neutrophils are lactosylceramide, a molecule also expressed on monocytes and dendritic cells, but not on lymphocytes. In contrast, phosphatidylglucoside is mainly expressed on neutrophils. STED microscopic analysis showed that phosphatidylglucoside and lactosylceramide form different domains on plasma membranes of neutrophils, with phosphatidylglucoside preferentially expressed along the neutrophil differentiation pathway. Phosphatidylglucoside was found to mediate the differentiation of HL-60 cells into the neutrophilic lineage, and to be involved in FAS-dependent neutrophil apoptosis. In contrast, lactosylceramide was only expressed on mature neutrophils. Complexes of lactosylceramide and the Src family kinase Lyn form membrane microdomains. LacCer-enriched membrane microdomains mediate neutrophil innate immune responses; e.g. chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and superoxide generation. C24 fatty acid chains of LacCer are indispensable for the formation of LacCer-Lyn complexes and for LacCer-dependent functions. Moreover, Lyn-coupled LacCer-enriched microdomains serve as signal transduction platforms for alphaMbeta2 integrin-mediated phagocytosis. This review describes the organization and potential functions of glycolipids in phagocytes, as well as the roles of both phosphatidylglucoside and lactosylceramide in neutrophils.

These analyses have allowed for the refinement of the mechanisms underlying the leukemic transformation in several oncohematologic disorders and, more importantly, they have permitted the definition of novel prognostic algorithms aimed at stratifying patients at the onset of disease and, consequently, treating them in the most appropriate manner.

Nilotinib is widely used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The present study identifies Mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) as a target of nilotinib. In studying ALL cell lines, we found that the expression of MDM2 in both Philadelphia positive (Ph+) and Philadelphia negative (Ph-) ALL cells was remarkably inhibited by nilotinib, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Further studies demonstrated that nilotinib inhibited MDM2 at the post-translational level by inducing MDM2 self-ubiquitination and degradation. Nilotinib-mediated MDM2 downregulation did not result in accumulation and activation of p53. Inhibition of MDM2 in nilotinib-treated ALL cells led to downregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), a translational target of MDM2, resulting in activation of caspases. Inhibition of XIAP following nilotinib-mediated downregulation of MDM2 resulted in apoptosis of MDM2-expressing ALL; however, similar nilotinib treatment induced stronger apoptosis in Ph+/MDM2+ ALL than in Ph-/MDM2+ or Ph+/MDM2- ALL. The ALL cells that were Ph-/MDM2- were totally resistant to nilotinib. These results suggested that nilotinib can inhibit MDM2 and induce a p53-independent apoptosis pathway by downregulating XIAP; thus, nilotinib can treat not only Ph+, but also Ph- ALL patients whose cancer cells overexpress MDM2.",,"['Zhang, Hailong', 'Gu, Lubing', 'Liu, Tao', 'Chiang, Kuang-Yueh', 'Zhou, Muxiang']","['Zhang H', 'Gu L', 'Liu T', 'Chiang KY', 'Zhou M']","['Department of Pediatrics and Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140626,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/metabolism']",,,2014/06/27 06:00,2015/10/08 06:00,['2014/06/27 06:00'],"['2014/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0100960 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-10590 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jun 26;9(6):e100960. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0100960. eCollection 2014.,,,"['R01 CA123490/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA143107/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA180519/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA143107/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4072773,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This extremely poor prognosis of AML is mainly caused by treatment failure due to chemotherapy resistance. Chemotherapy resistance can be caused by various features including activation of alternative signaling pathways, evasion of cell death or activation of receptor tyrosine kinases such as the insulin growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R). Here we have studied the role of the insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-7 (IGFBP7), a tumor suppressor and part of the IGF-1R axis, in AML. We report that IGFBP7 sensitizes AML cells to chemotherapy-induced cell death. Moreover, overexpression of IGFBP7 as well as addition of recombinant human IGFBP7 is able to reduce the survival of AML cells by the induction of a G2 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. This effect is mainly independent from IGF-1R activation, activated Akt and activated Erk. Importantly, AML patients with high IGFBP7 expression have a better outcome than patients with low IGFBP7 expression, indicating a positive role for IGFBP7 in treatment and outcome of AML. Together, this suggests that the combination of IGFBP7 and chemotherapy might potentially overcome conventional AML drug resistance and thus might improve AML patient survival.",,"['Verhagen, H Jmp', 'de Leeuw, D C', 'Roemer, M Gm', 'Denkers, F', 'Pouwels, W', 'Rutten, A', 'Celie, P H', 'Ossenkoppele, G J', 'Schuurhuis, G J', 'Smit, L']","['Verhagen HJ', 'de Leeuw DC', 'Roemer MG', 'Denkers F', 'Pouwels W', 'Rutten A', 'Celie PH', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Schuurhuis GJ', 'Smit L']","['Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Protein Facility, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140626,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (insulin-like growth factor binding protein-related protein 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Survival', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics']",,,2014/06/27 06:00,2015/02/13 06:00,['2014/06/27 06:00'],"['2014/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/08 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/13 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2014268 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2014.268 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2014 Jun 26;5:e1300. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2014.268.,,,,PMC4611740,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we studied mechanisms of acquired resistance of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) by examining genome-wide gene expression changes in KCL-22 CML cells versus their resistant KCL-22M cells that acquire T315I BCR-ABL mutation following TKI exposure. Although T315I BCR-ABL is sufficient to confer resistance to TKIs in CML cells, surprisingly we found that multiple drug resistance pathways were activated in KCL-22M cells along with reduced expression of a set of myeloid differentiation genes. Forced myeloid differentiation by all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) effectively blocked acquisition of BCR-ABL mutations and resistance to the TKIs imatinib, nilotinib or dasatinib in our previously described in vitro models of acquired TKI resistance. ATRA induced robust expression of CD38, a cell surface marker and cellular NADase. High levels of CD38 reduced intracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) levels and blocked acquired resistance by inhibiting the activity of the NAD+-dependent SIRT1 deacetylase that we have previously shown to promote resistance in CML cells by facilitating error-prone DNA damage repair. Consequently, ATRA treatment decreased DNA damage repair and suppressed acquisition of BCR-ABL mutations. This study sheds novel insight into mechanisms underlying acquired resistance in CML, and suggests potential benefit of combining ATRA with TKIs in treating CML, particularly in advanced phases.",,"['Wang, Zhiqiang', 'Liu, Zheng', 'Wu, Xiwei', 'Chu, Su', 'Wang, Jinhui', 'Yuan, Hongfeng', 'Roth, Mendel', 'Yuan, Yate-Ching', 'Bhatia, Ravi', 'Chen, WenYong']","['Wang Z', 'Liu Z', 'Wu X', 'Chu S', 'Wang J', 'Yuan H', 'Roth M', 'Yuan YC', 'Bhatia R', 'Chen W']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, Duarte, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, Duarte, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, Duarte, California, United States of America.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, Duarte, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, Duarte, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, Duarte, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, Duarte, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, Duarte, California, United States of America.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, Duarte, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, Duarte, California, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140626,United States,PLoS Genet,PLoS genetics,101239074,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (SIRT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 1)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides/administration & dosage', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage', 'Sirtuin 1/genetics', 'Thiazoles/administration & dosage', 'Tretinoin/*administration & dosage']",,,2014/06/27 06:00,2015/08/08 06:00,['2014/06/27 06:00'],"['2013/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pgen.1004414 [doi]', 'PGENETICS-D-13-03451 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Genet. 2014 Jun 26;10(6):e1004414. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1004414. eCollection 2014 Jun.,,,"['P30 CA033572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA095684/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA143421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA95684/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4072521,,,,,,,,,,,,,['PLoS Genet. 2015 Mar;11(3):e1005033.

Recently a putative link to breast cancer has started to emerge, however the function of RUNX1 in breast cancer is still unknown. To investigate if RUNX1 expression was important to clinical outcome in primary breast tumours a tissue microarray (TMA) containing biopsies from 483 patients with primary operable invasive ductal breast cancer was stained by immunohistochemistry. RUNX1 was associated with progesterone receptor (PR)-positive tumours (P<0.05), more tumour CD4+(P<0.05) and CD8+(P<0.01) T-lymphocytic infiltrate, increased tumour CD138+plasma cell (P<0.01) and more CD68+macrophage infiltrate (P<0.001). RUNX1 expression did not influence outcome of oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive or HER2-positive disease, however on univariate analysis a high RUNX1 protein was significantly associated with poorer cancer-specific survival in patients with ER-negative (P<0.05) and with triple negative (TN) invasive breast cancer (P<0.05). Furthermore, multivariate Cox regression analysis of cancer-specific survival showed a trend towards significance in ER-negative patients (P<0.1) and was significant in triple negative patients (P<0.05). Of relevance, triple negative breast cancer currently lacks good biomarkers and patients with this subtype do not benefit from the option of targeted therapy unlike patients with ER-positive or HER2-positive disease. Using multivariate analysis RUNX1 was identified as an independent prognostic marker in the triple negative subgroup. Overall, our study identifies RUNX1 as a new prognostic indicator correlating with poor prognosis specifically in the triple negative subtype of human breast cancer.",,"['Ferrari, Nicola', 'Mohammed, Zahra M A', 'Nixon, Colin', 'Mason, Susan M', 'Mallon, Elizabeth', 'McMillan, Donald C', 'Morris, Joanna S', 'Cameron, Ewan R', 'Edwards, Joanne', 'Blyth, Karen']","['Ferrari N', 'Mohammed ZM', 'Nixon C', 'Mason SM', 'Mallon E', 'McMillan DC', 'Morris JS', 'Cameron ER', 'Edwards J', 'Blyth K']","['Transgenic Models Lab, Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'Academic Unit of Surgery, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'Transgenic Models Lab, Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'Transgenic Models Lab, Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'University Pathology Unit, Southern General Hospital, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'Academic Unit of Surgery, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'Transgenic Models Lab, Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140626,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Estrogen/metabolism', 'Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*metabolism/pathology']",,,2014/06/27 06:00,2015/02/24 06:00,['2014/06/27 06:00'],"['2014/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0100759 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-08266 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jun 26;9(6):e100759. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0100759. eCollection 2014.,,,['Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],PMC4072705,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among them, deletions of 11q, 13q, 17p, and trisomy 12 have a known prognostic value and play an important role in CLL pathogenesis and evolution, determining patients outcome and therapeutic strategies. Standard methods used to identify these genomic aberrations include both conventional G-banding cytogenetics (CGC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Although FISH analyses have been implemented as the gold standard, CGC allows the identification of chromosomal translocations and complex karyotypes, the latest associated with poor outcome. Genomic arrays have a higher resolution that allows the detection of cryptic abnormalities, although these have not been fully implemented in routine laboratories. In the last years, next generation sequencing (NGS) methods have identified a wide range of gene mutations (e.g., TP53, NOTCH1, SF3B1, and BIRC3) which have improved our knowledge about CLL development, allowing us to refine both the prognostic subgroups and better therapeutic strategies.

The results showed that Rg3 inhibited VEGF and HIF-1alpha expression at both mRNA and protein levels in bone marrow stromal cells.

Comorbidity-related prognosis after alloSCT can be estimated by the hematopoietic cell transplantation comorbidity index (HCT-CI). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The charts from 85 patients who have undergone 90 alloSCTs between 1999 and 2011 were analysed. Most patients received a dose-reduced conditioning and a graft from an unrelated donor. Patients were stratified for age, HCT-CI, cGvHD versus no cGvHD, and a modified HCT-CI with a further split high-risk score. RESULTS: Age over 60 years did not affect the outcome. Manifestation of cGvHD improved the prognosis significantly. An additional stratification of the high-risk group of the HCT-CI revealed that even a fraction of these patients can have considerable benefit from an alloSCT. Furthermore, this high-risk collective could be clearly discriminated into two groups with different outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The investigation confirms that age is no absolute risk factor for alloSCT and demonstrates the heterogeneity of the high-risk group of the HCT-CI. A comprehensive investigation of an additional stratification is suggested. Furthermore, the authors encourage early withdrawal of immunosuppression, even in elderly patients and patients with comorbidities to permit graft-versus-leukaemia/lymphoma, since cGvHD is associated with a significantly better prognosis.",,"['Spath, Christian', 'Busemann, Christoph', 'Kruger, William H']","['Spath C', 'Busemann C', 'Kruger WH']","['Department of Internal Medicine C - Haematology and Oncology, Marrow Transplantation, and Palliative Care, Ernst-Moritz-Arndt-University Greifswald, Ferdinand-Sauerbruch-Str., 17475, Greifswald, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140626,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Comorbidity', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors', 'Severity of Illness Index', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,2014/06/27 06:00,2015/02/11 06:00,['2014/06/27 06:00'],"['2014/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00432-014-1748-6 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2014 Nov;140(11):1981-8. doi: 10.1007/s00432-014-1748-6.

Cranial computed tomography (CT), the reference standard for the diagnosis of traumatic brain injury (TBI), exposes children to ionizing radiation which has been linked to the development of brain tumors, leukemia, and other cancers. We describe the methods used to develop and test the effectiveness of a decision aid to facilitate shared decision-making with parents regarding whether to obtain a head CT scan or to further observe their child at home. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a protocol for a multicenter clinician-level parallel randomized trial to compare an intervention group receiving a decision aid, 'Head CT Choice', to a control group receiving usual care. The trial will be conducted at five diverse emergency departments (EDs) in Minnesota and California. Clinicians will be randomized to decision aid or usual care. Parents visiting the ED with children who are less than 18-years-old, have experienced blunt head trauma within 24 hours, and have one or two risk factors for clinically-important TBI (ciTBI) from the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network head injury clinical prediction rules will be eligible for enrollment. We will measure the effect of Head CT Choice on: (1) parent knowledge regarding their child's risk of ciTBI, the available diagnostic options, and the risks of radiation exposure associated with a cranial CT scan (primary outcome); (2) parent engagement in the decision-making process; (3) the degree of conflict parents experience related to feeling uninformed; (4) patient and clinician satisfaction with the decision made; (5) the rate of ciTBI at seven days; (6) the proportion of patients in whom a cranial CT scan is obtained; and (7) seven-day healthcare utilization. To capture these outcomes, we will administer parent and clinician surveys immediately after each clinical encounter, obtain video recordings of parent-clinician discussions, administer parent healthcare utilization diaries, analyze hospital billing records, review the electronic medical record, and conduct telephone follow-up. DISCUSSION: This multicenter trial will robustly assess the effectiveness of a decision aid on patient-centered outcomes, safety, and healthcare utilization in parents of children with minor head trauma in five diverse EDs.

Improved quantitative methods for functionally characterizing these deficiencies are required to accurately identify patients at risk of developing cancer and to identify mechanisms of drug resistance or sensitivity. METHODS: Flow cytometry-based single cell network profiling (SCNP) was used to measure drug-induced activation of DNA damage response (DDR) proteins in cell lines with defined HRR pathway mutations (including ATM-/-, ATM+/-, BRCA1+/-, BRCA2-/-) and in primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples. Both non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and HRR pathways were examined by measuring changes in intracellular readouts (including p-H2AX, p-ATM, p-DNA-PKcs, p-53BP1, p-RPA2/32, p-BRCA1, p-p53, and p21) in response to exposure to mechanistically distinct genotoxins. The cell cycle S/G2/M phase CyclinA2 marker was used to normalize for proliferation rates. RESULTS: Etoposide induced proliferation-independent DNA damage and activation of multiple DDR proteins in primary AML cells and ATM +/+but not ATM -/- cell lines. Treatment with the PARPi AZD2281 +/- temozolomide induced DNA damage in CyclinA2+ cells in both primary AML cells and cell lines and distngiushed cell lines deficient (BRCA2-/-) or impaired (BRCA1+/-) in HRR activity from BRCA1+/+ cell lines based on p-H2AX induction. Application of this assay to primary AML samples identified heterogeneous patterns of repair activity including muted or proficient activation of NHEJ and HRR pathways and predominant activation of NHEJ in a subset of samples. CONCLUSIONS: SCNP identified functional DDR readouts in both NHEJ and HRR pathways, which can be applied to identify cells with BRCA1+/- haploinsuffiency and characterize differential DDR pathway functionality in primary clinical samples.",,"['Rosen, David B', 'Leung, Ling Y', 'Louie, Brent', 'Cordeiro, James A', 'Conroy, Andrew', 'Shapira, Iuliana', 'Fields, Scott Z', 'Cesano, Alessandra', 'Hawtin, Rachael E']","['Rosen DB', 'Leung LY', 'Louie B', 'Cordeiro JA', 'Conroy A', 'Shapira I', 'Fields SZ', 'Cesano A', 'Hawtin RE']","['Research, Nodality Inc,, 170 Harbor Way, Suite 200, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA. rachael.hawtin@Nodality.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140625,England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,"['0 (BRCA1 Protein)', '0 (BRCA2 Protein)', '0 (Cyclin A2)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (H2AX protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'YF1K15M17Y (Temozolomide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins/metabolism', 'BRCA1 Protein/metabolism', 'BRCA2 Protein/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Cyclin A2/metabolism', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded/drug effects', '*DNA Damage', '*DNA Repair/drug effects', 'Dacarbazine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Haploinsufficiency/drug effects', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Homologous Recombination/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mutagens/toxicity', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Single-Cell Analysis/*methods', 'Temozolomide']",,,2014/06/27 06:00,2015/03/05 06:00,['2014/06/27 06:00'],"['2014/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['1479-5876-12-184 [pii]', '10.1186/1479-5876-12-184 [doi]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2014 Jun 25;12:184. doi: 10.1186/1479-5876-12-184.,,,,PMC4099151,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Silencing and inhibition of COX-2 with siRNA transfection or treatment with indomethacin led to a pronounced reduction of the extracellular levels of PGEv, and restored the menadione- induced cell death. In addition, pretreatment of cells with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 and the PKA inhibitor H89 abrogated the PGE(2)-induced expression of COX-2, suggesting involvement of the MAPK and PKA pathways. These results demonstrate that PGE(2) signaling acts in an autocrine manner, and specific inhibition of PGE(2) will provide a novel approach for the treatment of leukemia.",,"['Shehzad, Adeeb', 'Lee, Jaetae', 'Lee, Young Sup']","['Shehzad A', 'Lee J', 'Lee YS']","['School of Life Sciences, BK21 Plus KNU Creative BioResearch Group, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 702-701, Korea; Department of Biomedical Engineering and Sciences, School of Mechanical & Manufacturing Engineering, National University of Sciences & Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, Kyungpook National University Hospital, Daegu 700-721, Korea.', 'School of Life Sciences, BK21 Plus KNU Creative BioResearch Group, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 702-701, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Korea (South),BMB Rep,BMB reports,101465334,"['0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Lamin Type B)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '723JX6CXY5 (Vitamin K 3)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)', 'M876330O56 (N-(2-(4-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autocrine Communication/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dinoprostone/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indomethacin/pharmacology', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Lamin Type B/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Vitamin K 3/pharmacology']",,,2014/06/27 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/06/27 06:00'],"['2014/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['2794 [pii]', '10.5483/bmbrep.2015.48.2.081 [doi]']",ppublish,BMB Rep. 2015 Feb;48(2):109-14. doi: 10.5483/bmbrep.2015.48.2.081.,,,,PMC4352612,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Migrating lymphocytes adopt a polarized morphology with a trailing edge designated the uropod. Here, we demonstrate that MLV Gag localizes to the uropod in polarized B cells and CD4(+) T cells. The uropod localization of MLV Gag was dependent on plasma membrane (PM) association and multimerization of Gag but independent of the viral glycoprotein Env. Basic residues in MA that are required for MLV Gag recruitment to virological synapses between HEK293 and XC cells were dispensable for uropod localization in migrating B cells. Ultrastructural studies indicated that both wild-type and basic-residue mutant Gag localized to the outer surface of the PM at the uropod. Late-domain mutant virus particles were seen at the uropod in form of budding-arrested intermediates. Finally, uropods mediated contact between MLV-infected B cells and uninfected T cells to form virological synapses. Our results suggest that MLV, not unlike HIV, accumulates at the uropod of primary lymphocytes to facilitate viral spreading through the formation of uropod-mediated cell-cell contacts. IMPORTANCE: Viruses have evolved mechanisms to coordinate their assembly and budding with cell polarity to facilitate their spreading. In this study, we demonstrated that the viral determinants for MLV Gag to localize to the uropod in polarized B cells are distinct from the requirements to localize to virological synapses in transformed cell lines. Basic residues in MA that are required for the Gag localization to virological synapses between HEK293 and XC cells are dispensable for Gag localization to the uropod in primary B cells. Rather, plasma membrane association and capsid-driven multimerization of Gag are sufficient to drive MLV Gag to the uropod. MLV-laden uropods also mediate contacts between MLV-infected B cells and uninfected T cells to form virological synapses. Our results indicate that MLV accumulates at the uropod of primary lymphocytes to facilitate viral spreading through the formation of uropod-mediated cell-cell contacts.","['Copyright (c) 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

Here, we investigated the interaction between Toca 511 and human host cells, and we show that RRVs do not induce type I interferon (IFN) responses in cultured human tumor cells or cultured human primary cells. However, exogenous type I IFN inhibited RRV replication in tumor cells and induced IFN-regulated genes, albeit at a lower level than in primary cells. Unexpectedly, RRVs did not induce IFN-alpha production upon incubation in vitro with human plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), whereas lentivirus vector and heat-treated RRVs did. Coincubation of RRVs with heat-treated RRVs or with lentivirus vector suppressed IFN-alpha production in pDCs, suggesting that native RRV has a dominant inhibitory effect on type I IFN induction. This effect is sensitive to trypsin treatment. In addition, heat treatment inactivated that activity but exposed an immune-stimulatory activity. The immune-stimulating component is sensitive to deglycosidases, trypsin, and phospholipase C treatment. Experiments with retroviral nonreplicating vectors and virus-like particles demonstrated that the immunosuppressive activity is not associated with the amphotropic envelope or the glyco-Gag protein. In summary, our data provide evidence that RRVs do not directly trigger type I IFN responses in IFN-responsive tumor cells. Moreover, RRVs appear to carry a heat-labile component that actively suppresses activation of cellular innate immune responses in pDCs. Inhibition of IFN induction by RRVs and the reduced response to IFN should facilitate tumor-specific infection in vivo. IMPORTANCE: RRVs have a convincing preference for replicating in tumor cells in animal models, and we observed similar preferences in the initial treatment of human glioblastoma patients. This study investigates the basis for the interaction between RRV and human host cells (tumor versus nontumor) in vitro. We found that RRVs do not trigger an IFN-alpha/beta response in tumor cells, but the cells are capable of responding to type I IFNs and of producing them when stimulated with known agonists. Surprisingly, the data show that RRVs can actively inhibit induction of cellular innate immunity and that this inhibitory activity is heat labile and trypsin sensitive and not attributable to the envelope protein. These data partially explain the observed in vivo tumor specificity.","['Copyright (c) 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

Over the past few years, a lot of research has gone into the characterization of cancer stem cells (CSCs) from different tumors. CSCs have been elucidated in almost all solid tumors. The growth of this field has not been without controversies as many researchers considered CSCs to be a transient population of little consequence. The field has nevertheless progressed providing us not only a better understanding of cancer and its related facets like proliferation, EMT, and metastasis but also generating a hope for new generation therapeutics with CSCs as their targets. This search for drugs which target CSCs has also focused on miRNAs. miRNAs are small non-coding regulatory RNA molecules capable of fine-tuning the gene expression. The miRNA profile of CSCs is remarkably different from non-stem cancer cells and many miRNAs have also been shown to regulate self-renewal and differentiation properties of CSCs. The differential miRNA profile in CSCs make them probable biomarkers for the prognosis of cancer and their specificity in targeting the properties of CSCs make them potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

To test the efficiency and safety of sequential application of retinoic acid (ATRA), Realgar-Indigo naturalis formula (RIF) and chemotherapy (CT) were used as the maintenance treatment in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Methods. This was a retrospective study of 98 patients with newly diagnosed APL who accepted two different maintenance treatments. After remission induction and consolidation chemotherapy according to their Sanz scores, patients received two different kinds of maintenance scheme. The first regimen was using ATRA, RIF, and standard dose of CT sequentially (ATRA/RIF/CT regimen), while the second one was using ATRA and low dose of chemotherapy with methotrexate (MTX) plus 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) alternately (ATRA/CTlow regimen). The OS, DFS, relapse rate, minimal residual disease, and adverse reactions in two groups were monitored and evaluated. Results. ATRA/RIF/CT regimen could effectively reduce the chance of relapse in different risk stratification of patients, but there was no significant difference in 5-year DFS rate and OS rate between the two groups. Besides, the patients in the experimental group suffered less severe adverse reactions than those in the control group. Conclusions.

Their discovery is one of the major recent breakthroughs in molecular biology. miRNAs establish a multiplicity of relationships with target mRNAs and exert pleiotropic biological effects in many cell physiological pathways during development and adult life. The dynamic nature of gene expression regulation by Retinoic Acid Retinoic acid (RA) is consistent with an extensive functional interplay with miRNA activities. In fact, RA regulates the expression of many different miRNAs, thus suggesting a relevant function of miRNAs in RA-controlled gene expression programmes. miRNAs have been extensively studied as targets and mediators of the biological activity of RA during embryonic development as well as in normal and neoplastic cells. However, relatively few studies have experimentally explored the direct contribution of miRNA function to the RA signalling pathway. Here, we provide an overview of the mechanistic aspects that allow miRNA biogenesis, functional activation and regulation, focusing on recent evidence that highlights a functional interplay between miRNAs and RA-regulated molecular networks. We report examples of tissue-specific roles of miRNAs modulated by RA in stem cell pluripotency maintenance and regeneration, embryonic development, hematopoietic and neural differentiation, and other biological model systems, underlining their role in disease pathogenesis.

METHODS: This cross-sectional cohort study of a CCS cohort quantified organ iron content by magnetic resonance imaging. Iron status by serum markers and hemochromatosis gene mutation status were assessed. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients who had received a range (0-392 mL/kg) of cumulative PRBC transfusion volumes were enrolled (median age 14 years, range 8-25.6 years at evaluation). Median follow-up time was 4.4 years, and median time since last transfusion was 4.9 years. Cancer diagnoses included acute lymphoblastic or myelogenous leukemia (ALL/AML; n = 33) and solid tumors (n = 42). Liver and pancreatic iron concentrations were elevated in 36 of 73 (49.3%) and 19 of 72 (26.4%) subjects, respectively. Cardiac iron concentration was not increased in this cohort. In multivariate analysis, cumulative PRBC volume (P < 0.0001) and older age at diagnosis (P < 0.0001) predicted elevated liver iron concentration. CONCLUSIONS: Iron overload (IO) may occur in children and adolescents/young adults treated for cancer and is associated with cumulative PRBC transfusion volume and age at diagnosis. IMPACT: These findings have implications for development of monitoring and management guidelines for cancer patients and survivors at risk for IO, exploration of the additive risk of liver/pancreatic damage from chemotherapeutic exposures, and health education to minimize further liver/pancreatic damage from exposures such as excessive alcohol intake and hepatotoxic medications.",['(c)2014 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Ruccione, Kathleen S', 'Wood, John C', 'Sposto, Richard', 'Malvar, Jemily', 'Chen, Cheng', 'Freyer, David R']","['Ruccione KS', 'Wood JC', 'Sposto R', 'Malvar J', 'Chen C', 'Freyer DR']","['kruccione@chla.usc.edu.', 'Pediatric Cardiology and Radiology.

Although mTOR was originally discovered as a target protein of rapamycin, a natural macrolide immunosuppressant, rapamycin mainly inhibits the kinase activity of mTORC1, whereas mTORC2 is affected to a much lesser extent. The inhibitory effects of rapamycin on mTORC1 substrates are complex, and the use of rapamycin to investigate mTORC functions may provide misleading results. In contrast to pharmacological inhibition, studies using genetic approaches to the disruption of mTORC subunits have clearly demonstrated the physiological roles of the distinct mTOR complexes in organogenesis and tumourigenesis.

Such a metabolic switch is suggested to be due in part to functional attenuation of mitochondria in cancer cells. However, how oncogenic signals attenuate mitochondrial function and promote the switch to glycolysis remains unclear. We previously reported that tyrosine phosphorylation activates and inhibits mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) and phosphatase (PDP), respectively, leading to enhanced inhibitory serine phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and consequently inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) in cancer cells. In particular, Tyr-381 phosphorylation of PDP1 dissociates deacetylase SIRT3 and recruits acetyltransferase ACAT1 to PDC, resulting in increased inhibitory lysine acetylation of PDHA1 and PDP1. Here we report that phosphorylation at another tyrosine residue, Tyr-94, inhibits PDP1 by reducing the binding ability of PDP1 to lipoic acid, which is covalently attached to the L2 domain of dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2) to recruit PDP1 to PDC. We found that multiple oncogenic tyrosine kinases directly phosphorylated PDP1 at Tyr-94, and Tyr-94 phosphorylation of PDP1 was common in diverse human cancer cells and primary leukemia cells from patients. Moreover, expression of a phosphorylation-deficient PDP1 Y94F mutant in cancer cells resulted in increased oxidative phosphorylation, decreased cell proliferation under hypoxia, and reduced tumor growth in mice. Together, our findings suggest that phosphorylation at different tyrosine residues inhibits PDP1 through independent mechanisms, which act in concert to regulate PDC activity and promote the Warburg effect.","['(c) 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Shan, Changliang', 'Kang, Hee-Bum', 'Elf, Shannon', 'Xie, Jianxin', 'Gu, Ting-Lei', 'Aguiar, Mike', 'Lonning, Scott', 'Hitosugi, Taro', 'Chung, Tae-Wook', 'Arellano, Martha', 'Khoury, Hanna J', 'Shin, Dong M', 'Khuri, Fadlo R', 'Boggon, Titus J', 'Fan, Jun']","['Shan C', 'Kang HB', 'Elf S', 'Xie J', 'Gu TL', 'Aguiar M', 'Lonning S', 'Hitosugi T', 'Chung TW', 'Arellano M', 'Khoury HJ', 'Shin DM', 'Khuri FR', 'Boggon TJ', 'Fan J']","['From the Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322.', 'From the Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322.', 'From the Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322.', 'Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, Massachusetts 01923, and.', 'Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, Massachusetts 01923, and.', 'Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, Massachusetts 01923, and.', 'Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, Massachusetts 01923, and.', 'From the Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322.', 'From the Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322.', 'From the Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322.', 'From the Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322.', 'From the Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322.', 'From the Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322.', 'the Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06520.', 'From the Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, jfan3@emory.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140624,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FGFR1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1)', 'EC 3.1.3.43 (Pyruvate Dehydrogenase (Lipoamide)-Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Primers', 'Humans', 'Lactic Acid/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms/enzymology/*pathology', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pyruvate Dehydrogenase (Lipoamide)-Phosphatase/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1/physiology', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Cell Proliferation', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatase', 'Phosphotyrosine Signaling', 'Tumor Metabolism', 'Warburg Effect']",2014/06/26 06:00,2014/12/17 06:00,['2014/06/26 06:00'],"['2014/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)47526-X [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.581124 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2014 Aug 1;289(31):21413-22. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.581124.

Studies comparing the effect of different ATG preparations and dosages on immune reconstitution and risk for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-mediated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) are rare. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we determined T and B cell subsets by flow cytometry after allo-HSCT in children, who received ATG-Genzyme (ATG-G, n = 15), ATG-Fresenius (ATG-F, n = 25) or no-ATG treatment (n = 19). Additionally, PCR-quantified EBV-genome copy counts were correlated with incidence of PTLD. RESULTS: We could confirm a dose-dependent impairment of CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cell regeneration by ATG-G, including naive and memory CD4(+) T cells. No differences were seen between the currently applied dosages of 5-10 mg/kg ATG-G and 20-60 mg/kg ATG-F. Significantly delayed T cell subset reconstitution was determined only at high dosages of 20-60 mg/kg ATG-G compared to ATG-F. B cell reconstitution was comparably impaired in ATG-G- and ATG-F-treated patients. Although the incidence of EBV reactivation was similar in both ATG groups, EBV copy counts of >10(4) copies/10(5) peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the occurrence of PTLD were only found in ATG-G-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that high, but importantly not currently applied low dosages of ATG-G, impair thymic T cell regeneration and memory T cell immunity to a greater extent than ATG-F in pediatric patients. In addition, our results suggest an increased risk for EBV-PTLD when treated with ATG-G.

Hence, new therapies need to be developed for this subgroup of DS-AML patients. One new therapeutic approach is preventing cell cycle checkpoint activation by inhibiting the upstream kinase wee1 with the first-in-class inhibitor MK-1775 in combination with the standard genotoxic agent cytarabine (AraC). PROCEDURE: Using the clinically relevant DS-AML cell lines CMK and CMY, as well as ex vivo primary DS-AML patient samples, the ability of MK-1775 to enhance the cytotoxicity of AraC was investigated with MTT assays. The mechanism by which MK-1775 enhanced AraC cytotoxicity was investigated in the cell lines using Western blots to probe CDK1 and H2AX phosphorylation and flow cytometry to determine apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, DNA damage, and aberrant mitotic entry. RESULTS: MK-1775 alone had modest single-agent activity, however, MK-1775 was able to synergize with AraC in causing proliferation arrest in both cell lines and primary patient samples, and enhance AraC-induced apoptosis. MK-1775 was able to decrease inhibitory CDK1(Y15) phosphorylation at the relatively low concentration of 100 nM after only 4 hours. Furthermore, it was able to enhance DNA damage induced by AraC and partially abrogate cell cycle arrest. Importantly, the DNA damage enhancement appeared in early S-phase.

Aberrant DNA methylation patterns are a characteristic feature in various tumors, including AML. Metallothionein III (MT3) is a tumor suppresser reported to show promoter hypermethylated in various cancers. However, the expression and molecular function of MT3 in pediatric AML is unclear. METHODS: Eleven human leukemia cell lines and 41 pediatric AML samples and 20 NBM/ITP (Norma bone marrow/Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura) control samples were analyzed. Transcription levels of MT3 were evaluated by semi-quantitative and real-time PCR. MT3 methylation status was determined by methylation specific PCR (MSP) and bisulfite genomic sequencing (BSG). The molecular mechanism of MT3 was investigated by apoptosis assays and PCR array analysis. RESULTS: The MT3 promoter was hypermethylated in leukemia cell lines. More CpG's methylated of MT3 was observed 39.0% pediatric AML samples compared to 10.0% NBM controls. Transcription of MT3 was also significantly decreased in AML samples compared to NBM/ITP controls (P < 0.001); patients with methylated MT3 exhibited lower levels of MT3 expression compared to those with unmethylated MT3 (P = 0.049). After transfection with MT3 lentivirus, proliferation was significantly inhibited in AML cells in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05). Annexin V assay showed that apoptosis was significantly upregulated MT3-overexpressing AML cells compared to controls. Real-time PCR array analysis revealed 34 dysregulated genes that may be implicated in MT3 overexpression and apoptosis in AML, including FOXO1. CONCLUSION: MT3 may be a putative tumor suppressor gene in pediatric AML. Epigenetic inactivation of MT3 via promoter hypermethylation was observed in both AML cell lines and pediatric AML samples. Overexpression of MT3 may inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in AML cells. FOXO1 was dysregulated in MT3-overexpressing cells, offering an insight into the mechanism of MT3-induced apoptosis.

Current drug screening and chemopreventatitive methods are suboptimal, due in part to the poor specificity of compounds for cancer cells. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitor (PARPi)-mediated therapy is a promising approach for familial breast cancers caused by mutations of breast cancer-associated gene-1 and -2 (BRCA1/2), yet drug resistance frequently occurs during the treatment. Moreover, PARPis exhibit very little effect on cancers that are proficient for DNA repair and clinical efficacy for PARPis as single-agent therapies has yet to be illustrated. METHODS: Using a quantitative high-throughput screening approach, we screened a library containing 2,816 drugs, most of which are approved for human or animal use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or other countries, to identify compounds that sensitize breast cancer cells to PARPi. After initial screening, we performed further cellular and molecular analysis on lestaurtinib, which is an orally bioavailable multikinase inhibitor and has been used in clinical trials for myeloproliferative disorders and acute myelogenous leukemia. RESULTS: Our study indicated that lestaurtinib is highly potent against breast cancers as a mono-treatment agent. It also strongly enhanced the activity of the potent PARPi AG14361 on breast cancer cell growth both in vitro and in vivo conditions. The inhibition of cancer growth is measured by increased apoptosis and reduced cell proliferation. Consistent with this, the treatment results in activation of caspase 3/7, and accumulation of cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, irrespective of their BRCA1 status. Finally, we demonstrated that AG14361 inhibits NF-kappaB signaling, which is further enhanced by lestaurtinib treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Lestaurtinib amplifies the ability of the PARP1 inhibitor AG14361 to kill BRCA1 mutant and wild-type breast cancer cells, at least in part, by inhibiting NF-kappaB signaling. Each of these drugs has been approved for clinical trials for several different cancers, thus, their combination treatment should be applicable for a breast cancer trial in the future.",,"['Vazquez-Ortiz, Guelaguetza', 'Chisholm, Cristine', 'Xu, Xiaoling', 'Lahusen, Tyler J', 'Li, Cuiling', 'Sakamuru, Srilatha', 'Huang, Ruili', 'Thomas, Craig J', 'Xia, Menghang', 'Deng, Chuxia']","['Vazquez-Ortiz G', 'Chisholm C', 'Xu X', 'Lahusen TJ', 'Li C', 'Sakamuru S', 'Huang R', 'Thomas CJ', 'Xia M', 'Deng C']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20140624,England,Breast Cancer Res,Breast cancer research : BCR,100927353,"['0 (1-(4-dimethylaminomethylphenyl)-8,9-dihydro-7H-2,7,9a-benzo(cd)azulen-6-one)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Azulenes)', '0 (BRCA1 Protein)', '0 (BRCA1 protein, human)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '12794-10-4 (Benzodiazepines)', 'DO989GC5D1 (lestaurtinib)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Parp1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Azulenes/pharmacology', 'BRCA1 Protein/*genetics', 'Benzodiazepines/*pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Carbazoles/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 7/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Repositioning', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Furans', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1', '*Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering']",,,2014/06/26 06:00,2015/04/17 06:00,['2014/06/26 06:00'],"['2013/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/17 06:00 [medline]']","['bcr3682 [pii]', '10.1186/bcr3682 [doi]']",epublish,Breast Cancer Res. 2014 Jun 24;16(3):R67. doi: 10.1186/bcr3682.,,,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],PMC4229979,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Antofine N-oxide displayed a strong inhibitory effect on several solid tumor cell lines (glioblastoma, breast carcinoma and lung carcinoma) and on a T-cell leukemia cell line. Remarkably, its cytotoxic effect was considerably weaker in non-cancer cells. Antofine N-oxide was found to inhibit proliferation of the solid tumor cells whereas it caused apoptotic cell death in the leukemia cells. A microarray analysis after a short treatment revealed that the number of differentially expressed genes was considerably higher in solid tumor than in leukemia cells. Up-regulated genes in the three solid tumor cell lines include genes related to TNFalpha signaling, of which TNFalpha was among the most significantly induced. A functional analysis revealed that TNFR1 signaling was most likely activated in the solid tumor cells. The increased mRNA levels of several genes of this pathway (namely TNFalpha, TNFAIP3 and BIRC3) were confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR after different treatment durations. Finally a slight inhibition of NFkappaB-mediated transcription was observed in the same cells. Together our results suggest that inhibition of cell proliferation in solid tumor cells essentially occurs through TNFalpha signaling whereas this pathway is not activated in leukemia cells.

Strong prognostic factors at first relapse are lacking, which hampers optimization of therapy. We assessed the frequency of molecular aberrations (FLT3, NRAS, KRAS, KIT, WT1 and NPM1 genes) at first relapse in a large set (n = 198) of relapsed non-French-American-British M3, non-Down syndrome AML patients that received similar relapse treatment. We correlated molecular aberrations with clinical and biological factors and studied their prognostic relevance. Hotspot mutations in the analysed genes were detected in 92 out of 198 patients (46.5%). In 72 of these 92 patients (78%), molecular aberrations were mutually exclusive for the currently analysed genes. FLT3-internal tandem repeat (ITD) (18% of total group) mutations were most frequent, followed by NRAS (10.2%), KRAS (8%), WT1 (8%), KIT (8%), NPM1 (5%) and FLT3-tyrosine kinase domain (3%) mutations. Presence of a WT1 aberration was an independent risk factor for second relapse (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 2.74, P = 0.013). In patients who achieved second complete remission (70.2%), WT1 and FLT3-ITD aberrations were independent risk factors for poor overall survival (HR = 2.32, P = 0.038 and HR = 1.89, P = 0.045 respectively).

CSNK1alpha1 is expressed in all the tested MM cell lines and patient MM cells, and is not altered during bortezomib-triggered cytotoxicity. Inhibition of CSNK1alpha1 kinase activity in MM cells with targeted therapy D4476 or small hairpin RNAs triggers cell G0/G1-phase arrest, prolonged G2/M phase and apoptosis. D4476 also induced cytotoxicity in bortezomib-resistant MM cells and enhanced bortezomib-triggered cytotoxicity. CSNK1alpha1 signaling pathways include CDKN1B, P53 and FADD; gene signatures involved included interferon-alpha, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and LIN9. In addition, reduction of Csnk1alpha1 prevents cMYC/KRAS12V transformation of BaF3 cells independent of interleukin-3.

However, the fact that LSCs share functional and phenotypic properties with normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) poses a significant challenge: how to target LSCs without damaging normal HSCs and compromising hematopoiesis? The discovery that PTEN regulates LSCs and HSCs through different mechanisms, demonstrated that it is possible to identify pathways that differentially impact leukemia and normal stem cell function and opened new therapeutic perspectives for the selective elimination of LSCs.

To further explore the effects of BCL11A siRNA on the enhanced cytotoxicity of a chemotherapeutic drug, we investigated the effects of BCL11A siRNA combined with vincristine (VCR) on SUDHL6 cell proliferation and apoptosis. METHODS: Chemically synthesized BCL11A siRNA was transfected into SUDHL6 cells using the HiPerFect Transfection Reagent in combination with VCR. Cell proliferation was measured by the CCK8 assay. The morphology of apoptotic cells was observed with Hoechst 33258 staining. The rate of cell apoptosis was determined by annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide double staining using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. RESULTS: After BCL11A siRNA plus VCR treatment, cell proliferation was significantly decreased in comparison with VCR or BCL11A siRNA treatment alone and negative control siRNA plus VCR treatment (P <0.05). The apoptotic rate of BCL11A siRNA plus VCR treated cells was significantly increased compared with BCL11A siRNA and VCR treatment alone and negative control siRNA plus VCR treatment (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of BCL11A siRNA and VCR increases apoptosis in SUDHL6 cells. Our study implies that BCL11A siRNA in combination with VCR may be a useful approach for improving effective treatment for B cell lymphoma.",,"['He, Dongmei', 'Wu, Hong', 'Ding, Li', 'Li, Yangqiu']","['He D', 'Wu H', 'Ding L', 'Li Y']","['Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Jinan University, No, 601, West Huangpu Road, Guangzhou, Tianhe District 510632, PR China. thedm@jnu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140624,England,Eur J Med Res,European journal of medical research,9517857,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL11A protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Humans', '*Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse', 'Nuclear Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*administration & dosage', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Transfection', 'Vincristine/*administration & dosage']",,,2014/06/26 06:00,2014/10/17 06:00,['2014/06/26 06:00'],"['2014/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/17 06:00 [medline]']","['2047-783X-19-34 [pii]', '10.1186/2047-783X-19-34 [doi]']",epublish,Eur J Med Res. 2014 Jun 24;19:34. doi: 10.1186/2047-783X-19-34.,,,,PMC4086990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the aberrant splicing events in AML during treatment, we carried out RNA sequencing in peripheral mononuclear cell samples from a patient with complete remission. In addition to the sequencing samples, selected splicing events were confirmed and validated with real-time quantitative RT-PCR in another seven pairs of samples. A total of 4.05 and 3.39 GB clean data of the AML and remission sample were generated, respectively, and 2,223 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Integrated with gene expression profiling on T cells from AML patients compared with healthy donors, 82 DEGs were also differentially expressed in AML CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells. Twenty-three alternative splicing events were considered to be confidential, and they were involved in many biological processes, such as RNA processing, cellular macromolecule catabolic process, and DNA binding process. An exon3-skipping event in TRIP12 was detected in patients at remission and further validated in another three independent samples. TRIP12 is an ubiquitin ligase of ARF, which suppresses aberrant cell growth by activating p53 responses. The exon3-skipping isoform of TRIP12 increased significantly after treatment.

The microRNAs with RISC enzyme complex allow it to find its complementary sequence, which is usually located in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the target messenger RNA (mRNA). This is followed by inhibition of protein translation or promotion, resulting in degradation of the target gene. miR-21 has been mapped at chromosome 17q23.2, where it overlaps with the protein coding gene vacuole membrane protein 1 (VMP1), a human homologue of rat vacuole membrane protein. Recent evidence indicates that miR-21 plays a vital role in tumour cell proliferation, apoptosis and invasion. The inhibition of miR-21 may induce cell cycle arrest and increased chemosensitivity to anticancer agents, providing evidence that miR-21 functions as an oncogene in human cancer. Increased expression levels of miR-21 were observed in tumours arising from diverse tissue types. This also includes tumours of haematological origin, such as chronic lymphatic leukaemia, diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCLs), acute myeloid leukaemia and Hodgkin lymphomas. Recently, it has been shown that high levels of B cell activation were induced by miR-21 in circulating B cells and are seen in HIV-infected individual. Notably, miR-21 is overexpressed in activated B cells, suggesting its assistance in maintaining B cell hyperactivation, which plays a pivotal role in HIV-infected cells. Therefore, miR-21 can be considered as a powerful biomarker in HIV-related lymphomas. The number of studies related to the role of miR-21 in HIV-related lymphomas is sparse; therefore, this mini review highlights the recent publications related to clinical impact and significance of miR-21, specifically in HIV- and non-HIV-related lymphomas.",,"['Sekar, Durairaj', 'Hairul Islam, Villianur Ibrahim', 'Thirugnanasambantham, Krishnaraj', 'Saravanan, Subramanian']","['Sekar D', 'Hairul Islam VI', 'Thirugnanasambantham K', 'Saravanan S']","['Pondicherry Centre for Biological Sciences, Jawahar Nagar, Pondicherry, 605005, India, duraimku@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20140625,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (MIRN21 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/virology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HIV Infections/genetics/virology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation/genetics', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, AIDS-Related/*genetics/pathology/virology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics']",,,2014/06/26 06:00,2014/12/30 06:00,['2014/06/26 06:00'],"['2014/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-014-2068-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2014 Sep;35(9):8387-93. doi: 10.1007/s13277-014-2068-9.

However, most of them will relapse within six months to a year without additional cytostatic therapy. The questions regarding post-remission therapy remain unanswered. The objective of this study was to compare the survival and relapse rate among the patients who had received high dose cytosine-arabinoside during consolidation therapy and the patients who had not received high dose cytosine-arabinoside during consolidation therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 59 patients aged 18-60 years with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (except for Acute promyelocytic leukemia, which was excluded according to the French-American-British classification) who achieved complete remission. Thirty-nine patients who received high dose cytosine-arabinoside during consolidation were included in the study group and twenty patients who did not receive high dose cytosine-arabinoside during consolidation were in the control group. RESULTS: The results show a statistically significantly longer survival rate (p = 0.003) and a lower relapse rate (p = 0.02) among the study group patients, who received high dose cytosine-arabinoside during consolidation, compared to the controls, who did not receive high dose cytosine-arabinoside. The univariate analysis in the study group suggests that the affiliation to Acute myeloblastic leukemia with maturation and Acute myelomonocytic leukemia subgroups, as well as achieving complete remission after a single induction therapy has the prognostic significance. In the multivariate analysis, only the affiliation to Acute myeloblastic leukemia with maturation and Acute myelomonocytic leukemia subgroups retained the independent prognostic significance. CONCLUSION: This study has demonstrated that high dose cytosine-arabinoside used for consolidation therapy results in the higher survival rate and lower relapse rate compared to consolidation therapy without high dose cytosine-arabinoside.

There is insufficient evidence of the need for leukocytapheresis during early treatment of hyperleucocytosis, and its efficiency remains controversial, although leucoreduction is a measure that can prevent adverse events and death. The aim of this study was to analyse the safety and effectiveness of therapeutic leukocytapheresis and its influence on early mortality in our case series, adjusted to independent mortality risk factors described in the literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective review (June 2003-June 2012) of procedures carried out for the treatment of hyperleucocytosis at the Haematology and Haemotherapy Service of Miguel Servet University Hospital. The patients' data and technical information were prospectively registered for each leukocytapheresis session. RESULTS: Thirteen patients underwent a total of 27 leukocytapheresis procedures. After an average of two sessions, a statistically significant drop in the initial leucocyte counts was observed (p<0.01), as well as a relevant drop in lactate dehydrogenase levels. The only analytical value statistically related to early mortality in univariate analysis was initial creatinine level greater than 1.2 mg/dL (p=0.012, OR=2.5). DISCUSSION: Despite the small size and limited homogeneity of our case series, we can conclude that leukocytapheresis is a safe and effective therapeutic measure for leucoreduction in haematological pathologies of any lineage, particularly in patients without acute myeloid leukaemia. Patients with acute myeloid leukaemia had worse outcomes within 6 months of having finished leukocytapheresis sessions, as well as in terms of mean global survival and mean time of mortality. However, global mortality rates were similar in patients with or without acute myeloid leukaemia.",,"['Parra Salinas, Ingrid M', 'Gonzalez Rodriguez, Victoria P', 'Garcia-Erce, Jose A']","['Parra Salinas IM', 'Gonzalez Rodriguez VP', 'Garcia-Erce JA']","['Haematology Department, Miguel Servet University Hospital, Zaragoza, Spain.', 'Haematology Department, Miguel Servet University Hospital, Zaragoza, Spain.', 'Haematology Department, San Jorge Hospital, Huesca, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20140605,Italy,Blood Transfus,Blood transfusion = Trasfusione del sangue,101237479,"['AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Creatinine/blood', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', '*L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', '*Leukapheresis', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/mortality/therapy', '*Leukocytosis/blood/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', '*Tumor Lysis Syndrome/blood/mortality/therapy']",,,2014/06/25 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/06/25 06:00'],"['2013/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['2014.0310-13 [pii]', '10.2450/2014.0310-13 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Transfus. 2015 Jan;13(1):46-52. doi: 10.2450/2014.0310-13.

The aim of this study was to identify an efficient transfusion protocol of genotype matching for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia. We also examined a possible association of HLA class II alleles with red blood cell (RBC) alloimmunisation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 43 patients with MDS undergoing transfusion therapy with and without antibody formation. We investigated antigen-matched RBC units for ABO, D, C, c, E, e, K, Fy(a), Fy(b), Jk(a), Jk(b), S, s, Do(a), Do(b) and Di(a) on the patients' samples and on the donor units serologically matched for them based on their ABO, Rh and K phenotypes and presence of antibodies. We also determined the frequencies of HLA-DRB1 alleles in the alloimmunised and non-alloimmunised patients. RESULTS: Seventeen of the 43 patients had discrepancies or mismatches for multiple antigens between their genotype-predicted profile and the antigen profile of the units of blood serologically matched for them. We verified that 36.8% of patients had more than one RBC alloantibody and 10.5% of patients had autoantibodies. Although we were able to find a better match for the patients in our extended genotyped/phenotyped units, we verified that matching for Rh and K would be sufficient for most of the patients. We also observed an over-representation of the HLA-DRB1*13 allele in the non-alloimmunised group of patients with MDS. DISCUSSION: In our population molecular matching for C, c, E, e, K was able to reduce RBC alloimmunisation in MDS patients. An association of HLA-DRB1*13 and protection from RBC alloimmunisation should be confirmed.",,"['Guelsin, Glaucia A S', 'Rodrigues, Camila', 'Visentainer, Jeane E L', 'De Melo Campos, Paula', 'Traina, Fabiola', 'Gilli, Simone C O', 'Saad, Sara T O', 'Castilho, Lilian']","['Guelsin GA', 'Rodrigues C', 'Visentainer JE', 'De Melo Campos P', 'Traina F', 'Gilli SC', 'Saad ST', 'Castilho L']","['Hemocentro-UNICAMP, Campinas State University, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Basic Health Sciences Department, Maringa State University, Maringa, Parana, Brazil.', 'Basic Health Sciences Department, Maringa State University, Maringa, Parana, Brazil.', 'Hemocentro-UNICAMP, Campinas State University, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hemocentro-UNICAMP, Campinas State University, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hemocentro-UNICAMP, Campinas State University, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hemocentro-UNICAMP, Campinas State University, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hemocentro-UNICAMP, Campinas State University, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140612,Italy,Blood Transfus,Blood transfusion = Trasfusione del sangue,101237479,"['0 (HLA-DRB1 Chains)', '0 (HLA-DRB1*13 antigen)', '0 (Isoantibodies)', '0 (Rh-Hr Blood-Group System)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Group Incompatibility/blood/genetics/prevention & control', 'Blood Grouping and Crossmatching/*methods', '*Blood Transfusion', 'Female', '*Genotyping Techniques', 'HLA-DRB1 Chains/blood/genetics', 'Humans', 'Isoantibodies/blood', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/genetics/therapy', '*Rh-Hr Blood-Group System/blood/genetics']",,,2014/06/25 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/06/25 06:00'],"['2013/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['2014.0332-13 [pii]', '10.2450/2014.0332-13 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Transfus. 2015 Jan;13(1):53-8. doi: 10.2450/2014.0332-13.

Replacing the heptadienedione moiety of curcumin with a monocarbonyl cross-conjugated dienone embedded in a tetrahydrothiopyranone dioxide ring resulted in thiopyranone dioxides that were more resilient to hydrolysis and had greater growth inhibitory activities than curcumin on APL cells. Several members intercepted the degradation of misfolded N-CoR and triggered the signaling cascade in the unfolded protein response (UPR) which led to apoptotic cell death. Microarray analysis showed that genes involved in protein processing pathways that were germane to the activation of the UPR were preferentially up-regulated in treated APL cells, supporting the notion that the UPR was a consequential mechanistic pathway affected by thiopyranone dioxides.

Previous studies have indicated that exposure to (56)Fe heavy ions increases the incidence of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in mice but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Epigenetic alterations play a role in radiation-induced genomic instability and the initiation and progression of AML. In this study, we assessed the effects of low-dose (56)Fe-ion irradiation on epigenetic alterations in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) and hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells (HPSCs). Exposure to (56)Fe ions (600 MeV, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 Gy) resulted in significant epigenetic alterations involving methylation of DNA, the DNA methylation machinery and expression of repetitive elements. Four weeks after irradiation, these changes were primarily confined to HPSCs and were exhibited as dose-dependent hypermethylation of LINE1 and SINE B1 repetitive elements [4.2-fold increase in LINE1 (P < 0.001) and 7.6-fold increase in SINE B1 (P < 0.01) after exposure to 0.4 Gy; n = 5]. Epigenetic alterations were persistent and detectable for at least 22 weeks after exposure, when significant loss of global DNA hypomethylation (1.9-fold, P < 0.05), decreased expression of Dnmt1 (1.9-fold, P < 0.01), and increased expression of LINE1 and SINE B1 repetitive elements (2.8-fold, P < 0.001 for LINE1 and 1.9-fold, P < 0.05 for SINE B1; n = 5) were observed after exposure to 0.4 Gy. In contrast, exposure to (56)Fe ions did not result in accumulation of increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA damage, exhibited as DNA strand breaks. Furthermore, no significant alterations in cellular senescence and apoptosis were detected in HPSCs after exposure to (56)Fe-ion radiation. These findings suggest that epigenetic reprogramming is possibly involved in the development of radiation-induced genomic instability and thus, may have a causative role in the development of AML.",,"['Miousse, Isabelle R', 'Shao, Lijian', 'Chang, Jianhui', 'Feng, Wei', 'Wang, Yingying', 'Allen, Antino R', 'Turner, Jennifer', 'Stewart, Blair', 'Raber, Jacob', 'Zhou, Daohong', 'Koturbash, Igor']","['Miousse IR', 'Shao L', 'Chang J', 'Feng W', 'Wang Y', 'Allen AR', 'Turner J', 'Stewart B', 'Raber J', 'Zhou D', 'Koturbash I']","['Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas.', 'Division of Radiation Health, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas.', 'Division of Radiation Health, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas.', 'Division of Radiation Health, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas.', 'Division of Radiation Health, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas.', 'Division of Radiation Health, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas.', 'Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California.', 'Department of Behavioral Neuroscience, ONPRC, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Department of Behavioral Neuroscience, ONPRC, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Department of Behavioral Neuroscience, ONPRC, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Department of Neurology, ONPRC, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Department of Division of Neuroscience, ONPRC, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Division of Radiation Health, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas.', 'Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20140624,United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,"['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics/radiation effects', 'Cellular Senescence/genetics/radiation effects', 'DNA Damage/genetics', 'DNA Methylation/radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*radiation effects', 'Gene Dosage/radiation effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/*radiation effects', 'Iron/*adverse effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid/radiation effects', 'Time Factors']",,,2014/06/25 06:00,2014/09/06 06:00,['2014/06/25 06:00'],"['2014/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1667/RR13580.1 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Res. 2014 Jul;182(1):92-101. doi: 10.1667/RR13580.1.

In this study, we prospectively evaluated the leukaemia-initiating capacity of AML cells fractionated according to the expression of a nucleolar GTP binding protein, nucleostemin (NS). To monitor NS expression in living AML cells, we generated a mouse AML model in which green fluorescent protein (GFP) is expressed under the control of a region of the NS promoter (NS-GFP). In AML cells, NS-GFP levels were correlated with endogenous NS mRNA. AML cells with the highest expression of NS-GFP were very immature blast-like cells, efficiently formed leukaemia colonies in vitro, and exhibited the highest leukaemia-initiating capacity in vivo. Gene expression profiling analysis revealed that cell cycle regulators and nucleotide metabolism-related genes were highly enriched in a gene set associated with leukaemia-initiating capacity that we termed the 'leukaemia stem cell gene signature'. This gene signature stratified human AML patients into distinct clusters that reflected prognosis, demonstrating that the mouse leukaemia stem cell gene signature is significantly associated with the malignant properties of human AML.

Evidence suggests that HTLV-1, via the viral protein Tax, exploits CD4+ T cell plasticity and induces transcriptional changes in infected T cells that cause suppressive CD4+CD25+CCR4+ Tregs to lose expression of the transcription factor FOXP3 and produce IFN-gamma, thus promoting inflammation. We hypothesized that transformation of HTLV-1-infected CCR4+ T cells into Th1-like cells plays a key role in the pathogenesis of HAM/TSP. Here, using patient cells and cell lines, we demonstrated that Tax, in cooperation with specificity protein 1 (Sp1), boosts expression of the Th1 master regulator T box transcription factor (T-bet) and consequently promotes production of IFN-gamma. Evaluation of CSF and spinal cord lesions of HAM/TSP patients revealed the presence of abundant CD4+CCR4+ T cells that coexpressed the Th1 marker CXCR3 and produced T-bet and IFN-gamma. Finally, treatment of isolated PBMCs and CNS cells from HAM/TSP patients with an antibody that targets CCR4+ T cells and induces cytotoxicity in these cells reduced both viral load and IFN-gamma production, which suggests that targeting CCR4+ T cells may be a viable treatment option for HAM/TSP.",,"['Araya, Natsumi', 'Sato, Tomoo', 'Ando, Hitoshi', 'Tomaru, Utano', 'Yoshida, Mari', 'Coler-Reilly, Ariella', 'Yagishita, Naoko', 'Yamauchi, Junji', 'Hasegawa, Atsuhiko', 'Kannagi, Mari', 'Hasegawa, Yasuhiro', 'Takahashi, Katsunori', 'Kunitomo, Yasuo', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Nakajima, Toshihiro', 'Nishioka, Kusuki', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Jacobson, Steven', 'Yamano, Yoshihisa']","['Araya N', 'Sato T', 'Ando H', 'Tomaru U', 'Yoshida M', 'Coler-Reilly A', 'Yagishita N', 'Yamauchi J', 'Hasegawa A', 'Kannagi M', 'Hasegawa Y', 'Takahashi K', 'Kunitomo Y', 'Tanaka Y', 'Nakajima T', 'Nishioka K', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Jacobson S', 'Yamano Y']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140624,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Receptors, CCR4)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Sp1 protein, human)', '0 (T-Box Domain Proteins)', '0 (T-box transcription factor TBX21)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*virology', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Gene Products, tax/immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/genetics/immunology/virology', 'Receptors, CCR4/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/*metabolism', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/immunology', 'T-Box Domain Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology/virology', 'Th1 Cells/*immunology/*virology', 'Viral Load/immunology']",,,2014/06/25 06:00,2015/02/19 06:00,['2014/06/25 06:00'],"['2014/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/19 06:00 [medline]']","['75250 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI75250 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2014 Aug;124(8):3431-42. doi: 10.1172/JCI75250.

The role of alleles encoded by major histocompatibility loci (MHC) have been examined in a number of previous studies and results indicating weak, multi-allele associations between the HLA-DPB1 locus and BCP-ALL suggested a role for immunosusceptibility and possibly infection. Two independent SNP association studies of ALL identified loci approximately 37 kb from one another and flanking a strong meiotic recombination hotspot (DNA3), adjacent to HLA-DOA and centromeric of HLA-DPB1. To determine the relationship between this observation and HLA-DPB1 associations, we constructed high density SNP haplotypes of the 316 kb region from HLA-DMB to COL11A2 in childhood ALL and controls using a UK GWAS data subset and the software PHASE. Of four haplotype blocks identified, predicted haplotypes in Block 1 (centromeric of DNA3) differed significantly between BCP-ALL and controls (P = 0.002) and in Block 4 (including HLA-DPB1) between T-ALL and controls (P = 0.049). Of specific common (>5%) haplotypes in Block 1, two were less frequent in BCP-ALL, and in Block 4 a single haplotype was more frequent in T-ALL, compared to controls. Unexpectedly, we also observed apparent differences in ancestral meiotic recombination rates at DNA3, with BCP-ALL showing increased and T-ALL decreased levels compared to controls. In silico analysis using LDsplit sotware indicated that recombination rates at DNA3 are influenced by flanking loci, including SNPs identified in childhood ALL association studies. The observed differences in rates of meiotic recombination at this hotspot, and potentially others, may be a characteristic of childhood leukemia and contribute to disease susceptibility, alternatively they may reflect interactions between ALL-associated haplotypes in this region.",,"['Thompson, Pamela', 'Urayama, Kevin', 'Zheng, Jie', 'Yang, Peng', 'Ford, Matt', 'Buffler, Patricia', 'Chokkalingam, Anand', 'Lightfoot, Tracy', 'Taylor, Malcolm']","['Thompson P', 'Urayama K', 'Zheng J', 'Yang P', 'Ford M', 'Buffler P', 'Chokkalingam A', 'Lightfoot T', 'Taylor M']","[""Paediatric & Familial Cancer Research Group, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Manchester, St Mary's Hospital, Manchester, United Kingdom."", 'School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California, United States of America; Department of Human Genetics and Disease Diversity, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore; Genome Institute of Singapore, A*STAR (Agency for Science, Technology, and Research), Biopolis, Singapore.', 'Data Analytics Department, Institute for Infocomm Research, A*STAR, Singapore.', 'Research Computing Services, Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California, United States of America.', 'School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California, United States of America.', 'University of York, Heslington, York, United Kingdom.', 'Independent Researcher, Handforth, Cheshire, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140624,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (COL11A2 protein, human)', '0 (Collagen Type XI)', '0 (HLA-D Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DM antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Collagen Type XI/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Loci', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'HLA-D Antigens/genetics/immunology', '*Haplotypes', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Meiosis/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology', '*Recombination, Genetic']",,,2014/06/25 06:00,2015/03/04 06:00,['2014/06/25 06:00'],"['2014/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0100480 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-08754 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jun 24;9(6):e100480. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0100480. eCollection 2014.,,,,PMC4069019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example Notch is a potent T-cell oncogene, with >50% of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cases carry activating mutations in the Notch1 receptor. Targeting Notch signaling in T-ALL with gamma-secretase inhibitors, which prevent Notch receptor activation, has shown pre-clinical activity, and is under evaluation clinically. In contrast, Notch signaling inhibits acute myeloblastic leukemia growth and survival, and although targeting Notch signaling in AML with Notch activators appears to have pre-clinical activity, no Notch agonists are clinically available at this time. As such, despite accumulating evidence about the biology of Notch signaling in different hematologic cancers, which provide compelling clinical promise, we are only beginning to target this pathway clinically, either on or off.

The ability to target B-cell ALL with immunoglobulin-like binders, whether anti-CD22 antibody or anti-CD19 CAR-Ts, has impacted treatment options for some patients. The development of new ways to target B-cell antigens continues at rapid pace. T-cell ALL accounts for up to 20% of childhood leukemia but has yet to see a set of high-value immunotherapeutic targets identified. To find new targets for T-ALL immunotherapy, we employed a bioinformatic comparison to broad normal tissue arrays, hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), and mature lymphocytes, then filtered the results for transcripts encoding plasma membrane proteins. T-ALL bears a core T-cell signature and transcripts encoding TCR/CD3 components and canonical markers of T-cell development predominate, especially when comparison was made to normal tissue or HSC. However, when comparison to mature lymphocytes was also undertaken, we identified two antigens that may drive, or be associated with leukemogenesis; TALLA-1 and hedgehog interacting protein. In addition, TCR subfamilies, CD1, activation and adhesion markers, membrane-organizing molecules, and receptors linked to metabolism and inflammation were also identified. Of these, only CD52, CD37, and CD98 are currently being targeted clinically.

AQP9 expression is significantly decreased in the human hepatocellular carcinoma when compared with the non-tumourigenic liver, which leads to increased resistance to apoptosis. In addition, AQP9 is permeable to glycerol and urea. The involvement of AQP9 in leukemia has not been fully delineated. It is proposed that abnormal proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) contributes to leukemia carcinogenesis. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the possible roles of AQP9 in HSCs and its effect on the intracellular glycerol content. HSCs and non-HSCs (nHSCs) were isolated via magnetic-activated cell sorting and then subjected to flow cytometry for evaluation of purity. White blood cells (WBCs) were isolated from peripheral blood from healthy volunteers. Furthermore, AQP9 expression was examined at the mRNA and protein levels using western blotting and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The glycerol content of HSCs, nHSCs and WBCs was evaluated by ELISA. Finally, in order to observe the morphology of HSCs and nHSCs, a blood smear was conducted and the cells were observed with Wright-Giemsa staining. The results indicated that the glycerol content in the HSCs was markedly greater than that in the nHSCs. AQP9 mRNA and protein expression was not detected in the HSCs and nHSCs, but was identified in the WBCs. Moreover, the HSC morphological characteristics included round or oval cells with round, slightly oval or irregularly shaped nuclei. Additionally, the nuclei occupied almost the entire cell, were located in the middle or were biased toward one side, and were stained light purple or red. Overall, our results indicated that intracellular glycerol is involved in HSC proliferation, despite the fact that glycerol is not mediated by AQP9. Hence, our findings may be useful in further understanding the mechanism of leukemia carcinogenesis, and these data may be valuable in developing future therapeutic strategies.",,"['Qin, Ying-Song', 'Bu, Dan-Xia', 'Cui, Ying-Ying', 'Zhang, Xiang-Yu']","['Qin YS', 'Bu DX', 'Cui YY', 'Zhang XY']","['Department of Pathophysiology, Xuzhou Medical College, Xuzhou, Jiangsu 221002, P.R.

Specific somatic mutations in c-kit have been associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and are markers of a poor prognosis in AML. Various methods have been used to detect the c-kit gene mutation; however, the suitability of these methods in the clinical management of AML remains unclear. The current study developed a novel method, using modified hybridization probes and melting curve analysis, for detecting c-kit mutations in exon 17. Dual-labeled self-quenched oligonucleotide probes containing two segments, labeled with carboxyrhodamine or hexachlorofluorescein, were designed to detect sequences around the D816 or N820/N822 mutation hot spots in exon 17 of c-kit. The exon 17 region of c-kit was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using control plasmids carrying wild-type or mutant sequences, or genomic DNA derived from AML patients. Melting curve analysis of the amplification products was performed using a self-quenched probe. The results showed that the detection sensitivity, assayed using mutation-positive control plasmids, was 10% for the N820G mutation and 5% for the six other mutations; N822K(A), N822K(G), D816V, D816Y, D816H and D816F. In addition, c-kit mutations were identified in six of the 12 samples from the core-binding factor (CBF)-AML patients. This demonstrates that the novel method developed in the present study, is simple, rapid, specific and highly sensitive, and may facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of CBF-AML.",,"['Lu, Quanyi', 'Huang, Xiao', 'Chen, Huaying', 'Zhao, Xiaomin']","['Lu Q', 'Huang X', 'Chen H', 'Zhao X']","['Department of Hematology, Zhongshan Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian 361004, P.R.

The present study demonstrated that Wnt5a protein expression was significantly induced in bMSCs via an adenovirus vector (P<0.01). The results showed that the proliferation of HL60 cells, a leukemia cell line, was significantly inhibited when the cells were stimulated with the culture supernatant of adeno-Wnt5a bMSCs compared with the culture supernatants of bMSCs and adeno-vector bMSCs for 24 or 48 h (P<0.01).

However, no significant difference was identified in the proliferation and maturation of HL60 cells among the three groups stimulated with the culture supernatants containing a neutralization antibody against Wnt5a. Furthermore, the bMSC-derived Wnt5a was found to influence the maturation and proliferation of the HL60 cells by enhancing the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway, while inhibiting the canonical Wnt signaling pathway by upregulating the expression of receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2 and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, and suppressing the expression of beta-catenin and cyclin D1.

To date, xCELLigence has not been able to monitor the growth or cytotoxicity of nonadherent cells derived from hematological malignancies. The basis of its technology relies on the use of culture plates with gold microelectrodes located in their base. We have adapted the methodology described by others to xCELLigence, based on the pre-coating of the cell culture surface with specific substrates, some of which are known to facilitate cell adhesion in the extracellular matrix. Pre-coating of the culture plates with fibronectin, compared to laminin, collagen, or gelatin, significantly induced the adhesion of most of the leukemia/lymphoma cells assayed (Jurkat, L1236, KMH2, and K562). With a fibronectin substrate, nonadherent cells deposited in a monolayer configuration, and consequently, the cell growth and viability were robustly monitored. We further demonstrate the feasibility of xCELLigence for the real-time monitoring of the cytotoxic properties of several antineoplastic agents. In order to validate this technology, the data obtained through real-time cell analysis was compared with that obtained from using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide method.

It results due to translocation between chromosome 22 and chromosome 9 [t (9; 22)(q34; q11)]. It gives rise to translation of a 210 KDa chimeric protein (p210), leading to enhanced tyrosine kinase activity and activation of leukemogenic pathways, ultimately causing onset of CML. In case of CML, the classic fusions are b2a2 or b3a2, fusing exon 13 (b2) or exon 14 (b3) of BCR, respectively, to exon 2 (a2) of ABL. The type of BCR-ABL transcripts are thought to be have different prognosis and hence useful in clinical decision-making. The frequencies of different fusion oncogenes associated with leukemia can vary in different ethnic groups and geographical regions due to interplay of genetic variation in different ethnic populations, diverse environmental factors and living style. Moreover, earlier relevant studies from our region were carried out in small subset of patients. Therefore, objective of this study was to find out frequencies of different BCR-ABL splice variants in larger subset of CML patients. METHODS: A nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was established to detect BCR-ABL splice variants in 130 CML patients. Sensitivity of RT-PCR and ability to detect BCR-ABL fusion gene in least possible time was studied. RESULTS: BCR-ABL detection using our optimized RT-PCR protocol could be completed in 8 hours, starting from RNA extraction to Gel electrophoresis. Sensitivity of RT-PCR assay was of the order of 10(-6). Out of 130 Pakistani patients, 83 (63.84%) expressed b3a2 while 47 (36.15%) expressed b2a2 transcript. CONCLUSION: Our RT-PCR was proved to be very quick to detect BCR-ABL fusion oncogene in CML patients within one working day. Because of its sensitivity, it can be used to monitor complete molecular response in CML. BCR-ABL RT-PCR and BCR-ABL splice variants frequency in our study differs from other ethnic groups. It shows that ethnic and geographical differences exist in BCR-ABL splice variant frequency, which may have a profound effect on disease biology as well as implications in prognosis and clinical management of BCR-ABL positive leukemias.",,"['Iqbal, Zafar']",['Iqbal Z'],"['Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Medical Genetics and Hematology/Oncology, College of Applied Medical Sciences, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, National Guard Health Affairs, Mail Code 3129, Riyadh 11426, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ; Department of Hematology, Oncology and Pharmaco-genetic Engineering Sciences (HOPES) group, Health Sciences/Parasitology Research Laboratory, Department of Zoology, University of the Punjab, Lahore 54590, Pakistan ; Department of Biotechnology, Next-Generation Medical Biotechnology Division, School of Biological Sciences, University of Sargodha, Sargodha, Pakistan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Indian J Hum Genet,Indian journal of human genetics,101223637,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['b2a2', 'b3a2', 'breakpoint cluster region-abelson', 'breakpoint cluster region-abelson alternative splicing']",2014/06/25 06:00,2014/06/25 06:01,['2014/06/25 06:00'],"['2014/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/25 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/0971-6866.132758 [doi]', 'IJHG-20-64 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hum Genet. 2014 Jan;20(1):64-8. doi: 10.4103/0971-6866.132758.,,,,PMC4065481,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the chromosomal composition of the hyperdiploidy has not been extensively studied and possible mechanism for this pathology remains so far conjectural. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the pattern of chromosome involvement in a cohort of childhood hyperdiploid pre-B-ALL from India and from this pattern to develop an understanding on the causation of such pathology. Whether such patients also carry translocations and FLT3 mutations in addition to their hyperdiploid karyotype. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty-six childhood pre-B-ALL patients were studied. Bone marrow aspirate of these patients were evacuated for morphology, FAB classification, immunophenotyping and both conventional and molecular cytogenetics. RESULTS: Of 126 patients with pre-B-ALL (age 2-15 years), 90 patients with abnormal karyotype showed 50 with hyperdiploid karyotype (50/90 i.e. 55.5%). Chromosomes 9, 10, 14, 17, 18, 20 and 21 were more often involved in hyperdiploidy. Chromosome 21 duplication was present in 92% of the cases. Chromosomes 5, 15, 16, 17 and Y were less often involved (18-20%) in hyperdiploidy. About 44% of patients with hyperdiploidy had additional karyotypic abnormality of which TEL-AML1 was predominant (24%). Chromosome loss was rare and accounted for 20% of the cases only. We did not find any FLT3 mutation in our patients. CONCLUSION: In this study, the pattern of chromosome involvement in hyperdiploid karyotype of ALL patients is same as other studies except some chromosomes like 1, 6, 11, 12, 19 and 22 have some more frequent involvement than other studies. This study also showed the occurrence of TEL/AML1 fusion is more (19.8%) than other reports from India.",,"['Kerketta, Lily S', 'Baburao, Vundinti', 'Ghosh, Kanjaksha']","['Kerketta LS', 'Baburao V', 'Ghosh K']","['Department of Cytogenetics and Molecular Genetics, National Institute of Immunohaematology, KEM Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Cytogenetics and Molecular Genetics, National Institute of Immunohaematology, KEM Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Cytogenetics and Molecular Genetics, National Institute of Immunohaematology, KEM Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Indian J Hum Genet,Indian journal of human genetics,101223637,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Abnormal mitosis', 'centrosome pathology', 'cytogenetics', 'hyperdiploidy', 'pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'selective gain of chromosomes', 'uniparental disomy']",2014/06/25 06:00,2014/06/25 06:01,['2014/06/25 06:00'],"['2014/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/25 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/0971-6866.132751 [doi]', 'IJHG-20-32 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hum Genet. 2014 Jan;20(1):32-6. doi: 10.4103/0971-6866.132751.,,,,PMC4065475,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A variety of upstream genetic alterations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) lead to overexpression of HOXA9, almost always in association with overexpression of its cofactor meis homeobox 1 (MEIS1) . A wide range of data suggests that HOXA9 and MEIS1 play a synergistic causative role in AML, although the molecular mechanisms leading to transformation by HOXA9 and MEIS1 remain elusive. In this study, we identify CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) as a critical collaborator required for Hoxa9/Meis1-mediated leukemogenesis. We show that C/EBPalpha is required for the proliferation of Hoxa9/Meis1-transformed cells in culture and that loss of C/EBPalpha greatly improves survival in both primary and secondary murine models of Hoxa9/Meis1-induced leukemia. Over 50% of Hoxa9 genome-wide binding sites are cobound by C/EBPalpha, which coregulates a number of downstream target genes involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. Finally, we show that Hoxa9 represses the locus of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors Cdkn2a/b in concert with C/EBPalpha to overcome a block in G1 cell cycle progression. Together, our results suggest a previously unidentified role for C/EBPalpha in maintaining the proliferation required for Hoxa9/Meis1-mediated leukemogenesis.",,"['Collins, Cailin', 'Wang, Jingya', 'Miao, Hongzhi', 'Bronstein, Joel', 'Nawer, Humaira', 'Xu, Tao', 'Figueroa, Maria', 'Muntean, Andrew G', 'Hess, Jay L']","['Collins C', 'Wang J', 'Miao H', 'Bronstein J', 'Nawer H', 'Xu T', 'Figueroa M', 'Muntean AG', 'Hess JL']","['Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109; and.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109; and.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109; and.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109; and.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109; and.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109; and.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109; and.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109; and.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109; andIndiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202 jayhess@iu.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140623,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (Cdkn2a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cdkn2b protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*physiology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding']",['NOTNLM'],"['enhancer', 'gene regulation']",2014/06/25 06:00,2014/09/16 06:00,['2014/06/25 06:00'],"['2014/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1402238111 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1402238111 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Jul 8;111(27):9899-904. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1402238111.

Meningioma 1 (MN1) is overexpressed in AML patients and confers resistance to all-trans retinoic acid-induced differentiation. To understand the role of MN1 as a transcriptional regulator in myeloid differentiation, we fused transcriptional activation (VP16) or repression (M33) domains with MN1 and characterized these cells in vivo. Transcriptional activation of MN1 target genes induced myeloproliferative disease with long latency and differentiation potential to mature neutrophils. A large proportion of differentially expressed genes between leukemic MN1 and differentiation-permissive MN1VP16 cells belonged to the immune response pathway like interferon-response factor (Irf) 8 and Ccl9. As MN1 is a cofactor of MEIS1 and retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA), we compared chromatin occupancy between these genes. Immune response genes that were upregulated in MN1VP16 cells were co-targeted by MN1 and MEIS1, but not RARA, suggesting that myeloid differentiation is blocked through transcriptional repression of shared target genes of MN1 and MEIS1. Constitutive expression of Irf8 or its target gene Ccl9 identified these genes as potent inhibitors of murine and human leukemias in vivo. Our data show that MN1 prevents activation of the immune response pathway, and suggest restoration of IRF8 signaling as therapeutic target in AML.",,"['Sharma, A', 'Yun, H', 'Jyotsana, N', 'Chaturvedi, A', 'Schwarzer, A', 'Yung, E', 'Lai, C K', 'Kuchenbauer, F', 'Argiropoulos, B', 'Gorlich, K', 'Ganser, A', 'Humphries, R K', 'Heuser, M']","['Sharma A', 'Yun H', 'Jyotsana N', 'Chaturvedi A', 'Schwarzer A', 'Yung E', 'Lai CK', 'Kuchenbauer F', 'Argiropoulos B', 'Gorlich K', 'Ganser A', 'Humphries RK', 'Heuser M']","['Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Hematology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, HSC, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', '1] Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada [2] Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140520,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (MN1 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-8)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/metabolism/*prevention & control', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism']",,,2014/06/25 06:00,2015/03/25 06:00,['2014/06/25 06:00'],"['2013/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/28 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014162 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.162 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Jan;29(1):157-68. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.162.

A survey of platelet transfusion practice in the North of England.,213-8,10.1111/tme.12126 [doi],"OBJECTIVES: To record the fate of transfused platelet doses in the North of England, and thereby assist with demand-planning and help target teaching on appropriate use. BACKGROUND: Platelet use has risen recently to the extent that donation practice has changed to meet demand. Two national comparative audits have shown inappropriate use and the 2010 audit concluded that current U.K. guidelines for platelet usage should be completely implemented at a local level. It is necessary to know how platelets are used and by whom in order to facilitate guideline concordance. METHODS: All hospital trusts in the North East and Cumbria recorded data on all platelet doses transfused in two separate 4-week periods in 2012. Data were entered onto an electronic survey tool. RESULTS: One thousand and five hundred and seventy-four reports were received, documenting 1937 transfused doses--96% of total issues for the study periods. One thousand and forty-five platelet doses (54%) were given for haematological indications. The second commonest indication was cardiac surgery (201 doses, 10% of the total) followed by non-haematological oncology (127 doses, 6.5%), critical care (106 doses, 5%) and liver disease (50 doses, 2.5%). The commonest haematological indication was acute myeloid leukaemia, 310 doses, (16% of all platelet use), followed by stem cell transplantation, 271 doses (14%). Seventy-two percent of platelet doses were given prophylactically, the majority without any planned procedure. CONCLUSION: The commonest indication for platelet use, where reinforcement of guidelines will be productive, is prophylaxis in haematological disease. Use of platelets in cardiac surgery is also worthy of close scrutiny.","['(c) 2014 The Authors.

The first uncommon aberration was a complex rearrangement of chromosome 15 (probably the consequence of chromothripsis) masked by an apparently balanced reciprocal translocation, t(11;15)(p11.2;q21). The second one was a special type of unbalanced ""vice versa"" jumping translocation, which involved the same acceptor chromosome arm (13q) and various donor chromosome segments.

The Janus kinase (JAK)2/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)5 pathway has recently been explored for providing putative survival signals to CML stem/progenitor cells (SPCs) with contradictory results. We investigated the role of this pathway using the JAK2 inhibitor, ruxolitinib (RUX). We demonstrated that the combination of RUX, at clinically achievable concentrations, with the specific and potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor nilotinib, reduced the activity of the JAK2/STAT5 pathway in vitro relative to either single agent alone. These effects correlated with increased apoptosis of CML SPCs in vitro and a reduction in primitive quiescent CML stem cells, including NOD.Cg-Prkdc(scid) IL2rg(tm1Wjl) /SzJ mice repopulating cells, induced by combination treatment. A degree of toxicity toward normal SPCs was observed with the combination treatment, although this related to mature B-cell engraftment in NOD.Cg-Prkdc(scid) IL2rg(tm1Wjl) /SzJ mice with minimal effects on primitive CD34(+) cells. These results support the JAK2/STAT5 pathway as a relevant therapeutic target in CML SPCs and endorse the current use of nilotinib in combination with RUX in clinical trials to eradicate persistent disease in CML patients.",['(c) 2014 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Gallipoli, Paolo', 'Cook, Amy', 'Rhodes, Susan', 'Hopcroft, Lisa', 'Wheadon, Helen', 'Whetton, Anthony D', 'Jorgensen, Heather G', 'Bhatia, Ravi', 'Holyoake, Tessa L']","['Gallipoli P', 'Cook A', 'Rhodes S', 'Hopcroft L', 'Wheadon H', 'Whetton AD', 'Jorgensen HG', 'Bhatia R', 'Holyoake TL']","[""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, College of Medical, Veterinary & Life Sciences, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom;"", 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Cancer Center, Duarte, CA; and.', ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, College of Medical, Veterinary & Life Sciences, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom;"", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, College of Medical, Veterinary & Life Sciences, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom;"", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, College of Medical, Veterinary & Life Sciences, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom;"", 'Stem Cell and Leukemia Proteomics Laboratory, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.', ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, College of Medical, Veterinary & Life Sciences, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom;"", 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Cancer Center, Duarte, CA; and.', ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, College of Medical, Veterinary & Life Sciences, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom;""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140623,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '82S8X8XX8H (ruxolitinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Nitriles', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Pyrazoles/*administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2014/06/25 06:00,2015/04/25 06:00,['2014/06/25 06:00'],"['2014/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35577-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-12-545640 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Aug 28;124(9):1492-501. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-12-545640.

Therefore, we integrated copy-number alteration data from the 8 most commonly deleted genes, subordinately, with established chromosomal abnormalities to derive a 2-tier genetic classification. The classification was developed using 809 ALL97/99 patients and validated using 742 United Kingdom (UK)ALL2003 patients. Good-risk (GR) genetic features included ETV6-RUNX1, high hyperdiploidy, normal copy-number status for all 8 genes, isolated deletions affecting ETV6/PAX5/BTG1, and ETV6 deletions with a single additional deletion of BTG1/PAX5/CDKN2A/B. All other genetic features were classified as poor risk (PR). Three-quarters of UKALL2003 patients had a GR genetic profile and a significantly improved event-free survival (EFS) (94%) compared with patients with a PR genetic profile (79%). This difference was driven by a lower relapse rate (4% vs 17%), was seen across all patient subgroups, and was independent of other risk factors. Even genetic GR patients with minimal residual disease (>0.01%) at day 29 had an EFS in excess of 90%.

HSPs are, therefore, considered as possible therapeutic targets in the treatment of human cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This strategy offers the possibility of targeting several oncogenic proteins or several intracellular signaling pathways through the use of a single therapeutic agent. AREAS COVERED: Several specific HSP70 inhibitors have now been developed. We describe: i) the molecular structure of HSP70 and the molecular interactions especially with its co-chaperones; ii) the immunoregulatory functions of HSP70; iii) the expression and function of HSP70 in human AML cells; iv) the molecular and pharmacological characteristics of potential HSP70 inhibitors; and v) the clinical and experimental studies of HSP70 inhibition in human AML. Our review is based on careful selection of relevant publications identified in the PubMed database. EXPERT OPINION: HSP70 inhibitors have antileukemic activity in human AML.

In vertebrates the first neutrophils are thought to originate during primitive hematopoiesis, which precedes hematopoietic stem cell formation. In zebrafish embryos, it has been suggested that primitive neutrophils may originate in two distinct sites, the anterior (ALPM) and posterior lateral plate mesoderm (PLPM). An ETS-family transcription factor Etsrp/Etv2/ER71 has been implicated in vasculogenesis and hematopoiesis in multiple vertebrates. However, its role during neutrophil development is not well understood. Here we demonstrate using zebrafish embryos that Etv2 has a specific cell-autonomous function during primitive neutropoiesis in the anterior lateral plate mesoderm (ALPM) but has little effect on erythropoiesis or the posterior lateral plate mesoderm (PLPM) expression of neutrophil marker myeloperoxidase mpo/mpx. Our results argue that ALPM-derived neutrophils originate from etv2-expressing cells which downregulate etv2 during neutropoiesis. We further show that Scl functions downstream of Etv2 in anterior neutropoiesis. Additionally, we demonstrate that mpx expression within the PLPM overlaps with gata1 expression, potentially marking the cells with a dual myelo-erythroid potential. Intriguingly, initiation of mpx expression in the PLPM is dependent on gata1 but not etv2 function. Our results demonstrate that mpx expression is controlled differently in the ALPM and PLPM regions and describe novel roles for etv2 and gata1 during primitive neutropoiesis.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We propose a non-invasive method (NIRS, near infrared spectroscopy) to be used in routine clinical practice to evaluate a potential impairment of skeletal muscle oxidative capacity during exercise in children previously diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the capacity of skeletal muscle to extract O2 in 10 children diagnosed with ALL, 1 year after the end of malignancy treatment, compared to a control group matched for gender and age (mean+/-SD = 7.8+/-1.5 and 7.3+/-1.4 years, respectively). METHODS AND FINDINGS: Participants underwent an incremental exercise test on a treadmill until exhaustion. Oxygen uptake ([Formula: see text]), heart rate (HR), and tissue oxygenation status (Delta[HHb]) of the vastus lateralis muscle evaluated by NIRS, were measured. The results showed that, in children with ALL, a significant linear regression was found by plotting [Formula: see text] vs Delta[HHb] both measured at peak of exercise. In children with ALL, the slope of the HR vs [Formula: see text] linear response (during sub-maximal and peak work rates) was negatively correlated with the peak value of Delta[HHb]. CONCLUSIONS: The present study proves that the NIRS technique allows us to identify large inter-individual differences in levels of impairment in muscle O2 extraction in children with ALL. The outcome of these findings is variable and may reflect either muscle atrophy due to lack of use or, in the most severe cases, an undiagnosed myopathy.",,"['Lanfranconi, Francesca', 'Pollastri, Luca', 'Ferri, Alessandra', 'Fraschini, Donatella', 'Masera, Giuseppe', 'Miserocchi, Giuseppe']","['Lanfranconi F', 'Pollastri L', 'Ferri A', 'Fraschini D', 'Masera G', 'Miserocchi G']","['Department of Health Sciences, Laboratory of Clinical Physiology and Sport Medicine, University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Department of Health Sciences, Laboratory of Clinical Physiology and Sport Medicine, University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Department of Health Sciences, Laboratory of Clinical Physiology and Sport Medicine, University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Milano-Bicocca, San Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Milano-Bicocca, San Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Italy.', 'Department of Health Sciences, Laboratory of Clinical Physiology and Sport Medicine, University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140623,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,['S88TT14065 (Oxygen)'],IM,"['Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Female', 'Heart Rate/physiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Muscle, Skeletal/*pathology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared/*methods']",,,2014/06/24 06:00,2015/10/13 06:00,['2014/06/24 06:00'],"['2014/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0099282 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-00267 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jun 23;9(6):e99282. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0099282. eCollection 2014.,,,,PMC4067277,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mobile genetic elements can induce cancer development by random insertion into cancer related genes or by inducing translocations. L1s are typically implicated in cancers of an epithelial cell origin, while Alu elements have been implicated in leukemia as well as epithelial cell cancers. Likewise, viral infections have a significant role in cancer development predominantly through integration into the human genome and mutating or deregulating cancer related genes. Human papilloma virus is the best-known example of viral integrations contributing to carcinogenesis. However, hepatitis B virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and Merkel cell polyomavirus also integrate into the human genome and disrupt cancer related genes. Thus far, the role of microbes in cancer has primarily been attributed to mutations induced through chronic inflammation or toxins, as is the case with Helicobacter pylori and enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis. We hypothesize that like mobile elements and viral DNA, bacterial and parasitic DNA may also integrate into the human somatic genome and be oncogenic. Until recently it was believed that bacterial DNA could not integrate into the human genome, but new evidence demonstrates that bacterial insertional mutagenesis may occur in cancer cells. Although this work does not show causation between bacterial insertions and cancer, it prompts more research in this area. Promising new sequencing technologies may reduce the risk of artifactual chimeric sequences, thus diminishing some of the challenges of identifying novel insertions in the somatic human genome.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

It is not known if MMP-9 is involved in CLL cell response to chemotherapy and we address this in the present study, using arsenic trioxide (ATO) and fludarabine as examples of cytotoxic drugs. METHODS: We used primary cells from the peripheral blood of CLL patients and MEC-1 cells stably transfected with an empty vector or a vector containing MMP-9. The effect of ATO and fludarabine was determined by flow cytometry and by the MTT assay. Expression of mRNA was measured by RT-PCR and qPCR. Secreted and cell-bound MMP-9 was analyzed by gelatin zymography and flow cytometry, respectively. Protein expression was analyzed by Western blotting and immunoprecipitation. Statistical analyses were performed using the two-tailed Student's t-test. RESULTS: In response to ATO or fludarabine, CLL cells transcriptionally upregulated MMP-9, preceding the onset of apoptosis. Upregulated MMP-9 primarily localized to the membrane of early apoptotic cells and blocking apoptosis with Z-VAD prevented MMP-9 upregulation, thus linking MMP-9 to the apoptotic process. Culturing CLL cells on MMP-9 or stromal cells induced drug resistance, which was overcome by anti-MMP-9 antibodies. Accordingly, MMP-9-MEC-1 transfectants showed higher viability upon drug treatment than Mock-MEC-1 cells, and this effect was blocked by silencing MMP-9 with specific siRNAs. Following drug exposure, expression of anti-apoptotic proteins (Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, Bcl-2) and the Mcl-1/Bim, Mcl-1/Noxa, Bcl-2/Bax ratios were higher in MMP-9-cells than in Mock-cells. Similar results were obtained upon culturing primary CLL cells on MMP-9. CONCLUSIONS: Our study describes for the first time that MMP-9 induces drug resistance by modulating proteins of the Bcl-2 family and upregulating the corresponding anti-apoptotic/pro-apoptotic ratios. This is a novel role for MMP-9 contributing to CLL progression. Targeting MMP-9 in combined therapies may thus improve CLL response to treatment.",,"['Amigo-Jimenez, Irene', 'Bailon, Elvira', 'Ugarte-Berzal, Estefania', 'Aguilera-Montilla, Noemi', 'Garcia-Marco, Jose A', 'Garcia-Pardo, Angeles']","['Amigo-Jimenez I', 'Bailon E', 'Ugarte-Berzal E', 'Aguilera-Montilla N', 'Garcia-Marco JA', 'Garcia-Pardo A']","['Cellular and Molecular Medicine Department, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Madrid, Spain.', 'Cellular and Molecular Medicine Department, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Madrid, Spain.', 'Cellular and Molecular Medicine Department, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Madrid, Spain.', 'Cellular and Molecular Medicine Department, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Unit, Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro, Madrid, Spain.', 'Cellular and Molecular Medicine Department, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140623,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Female', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/metabolism', 'Integrin alpha4beta1/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/genetics/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Oxides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",,,2014/06/24 06:00,2015/10/13 06:00,['2014/06/24 06:00'],"['2013/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0099993 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-50418 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Jun 23;9(6):e99993. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0099993. eCollection 2014.,,,,PMC4067296,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
