The therapeutic use of radiopharmaceuticals is followed by a lower incidence of leukemia and other cancers. 3. The treatment is comparatively noninvasive and nontraumatic.

The peak plasma level was 1.12 IU/ml, only one fourth of that seen when L-asparaginase was given intravenously at equal doses. However, the enzyme level decrease in the plasma after intramuscular injections was slower, with a half-life ot 46 hours, compared to 7 to 28 hours for intravenously administered drug. The apparent volume of distribution indicated that the intravenously injected enzyme was mostly distributed in plasma, whereas the intramuscularly injected enzyme yielded a much larger volume of distribution (63 versus 245 ml/kg). In addition, only 19 per cent of the intramuscularly injected dose was in plasma, and the area under the curve (C X t) was only 1/24 that by intravenous route (20 versus 487 IU/ml.hr).

These two amino acids, when used at concentrations found in the ascitic fluid, significantly reduced melphalan uptake to levels which approximated those obtained with ascitic fluid. The possible effect of high concentrations of these amino acids on melphalan therapy for this neoplasm is discussed with particular reference to the model melphalan transport system in the murine L1210 leukemia cell.

The contribution of the single, simultaneous dose of CP plus MTX on Day 5 to therapeutic synergism was examined. The combination of CP plus MTX on Day 5 produced a greater decrease in tumor cell numbers than either drug alone. Measurements of the time course of inhibition and recovery of 3H-deoxyuridine incorporation into DNA showed that within 48 hours, recovery of DNA synthesis in small intestine and bone marrow was almost complete after either CP, MTX, or CP plus MTX. In contrast, tumor, which had recovered within 48 hours after MTX, still remained greater than 90% inhibited after eight CP or CP plus MTX.

A higher incidence of chromosomal abnormalities was noted in bone marrow cells of this group (five of six) when compared with a larger group of preleukemic patients not known to have been exposed to mutagens (four of 21). In addition, two patients had second chromosome studies after overt leukemia developed and there was no evidence of cytogenetic clonal evolution. The clinical course and cytogenetic data in these patients attest to the relevance of our criteria in identifying the preleukemic syndrome and suggest that the leukemic clone was fully established during the preleukemic phase.

Two patients developed serious fungal infections (Candida albicans in one and Allescheria boydii in the other). One patient had disseminated cytomegalovirus infection and two had toxoplasmosis.

The expression of an erythroid phenotype, as measured by the accumulation of hemoglobin, occurred over a narrow range of concentrations of inducers; the maximum degree of differentiation was attained at a level of inducing agent which caused slight inhibition of cell replication. Stationary phase cells with diminished capacity for DNA synthesis failed to differentiate in the presence of DMSO; whereas, in contrast, exponentially growing murine leukemia cells undergoing extensive DNA biosynthesis readily attained a differentiated phenotype. The induced synthesis of hemoglobin in Friend cells exposed to DMSO was inhibited by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine, arabinosylcytosine and hydroxyurea, when cells were simultaneously exposed to DMSO and a metabolic inhibitor. However, addition of either 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine, arabinosylcytosine or hydroxyurea to cultures pretreated with DMSO did not prevent the ultimate expression of the erythroid phenotype. These findings suggest that a process which is associated with cellular proliferation is required for the initiation of murine erythroleukemia cell maturation, but not for the ultimate accumulation of the erythroid marker hemoglobin in cells programmed to differentiate.",,,,,,,,,

The symptomatic treatment of this affection is based on histamine inhibitors and disodium cromoglycate seems to be an efficient drug. With the possible development of acute leukemia, the eventual association with a carcinoma and the frequency of serious digestive bleeding, the prognosis may be very poor.",Ascite revelatrice d'une mastocytose cutaneo-viscerale.,,,,,,,,

Carcinogens are assumed to destroy a vital substance ""A"" which is replenished by a second, ""B"", produced by neoplastic stem cells. Cancer progression is manifested by a gradual deterioration of the ""A"" producing machinery accompanied by a compensatory proliferation of neoplastic ""B"" producing stem cells whose size is therefore closely regulated so as to meet the organism's demands. Any stem cell pool reduction leading to a loss of ""A"" or ""B"" is followed by a proliferation of the remaining stem cells to replenish the loss. Such may be observed in chronic lymphoblastic leukemia maintaining a nearly constant elevated peripheral lymphoblast count. Following selective lymphoblast destruction the count is rapidly replenished to its pretreatment level. The same mechanism is assumed to explain the detrimental effect of some surgical interventions on cancer patients. Neoplastic progression is postulated to a obey a ""stem cell conservation"" principle which when violated is followed either by a stem cell replenishment or aggrevates the patient's conditions. This conservation law introduces a new definition of carcinogenesis: Any process reducing the ""A"" or ""B"" producing machinery is regarded as a carcinogen. A definition embracing, surgical extirpation of normal or neoplastic stem cells or cell destruction by irradiation, chemotherapy or chemical carcinogens.",,,,,,,,,

We found that only 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide, which is able to release both acrolein and the alkylating metabolite phosphoramide-mustard, decreased the transplantability of L 1210 cells, while the structurally analogous 4-hydroperoxy-dechloro-cyclophosphamide and 4-hydroperoxy-semi-cyclophosphamide, which under physiological conditions only release acrolein but no alkylating split products showed no cytotoxicity. Acrolein itself showed only a marginal effect, when administered in concentrations equivalent to the release of acrolein from the oxazaphosphorinane-derivatives in test. In this case, however, significant lysis of the L 1210 cells was observed by estimating dye exclusion, while acrolein released intracellularly from 4-hydroperoxy-oxazaphosphorinane-compounds did not. This points to a different mechanism of the cytotoxic action of extracellular acrolein and acrolein released intracellularly from activated oxazaphosphorinane-compounds. The results suggest that the cytotoxic effect of activated cyclophosphamide is based on the alkylating moiety of the molecule. Neither the 4-hydroperoxy-group nor the activated oxazaphosphorinane-ring itself, nor acrolein released intracellularly during toxification of activated cyclophosphamide exert a direct cytotoxic effect. Thus, the release of acrolein from activated CP apparently does not contribute to the cytotoxicity of CP in vivo.",,,,,,,,,

In the present report, we studied natural resistance against the ascitic lines of one chemically and two virally induced syngeneic leukemias in C57BL bg/bg mice and their phenotypically normal heterozygous +/bg littermates. S.c. threshold inocula of all three leukemia lines grew faster and caused death earlier in bg/bg than in +/bg mice, and two of the lines were rejected completely at a significantly higher frequency in +/bg control animals. The +/bg mice also eliminated [125I]-IdUrd-labelled leukemia cells at a faster rate than bg/bg mice, as measured by pulmonary, hepatic and splenic radioactivity retained 18-30 h after i.v. injection. Direct splenic killing of 51Cr-labelled leukemia cells was also studied in vitro, and was found to be severely depressed in bg/bg compared to +/bg. This natural killer activity was independent of adherent cells and showed a rapid, but transient, increase after inoculation of the tumor cell doses used in the transplantation tests. It was also possible to study the bg mutation in T-cell-free mice, by combining it with the nu mutation on a C57BL background. The NK activity of such beige-nude mice was found to be partially impaired compared to nude (non-beige) or wild-type animals, but higher than that of beige (non-nude) mice. Our results suggest that NK cells may be responsible for elimination of small numbers of tumor cells in the intact syngeneic host. The further use of beige and beige-nude mice in studies of transplanted and primary tumors is discussed.",,,,,,,,,

Since the individual polypeptides forming the complex live much longer than hnRNA, and in addition degrade at a different rate, we considered the following two modes of degradation as most likely. (1) The complex might not be subjected to a profound degradation at the end of the processing of associated pre-mRNA. In this case it should exist as a long-lived recyclable mosaic of metabolically differing polypeptides whose replacement takes place at a specific rate. (2) Alternatively, the protein complex might be completely degraded at the end of processing, but in a way that liberates free individual polypeptides available for recycling. The further experiments indicate that the 37 000-Mr, 34 000-Mr and 32 000-Mr core proteins in isolated 40-S particles and in particles associated with a nuclear fraction released from chromatin after micrococcal nuclease digestion degrade at different rates.

Chromatographic behavior, hydrophobicity, transport, binding, and photosensitizing capacity of different porphyrins were examined and compared. Biological studies were carried out using murine leukemia L1210 cells in vitro. The initial rate of porphyrin uptake was a function of drug hydrophobicity. The most hydrophobic components of HPD were therefore the most potent photosensitizers when irradiation followed a 10-min porphyrin-loading incubation. But these and other hydrophobic porphyrins were readily washed from cells by medium containing serum. Hydrophilic components of HPD were gradually accumulated by L1210 cells via a mode of binding not readily dissociated by washing and appear to be responsible for the preferential affinity of this product for neoplastic cells.

Three mathematical models were suggested and fitted to experimental data. It was found that: (a) model of simple kinetics (Model 1) does not agree with experimental data. Therefore, two hypotheses were considered in further mathematical modelling: (b) virions are identical in time of budding: maturation is dependent on the presence of a virion component which is degraded with time (Model 2). This model agrees with experimental data in all stages of the maturation process. (c) Virions are released from cells at different stages of assembly (Model 3). This model differs from experimental data especially in early stages of maturation. The hypothesis used for the construction of Model 2 seems to be the most plausible to explain the maturation process and is in agreement with data of murine leukemia virus maturation which was found to be accomplished by cleavage of p70 precursor protein.",,,,,,,,,

Statistical analysis of actuarial curves showed a significant difference of survival probability according to the bone marrow infiltration patterns. Thus, in patients with interstitial or nodular patterns the life expectancy is significantly longer than in those with mixed or diffuse patterns. furthermore, a significant degree of correlation between bone marrow infiltration patterns and different methods of clinical staging in CLL was apparent.

DNA-protein cross-links were removed at a slower rate - T 1/2 approximately 10-12 hr. Cells were subcultured at low density at various times after irradiation and scored for colony survival (potentially lethal damage repair), and chromosome aberrations in the first mitosis after sub-culture. Both cell lethality and the frequency of chromosome aberrations decreased during the first several hours of repair, reaching a minimum level by 6 hr; this decrease correlated temporally with the repair of the slowly rejoining DNA strand breaks.

Seven patients with C. septicum gangrene or sepsis have been treated at the Massachusetts General Hospital in the years 1977-79. All of these patients have had associated malignant disease: four patients had colon adenocarcinomas, two patients had acute myeloblastic leukemias, and one patient had breast carcinoma. In six of the seven patients, the malignancy was in an advanced state; the breast carcinoma showed no evidence of recurrence after mastectomy, 17 years earlier. A bowel portal of entry is postulated in five patients. Despite prompt use of appropriate antibiotics, the only survivors were two of the four patients who underwent early extensive debridement. These results suggest that, in the patient with C. septicum infection, malignancy should be sought; that, in the septic patient with known malignancy, C. septicum should be considered; and that, in the absence of external source in the patient with clostridial myonecrosis or sepsis, the cecum or distal ileum should be considered a likely site of infection. Increased awareness of this association between C. septicum and malignancy, and aggressive surgical treatment, may result in improvement in the present 50-70% mortality rate.",,PMC1345077,,,,,,,

Fluoxymesterone and dexamethasone were the most active inducers of CFU-E proliferation, and etiocholanolone and dexamethasone were the most potent burst augmenters. Androsterone did not significantly influence BFU-E proliferation in 66% of the marrow cultures from hematologically normal donors.

Studies were performed to evaluate glyoxylic acid-induced catecholamine fluorescence as a rapid method for identifying neuroblastoma cells in biopsy specimens. The morphology of tumor explants in tissue culture was also evaluated for use as a diagnostic aid. Eighteen neuroblastomas were stained for catecholamines; 78% showed specific catecholamine fluorescence. Two ganglioneurons and a pheochromocytoma also showed positive catecholamine fluorescence. All 20 neuroblastomas placed in tissue culture demonstrated neurite outgrowth, a property that distinguishes neuroblastoma from other small round cell neoplasms. Seventeen nonneuroblastoma tumors displayed neither specific fluorescence nor neurite outgrowth. The ability of these two technics to identify neuroblastoma was compared with routine histology, urinary vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) spot tests, quantitative urinary VMA and catecholamine assays, and electron microscopy. Only electron microscopy was as sensitive as fluorescence and morphology in culture. The fluorescence method is rapid and simple and provides a valuable tumor marker when positive. Neurite outgrowth in cell culture and electron microscopy, although more time-consuming, were the most sensitive of all the diagnostic methods evaluated.",,,,,,,,,

Analysis of actuarial survival curves revealed the following: 1) the method of staging proposed by Rai was confirmed to be a reliable predictor for prognosis of CLL; 2( neither age nor sex do appear to be prognostic factor; 3) the enlarged liver did not appear to make worse the prognosis of CLL, probably by hepatomegalies due to other aetiologies.

In vitro studies have been highly successful, showing target specificity of a high order in some cases. However, so far, such conjugates have been inadequate in vivo, probably for two main reasons. First, conventional heteroclonal antibodies are perhaps inappropriate, because purification by biochemical methods leaves a large amount of non-antibody gamma-globulins. The use of monoclonal antibodies may overcome this problem. Second, when whole toxins have been conjugated to antibodies there has been a strong residual nonspecific cytotoxicity due to the binding capacity of a subunit, the B-piece of the toxin. (Diphtheria toxin or ricin consist of two polypeptide subunits. The A-piece is responsible for inhibition of protein synthesis on ribosomes, and the B-piece binds to galactose residues on the cell membrane and facilitates the transmembrane passage of the A-piece.) In the present work the problem of nonspecific binding by the B-piece has been circumvented by using the A-piece only as the toxin component of immunotoxins; these immunotoxins are active both in vitro and in vivo.",,,,,,,,,

It is assumed that the theory is of the two-hit type. The first hit damages DNA repair capability of base damage. The second hit causes derepression of a 2 repressor system. Sequential repression of gene expression occurs. Inactivation of the first repressor permits synthesis of the second which will repress the expression of the leukocyte maturation gene. The first repressor is inactivated by X-ray damage to its corresponding operator region.

Total body nitrogen was determined by means of the prompt gamma neutron activation technique; total body potassium was measured with the use of a whole body counter. The mass and protein content of the muscle compartment and nonmuscle lean tissue were estimated by application of the technique of compartmental analysis. Total body water, determined simultaneously with the use of tritium label, provided a measure of lean body mass. From these data, the body fat can be inferred. The prompt gamma neutron activation and whole body counting techniques represent a considerable advance over the balance and radioisotope techniques used in earlier studies. The new techniques make possible sequential studies over prolonged periods of time with a considerable degree of accuracy. The loss of body weight by patients with solid tumors consisted primarily of the loss of muscle mass and body fat. Even in severe wasting, the patients appear to retain significant amounts of body fat. It is the skeletal muscle which is predominantly lost; the visceral life-supporting system is, to a considerable extent, spared. The nonmuscle tissue including the visceral fraction did not change in this study, and actually appeared to increase in size when comparison was made with the normal contrast population.

These results indicate that only 1 category of established hematopoietic cell line, the LCL, has MRBC receptors and that thus a further subset of B-lymphocyte, the one represented by LCL, has the capacity for rosetting with MRBC.

Membrane carbohydrates of rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells and rat mast cells (RMC) were labeled by treating the cells with galactose oxidase followed by [3H]-NaBH4. IgE receptors were separated from detergent solubilized membranes and examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Pretreatment with neuraminidase markedly increased the incorporation of 3H into both the total membrane extract and into the IgE receptors. SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated the presence of galactose in all IgE-binding components of 2 RBL cell lines and the presence of sialic acid on the major IgE-binding component. Prior saturation of the cells with IgE did not prevent the carbohydrate labeling of the receptor, although it did block the labeling of its protein part, indicating that carbohydrates are not located in the binding site. Removal of terminal sialic acid residues with neuraminidase increased the affinity of the receptor for IgE without appreciably affecting the number of receptors per cell. In order to more drastically modify the receptor carbohydrates, RBL cells were grown in the presence of Tunicamycin (TN). TN was shown to markedly inhibit the incorporation of [3H]-glucosamine into the receptor. RBL cells grown in the presence of TN expressed fewer receptors at the cell surface, as judged both by ligand binding studies and external labeling procedures. These data cumulatively suggest that the carbohydrate moieties of the receptor are not directly located in the binding site of the IgE receptor; however, the TN studies suggest that receptor carbohydrate may play a role in transport of the receptor to the plasma membrane or in its orientation thereafter.",,,,,,,,,

The kinetic parameters of transport were computed by fitting appropriate integrated rate equations to time courses of transmembrane equilibration of radiolabeled substrate. Transport of all four lines, as in Novikoff rat hepatoma cells, conformed to a simple carrier model with directional symmetry but differential mobility of loaded and empty carrier. As was apparent from a comparison of influx and exchange flux, the loaded carrier of all cell types moved between 4 and 14 times faster than the empty carrier. ATP depletion of the cells by incubation in glucose-free medium containing KCN and iodoacetate had no significant effect on the kinetic properties of the transporter.

Fractions containing most of the tumor-rejection activity but low amounts of gp70 and p30 were consolidated and used to hyperimmunize semisyngeneic, CBF1, hybrid mice. Using the complement-dependent cytotoxicity assay, we determined the antibody titers against RBL-5 and several other leukemic cells. Only RBL-5 and EL-4 tumor cells were lysed. Similar results were obtained when the same tumor cells were used to absorb the syngeneic antiserum and the residual cytotoxic titer determined on RBL-5 target cells. Coupling of the gamma-globulins from this antiserum to Sepharose 4B facilitated the isolation of an antigen which inhibited the C'-dependent lysis of RBL-5 tumor cells and, when used for immunization, protected the recipient mice against a subcutaneous challenge of RBL-5 leukemia cells. By means of disc gel electrophoresis, in the presence of SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol, two polypeptide chains with molecular weights of 46,000 and 21,000 were resolved. The binding of the antigen to a lens culinaris lentil lectin column and its subsequent elution with alpha-methyl mannoside suggests that the specific tumor antigen is a glycoprotein.",,,,,,,,,

Human monocytes bound K-562 cells firmly and mediated a slow cytolysis of the leukemia cells. Monocyte binding of target cells was shown to be trypsin sensitive. Freeze-fracture and thin section electron microscopy revealed that effector and target cells were separated by a irregular space larger than 20 nm. There was no evidence for the involvement of specialized membrane junctions or organelle transfer between monocytes and target cells. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that K-562 cells bound to monocytes progressively lost their microvilli. This process started in the membrane areas close to the effector-target cell interaction. The results suggest that binding of target cells by monocytes followed by action of short-range soluble cytotoxic mediators may be the mechanism for the monocyte-mediated cytotoxicity towards K-562 cells.",,,,,,,,,

While YAC cells invariably grew progressively once they formed a palpable tumor, regression of YWA tumors was frequently observed in both susceptible and resistant genotypes. The hybrid resistance pattern for YAC and YWA differed in one important respect: outcross of the syngeneic host to the A-congenic A.BY strain introduced a strong H-2b-associated resistance factor against YWA, but not against YAC. Compared to YAC, which is highly NK-sensitive and rapidly eliminated from mice with high NK activity, YWA was insensitive to NK-mediated lysis in vitro and [125I] UdR-labelled YWA cells were not eliminated more efficiently from the highly resistant (A.SW X A.BY) F1 then from the parental strain in short-term (4-18h) in vivo rejection assays. It was therefore concluded that the H-2b-associated resistance against YWA was independent of NK cells or other rapidly acting effector mechanisms. Moreover, thymectomy, followed by irradiation and fetal liver reconstitution, completely abolished the resistance against YWA but left the resistance against YAC virtually intact. These data suggest that two lymphomas induced by the same agent can be rejected by different effectors. The NK-resistant YWA lymphoma is rejected by a T-dependent mechanism, while the resistance against the inoculation of the highly NK-sensitive YAC line is T-independent and, in all probability, mediated by NK cells.",,,,,,,,,

Positively charged liposomes were more toxic in vitro (chick heart cells) and in vivo (5-fold reduction in LD50 in mice) than neutral or negatively charged liposomes. Based on these findings, adriamycin was encapsulated in negatively charged liposomes (PG: PC: Chol--1:4:5), sequentially extruded through polycarbonate membranes (to 0.2 micrometer pore size) and purified by exhaustive dialysis. This preparation had a mean vesicle diameter of 0.24 micrometer and was stable in serum (24 hr drug retention of 85%). As compared with free drug, liposome-encapsulated adriamycin was less toxic in vitro to chick heart cells. In mice, adriamycin displayed short- (4-14 day) and long- (45-70 day) term toxicity. Encapsulating adriamycin increased both short- (20-50 mg/kg) and long- (10-15 mg/kg to 25-30 mg/kg) term LD50 levels. As compared with free drug, administering encapsulated adriamycin in vivo reduced the incidence of cardiac histopathologic lesions at 20 and 40 mg/kg. Compared in vivo, plasma levels of liposome-encapsulated adriamycin were 2/3-fold higher than free drug up to 24 hr post drug administration. Cardiac uptake of adriamycin was reduced 2-fold (conc x time value for 48 h) following encapsulated drug administration. Encapsulating adriamycin in liposomes did not alter its therapeutic effect against L1210 leukemic cells in vivo.",,,,,,,,,

The uncontrolled proliferation of the megakaryocyte-platelet cell line occurred after splenectomy and treatment of blastic phase. Applicability of the term megakaryocytic leukaemia is discussed as well as its relationship to similar disorders. It is suggested that an extensive neoplastic proliferation of megakaryocytes with abnormal maturation and thereby formation of large dysplastic platelets in extramedullary organs especially the liver in the end stage of myelofibrosis is a possible mechanism for this disorder. Treatment with platelet-pheresis may be an effective part of therapy.,,,,,,,,,

In all cases, hairy cells with typical ultrastructural characteristics were observed within splenic cords and sinuses. Hairy cells had numerous cytoplasmic processes that interdigitated with cytoplasmic processes of other hairy cells. Hairy cells also adhered to sinus endothelial cells and ring fibers and protruded into spaces between endothelial cells. Some normal sinuses were filled with aggregated hairy cells. Other sinuses appeared dilated. Many sinuses were lined by hairy cells that covered thinned endothelial cells and ring fibers. In these abnormal sinuses, endothelial cells were decreased and many appeared injured. The splenic cords were expanded by an infiltration of hairy cells and by large blood-filled spaces. These findings suggest that hairy cells adhere to many cell surfaces, produce endothelial cell injury and death, and impede the venous flow of blood in the spleen.

Other larger studies used methodology and design that precluded an interpretation of the results. Such limitations were acknowledged by some authors. Use of restrictive disease rubrics also lead to the submerging of sites that would have demonstrated significant excesses. For example, some investigators analyzed data for liver cancer deaths with the board category of digestive system cancer deaths, while others combined data for CNS cancer deaths with the broad category of ""other and unspecified cancer,"" and most studies analyzed information for lymphatic and hematopoietic system cancer deaths with all data combined. Only four of eight studies reviewed could demonstrate a significant excess of liver cancer among VC-exposed workers--a site confirmed in humans by 1974. In contrast, five of eight studies appear to demonstrate a significant excess of CNS cancer mortality. Workers exposed to VC also demonstrate a significant excess of mortality for lung cancer, while the data for lymphatic and hematopoietic system cancer are suggestive.

The kinetics of cross-link formation were similar in both cell lines. After 1-h treatment with cis-DDP, cross-linking continued to increase to a maximum at 12 h posttreatment. Although cross-linking decreased by 24 h some lesions were seen to persist. After 72 h interstrand cross-links were completely removed by both cell lines, however 50% of the DNA-protein cross-links still remained in the sensitive cells even though they were undetectable in the resistant subline. To correlate cross-linking with cytotoxicity, a range of drug concentrations were used for concomitant growth inhibition studies and alkaline elution analyses. In addition to the 30-fold resistant subline, two other sublines developed in our laboratory which show 20- and 50-fold resistance to cis-DDP were included in these determinations. All the resistant sublines exhibited the same degree of cross-linking at the same applied drug doses although these doses elicited markedly different cytotoxicities; cross-linking varied only with applied drug concentrations. The degree of cross-linking in L1210/0 was also directly related to the dose of cis-DDP. However, the sensitive cell line displayed equivalent total cross-linking at a 5-fold lower applied dose. This may implicate an uptake phenomenon as a contributor to resistance. However, such a phenomenon can account for only part of the resistance observed as there existed 6-fold more total cross-links and 9-fold more interstrand cross-links in L1210/DDP2 at doses that were equitoxic to L1210. This suggests the existence of a more critical cytotoxic lesion that was not detectable by alkaline elution, probably interstrand cross-links. Resistance could be due to a differential removal of these lesions.",,,,,,,,,

The amount of this glycoprotein, which is barely detectable on the VLB-sensitive cells (CEM), appears to be related in part to the degree of resistance, up to approximately 270-fold. Exposure of the cells to Pronase for 45 to 60 min or growth of the cells for 2 days in tunicamycin, an inhibitor of glycoprotein synthesis, resulted in the absence of the resistance-associated glycoproteins, as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of these treated cells after labeling te cells either with sodium [3H]-borohydride or with [14C]- or [3H]glucosamine. Uptake studies with [3H]VLB revealed that CEM cells normally accumulated and retained more drug than did the CEM/VLB100 cells. While the tunicamycin or Pronase treatments slightly increased the uptake of drug by CEM cells, there was no enhanced uptake of [3H]VLB by the tunicamycin- or pronase-treated CEM/VLB100 cells, when compared with untreated controls, indicating that the loss of external surface glycoproteins did not render the resistant cells more ""leaky"" to drug influx. Additionally, diminished drug retention by the CEM/VLB100 cells was unaffected by these treatments. Moreover, when CEM/VLB100 cells were grown grown for 2 days in the presence of tunicamycin and several concentrations of VLB, no enhanced toxicity of VLB was noted. Other experiments with [14C]glucosamine and [3H]leucine revealed that treatment with tunicamycin did not affect the distribution of proteins in these cells. Taken together, these results permit the suggestion that the carbohydrate moiety of the cell surface resistance-associated glycoproteins does not mediate resistance to the alkaloid per se; however, a role for plasma membrane proteins cannot be ruled out at this time.",,,,,,,,,

Conservation of potency was the criterion of therapeutic success. In idiopathic priapism 50% of the patients kept their potency after shunt-operations, whereas in priapism of known origin (""secondary priapism"" due to ileofemoral thrombosis, leukemia, hemodialysis) after different treatment methods (thrombolytic pharmacotherapy, shunt-operations) the result nearly always was a loss of potency.

Thirty-day-old thymectomized mice were submitted to four doses at weekly intervals (1.75 Gy) and thereafter treated with FTS (1 ng) for 9 days. Two groups were restored with either bone marrow or spleen cells prior to FTS treatment. In another group mice were treated with FTS (12 ng) for 1 month after thymectomy and prior to irradiation. Results indicated that primarily irradiation and FTS, and, to a lesser extent, restoration and age of the mice at the time of their first radiation exposure influenced leukaemogenesis. Irradiation increased the spontaneous low incidence of extrathymic leukaemia (5%) up to 50%. Although nothing is yet known about the expression of endogenous retroviruses in thymectomized AKR mice, the possible expression of leukaemogenic recombinants, either identical to or different from mink-cell-focus-inducing viruses (MCF), might explain this enhancing effect of radiation on leukaemogenesis. Mice developed two types of leukaemias: ""null"" leukaemias whose cells bore no detectable theta antigen or surface immunoglobulin, and B leukaemias. Among the null leukaemias, two kinds could be distinguished: ""early"" ones which were observed before 450 days, and in which BM and spleen were similarly involved, and ""late"" ones which displayed the same characteristics as B leukaemias, i.e. delayed appearance (after 450 days) and splenic origin. Although FTS did not modify the overall frequency of leukaemias, it increased significantly the incidence of the ""early"" null ones. It had no effect on the frequency or the latency of late null and B leukaemias. Any population of theta-negative T cells sensitive to FTS could be an acceptable candidate for ""early"" null leukaemogenesis. The origin of ""late"" null leukaemias remains an open question.",,,,,,,,,

(Cancer Treat. Rep., 60: 23-27, 1976) reported rapid emergence of resistance of L1210 leukemia cells in mice to two schedules of six antimetabolites and much slower development of resistance to a third schedule. Such rapid development of resistance to six drugs presents a striking puzzle, and one whose solution gives some insights into the basis for general emergence of drug resistance. Our approach was to examine the consequences of applying these drugs singly or in pairs and, from the results, to infer interactions in six-drug combinations. 6-Thioguanine (TG) and 6-mercaptopurine are the key drugs since, as shown by Schmid et al., resistance of leukemic cells appeared to six-drug combinations at the same time as did resistance to the purine analogs; sensitivity to the other drugs remained. We demonstrated that cells which emerged were resistant to both of the purine analogs, owing to a deficiency of the activating enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. TG resistance arose in the presence of TG because of an overgrowth of TG-resistance mutants that were present as one cell in 10(4) in the original L1210 population. L1210 cultures were prepared free of TG-resistant mutants. With these cells, TG administered shortly after inoculation was very effective in delaying their death. The cells that finally grew out were still TG sensitive. Simultaneous treatment with all the drugs greatly delayed appearance of TG resistance in vivo and in vitro. Methotrexate alone was responsible for this result, owing to its ability preferentially to kill TG-resistant cells. The other three drugs were not effective in delaying TG resistance. Methotrexate was effective only if it was added daily; one large injection was ineffective. Therefore, TG and methotrexate added daily for 6 days (simultaneous schedule) was the most effective drug regimen tested.",,,,,,,,,

This test is excellent for the research of anti-platelets auto-antibodies in ITP. Yet, the reaction remains negative in a minority of ITP.

Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that maternal subcutaneous injections of hydroxyurea produce immediate circulatory alterations in rabbit embryos similar to those observed subsequent to uterine artery occlusion. The present study was designed to investigate the possibility that the embryolethal and teratogenic properties of hydroxyurea might be due to alterations in maternal hemodynamics, i.e., constriction of the uterine vasculature, resulting in exposure of the embryo to uterine ischemia at critical stage of in utero development. This study demonstrates that hydroxyurea significantly alters blood pressure and heart rate and produces significant uterine vasoconstriction.

Three different types of transplanted extramedullary tumors, including a carcinoma (EAC), a sarcoma (S-180), and a leukemia (L-1210) produced anemia, neutrophilia, and medullary erythroblastopenia. Because the most striking effects were observed with S-180, it was selected for detailed study. Although erythroblasts were greatly decreased in the bone marrow to about 1% in the differential count, CFU-E and BFU-E were not, suggesting inhibited maturation of erythroid progenitors. Suppression of MSC to 1/3 of normal occurred at 21 days of tumor bearing, and qualitatively abnormal MSC at 35 days failed to enhance CFU-E and BFU-E in split-phase culture. We found that these MSC from tumor-bearing mice produced suppressive levels of PGE. PGE production and erythroid colony enhancement of MSC from either normal or tumor-bearing mice was abrogated by including 5 micrograms/ml indomethacin in the split-phase culture. Medium conditioned by S-180 that was capable of suppressing the growth of MSC colonies had no direct effect on erythroid colony formation. Our results support a hypothesis that extramedullary tumors are capable of producing a lesion in the supportive tissue of the bone marrow, leading to anemia and medullary erythroblastopenia. We believe that early, the tumor suppresses the number of MSC required for maturation of erythroid precursors and later induces the normal numbers of MSC to produce suppressive levels of PGE.",,,,,,,,,

BHK, 3T3, P388D1, and P388 cells produced plasminogen activator constitutively, but no significant production was observed in the other cell lines. Plasminogen activator production was induced or stimulated by TPA only in P388 cells (10- to 20-fold by 100 ng TPA/ml). On the other hand, phosphatidylcholine synthesis was stimulated by TPA only in HeLa cells, and hexose transport, as measured with 3-0-methyl-D-glucose, only in 3T3 and P388D1 cells, as well as in human lymphocytes. The stimulation of hexose transport occurred more rapidly than the induction of plasminogen activator production and seemed to be part of the mitogenic response of cells to TPA treatment. A stimulation of deoxyglucose uptake was similarly limited to 3T3 and P388D1 cells. A significant decarboxylation of carbon 1 of deoxyglucose occurred in P388 and P388D1 cells, but not in Novikoff cells, and any decarboxylation that occurred was not stimulated by TPA.

The assay exhibits a limit of detection of about 1 ng eEF-TU and an intraassay variability of < 10%. By using the radioimmunoassay, it was found that eEF-Tu is a major non-hemoglobin protein of rabbit reticulocyte postribosomal supernatant proteins, comprising about 3% of the total hemoglobin and 10--13% of the non-hemoglobin proteins. Similar results were found for a number of different tissues and cells, including rabbit heart, brain, liver and kidneys, as well as both induced and non induced Friend erythroleukemia cells. Values of eEF-Tu ranged from 1% of supernatant proteins in heart to about 11% in noninduced erythroleukemic cells. The levels of eEF-Tu in these mammalian tissues were comparable to the level of the homologous factor EF-Tu in Escherichia coli. It has previously been found that EF-Tu constitutes about 6--8% of the supernatant proteins of E. coli [Furano, A. V. (1975) Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA, 72, 4780--4784]. The level of eEF-Tu in reticulocytes was compared to the abundance of other components of protein synthesis in reticulocytes, such as translocase (eEF-G), tRNA, ribosomes and eIF-2.

Inhibition is achieved at concentrations of the organic compounds reported to be optimal for induction of erythroid differentiation in Friend leukemia cells. Butyric acid is the most potent compound tested. Compounds that are structurally related to butyric acid, but that do not induce erythroid differentiation, do not inhibit lymphocyte mitogenesis. Lymphocyte responses to other mitogens are also suppressed by the polar organic compounds, although higher concentrations are required. These agents are much less inhibitory when added 24 hr after initiation of the cultures, indicating that they may affect an early phase of lymphocyte activation.

Further investigations in the patient with congenital abnormality disclosed that PF-3 activity failed to respond to any of the stimuli tested, and there was a clear dissociation between PF-3 availability and platelet aggregation. The abnormality was due to an intrinsic platelet defect caused by a true deficiency of the membrane phospholipid clotting activity.

In our rat model for AML, the transplantable Brown Norway myeloid leukaemia (BNML), near total suppression of haemopoiesis was observed in a relatively early stage of the disease because of the physical disappearance of haemopoietic stem cells (HSC) from the bone marrow, which was only partly compensated by an increased number of HSC in the spleen. The few HSC remaining in the BNML bone marrow in the terminal stage of the disease were mostly out of cycle, in contrast to the HSC in normal rat marrow. Studies with injected labelled leukaemic cells revealed that both BNML and cells of a transplantable lymphatic leukaemia home in the subendosteal region of the femoral bone marrow. Subsequently, ALL cells become randomly distributed over the whole marrow space, while BNML cells remain localized in the subendosteal region. The latter area contains in normal rat marrow a higher proportion of proliferating blast cells than the central area of the marrow, which is reminiscent of the kinetic gradient described in mouse bone marrow by Shackney et al. [22]. These observations support the hypothesis that the depression of normal haemopoiesis in AML is caused by a specific localization and proliferation of AML cells in the subendosteal area, which normally provides the optimal microenvironment for HSC self-replication. In ALL the more severe depression of haemopoiesis occurs in a later stage and is caused by random replacement of HSC as a result of non-specific overgrowth.",,,,,,,,,

A number of experimental approaches have suggested that the cytotoxic 'specificity' of NK cells is not clonally distributed. Thus, clones of NK cells, established from mouse spleen cell suspensions, showed no greater restriction in the spectrum of target cells which they could lyse, than did the parent spleen cell populations from which they were derived. It seems likely therefore that the wide range of target cell types that can be lysed by NK cells share common cell surface characteristics which render them susceptible. As lysis results from membrane-membrane interactions, it seemed logical that a search for 'hallmarks' of NK susceptibility should begin with a detailed examination of the plasma membrane of susceptible cells. Analysis of one pair of lymphoma cell variants, selected on account of their markedly different susceptibility to NK cells, suggests that cell surface glycoconjugates may be of significance in determining those effector cell-target cell interactions that lead to lysis. This review outlines attempts to characterize such glycoconjugates.",,,,,,,,,

B-1 antibody was found to have reactivities against null cell ALL cells as well as some CML-blastic crisis cells. The antibody reacted against some cultured lymphoid cell lines and also several percent of bone marrow cells. The reactivities of B-1 antibody were quite similar to those of c-ALL by Greaves et al and J-5 by Ritz et al. Radioimmunoprecipitation experiment suggested that B-1 antibody define the same antigen as the other two do. Meanwhile, D-22 antibody reacted against null cell ALL cells, but did not react against any other types of leukemia cells or any other cultured cell lines, or bone marrow cells. Thus D-22 antibody was considered to have higher specificity for null cell ALL cells than any other antibodies reported. On the other hand, the analyses by flow cytometry were well correlated with the analysis by immune adherence assay and by immunofluorescent microscopy. Besides, the analysis by flow cytometry provided us precise quantitative data and histogram pattern of positive cells. Furthermore, detailed examination of subpopulation could be done using cell sorter or other biological features could be analysed simultaneously using another fluorescent dye.

Doses of single injection were escalated from an initial dose of 2 mg/m2 estimated by one twentieth of LD10 in mice up to 60 mg/m2. The most frequent and severest toxicity was nausea and vomiting seen in about the half of patients being administered dosages ranged from 24 mg/m2 to 40 mg/m2, and 3 out of 4 patients received dosages exceeding 50 mg/m2 required clinical managements; moreover, 1 out of 2 patients administered 60 mg/m2 was ranked as grade 4 of the criterion of toxicities in WHO handbook.

It was also noted that the age of patients with familial leukemia in children of consanguineous parents was younger than that of cases whose parents were not related. These findings suggest that genetic factors may play an important role in the etiology of familial leukemia in siblings. According to the frequencies of familial aggregations in close relatives, the genetic relationships were supposed to be important in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute leukemia, but not in chronic granulocytic leukemia. Increased prevalence of autoimmune diseases in relatives of leukemic patients suggests a possibility of genetic immunodeficiency as a common etiologic factor in both diseases. Immunodeficiency was found in unaffected relatives of patients with familial leukemia and lymphoma. Genetic factors were also suggested by the familial occurrences of multiple myeloma and primary macroglobulinemia, and the incidence of benign monoclonal gammopathy in relatives of patients with these diseases. HLA studies revealed the increased frequencies of A2 in acute lymphocytic leukemia, of B5 and B18 in Hodgkin's disease, and of A5 and B18 in multiple myeloma. From such relationships existing between familial immunodeficiencies and hemopoietic neoplasia, genes regulating the immune responsiveness might be involved in susceptibility to these diseases.",,,,,,,,,

Continuous exposure of leukemic and normal bone marrow cells to DM as well as Ara-C in vitro appeared to be more effective than pulse exposure because colony formation was suppressed by a dose dependent fashion. The relationship between in vitro sensitivity to DM and Ara-C and that of in vivo to chemotherapy was investigated in 17 untreated and 5 relapsed patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. The sensitivity of L-CFU to the two chemotherapeutic agents varied from patient to patient. These studies indicated a clear-cut relationship between in vitro drug sensitivity and in vivo response to patients whose L-CFU were sensitive to both agents and entered complete remission, whereas patients whose L-CFU were insensitive to one or both drugs in vitro failed to enter remission. This assay system appears to be useful in predicting response of patients to chemotherapy and in selecting the most effective drugs for an individual patient use.",,,,,,,,,

In some of the substrains the inserted viral genome becomes activated at specific stages of embryogenesis and the available evidence suggests that these viral genomes are developmentally regulated. To investigate the effect of cellular differentiation on virus expression, M-MuLV was introduced either into preimplantation or post-implantation mouse embryos or into embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells. Whereas preimplantation embryos or EC cells are not permissive for virus expression, efficient replication occurred in postimplantation embryos or in differentiated cell lines. The viral genomes introduced into early embryonal cells were highly methylated and noninfectious when analyzed in the adult. In contrast, viral genomes introduced into postimplantation embryos or into differentiated cells remained unmethylated and were infectious in a transfection assay. These results demonstrate an efficient de novo methylation activity which appears to be involved in repression of genes introduced into pluripotent embryonal cells and which is not observed in cells of the postimplantation embryo or in differentiated cells in tissue culture.",,,,,,,,,

Although that observation may be important and is currently being examined through case-control analyses, it must be recognized that Bross and Driscoll extracted their observation from matrices of over 4,000 data cells apparently by recombination of innumerable possible permutations of dosage and latency intervals. For that reason, their finding can be regarded as no more than a suggestion for further study. It certainly does not represent a proper scientific conclusion.

All dUrd analogs tested showed competitive kinetics with respect to dThd. However, there was little, if any, correlation between the inhibitory effects of the compounds on L1210 cell growth and their inhibitory activities against dThd kinase (r = 0.16). The most potent inhibitors of dTMP synthetase were (in order of decreasing activity): 5-nitro-dUMP greater than 5-formyl-dUMP greater than 5-fluoro-dUMP greater than 5-oxime of 5-formyl-dUMP greater than 5-azidomethyl-dUMP greater than (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-dUMP.

During the myelosuppression from chemotherapy, all three variables fell; during recovery, megakaryocyte ploidy rose 1-2 days before platelet volume, which in turn rose 1-2 days before platelet count. Serial platelet volumes and counts of these patients were compared to the nomogram of the inverse nonlinear relation between platelet count and platelet size in reference subjects. Platelet volume became inappropriately small before platelet count fell substantially and remained small through most of the thrombocytopenic nadir. The end of the nadir was predictable 1-2 days after platelet volume increased to lie congruent with the reference nomogram. Changes in thrombopoiesis appear to occur sequentially in megakaryocyte ploidy, platelet volume, and platelet count. Changes in platelet count, and therefore the appearance of duration of the thrombocytopenic nadir, can be predicted by 1-2 days with platelet volume and 3-4 days with megakaryocyte ploidy. As platelet count rose, despite the continuing predominance of ""young"" platelets, MPV fell, suggesting that megakaryocyte stimulation as well as platelet age affects platelet size.",,,,,,,,,

The sites in DNA synthesis which were inhibited were DNA polymerase and purine synthesis. In the latter pathway the enzyme activities inhibited were phosphoribosyl aminotransferase, inosinic acid dehydrogenase, and dihydrofolate reductase. In vivo administration of the diterpene esters at 0.8 mg/kg afforded identical types of effects on purine and DNA synthesis and in addition suppressed histone phosphorylation and reduced the number of surviving tumor cells.

In all cases, the diagnoses were based on the histological examination of lymph nodes, bone marrow, or skin biopsies. According to the Kiel classification, the diagnoses were as follows: chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) n = 145. Immunocytoma (Ic) n = 39. Centrocytic (Cc) and centroblastic/centrocytic lymphoma (Cb/Cc) n = 17. Hairy-cell leukemia (HCL) n = 10. Prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL) n = 6 and Sezary's syndrome n = 3. In only 8 of the 220 cases did the leukemia cells show T characteristics. In leukemic B-cell lymphoma, a uniform phenotype was observed for B-CLL, characterized by a weak SIgM staining with or without SIgD, the presence of C3d-receptors and a high percentage of M-R. This phenotype was also detected in one third of the cases of immunocytoma. The cells of B-PLL and leukemic CC and CB/CC were characterized by a stronger SIg staining, a variable formation of complement receptors and, in most cases, absence of M-R. In all cases of B-cell lymphoma, the monoclonality of the cell proliferation could be confirmed by the restriction to a single L-chain type. This also applies to the 10 cases of HCL, although in the majority of these cases, several heavy-chain classes could be detected at the malignant cells.",,,,,,,,,

Strains of mice differ among themselves in susceptibility to Friend virus and one of the major genes affecting the early response to viral infection is Fv-2. Allophenic mice compounded from a resistant strain C57BL/6 (Fv-2rr) and a susceptible one DBA/2 (Fv-2ss) were infected with the polycythemic strain of Friend virus to determine whether susceptibility/resistance was limited to cells of the respective genotypes or if there was an influence across the genotypic barriers. The manifestations of viral pathogenesis monitored were splenomegaly, reticulocytosis and leukocytosis. In addition, the proportion of red cells of the two genotypes in each animal was monitored before and after viral infection by analyses for strain specific electrophoretic variants of hemoglobin and glucose phosphate isomerase. The group of allophenic mice with 25% or more susceptible-strain red blood cells all developed symptoms of virus-induced disease and also revealed dramatic increases in the number of red cells of the susceptible-strain genotype. Thus, no evidence for protection of susceptible-strain cells by ones of the resistant strain could be observed and the disease developed primarily in susceptible strain cells. On the other hand infected animals with 15% or less DBA/2 red cells were severely retarded in the development of Friend disease. Under these circumstances susceptible strain target cells might fail to undergo viral induced replication as a result of direct protection by resistant strain cells. Alternatively, other more complex mechanisms might be involved such as protective anti-viral immune reactions.",,,,,,,,,

With a two-sided test statistic, no statistically significant excesses in total or cause-specific mortality were observed for the overall worker population of either plant. However, the plant A study group demonstrated a nonsignificant statistical excess [standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of 203] for the cause-specific category of leukemia and aleukemia. Additional analyses were performed on a subgroup consisting of all white males with at least six months of employment at plant A between the beginning of 1943 and the end of 1945, a time which coincided with process and operational changes. An SMR of 278, also not statistically significant, was demonstrated for the leukemia and aleukemia cause-specific category.

Secondary invasion in other tissues usually disappears after a successful remission induction. Leukemic cells may remain in undetectable numbers in gonads and central nervous system (CNS). These sites are shielded from infiltration by cytostatics, this shielding however is far from absolute. Ovarian leukemia is extremely rare, testicular leukemia is relatively rare. Prophylactic measures (radiotherapy, biopsies) are therefore not warranted. In case of testicular leukemia bilateral biopsies, greater than 2000 Rad irradiation and a reinduction treatment are advised. CNS-leukemia-prophylaxis and treatment should be effective, i.e. complete eradication is the goal, but treatment-strategies should aim at minimizing lasting CNS-damage. The type of treatment given should be tailored to the patient: in non high risk ALL prophylaxis without irradiation is feasible, in T-cell-leukemia and NHR-ALL with initial CNS-leukemia a plea is made for craniospinal irradiation in the prophylaxis scheme.

The morphological classification of acute lymphoblastic leukemia versus acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia is more important than the differentiation in lymphoblastic types. Immunological characterisation as a B-cell leukemia seems to hold a poor prognosis. Cell replication rate, chromosomal studies and HLA typing are of growing importance but should not influence the choice of therapy at this moment.

The three dogs that died with myelogenous leukemia had micromegakaryocytes and megakaryoblasts in the peripheral blood during the preleukemic phase when myeloblasts were not observed in the peripheral blood or in increased numbers in the bone marrow. In this study we have examined the megakaryocytes during the preleukemic period by a combination of light, transmission, and scanning electron microscopy. Morphologic abnormalities seen by light microscopy included mononucleated and binucleated forms, many with cytoplasmic blebs. The small mononuclear forms in the bone marrow tended to form clusters. Ultrastructural features included a paucity of both specific alpha granules and dense granules. The micromegakaryocytes showed dysgenesis of the demarcation membrane system. This membrane system appeared disorganized with a few dilated round, oval, or rarely, elongated vesicles and showed no evidence of platelet formation. The cells also had a paucity of endoplasmic reticulum, few mitochrondria, and sparse glycogen accumulations. The scarcity of cytoplasmic organelles gave a pale immature appearance to the cytoplasm. By scanning electron microscopy, the sponge-like surface of large mature megakaryocytes from unirradiated marrow contrasted with the characteristically smooth, topographically featureless surfaces of the micromegakaryocytes from preleukemic dogs.",,,,,,,,,

Four polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were tested at constant dosage levels with 4 concentrations of S20 for ability to induce forward mutations at the thymidine kinase (TK) locus. With all 4 hydrocarbons, increasing S20 concentration resulted in a significant (p less than 0.001) decrease in mutation frequency and corresponding increase in survival. In the absence of S20, no significant mutation induction was observed. Within 5 min after the addition of S20 to a reaction mixture containing [3H]benzo[a]pyrene [B(a)P] (3 micrograms/ml) and appropriate cofactors, 70% of the B(a)P was metabolized with a high S20 concentration, whereas only 14% was metabolized with a low S20 concentration. In the absence of S20, the cells did not metabolize B(a)P. Incubation of B(a)P with a low concentration of S20 in the presence of calf thymus DNA (1.5 mg/ml) resulted in twice as much covalently bound B(a)P per mg DNA (33 pmoles/mg) as incubation with a high concentration of S20 (15 pmoles/mg). The amount of the major B(a)P-DNA adduct, (+/-)-7 beta,8 alpha-dihydroxy-9 alpha, 10 alpha-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene-deoxyguanosine, per mg DNA was 5 times greater with low S20 concentration than with high (11.6 pmoles/mg and 2.1 pmoles/mg, respectively). These results suggest that the decrease in mutation frequency with high S20 concentrations results from the rapid oxidation of the hydrocarbon which reduces the opportunity for mutagenic derivatives that are formed from B(a)P to interact with DNA and induce mutation.",,,,,,,,,

The ratio of the drug metabolite to the endogenous nucleotide (araCTP/dCTP) may, therefore, be important in determining the effectiveness of ara-C therapy. This ratio may also play a role in drug resistance. Previously published methods have focused on either araCTP or dCTP, along with metabolites and analogues of one of these compounds.

Limulus sera fail to agglutinate neuraminidase-treated cells but Androctonus sera react with untreated and neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes at the same degree. Sialyl-lactose is the best inhibitor for Androctonus sera, followed by N-acetylneuraminic and N-glycolylneuraminic acids, glucuronic and galacturonic acids, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine. The amounts of inhibitor required depend upon the particular cell and enzyme treatment: agglutination of neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes by Androctonus is inhibited by lower concentrations of the same compounds that inhibit untreated erythrocytes agglutination.

In circumstances the rapidly exchanging pool was a reflection of the circulating pool, suggesting that it is an extravascular, protein-bound pool of methotrexate.

Tumor associated inhibitory activity (TAIA) and simultaneously present humoral stimulatory activity (HSA) in this disease may be modulated by timed sequential chemotherapy to increase tumor growth at a predictable time and make it more sensitive to accurately administered drug. Our in vivo studies of timed sequential chemotherapy in human leukemia demonstrate than an increase in tumor labeling index (LI) temporally coincides with the detection of HSA following drug administration. Maximal HSA occurs at a predictable time following initial administration of the aplasia-producing drug and is coincident with an increased LI of recovering normal marrow granulocytic elements and marrow tumor cells.

Friend cells induced to differentiate by DMSO treatment showed a similar distribution of radioactivity, but with a 60% reduction in the overall level of poly(ADP-ribosylation) under identical labeling conditions. When isolated nuclei were pulse labeled with 0.6 microM [32P]NAD, radioactive peaks were not restricted mainly at the positions of core histones but widely dispersed in the area from 10 to 50 kDa with another peak at 170 kDa. Increase of NAD concentration resulted in the overall shift of peaks to higher molecular weight positions. When pulse-labeled nuclei or permeable cells were chased with 1 mM NAD, radioactive peaks migrated to positions of very high molecular weight (greater than Mr = 180 000). Remarkable suppression of poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis was observed when DMSO, hexamethylene bisacetamide, butyric acid, or hemin were used as the inducers.",,,,,,,,,

Permanent changes are revealed by reductive tritiation after oxidation with NaIO4 or galactose oxidase. In differentiated cells one glycoprotein fraction (Mr 150 000) could not be labeled by any of these methods, although it does contain neuraminic acid.

Sixty-two out of 160 serologically studied sheep showed in their sera antibodies against the virus of bovine leukosis as established by means of the agglutination immunodiffusion test. The leukosis virus was obtained from lymphocyte cultures isolated from infected sheep. It was used in the production of an antigen. A specific precipitation line was produced in the interaction between the sheep leukotic antigen and the bovine leukotic serum in the agglutination immunodiffusion test. Such data spoke of the antigenic similarity between the virus isolated from leukotic sheep and the virus isolated from leukotic cattle.

Our investigations with a large patient collective have shown that systemic forms of the disease occur more often than is generally supposed. In particular the incidence of bone marrow manifestations deserve more attention. The inflammatory-granulomatous findings in the bone marrow suggest an immunoactive component in the pathogenesis of this disease. The bone lesions that occur in about 50% of patients are probably the result of the common endosteal site of the mastocytosis granuloma. These lesions can be generalized (osteoporosis-osteosclerosis) or localized (osteolytic-osteosclerotic foci).

Mutagenic responses to benzo[alpha]pyrene, 3-methylcholanthrene, N-nitrosodiethylamine, and N-nitrosodipropylamine first increased, then plateaued within the range of mutagen concentrations tested, while consistent dose-dependent increases in mutant frequencies were observed following 2-aminoanthracene, 2-aminofluorene, or N-nitrosodimethylamine treatments. The relatively flat portions of the mutant frequency curves for benzo[alpha]pyrene and 3-methylcholanthrene coincided with maximum chemical solubility as obvious from visible or microscopically detectable precipitate. These hamster cells readily facilitated the metabolism of 1,2-benzanthracene to a detectable mutagen and were especially competent in the activation of the two aromatic amines. Thus, cultured hamster hepatocytes can activate a variety of chemical carcinogens including polycyclic hydrocarbons to mutagens in a whole cell-mediated in vitro assay using L5178Y/TK+/- cells as the target organism.",,,,,,,,,

In the first mitoses after 100 R gamma-irradiations, it was found that M10 cells were highly radiosensitive in terms of chromosomal aberrations accompanying longer mitotic delay (3 h); the frequencies of both chromatid-type and chromosome-type aberrations were, respectively, about 7 and 4 times higher than that of wild-type L5178Y cells. Furthermore, chromatid exchanges, particularly triradials, isochromatid breaks with sister union, and chromatid gaps and breaks were markedly enhanced at G1 phase of M10 cells. In contrast, the chromosomal radiosensitivity of Q31 cells after 100 R irradiation was similar to that of L5178Y cells. On the other hand, spontaneous aberration frequencies (overall breaks per cell) of M10 and Q31 cells were, respectively, 5.1 and 2.2 times higher than that of wild-type L5178Y cells.

Recently, we and others have shown that AT cells do not show the same decrease in DNA synthesis as normal cells following gamma-irradiation. They may also have a defect in DNA repair following gamma-irradiation. Some of our patients show the presence of one or more cytogenetically abnormal clones involving chromosome 14 in their circulating lymphocytes; these are actively proliferating, in the absence of any clinically diagnosed malignancy, and can exist for several years. A variety of subclones also appear at different times, pointing to an instability in the major clone. Lymphocytic leukaemia arising in such clones in AT patients has been described by others. The defective response of AT cells to some types of damage to DNA may increase the probability of translocations of chromosomal segments to other sites, resulting in the observed chromosomal rearrangements. Furthermore, in vivo, cells with such rearrangements may develop into clones before a malignant change is seen, rather than being a secondary feature of lesser importance.",,,,,,,,,

While reserpine synergistically increased the life span at the dose of 2.5 mg/kg in combination with these antitumor agents, the mice given reserpine showed considerable reduction of food intake and hypothermia. Iproniazid reduced all these effects of reserpine, while imipramine slightly potentiated hypothermia among these effects of reserpine. Starvation scarcely influenced the effect of the antitumor agents. On the other hand, reserpine also enhanced the antiproliferating effect of CAP-2 against L1210 cells in vitro. Iproniazid did not influence the combined antiproliferating effect of these agents in vitro. These results indicate that iproniazid reduced the antileukemic combination effect of reserpine with antitumor agents through an antireserpic effect such as inhibition of hypothermia. Therefore, it seems likely that the antileukemic combination effect of reserpine is closely related to the marked hypothermia, and only partially related to the direct effect on L1210 cells.",,,,,,,,,

Separation of BPA from Ep activity in patients sera was also attempted by Sephadex G-100 but this was unsuccessful due to the presence of inhibitors to burst formation.

A significantly increased risk for surface, chlorinated water use was noted for rectal cancer. No risk could be demonstrated for colon cancer. The risk noted for bladder cancer by other investigators is not substantiated. Brain cancer risk appears to be associated with chlorinated groundwater, but this may be industrial confounding. Breast cancer demonstrated a slight, but significant, risk associated with surface chlorinated water. This risk, however, might be due to confounding of rural life style, early childbearing and large families with nonchlorinated water found in these settings. Chlorination risk for kidney cancer was not significant. No risk was observed in association with surface water for other cancers of the gastrointestinal or urinary tract.

Randomized studies have tended to yield positive results concerning treatment differences when there were prior suggestions of activity from nonrandomized studies.

AMP-PNP and the other imidotriphosphates have little effect on purified HeLa cell RNA polymerase II initiation and elongation of transcription.

The normal splenic lymphocytes (NSL) showed a biphasic profile of electrophoretic mobility (EPM) as a function of the concentration of Con A, under capping conditions. The mean EPM of NSL increased at low concentrations of the lectin and was reduced below that of untreated cells at higher (greater than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml) concentrations of the lectin. The leukemic cells (LSL) also showed enhancement in EPM at low concentrations of Con A. At high concentrations of the same, however, the mean EPM of LSL was the same as that of untreated cells. In the case of NSL the reduction in EPM at high concentration of Con A is known to be brought about by post-redistributional binding of excess lectin to new receptor sites which emerge after capping of the first type of receptors. Similar investigations of the electrokinetic characteristics of Con A-receptor interaction on leukemic cells revealed that only a single type of receptor was present on LSL. These receptors were inducible to redistribution at low concentrations of Con A. High concentrations of the lectin, however, inhibited the redistribution of the receptors to Con A on LSL. This was confirmed when LSL treated with high concentrations of Con A were relieved from this inhibition by moderate concentrations of alpha-methyl glucoside, which dissociates cell bound Con A. Very low or very high concentrations of alpha-MG were ineffective. The receptors to Con A on LSL were thus behaviorally distinguishable from those on NSL. These data clearly demonstrate that the malignant transformation in AKR mice is also associated with alterations in the properties of receptors to a multivalent ligand Con A.",,,,,,,,,

Since farmers often serve in the role of mechanic, carpenter, welder, pesticide applicator, and veterinarian, they may be exposed to many potentially hazardous substances. The types and levels of exposures have been discussed by others earlier in the program. The evidence is strongest for the association between farming and risk of leukemia. However, the specific leukemogenic agent or agents have yet to be identified. Leukemia excesses among poultrymen and dairy farmers suggest involvement of zoonotic viruses, while associations with crop production is more indicative of pesticide usage. The associations regarding other cancers (i.e., Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, soft-tissue sarcoma, and cancers of the stomach, brain, and prostate) are even less clear. However, the Swedish reports of high risk of soft-tissue sarcomas and lymphomas among persons exposed to herbicides is particularly disconcerting and underscores the urgent need for similar epidemiologic studies in the U.S. Several case-control interview studies are underway that should help clarify the role of agricultural factors in the origin of various cancers. NCI is sponsoring studies of leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma among men from Minnesota and Iowa. Detailed information on farm practices and pesticide usage is being gathered. A study of soft-tissue sarcoma, Hodgkin's disease, and non-hodgkin's lymphoma also has just been initiated. This investigation is located in Kansas, a major wheat producing area. A wheat producing area was selected because herbicides are more heavily used on this crop than insecticides. The major objective of this project is to evaluate the role of herbicides in the origin of these cancers. A case-control study of brain cancer has also recently been initiated. Although this study focuses on contact with petrochemicals, a complete work history will be obtained and would note any farm experience. These data may help clarify the reported association between brain cancer and farming.",,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, there was a negative reaction with corresponding extracts from normal lymph nodes for 11 animals. 4 of 10 hematologically normal cows also showed a positive reaction against tumour cell membrane extracts. One of these, however, thereafter developed antibodies against BLV glycoprotein gp 51. Using tumour cell membrane preparations as antigen, the 4 cows with PL tested also exhibited a positive reaction, whereas none of 3 hematologically normal cows showed any reactivity.

Interpretational difficulties occur quite frequently, especially in acute leukaemias. Subjective morphological cell-type characterization--which is acquired only after many years of experience--is rather unsatisfactory in the long run. Therefore in order to obtain uniform results in all haematological areas, new methods are needed. In principle, immunological cell-type characterization represents an alternative method. By applying requisite antibodies practically any cell component can be demonstrated and quantitated. Up to recently the major obstacle to a more rapid development of immunological cell typing was the lack of specific antisera, but with the introduction of hybridoma technology it became possible to obtain monoclonal antibodies and thus, markedly improve immunological cell typing virtually overnight. We have, therefore, used this new technology for the production of monoclonal antibodies to human leucocyte antigens. This paper describes six of the cell-type specific monoclonal antibodies obtained, their suitability for diagnostic purposes and the classification of human leukaemias. With the help of these antibodies the majority of human leukaemias can now be typed. Without claiming completeness and in full awareness of the fact that a number of problems remain to be solved, we nevertheless believe that the presented data point to the possibilities opened up by this technology for leukaemia diagnosis in the future.",Leukamiediagnostik mit monoklonalen Antikorpern.,,,,,,,,

In one of five patients dying from metastatic cancer, spread to the heart is found. The incidence of metastatic involvement of the heart depends on the type of cancer, malignant melanoma and leukemia being the most frequent and metastases of carcinoma less so. The primary carcinomas metastasizing to the heart are most often situated near it, which may indicate that lymphatic channels are infiltrated in a retrograde manner from metastatic deposits in mediastinal lymph nodes. The fact that metastasis of primary carcinoma in the vicinity of the heart lodge predominantly in the epicardium supports this concept. On the other hand, it appears easier to explain the frequency and distribution of cardiac metastases from carcinomas of the abdominal cavity by assuming that they are bloodborne. Hence it is assumed that the routes of disseminated of tumor cells to the heart are through lymphatic as well as blood vessels.",Herzmetastasen maligner Tumoren. Eine Autopsie-Studie.,,,,,,,,

Mutants with the phenotype deficient in hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) were selected in 6-thoiguanine(TG)-containing medium and isolated. Reverse mutations to the HPRT-proficient phenotype occurred both spontaneously and after treatment with ethyl nitrosourea (ENU), which suggested that the initial HAP treatment had induced point mutations at the HPRT locus. Reconstruction experiments, in which a small number of wild-type cells together with different numbers of mutant cells were seeded in HAT medium, indicated that densities up to 10(6) cells per ml can be used for the selection of revertants. Optimal expression of induced revertants was obtained two days after treatment. The dose-response relationship for induction of reverse mutations by ENU appears not to deviate from linearity. The highest revertant frequency observed was 3.3 x 10(-5) at an ENU concentration of 1 mM. The spontaneous reversion frequency per generation -- based on 3 spontaneous revertants -- was estimated to be 1.3 x 10(-9).

The end product in each case was F(ab')2-like. It contained the Ce2 regions, had intact antigen combining sites but had lost all ability to bind to the cell receptor for IgE. With mouse IgE the two principal sites of cleavage are likely to be the interdomain regions between Ce4:Ce3 and Ce3:C32 respectively. Cleavage at these sites occurs sequentially with the rate constant for the cleavage at the second site being approximately four-fold greater than that for the initial cleavage. When IgE is bound to the receptor the rates of cleavage are inhibited approximately three-fold. With rat IgE, the principal initial cleavage occurs within the intrachain disulfide loop in the Ce3 domain. Even when this disulfide bond in the digested protein is reduced, the product retains a substantial binding activity. A second cleavage occurs at a similar rate as the first and at a site analogous to that seen with mouse IgE, i.e. between the Ce3 and Ce2 domains. Notably, when bound to the receptor, the rate of cleavage at the first site is inhibited approximately three-fold but at the second site more than or equal to 40-fold. These results strongly implicate thd Ce3 domain as the principal site of interaction between rodent IgE and its receptor.",,,,,,,,,

These patients were compared to the remainder of the group and found to be comparable in respect to known prognostic factors at diagnosis (P greater than 0.05).

This effect did not persist in any other group of patients examined. When subjected to multivariate analysis the IVU did not significantly influence relapse or survival in these patients.

Efficacy of transfusions was evaluated from data supplied by hospitals administering them. Buffy coats separated from ACD blood contained a mean of 4.9 X 10(8) granulocytes. Fifty-seven patients received a course consisting of a mean of 3.8 transfusions. Of these, 27 received a mean of 17.5 units per transfusion and had a survival rate of 44.4%, which was not significantly different from the 50.0% found in 30 who received a mean of 11.1 units per transfusion. No significant difference in survival rate was found between 31 patients with acute leukemia and 26 with other disorders or 38 patients with positive and 19 with negative cultures. Finally, no significant difference in survival rate was noted between patients who received a course of greater than or equal to four transfusions or less than or equal to three transfusions in any of the above groups. Survival rates were less than those generally reported following similar courses of leukapheresis units. Buffy coat transfusions consisting of a mean of approximately 17.5 units as produced during this study have therefore been shown to be not generally beneficial. The increased survival seen in some studies utilizing leukapheresis products may relate in part to the larger number of granulocytes they contained. Greater benefit from buffy coat transfusions might result if the number of granulocytes infused were increased. Evaluation of possible efficacy associated with transfusions of increased numbers of buffy coat units further enriched with granulocytes may be justified when leukapheresis donors are not available.",,,,,,,,,

Different complements of radiolabelled surface glycoproteins were found in extracts from cells with different lectin binding characteristics. Additional confirmation of heterogeneity was obtained by analyses of hexose and sialic acid contents of the extracts and various lectin-adherent fractions. The fact that CLL cells from different patients may carry different cell surface oligosaccharides provides the possibility that clinical variability in this disorder may relate in part to this molecular heterogeneity. The data further indicate that different lectins may bind to different saccharide structures at CLL cell surfaces. CLL cells represent excellent source material for isolation and purification of specific lectin receptor molecules.,,,,,,,,,

Adenine at 100 microM affected ribonucleotide levels by expanding the ATP pool and causing slight decreases in the GTP, UTP and CTP pools, while dThd alone or in combination with adenine had no effect on ribonucleotide pools. dThd at 10 microM caused a more than 2-fold increase in the dTTP pool and a marked but transient decrease in the dCTP pool with lesser effects on purine deoxyribonucleotide levels. Adenine at 100 microM produced only slight, transient increase in the dATP pool. Exposure of cells to dThd plus adenine compared with individual agents produced more than additive increases in dTTP and dATP pools. The decrease in the dCTP level was more with combined agents than with dThd alone. The results showed that an alteration in adenine nucleotide pools modifies the activity of dThd through greater enhancement of dTTP levels leading to a greater suppression of the dCTP pool.",,,,,,,,,

Fractionation of bone marrow cells suspended in bovine serum albumin (BSA) by equilibrium density centrifugation or by velocity sedimentation at 1 g unit gravity using discontinuous density gradient of Ficoll was applied. The leukemogenic potential of the separated bone marrow fractions was tested by evaluating leukemia development following their transfer into appropriate recipients. No enrichment of D-RadLV-induced preleukemic cells was found in any of the four bone marrow fractions obtained following separation on BSA gradient. Separation of D-RadLV-induced preleukemic cells was afforded by using the Ficoll gradients.

The resulting 4-(p-carboxyphenyl)-1-methoxy-1-butenes were brominated at pH 7-8 to afford the 2-bromo-4-(p-carboxyphenyl)butyraldehydes. Condensation with 2,4,5,6-tetraminopyrimidine and subsequent in situ oxidation of the resulting dihydropteridines yielded crystalline 10-alkyl-10-deaza-4-amino-4-deoxypteroic acids. The pteroic acids were coupled with diethyl glutamate via the mixed anhydride method, followed by saponification at room temperature, to give the target 10-deazaminopterins. The 10-alkyl compounds were approximately equipotent to 10-deazaminopterin as growth inhibitors of folate-dependent bacteria. Their abilities to inhibit Lactobacillus casei and L1210 derived dihydrofolate reductases were also similar. Transport properties in vitro were suggestive of an improved therapeutic index for the 10-alkyl analogues. Against L1210 in mice, the percent increase in life span at the LD10 dosage was +151% (methotrexate), +178% (10-deazaminopterin), +235% (10-methyl analogue), and +211% (10-ethyl analogue). 10,10-Dimethyl-10-deazaminopterin was less effective at an equimolar dosage, but the ILS at the maximum dose tested (72 mg/kg) was +135%.

In several attempts, virus from single foci of MSV initially contained only MSV(FeLV) but on passage each showed a minimal persistence of B-MuX. To eliminate the B-MuX component, MSV(B-MuX) was subjected to two consecutive transspecies rescues. The first was performed by co-cultivation of MSV(B-MuX)-producing quail cells with mouse 3T3FL cells, which are completely non-permissive for B-MuX, and pure ecotropic Friend Eveline strain of murine leukaemia virus (F-MuLV); this resulted in apparently pure MSV(F-MuLV). Second, these MSV(F-MuLV)-infected 3T3FL cells were co-cultivated with FeLV and cat cells, which are completely non-permissive for F-MuLV; this resulted in the generation of MSV(FeLV). Passage of this apparently pure FeLV pseudotype in cells permissive only for the replication of B-MuX surprisingly revealed residual murine xenotropic virus. It appears that pressure for survival resulted in genomic masking of B-MuX by heterologous virus envelopes. This phenomenon, which also occurs extensively in nature, implies that if absolute oncovirus genetic purity is required, even extensive attempts at purification may be inadequate.",,,,,,,,,

Over half (53.1 per cent) of the second PMTs occurred within five years of the first PMTs. First PMTs were most common in the hematopoietic system and the cervix; second PMTs were most common in the lungs and the hematopoietic system. Second PMTs were less well differentiated than index PMTs. Forty-four deaths had not been directly tumor-related. Nineteen patients with metachronous MPMT lived more than ten years. Of 23 patients with one pulmonary PMT, 22 died within two years. Concomitant findings of pulmonary artery embolism, gallstone(s), thyroid or prostatic hyperplasia, and benign tumor were common in these patients.

The analogue was prepared by attachment of lysine in place of the glutamate side chain of methotrexate and conjugation to fluorescein isothiocyanate via the epsilon-amino group of lysine. Spectrophotometric enzyme inhibition assays showed PT430 to be about one-tenth as potent as methotrexate against either Lactobacillus casei or L1210 mouse leukemia enzyme; competitive radioligand binding assays using tritiated methotrexate gave similar results. In assays of L1210 cell proliferation in culture, on the other hand, PT430 was 100-fold less toxic than methotrexate. In dilute solution, the fluorescence intensity of PT430 was 5-fold lower than that of equimolar fluorescein and diminished with decreasing pH. On complexation with dihydrofolate reductase, however, fluorescence intensity was enhanced 3- to 5-fold depending on the pH. Measurement of fluorescence increase with added ligand provided data for the determination of the stoichiometric ratio, dissociation constant, and extent of fluorescence enhancement. Specificity of PT430 for methotrexate binding sites was indicated by the observation of decreased fluorescence uptake in PT430-treated L1210 cells in the presence of methotrexate. Fluorescence uptake occurred faster, and to a greater extent, in methotrexate-resistant dihydrofolate reductase overproducing L1210/R6 cells than in the methotrexate-sensitive parent line.

Glycosylation inhibition and peptide mapping analyses indicate that the smaller size of the mutant glycoprotein is caused by a shortening of its polypeptide chain rather than by reduced glycosylation. Unlike gPr90env of wild type R-MuLV which contains Asn-linked high mannose oligosaccharides and is processed by partial proteolysis and by further glycosylation in the Golgi apparatus to produce gp70 plus p15E, the mutant glycoprotein can reach the cell surface without proteolysis.

The effects of COTC on macromolecular syntheses, mitosis and membrane functions may be attributed to the interaction with the sulfhydryl group of various enzymes. Although COTC is multifunctional drug, the inhibition of DNA polymerase alpha and a certain mitotic process seems to be related to the lethal action.",,,,,,,,,

They differ only through the replacement of a vinyl group of chrysomycin A by methyl in chrysomycin B. The absorption spectrum of chrysomycin A is identical with that of the antitumor antibiotic toromycin (gilvocarcin V, 2064A), while that of chrysomycin B is similarly identical with the one of gilvocarcin M (2064B). The structures of these antibiotics (toromycin, the glivocarcins, and 2064A and B) have been elucidated recently. Chrysomycins A and B thus contain the same chromophores as gilvocarcins V and M, respectively; comparison of 1H and 13C NMR spectra confirms this identity. The chrysomycins differ from these other antibiotics in the C-glycosidic side-chain, which is a methylpentose in the gilvocarcins, a 3,5-dimethylpentose in the chrysomycins.

Glucocorticoid receptor sites in the leukemic hairy cells ranged from 5,710 to 11,400 sites/cell, and the mean dissociation constant (KD) between the receptor sites and [3H]dexamethasone was 0.67 +/- 0.03 X 10(-8) M.

The dietary concentrations were estimated to be maximally tolerated doses and half maximally tolerated doses. All animals that died during the study and all survivors at the end of two years were examined grossly and microscopically for the presence of tumors. The incidences of animals with tumors at a specific anatomic site in the treated groups and the controls were compared statistically. Neither phthalamide nor phthalic anhydride increased tumor incidences in rats or mice. Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate increased the incidences of liver tumors in rats and mice of both sexes, while di(2-ethylhexyl) adipate caused liver tumors in male and female mice, only. Butyl benzyl phthalate did not cause tumors in male or female mice, but the incidence of myelomonocytic leukemia in butyl benzyl phthalate-treated female rats was significantly greater than that in the controls. Chemically induced early deaths in the butyl benzyl phthalate-treated male rats precluded an evaluation of carcinogenic potential in this sex. Under the conditions of these tests, di(2-ethylhexyl) adipate was considered to be carcinogenic in both rats and mice and di(2-ethylhexyl) adipate was considered to be carcinogenic in mice. The evidence for carcinogenic effects of butyl benzyl phthalate in female rats was judged to be equivocal because of the variable nature of the incidence of myelomonocytic leukemia in Fischer 344 rats.

In vitro tritiated thymidine autoradiography and propidium iodide-DNA flow cytometry were employed for kinetic studies. Blasts disappeared from blood with a median half time of 35 hr. After VCR-Ara-c administration, a significant increase in labeling index (LI) and in the aliquot of cells with DNA content between the diploid (2n) and the tetraploid (4n) values was observed in 80% of the courses in peripheral blood blasts and in all courses in bone marrow blasts. The median grain count over the labeled nuclei was decreased, and the 4n cell percentage and the bone marrow blast mitotic index did not increase. These findings suggest that the increase in the S phase fraction of blast population is due to cell synchronization. Increase in the S phase appears to heighten the cytocidal effect of ADM.

Antifolate activity was measured by the deoxyuridine suppression assay, direct measurement of dihydrofolate reductase and morphological changes characteristic of folate deficiency. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by cell growth curves. These drugs were studied in freshly obtained human normal evaluated by cell growth curves. These drugs were studied in freshly obtained human normal bone marrow and leukemia cells as well as in three established cell lines HL-60 (human promyelocytic leukemia), CEM (human T lymphocytes), and L1210 (murine lymphoid leukemia). Purified X-methyl folate and 9-methyl folate at concentrations up to 2X10(-5) M failed to induce cell toxicity or inhibit deoxyuridine suppression of 3H-thymidine into DNA. Dihydrofolate reductase was not inhibited by 9-methyl folate but was partially inhibited by purified X-methyl folate. Crude X-methyl folate (2X10(-1) M) is a weak folate antagonist as compared to methotrexate since it requires a 1,000-fold higher concentration to inhibit cell growth and dihydrofolate reductase activity. In addition, the crude X-methyl folate contains a folate-like fraction since it will correct the abnormal deoxyuridine suppression in folate-depleted cells. None of the drugs tested were able to induce myeloid differentiation in the HL-60 cells. The data suggest that 9-methyl folate would not be active as a folate antagonist antitumor agent and that purified and crude X-methyl folate in large concentrations will inhibit folate metabolism. Additional studies are needed to remove the folate-like activity in the crude material in order to further establish the antitumor effects of the crude X-methyl folate.",,,,,,,,,

Remission was maintained with monthly 5-day courses of cytarabine and thioguanine for 4 years. Of the entire group, 57% achieved complete remission and 29% died in the first 30 days of treatment. The median remission duration was 15 months, with 20% of the complete responders predicted to remain in complete remission for 4 years. No primary central nervous system relapses have occurred. Of six variables examined by multivariate analysis, only age was predictive of remission success. Before analysis, the patients were divided into groups by age: group 1--ages 16-42 years (n = 17); group 2--ages 43-59 years (n = 25); and group 3--ages 60-73 years (n = 23). Complete remission rates were 76% in group 1, 64% in group 2, and 35% in group 3 (P = 0.002). Lower remission rates for older patients resulted from more early deaths rather than resistant disease. Age and LDH levels affected remission duration. The median complete remission duration was 48 months in group 1 and 10 months in groups 2 and 3 (P = 0.004). In group 1, 41% of patients achieving complete remission are predicted to remain in complete remission for 4 years. We concluded that this five-drug induction regimen is highly effective for induction therapy in younger adults with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia.

Because relatively little is known about the binding of adjuvants to antigens, the nature of the interaction of DDA with soluble protein and cellular antigens was investigated. Dose-dependent, stable complexes are formed between cells and the lipoidal cation of DDA. Since the interaction is independent of negatively charged sialic acid residues of the cell membrane and little DDA binds to intracellular structures, it is suggested that binding occurs primarily at the cell membrane, probably through hydrophobic interaction with lipids. The idea of membrane perturbation is supported by the leak of macromolecules (lactic dehydrogenase) from treated cells. Reaction of varying amounts of DDA with a constant amount of ovalbumin was also dose dependent. Because of a minimal effect of ionic strength on the reaction, it is concluded that ionic interaction may make a minor contribution to product formation. Complexes of DDA and antigen are articularly effective in eliciting a delayed hypersensitivity reaction, which has been postulated to be desirable for an antitumor effect.",,,,,,,,,

The nitrosourea resistant TLX5 lymphomas were cross-resistant in vitro to both cyclohexylisocyanate and chloroethylisocyanate whereas the nitrosourea resistant L1210 line showed no cross-resistance to cyclohexylisocyanate and marginal cross-resistance to chloroethylisocyanate. The results suggest that the TLX5 lymphoma, which is naturally resistant to alkylating agents of the 2-chloroethylamine type, may be sensitive to in vivo to nitrosoureas as a consequence of the intracellular release of isocyanates. This hypothesis was supported by the finding that the resistant TLX5 lymphoma showed no cross-resistance to other electrophilic agents, for example formaldehyde, monomethyltriazene or HN2. The transport of nitrosoureas into the sensitive and resistant cell lines was similar in profile and there was no difference in the concentration of non-protein thiols.",,,,,,,,,

In addition, tumor promoters have been shown to inhibit this induced differentiation, thus suggesting that the conversion of a cell into a cancer cell can be thought as an alteration in its state of differentiation. We found that actinomycin D-induced erythroid differentiation is not inhibited by the tumor promoter 12-0-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in two murine erythroleukemia cell lines. Thus we investigated the cellular distribution with respect to the cell cycle in synchronized cells cultured with TPA and actinomycin D in order to determine whether alteration of the cell cycle parameters can interfere to some extent with the process of differentiation. Cells synchronized in S phase progress through the cell cycle and differentiate when cultured with actinomycin D and TPA. On the contrary, some cells synchronized in G1 are prevented entry to S phase by the tumor promoter. Only in this cellular population was there found inhibition of intracytoplasmic hemoglobin accumulation. Therefore in the Friend leukemia cell system, the tumor promoter TPA does not inhibit DNA synthesis, but the progression of the cells through G1. In addition our results suggest that this progression through G1 and/or early S is a cellular event which is critical for the organization of the expression of globin and related genes.",,,,,,,,,

Prerequisites are subtile control of clinical effectiveness and formation of antibodies. In planned bone marrow transplantation only preparation of individual donors (not related!) with HLA-A/B match are to be used. The same is applied to already alloimmunized patients, in which case a negative lymphocytotox cross test must still be present. Patients without option to transplantation or without HLA-antibodies may receive also random preparations of individual donors or mixed preparations. AB0-minor-incompatibilities are without significance, AB0-major-incompatibilities are not permissible. The introduction of thrombocyte-specific testings is urgently to be aspired to.--Exclusively therapeutic substitution of thrombocytes, i.e. in manifest haemorrhage, is performed in a primarily not limited period of substitution, in a completely immune competent recipient with regularly low values of thrombocytes without cytoreductive therapy (example: aplastic anaemia). In these cases on account of high danger of sensitization only preparations of individual donors with HLA-A/B-match should be used. In cases of exception in thrombocytopenic, life-threatening haemorrhages on account of metabolic disturbances (immune thrombocytopenia, massive transfusions) the substitution with thrombocytic mixed concentrates is satisfied.--The substitution of thrombocytes is a common task of clinic and blood donation service, which opens new possibilities of therapy (e.g. transplantation of bone marrow).",Indikation zur prophylaktischen und therapeutischen Thrombozytensubstitution.,,,,,,,,

Acute leukaemia (3 cases) and osteomyelofibrosis (3 cases) were only observed in patients previously treated with 32 P or busulfan. Pipobroman therefore appears to be much less toxic than other alkylating agents. Its is as effective as 32 P but acts more rapidly. It seems to have little oncogenic power, but a more prolonged study is required to ascertain this point.",Traitement des polyglobulies par le pipobroman.,,,,,,,,

We originally hypothesized that age-dependent polioencephalomyelitis (ADPE) occurred as the result of immune recognition of a 'self'-determinant on the 'altered-self' antigen. In this report we used the non-ionic detergent, NP-40, to solubilize Ib cell surface antigens. Although immunization of immunocompetent C58 mice with the soluble NP-40 Ib cell extract afforded protection to lethal tumor challenge, the extract failed to induce ADPE in immunosuppressed mice. Data presented here demonstrate that Ib-TASA is not involved in the etiology of ADPE. The evidence suggests that lactic dehydrogenase virus, which is a silent virus passaged with line Ib leukemia, is the causative agent of the paralytic disease.",,,,,,,,,

Analysis of the uptake of 5-ethyl-2'-deoxyuridine and 5-propyl-2'-deoxyuridine (n-PrdU)--similar to both thymidine and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine--indicates that transport is dependent upon a functional cellular thymidine kinase. All of the aforementioned pyrimidines with the exception of n-PrdU are phosphorylated to the triphosphate and incorporated into DNA. The homologs 5-iso-propyl-2'-deoxyuridine (iso-PrdU) and 5-hexyl-2'-deoxyuridine are neither transported into the cell, phosphorylated, nor incorporated into DNA. These analogs were tested (i) for their ability to induce in the absence of dimethyl sulfoxide and (ii) to determine whether they enhance or inhibit dimethyl sulfoxide-induced differentiation of Friend erythroleukemia cells. Inhibition of erythroid differentiation appears to require the incorporation of thymidine analogs into DNA, and thus only 5-ethyl-2'-deoxyuridine and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine were effective in inhibiting dimethyl sulfoxide-induced differentiation. The observation that iso-PrdU, and to a lesser extent n-PrdU and 5-propyldeoxyuridine monophosphate, induce differentiation under conditions in which they are not detectable intracellularly is strong evidence that this class of inducer acts at the cell membrane.",,PMC369890,,,,,,,

The loss of Rh-123 uptake is irreversible and occurs prior to Trypan Blue staining. Thus, the antimetabolites, unlike freeze-thawing and detergent treatments, generally cause mitochondrial damage prior to changes in plasma membrane permeability. Since the effect of antimetabolites on Rh-123 uptake is maximal at 24 h, the Rh-123 assay may provide a rapid alternative to the clonogenic assay for monitoring the cytotoxic effects of these drugs. Our results also suggest that the inhibition or impairment of mitochondrial function may be an important step in the cytocidal and/or cytostatic action of anti-cancer drugs.",,,,,,,,,

Highly purified eosinophils were obtained by centrifugation in a Percoll density gradient. Studies were carried out on density distribution, oxygen consumption upon adherence to serum-coated Sephadex and expression of cell surface receptors for IgG and complement. In eosinophil leukaemia the density of eosinophils was abnormally low. Abnormal light density fractions of blood eosinophils were also detected in the hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES). Light density eosinophils of HES showed morphological signs of degranulation consonant with the finding of a low content of granular eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) suggesting degranulation in the circulation or abnormal granule formation in the marrow. In addition, such cells exhibited a higher oxygen consumption than eosinophils with normal density upon adherence to serum-coated Sephadex. Low density eosinophils showed a greater number of cells with Fc-IgG and complement receptors than high density cells. Likewise exudate eosinophils displayed an abnormally low density with higher than normal oxygen consumption indicating that eosinophils may be activated in the tissues. In one patient with HES, a febrile episode resulted in a disappearance of eosinophils with a normal density while abnormal low density eosinophils increased. Our findings suggest that eosinophils from some patients with eosinophilia may be 'activated' in the circulation.",,PMC1555549,,,,,,,

The concentration of ADF was calculated to 120-150 micrograms/ml in four normal sera and about half as much in three sera from leukemia patients treated with cytostatic drugs. In the presence of Ca2+ ADF shortened actin filaments into fragments, the size of which was correlated to the actin: ADF molar ratio, as judged by electron microscopy. The severing of F-actin was not necessarily followed by an increase in the quantities of monomeric actin, as determined by a DNase I inhibition assay and a sedimentation assay. The findings indicated that ADF shortens filamentous actin by breaking bonds between adjacent actin molecules thereby forming stable ADF-actin complexes, without a monomeric net release. The effect of ADF on F-actin was rapid and was reversed upon chelation of Ca2+. ADF cross-reacted immunologically and exhibited similarity in reaction mechanism with gelsolin, the Ca2+-dependent F-actin-severing protein from macrophages. This implies that the proteins are both structurally and functionally related. The physiological role of ADF may be to handle actin released at cell destruction, probably by forming ADF-G-actin 1:1 complexes thereby preventing formation of actin filaments.",,,,,,,,,

Erythroleukemia cells were examined by cell surface labeling followed by immunoprecipitation with antisera specific to CFAs and CAAs. Erythroleukemia cells expressed CFAs and CAAs on their membranes that are not reported to be expressed by the target cell of AEV. The expression of CAAs and the enhanced expression of CFAs by erythroleukemia cells may be due to limited cellular differentiation, alterations in regulatory controls of genes coding for CFAs and CAAs, or increased levels of production of previously undetected CFAs and CAAs following AEV transformation. Control and induced erythroleukemia cells expressed CFAs and CAAs that differed both quantitatively and qualitatively from normal erythroid cells.

Immunochemical staining of electrophoretically separated chromosomal proteins transferred to nitrocellulose sheets revealed numerous antigens in chromatin preparations from several human tumors, placenta, and normal kidney. While immunoabsorption of the antisera with placenta chromatin removed some of the immunochemical staining, many of the electrophoretically separated antigens resisted repeated immunoabsorptions. However, further comparisons revealed that only one major protein antigen (band at an approximate molecular weight of 81,000) was represented in all the assayed human tumors while being absent from human placenta or kidney. Fractionation of HeLa cells into three cytoplasmic and several nuclear fractions showed that almost all the antigens recognized by antisera to dehistonized chromatin were nuclear.

The major progress which has been achieved will continue, provided that factors which threaten the clinical cancer researcher are identified and corrected. These problems (with proposed solutions) include: the increasing number of clinical oncologists, particularly medical oncologists; the relationship of the practicing clinical oncologist to cancer centers; the relative attractions of clinical practice, on the one side, and basic science on the other, as compared to clinical cancer research; the lack of recognition that clinical cancer research provides an opportunity for high achievement and challenge, and originality; the threat of curtailment of research funding; jurisdictional and other conflicts between scientific and clinical disciplines; the emerging ""establishment generation"" of clinical oncology; and the bureaucratic and regulatory ambience that has increasingly enveloped the clinical cancer researcher. That opportunities for originality continue was illustrated by a new therapeutic surgery known as neoadjuvant or anterior chemotherapy. In this strategy, systemic treatment is employed prior to surgery and/or radiotherapy for patients with head and neck cancer has increased operability (""upstaged"" the patient) and on preliminary analysis would appear to be increasing disease-free survival. A clinical trial in osteogenic sarcoma involving initial chemotherapy has indicated that such treatment not only provides substantial regression of the primary in the majority of patients but also results in a substantially improved disease-free and overall survival, particularly in patients with locally responsive disease.",,,,,,,,,

All S. epidermidis infections before 1977 originated from skin sites; since 1977 the respiratory tract and alimentary canal have become the predominant sites of origin. Predisposing factors for infection were profound granulocytopenia (less than 100/microL), a diagnosis of acute leukemia, and an oral nonabsorbable antibiotic regimen lacking vancomycin. The increased incidence of infection was not related to a nosocomial source or the more frequent use of long-term indwelling catheters. Methicillin resistance among isolates was common (40%). Intravenous vancomycin therapy provided the best therapeutic results.

These patients have an unusual form of leukemia with distinct clinical and morphological features. With improved therapy many cancer patients have experienced prolonged survival and cure. Some of these patients will develop ANLL as a consequence of their previous therapy, or for reasons associated with their primary tumor (host factors or common oncogenic virus). It is also possible that a fraction of these patients will develop the usual form of leukemia (de novo ANLL) that is unrelated to the underlying malignancy. Indeed, a statistical analysis assuming ANLL incidence rates to be unaffected by breast cancer or cancer therapy, predicted the occurrence of three new ANLL cases with a history of breast cancer in Wisconsin per year. Eleven patients with ANLL and a history of breast cancer were seen at the University Hospitals over a ten-year span (1969-1978). Clinical, morphological and cytogenetic features were examined and it was found that five of the eleven patients had features atypical for therapy related leukemia. Indeed, two of the patients had not received breast cancer therapy. The distinction between de novo and therapy related leukemia is important because remission and prolonged survival are more likely in the former and morbidity and mortality associated with therapy are more likely in the latter. We suggest that if features of de novo leukemia exist, despite previous therapy for underlying malignancy, intensive antileukemia therapy should be considered.",,,,,,,,,

Patients with systemic candidiasis generally had prolonged severe neutropenia, fever refractory to antibiotics, and evidence of mucosal colonization by fungi. At autopsy, Candida was always widely disseminated. Patients with aspergillosis generally had neutropenia, fever, and pulmonary infiltrates at the time of admission to the hospital and, at autopsy, their infections were primarily confined to the lungs. Patients infected with both Candida and Aspergillus had clinical and pathologic findings that were a combination of the features of each type of infection. A diagnosis of invasive fungal infection was established before death in only nine of the patients, all of whom had systemic candidiasis. Four of these patients were successfully treated and survived their hospitalization. The reasons for frequently misdiagnosing and unsuccessfully treating systemic mycosis in patients with acute leukemia are examined, and suggestions are made for improved management of patients at high risk for these infections. These suggestions are based upon recognition of the clinical settings in which fungal infections occur, the aggressive use of invasive diagnostic procedures, and the early empiric use of amphotericin B.",,,,,,,,,

These cellular homologues have been highly conserved during evolution and are found in human DNA. The expression of at least one c-onc under the control of a viral promoter results in transformation of cells in a manner resembling that displayed by the v-onc counterpart; the inappropriate expression of c-onc in the absence of viral influences could likewise result in the malignant state. This proposal would be strongly supported by the presence of c-onc RNAs in a variety of human tumours were they not also demonstrable in normal tissues. The role of these RNAs in the oncogenic process remains unclear. Here we report that RNA homologous to the oncogene (v-abl) of Abelson murine leukaemia virus (A-MLV) is expressed in a unique human leukaemia in a fashion different from that of other human tissues and tumours. In addition, DNA from this tumour transforms NIH-3T3 cells at a high efficiency in a transfection assay. The transfected sequences are not related to the v-abl gene, but the NIH-3T3 transformants manufacture a transforming growth factor which behaves similarly to factors produced by A-MLV-transformed NIH-3T3 fibroblasts.",,,,,,,,,

The synergistic toxicity of the C-2 and misonidazole (2.5 mM) combination increased with increasing C-2 concentration, and at 0.01 survival the dose-modification ratio of C-2 alone versus the combination was approximately 1.5. Similarly, when the concentration of C-2 was held constant (10 microM) and the concentration of misonidazole varied from 2.5 to 25 mM, a cell kill greater than the additive toxicities of misonidazole and C-2 alone was observed. The kinetic patterns of formation and removal of DNA interstrand cross-links following a 2-hr treatment of 10 microM C-2 or 10 microM C-2 plus 2.5 mM misonidazole were similar.

According to the clinical manifestations lymphomas can be divided into two major categories. In one type the thymus appears to be the primary site for lymphoma development. The second type is dominated by the generalized enlargement of spleen and lymph nodes. Individual lymphomas differ in the cell surface expression of Thy 1.2, MCSA (designated operationally as the M-MuL V-determined cell surface antigen) and viral p30 antigens. In addition, spleen and thymus of the same leukemic animal often differ antigenically. The karyotype of cells from enlarged organs is diploid or shows trisomy of chromosome 15. Lymphomas developing in Balb/Mo mice are thus heterogeneous with regard to clinical manifestations, cell surface antigens and karyotype and, in this respect, do not differ from lymphomas arising after the inoculation of exogenous M-MuL V. Amplification of the M-MuL V genome in young Balb/Mo mice is not accompanied by the appearance of MCSA on thymus cells. Still, 32% of lymphomas are MCSA positive. The results suggest that MCSA is related to a virus activated in a minority of Balb/Mo mice during the late phase of leukemogenesis.",,,,,,,,,

Colonies containing small and transformed lymphocytes appeared after 5-7 days incubation. The plating efficiency of CLL colonies was 0.15 +/- 0.08% (x +/- S.D.), similar to that of other colony-forming systems. The majority of CLL colony-forming cells were in S phase (50 +/- 4% x +/- S.E.) as determined by thymidine suicide and the fraction of colony-forming cells in S phase was inversely related to the WBC. Cells harvested from CLL colonies lacked surface markers for T lymphocytes and stained positively for monoclonal surface and/or cytoplasmic immunoglobulin light chains. A 1-h incubation was used to study the in vitro response of CLL colony-forming cells to adriamycin and melphalan.

Markedly elevated levels (greater than 1,000 pg/ml) were only found in this group. Since immunoreactive CT dropped to normal or only slightly elevated levels in remission and increased again before or during relapse, serum CT levels seem to reflect the activity of the disease. However, in patients with chronic leukemia, Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a lower incidence and only slightly elevated serum levels were found. In addition, the molecular weight of the proteohormone in serum specimen and cell extracts was investigated by gel chromatography. Besides physiological CT, different high-molecular weight forms of the hormone could be demonstrated in serum and in cell extracts. Extracts of leukemic cells revealed higher molecular forms only.

Both effects were dose-related and beyond question, and the disabilities probably included the effects of incomplete repair of bone marrow damage. Therefore, in addition to differences between high and low dose being largely obliterated, there was probably distortion of cancer effects. The two opposing forces are clearly the reason why the change from the high mortality rates of 1945-6 to the low rates of the 1950s was not accompanied by a change from a position to a negative association with dose, and imperviousness to the residual disabilities is probably the reason why sudden deaths of previously healthy individuals (exemplified by suicides) were an exception to this rule. Finally, impairment of bone marrow function probably accounts for the early epidemic of myeloid leukaemia; the apparent absence of other cancers at this time, and the relatively high dose-related death rates for blood diseases other than leukaemia.",,PMC1052900,,,,,,,

We found two types of serotonin binding protein in RBL cells. These proteins differed from one another in molecular weight and eluted in separate peaks from sephadex G-200 columns. Peak I protein (KD = 1.9 X 10(-6) M) was a glycoprotein that bound to concanavalin A (Con A); Peak II protein (KD1 = 4.5 X 10(-8) M; KD2 = 3.9 X 10(-6) M) did not bind to Con A. Moreover, binding of [3H]serotonin to protein of peak I was sensitive to inhibition by reserpine, while binding of [3H]serotonin to protein of peak II resisted inhibition by that drug. Other differences between the two types of binding protein were found, the most significant of which was the far more vigorous conditions of homogenization required to extract peak I than peak II protein. Neither peak I nor peak II protein resembled the serotonin binding protein (SBP) that is found in serotonergic neurons of the brain and gut. Electron microscope radioautographic analysis of the intracellular distribution of [3H]serotonin taken up in vitro by RBL cells or in vivo by murine mast cells indicated that essentially all of the labeled amine was located in cytoplasmic granules. No evidence for a pool in the cytosol was found and all granules were capable of becoming labeled. The presence of two types of intracellular serotonin binding proteins in these cells may indicate that there are two intracellular storage compartments for the amine. Both may be intragranular, but peak I protein may be associated with the granular membrane while peak II protein may be more free within the granular core. Different storage proteins may help to explain the differential release of amines from mast cell granules.",,PMC2112151,,,,,,,

The in vivo effects of the tested compounds did not correlate either with the propensity of the drugs to undergo oxidative N-demethylation and hydrolysis to diazonium cations or with in vitro cytotoxicity for TLX5 lymphoma cells. The para isomer did not reduce the number and viability of peritoneal TLX5 lymphoma cells after in vivo and in vitro treatment, whereas a dose-dependent reduction that can even result in the absence of clonogenic tumor cells occurred in the brains of the treated animals. These data indicate that the increased survival time of the tumor-bearing mice treated with the para isomer should not be ascribed to cytotoxic effects of the drug and might be attributed to inhibition of tumor cell dissemination in various organs of the host, as already observed for solid metastasizing tumors in mice.",,,,,,,,,

A specific, significant association between a (8; 21) karyotype and M2-ANLL was confirmed; four of ten patients with M2-ANLL showed this translocation. The more mature morphology of M2-ANLL was associated with a longer survival irrespective of karyotype, ethnic group, and age. The specificity of t(15; 17) in M3-ANLL and nonrandom monosomy 7 in preleukemic children was confirmed. Patients, particularly adults, with normal karyotypes tended to survive longer than those with abnormal karyotypes.

An extensive statistical analysis has been carried out on a large number of pretreatment and treatment characteristics to identify factors related to CR and remission duration. Multivariate regression techniques yielded as favorable characteristics associated with CR, in order of importance: young age at diagnosis, the presence of Auer rods at diagnosis, and treatment with Pseudomonas vaccine.

Aneuploidy of the primary malignant stem line was detected in 54 cases (24%): 51 hyperdiploid and 3 hypodiploid. A second stem line with approximately twice the DNA content of the primary stem line was recognized by FCM in 28 cases (23 ALL, 5 ANLL) and may be an important source of leukemia cell heterogeneity. The degree of DNA content abnormality detected by FCM was highly correlated (r = 0.98) with the number of whole chromosome gains or losses in the leukemia karyotype. Aneuploidy detectable by FCM was more frequent in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (52 of 173, 30.1%) than in acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (2 of 52, 3.8%) (p less than 0.001). In the ALL group, aneuploidy was significantly correlated with the cell surface expression of common ALL antigen: 46 of 127 antigen-positive cases were aneuploid compared to 6 of 46 antigen-negative cases (p less than 0.003). Only 2 of 21 cases of T-cell ALL without common ALL antigen had detectable aneuploidy, which was significantly less than in the common ALL group (p = 0.02). The median percentage of cells in S-phase was significantly greater for B-cell and erythrocyte rosette-positive T-cell ALL, than for the other phenotypic subgroups. We conclude that aneuploidy and S-phase cell percentage are correlated with the state of leukemia cell differentiation. The biologic basis for the correlation is not established, but may be linked to the process of malignant transformation.",,,,,,,,,

When these cells were incubated with [14C]arachidonate, it was actively incorporated initially into PC, and subsequently, gradually mobilized to PE from PC during the 72 h of culture. This characteristic redistribution was observed specifically with polyunsaturated acyl chains. Thus, the normal metabolic pathway of polyunsaturated fatty acids in these cells appears to consist of two steps: firstly fatty acids are incorporated from the external medium into the form of polyunsaturated PC, and, subsequently, are stored within cells as a metabolically stable pool after the conversion into the form of polyunsaturated PE. In differentiated cells, this redistribution pathway was significantly enhanced, suggesting a change in the activity of the deacylation-reacylation cycle during the course of differentiation,",,,,,,,,,

About half of the 332 odds ratios calculated were above unity and half were below unity, and no more of them differed significantly from unity at the 5% level than would be expected by chance. Odds ratios for tumors of the small intestine were consistently elevated in both sexes, as were those for neoplasms of the thyroid, eye, testis, and prostate in males; however, odds ratios for brain tumors and leukemia were consistently less than one in both sexes. Chance is the most likely explanation for these findings. Results of this study and prior studies of cancer in relation to waterborne asbestos are inconsistent, and provide little evidence that asbestos in community water supplies has altered the risk of any cancer. However, all investigations conducted to date are correlational studies which have an inherently higher probability of failing to detect actual increased risks associated with imbibed asbestos, and additional studies of individual exposures are warranted.

One of these transport systems exhibits a broad specificity for folate compounds, including 4-amino antagonists such as methotrexate. The primary substrate for this system is 5-methyltetra-hydrofolate (Kt = 1 microM), the principal circulating form of the vitamin in mammals. 5-Formyltetrahydrofolate (Kt = 5 microM) and Methotrexate (Kt = 5 microM) are also taken up efficiently, but folate (Kt = 100 microM) is a relatively poor substrate. Vmax for this system is ca. 15 pmoles/min/mg protein. Energy for substrate internalization is provided by an anion-exchange mechanism, and regulation appears to be mediated by cyclic AMP. The system can be inhibited irreversibly by treatment of the cells with photo-activated azido AMP or carbodiimide-activated folate compounds. The latter method allows the membrane-associated binding protein to be labeled in situ, thereby providing a means for identifying it during subsequent solubilization and purification. Guidance for this latter project is provided by previous experience in the purification to homogeneity of a similar folate-binding protein from Lactobacillus casei. L1210 cells also contain an efficient system for the transport of adenine (Kt = 20 microM; Vmax = 200 pmoles/min/mg protein). Uptake of adenine is linked with its conversion to AMP via PRPP-dependent adenine phosphori-bosyltransferase. Pterins, which have a close structural similarity to adenine (as well as to a portion of the folate molecule), are also transported into L1210 cells. Transport of [3H] 6-hydroxymethylpterin (Kt = 20 microM) was inhibited by 6-formylpterin, 6-methylpterin and 6-carboxypterin with Ki values of 42, 100 and 350 microM, respectively. Adenine (Ki = 20 microM) and various other purines were also good inhibitors of pterin transport. Present evidence indicates that adenine and pterins use separate transport systems, but isolation of the components of these systems may further delineate their interrelationships.",,,,,,,,,

The major site of action of azaG was the inhibition of protein synthesis. TG seemed to inhibit RNA synthesis more than DNA and protein synthesis. In contrast, DG inhibited both protein and DNA synthesis but not RNA synthesis. Whereas the LD50 and ID50 for macromolecular synthesis for DG and also for azaG were quite similar, for TG the LD50 was one-tenth that of the ID50 for macromolecular synthesis. Since azaG, DG, and TG had different effects on protein and RNA synthesis, the effects of the analogs on the process of translation were examined. DG and azaG, but not TG, altered the polyribosome sedimentation profile, increasing the numbers of monosomes and smaller polysomes and decreasing the number of larger polysomes. This shift in the polysome profile was reversed by low concentrations of cycloheximide, suggesting that DG and azaG inhibited the initiation of translation. This was examined directly by the incorporation of 35S-met-tRNA into the initiation complexes. DG and azaG inhibited the formation of the 43S and 80S initiation complexes and this inhibition correlated closely with the inhibition of total protein synthesis. It is likely that the inhibition of tumor growth by azaG is due to the inhibition of initiation of translation, perhaps through actions on mRNA. The mechanism of growth inhibition for DG is not yet known but may similarly involve actions at this level.",,,,,,,,,

We divided the mutants into two groups, ""highly sensitive"" and ""moderately sensitive"" mutants, according to their sensitivity to UV irradiation. Fifty-eight mutants were highly sensitive and three were moderately sensitive to UV. The reconstruction experiments indicate that more than 90% of highly sensitive mutants were recovered by the cell suspension spotting method. Frequencies of recovered mutants highly sensitive to UV increased with increasing dose of mutagens. Recovered mutant frequency reached 10(-2) after treatment with 1.5 micrograms/ml of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) (survival 0.2%). Eight UV-sensitive mutants were divided into four complementation groups. These mutants were 2-6 times more sensitive to UV than parental L51 T/t cells in terms of D37 (dose required to reduce survival to 37%). Four representative UV-sensitive mutants which are classified into different complementation groups were examined for their sensitivity to killing by UV, 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO), mitomycin C (MMC), X-rays, and MNNG.

A Southern blot analysis of these sequences revealed that multiple copies are present in the DNA of all mice examined, regardless of species or geographic origin. Considerable locus polymorphism was also apparent, and at least one of these polymorphisms appeared to reflect the differing chromosomal location of a complete VL30 sequence. These data indicated that VL30 elements are not recent additions to the mouse genome and suggested that the evolution of the VL30 multigene family has been accompanied by duplication and dispersion of VL30 sequences to diverse genomic sites. In addition, we reexamined the issue of genetic relatedness between mouse VL30 sequences and a physically similar family of virus-like elements in the rat genome. We found that many, if not all, rat and mouse VL30 loci contain regions of sequence homology.

Along with the propyl (8a) and octyl (8b) homologues of methotrexate, the propargyl compound 8c was prepared for evaluation. Syntheses of 8a,b were achieved by a standard multistep sequence involving preparation of the side-chain precursors via tosylated intermediates and then their alkylation with 6-(bromomethyl)-2,4-pteridinediamine hydrobromide. The side-chain precursor to 8c was prepared by direct alkylation of diethyl N-(4-aminobenzoyl)-L-glutamate with propargyl bromide and was separated from unchanged amine and dipropargyl coproduct by a combination of methods, including dry-column chromatography and recrystallization. Subsequent steps leading to 8c were like those used to prepare 8a,b. Biological evaluations of the three compounds consisted of studies of their effects on enzyme inhibition [(dihydrofolate reductase (EC 1.5.1.3) and thymidylate synthase)], L1210 cell growth inhibition, cellular membrane transport with various murine cell types (L210, S180, Ehrlich, and epithelial), in vivo (mice) activity vs. L1210 leukemia and S180 ascites, and plasma clearance in mice. The in vivo results vs. S180 ascites offered evidence that 8c might have a better therapeutic index against this tumor than methotrexate, but no other result from either of these compounds suggested significant superiority over methotrexate.",,,,,,,,,

The 240 million x-ray procedures performed annually contribute 90 percent of the man-made portion. It is assumed that the risks of medical radiation are outweighed by the benefits gained from the information obtained. If present in sufficiently high dosage, radiation can have harmful effects, such as induction of leukemia and thyroid malignancy. No deleterious effects have been shown to have been caused by diagnostic radiation. It is reassuring that the risks of medical radiation appear to be quite small compared with other common hazards most people face daily. Careful attention to the use of radiographic safety and protective technique will ensure the lowest possible radiation dose. The physician's discretion in ordering only appropriate and indicated x-ray films will ensure the patients are exposed to the lowest possible amount of radiation.",,,,,,,,,

There appeared to be a general decrease in the mobility of the various receptors on the surface membranes of CLL cells as compared with normal lymphocytes. Although C3 receptors were present on the majority of CLL cells, only a small proportion of the cells formed EAC rosettes. The response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA), Con A and pokeweed mitogen (PWM) confirmed previous observations that CLL cells respond poorly to the B cell mitogen, PWM, and that this response is significantly lower than that to the T cell mitogens, PHA and Con A. The decrease in response to all three mitogens seemed to correlate with the clinical stage of the disease, and it appears that Stage II cases may constitute a heterogeneous group of patients in this respect. A differential response to reduced concentrations of PHA was observed in CLL lymphocytes, but not with normal cells. The data concerning B and T cell function in CLL cells, as determined by the transformation and rosetting capacity of these cells, suggest a general decrease in function, which apparently deteriorates with progression of the disease.",,,,,,,,,

We investigated the mechanism by which 1,400 micrograms of C. parvum mixed with 10(6) LX prevents immunization by the LX. The inhibitory effect was a function of the ratio of C. parvum to tumor cells. Injection of 1,400 micrograms C. parvum, alone or mixed with the LX, did not prevent immunization by LX given simultaneously at a separate site. Injection of C. parvum, alone or mixed with the LX, did not prevent immunization by LX injected simultaneously at a separate site sharing a common lymph-node drainage area. The high dose of C. parvum prolonged retention of radiolabelled LX at the injection site and decreased the rate of distribution of the LX to other organs, particularly the spleen.

The drugs were given IP or IV, in general on days 1, 5, and 9 following tumor inoculation. Mitoxantrone given IP at the optimal dose (1.6 mg/kg/day; as a free base) produced a statistically significant number of 60-day survivors (curative effect) in mice with IP implanted L1210 leukemia. The curative effect was not observed with any of the other antibiotics. In the case of IV implanted L1210 leukemia, there was an increase in lifespan (ILS) by more than 100% in the mice following IV treatment with mitoxantrone or DM. In IP implanted P388 leukemia, the curative effect was elicited by IP treatment with mitoxantrone or MMC. In IP implanted B16 melanoma, both the curative effect and a more than 100% ILS in mice that did die were produced by IP treatment with mitoxantrone or ADM. In SC implanted Lewis lung carcinoma, mitoxantrone and ADM administered IV also showed effective antitumor activities and produced a 60% and a 45% ILS, respectively. In conclusion, mitoxantrone and ADM had a wider spectrum of antitumor activity against mouse tumors, including two leukemias and two solid tumors, than did the other drugs; however, mitoxantrone elicited higher antitumor effects than ADM on mouse leukemias, especially on L1210 leukemias. Moreover, mitoxantrone possessed much higher therapeutic indices than ADM against IP implanted P388 (optimal dose/ILS40; greater than 128 versus 15.2) and L1210 (optimal dose/ILS25; 72.7 versus 4.8) leukemias. In addition, mitoxantrone showed moderate activity against DM-resistant L1210 leukemia.",,,,,,,,,

Immunogenic responses towards both the immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody subclasses were evaluated in C57BL x DBA/2 F1 mice exposed to 250 rads of whole-body irradiation 4 hr prior to immunization with 5-diazo-4-oxynorvaline-inactivated native and modified L-asparaginase in complete Freund's adjuvant. Under these immunologically stressful conditions, the native enzyme evoked an IgE and IgG response which could be further amplified by a secondary immunization, whereas the modified enzyme evoked no IgE or IgG response even after a tertiary immunization. In experiments mimicking an intensive therapeutic schedule, whereby two groups of mice were given weekly injections of 5 to 10 units of either native or modified asparaginase for up to 14 weeks, neither enzyme form evoked a significant IgE response, and only the mice given injections of the native enzyme produced an IgG response. In a preliminary patient study, skin testing of a child who had shown an allergic reaction to the native enzyme resulted in a negative response after an intradermal injection of the modified enzyme, whereas a wheal and flare reaction was observed to both the native enzyme and a histamine control. All of these results suggest that the modified enzyme should show a definite reduction in immunological reactions associated with L-asparaginase treatment of childhood leukemia.",,,,,,,,,

The effect of the drug on protein synthesis was therefore further examined.

DG altered the polyribosome sedimentation profile in a dose-dependent manner, increasing the numbers of monosomes and smaller polysomes and decreasing the number of larger polysomes. The nascent polypeptides in DG-treated cells were labeled with [3H]leucine, and the increased number of monosomes was not associated with a proportionate amount of [3H]leucine when compared to the polysomes. This indicated that the monosomes had not been derived directly from the breakdown of active polysomes. The shift in the polysome profile was reversed by cycloheximide, suggesting that DG profile inhibited the initiation of translation.

Controls consisted of 42 nonneoplastic specimens obtained from lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, and peripheral blood. Each specimen was analyzed after staining with a hypotonic solution of propidium iodide using nuclei isolated from chicken erythrocytes as an internal standard. The DNA content and light scatter of the human populations was expressed as a ratio between the DNA content (or light scatter) of the human G0--G1 cells and that of the chicken erythrocytes nuclei. The mean DNA ratio for the 42 nonneoplastic samples was 2.58 +/- 0.045 (SD). In these samples the DNA coefficient of variation of the human G0--G1 peak ranged from 1.48--3.28% (mean, 2.33 +/- 0.54%). The FCM data in the NHL was compared to morphologic diagnoses made according to the ""working formulation of NHL for clinical usage"" recently proposed by a panel of international experts. Eight of 17 (47%) low grade NHL, one of two (50%) mycosis fungoides, ten of 14 (71%) intermediate grade NHL, nine of ten (90%) high grade NHL, nine of 17 (53%) ALL, three of ten (30%) ANLL, and seven of 25 (28%) chronic lymphoid leukemias had abnormal DNA ratios indicative of aneuploidy. In addition, several cases had normal DNA ratios but G0--G1 coefficients of variation outside of the normal range. All cases of HD had normal DNA values except one case with a small percentage of near tetraploid cells. The mean percentage of cells with S-phase DNA content for the low grade NHL (2.2 +/- 0.8%) was significantly lower than that of the intermediate grade NHL (12.1 +/- 4.9%; P less than 0.0001). The mean S-phase value for the intermediate grade NHL was significantly lower than that of the high grade NHL (22.6 +/- 11.1%; P less than 0.001). The three prognostic categories of NHL designated by the new formulation were clearly distinguishable by the FCM data. Light scatter was not particularly useful for distinguishing nonneoplastic from neoplastic populations. The mean light scatter coefficient of variation of the ALL (15.2%) was significantly lower than that of ANLL (20.5%), however (P less than 0.04).",,,,,,,,,

Attention was paid to nonsplenectomized patients to find a staging system to predict the survival length at the time of diagnosis. On the basis of hemoglobin level and spleen size at the time of diagnosis, 3 stages could be distinguished with significantly different prognoses (stages I-III). In addition, we addressed the question of splenectomy to identify those patients who benefit from the operation. Using arbitrary, but clinically relevant, criteria to call the operation beneficial, splenectomy appears to be indicated for patients with large spleens (greater than or equal to 4 cm under costal margin) or with smaller, but palpable, spleens when anemia (Hb less than 12 g/dl) is present. The third question concerned the splenectomized patients. To indicate the patients who have a poor postsplenectomy survival, a staging system was developed on the basis of hemoglobin level and number of neutrophils at 2-3 mo after the operation (stages A-C). The validity of the two staging systems was supported by the results of an analysis of an independent test series of patients. These staging systems may be helpful for the choice of therapy and in the planning of clinical trials in patients with hairy-cell leukemia.",,,,,,,,,

This was found to be due to relatively low contents of cholesterol and sphingomyelin and a high amount of unsaturated fatty acyl chains, especially linoleic acid, in the phospholipids. PM from GRSL cells contain markedly more phosphatidylethanolamine than those from thymocytes. For both GRSL cells and thymocytes the detailed lipid composition of isolated PM was compared with that of the corresponding shed extracellular membranes (ECM), which were isolated from the ascites fluid and from thymus cell suspensions, respectively. The somewhat decreased lipid fluidity of thymocyte ECM as compared to their PM, can be ascribed to the increased cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio (0.88 vs. 0.74). No other major differences were found between the lipid composition of these membranes. In contrast, significant differences were found between PM and ECM from GRSL cells. In this system a much lower lipid fluidity of the shed ECM was found, due to the much increased cholesterol/phospholipid molar ratio (3.5-fold) and sphingomyelin (9-fold) content, as compared to the PM. Further, the ECM contain relatively more lysophosphatidylethanolamine and less phosphatidylcholine and -inositol. ECM contain a higher amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially in the phosphatidylethanolamine and lysophosphatidylethanolamine classes. On the other hand, the fatty acids of phosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylcholine are more saturated than in PM. In particular, ECM of GRSL cells contain less oleic and linoleic acid residues and more arachidonic acid and 22:polyunsaturated fatty acid residues than PM. The possible relevance of these differences with respect to the mechanism of shedding of vesicles from the cell surface, is discussed.",,,,,,,,,

A reduction in this toxicity can be achieved by attaching the chloroethylnitrosourea cytotoxic group to C2 (chlorozotocin) or C1 (1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-(beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-1-nitrosourea, GANU) of glucose. Both glucose analogs are less myelotoxic in mice than 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohepyl-1-nitrosourea (CCNU) or 1-(4-amino-2-methylpyrimidin-5-yl)methyl-3-(2-chloroethyl)-3-nitrosourea (ACNU), while retaining comparable antitumor activity against the murine L1210 leukemia. To define the nuclear mechanisms for this reduced myelotoxicity, alkylation of L1210 and murine bone marrow DNA was quantitated. With the use of the endonuclease micrococcal nuclease and DNase I, the sites of alkylation within the chromatin substructure were determined. Experiments were performed on L1210 leukemia or bone marrow cells that had been incubated in vitro for 2 hr with 0.1 mM [14C]chloroethyl drug. The quantitative alkylation of DNA by GANU was 1.3-fold greater in L1210, as compared to bone marrow, cells. This ratio of DNA alkylation is comparable to the 1.3 ratio we previously reported for chlorozotocin [L. C. Panasci, D. Green and P. S. Schein, J. clin. Invest. 64, 1103 (1979)]. In contrast, the ratio of alkylation (L1210:bone marrow DNA) for the myelotoxic ACNU was 0.66, similar to 0.59 for CCNU. Nuclease digestion experiments demonstrated that chlorozotocin and GANU preferentially alkylated internucleosomal linker regions of bone marrow chromatin, while nucleosome core particles were the preferred targets of CCNU and ACNU. The reduced myelotoxicity of chlorozotocin and GANU may be correlated with the advantageous ratio of L1210:bone marrow DNA alkylation and preferential alkylation of internucleosomal regions of bone marrow chromatin.",,,,,,,,,

Ellipticine caused a much higher frequency of each of these lesions than adriamycin, at equitoxic doses. However, adriamycin-induced DNA effects were slowly and incompletely repaired over 24 hr after drug removal while the effects of ellipticine were virtually completely repaired within 30 min. Repair of ellipticine-induced lesions was observed only if cells were diluted ( 100-fold) after drug treatment, suggesting that significant amounts of drug may have been sequestered in the cellular membranes. Cell dilution did not alter the effects of adriamycin. Removal of the DNA lesions was temperature dependent. Finally, the similarity in the rates of repair for DNA single and double strand breaks and DNA-protein crosslinks supports the hypothesis that they are functionally related.",,,,,,,,,

The storage pool deficiency was confined to the substances contained in the platelet dense bodies, because alpha-granule and lysosome markers were present in normal amounts. In chronic granulocytic leukemia the storage defect was usually less marked but was accompanied by a decreased formation of thromboxane B2 and normal platelet aggregation in response to arachidonic acid. There was no clearcut relationship of these biochemical abnormalities to prolongation of bleeding time or to thrombotic and hemorrhagic symptoms. The defect was still present in 15 patients after treatment had returned the cell counts to the normal range. Normal levels of 5HT and adenine nucleotides were observed in 8 patients whose platelet counts were high after splenectomy for non-hematological reasons.

There were 10 diagnostic differences apparent when biopsy results were compared with autopsy findings in 28 autopsied patients. Therapy was initiated or modified in 19 patients on the basis of open lung biopsy. Forty-four patients lived 1 year or less, 14 for more than 1 year, and 10 were lost to follow-up. Of 42 patients with an untreatable disease on the basis of lung biopsy, 67% died and 33% lived to leave the hospital. Of 25 patients with a treatable disease, 56% died and 44% left the hospital. Of 28 autopsied patients, only 12 were receiving appropriate medication at time of death despite biopsy.

Significant correlations were obtained for lung cancer (males, r = 0.46; females r = 0.55) and pancreatic cancer (males, r = 0.59; females, r = 0.40) , and there was a borderline correlation (r = 0.36; p = 0.04) for leukemia in males. In all, there were positive correlations for eight out of the nine computations made. Since background radiation correlates with urbanization and therefore with smoking, air pollution, etc, the correlations might be spurious due to confounding; on the other hand confounding is a reciprocal phenomenon which suggests that background radiation should to be taken into consideration when widespread risk factors like smoking, coffee drinking, general air pollution, etc, are studied.",,,,,,,,,

In the presence of 10 mM sodium azide, which has been shown to diminish the modulation occurring during simultaneous incubations with anti-Ig and C, this correlation was even stronger (P less than 0.001). No zone could be defined in which the level of surface Ig expression was sufficient to serve complement lysis but too low for modulation. Furthermore, both the degrees and rates of modulation occurring on incubation with antibody at 37 degrees C, either before C addition or in the presence of lytic C, were similar for populations of high, low, or intermediate antigen density. Separation of cells by their size or density failed to yield populations differing in either their susceptibility to humoral killing through anti-Ig or their modulating capacity. IgG and IgM antibodies to the L2C cell surface Ig evoked similar levels of killing with syngeneic C, and when compared for their ability to promote anti-complementary modulation, no difference was revealed in either the rate or degree of modulation occurring during incubations at 37 degrees C with the two isotopes.

For many alloimmunized patients autologous frozen platelets represented the only source of histocompatible platelets. 5% dimethylsulfoxide is used as the cryoprotective agent and the platelets can be maintained in the frozen state for at least three years without significant reduction in effectiveness. There are essentially no side effects following transfusion and patient acceptance has been excellent.

Virus yields were reduced more than 50-fold by 10(-5) M monensin, whereas particle production was reduced by 50% in monensin-treated cells. The resulting particles failed to incorporate newly synthesized gp70 and p15(E), whereas the other structural proteins, p30, p15, p12, and p10, were incorporated into virions. However, monensin did not inhibit the incorporation into virions of preformed gp70. A reduction in the efficiency of cleavage of the PrENV glycoprotein precursor and a defect in the processing of simple endo-H-sensitive to complex endo-H-resistant oligosaccharides suggest that intracellular transport of gp70 may be blocked before its entry into the Golgi apparatus. Fewer particles were found to bud from the cell surface, but intracellular vacuoles with budding virions were detected.

With the use of FLV obtained by a variety of procedures, we showed that the polycythemia spleen focus-forming component (SFFVp) was responsible for the contrasting changes of hematocrits observed in FV-Pp (polycythemia strain)-infected DBA/2 (Fv-5pp) or CBA (Fv-5aa) mice. These changes in hematocrits were found to be a direct result of the rise in circulating reticulocytes and erythrocytes in DBA/2 mice and a corresponding drop of these erythroid cells in CBA mice 2 wk after infection. Examination of the FV-P-induced cellular changes indicated that dramatic increase in erythropoietin (epo)-independent erythroid precursor (CFU-E*) cells was detected in the spleens and marrow of both strains of mice. The epo responsiveness of the CFU-E in the uninfected and FV-P-infected CBA and DBA/2 mice was also very similar. Similar to FLV-infected DBA/2 mice, the FV-P-infected CBA mice also developed tumorogenic cells (CFU-FV) relatively early after infection (4-6 wk). Study of the physiological and pathological changes in the marrows and spleens of these infected mice indicated that significant differences were found in the spleens of the two strains of mice. The percent of reticulocytes in the spleen cells of CBA mice remained between 10 and 20%, and level of the DBA/2 mice increased to approximately 50%. This higher rate of erythropoiesis was also reflected in the significantly higher rate of uptake of 59Fe in the spleens of the DBA/2 mice. These results suggest that the Fv-5 locus might control the hematocrit levels of these mice by regulating the rates of erythropoiesis in the spleen levels of these mice, probably by affecting the rate of proliferation of an erythroid cell or cells. The erythroid cell(s) affected is likely to be more mature than the erythroid progenitor, CFU-E, as the levels of CFU-E in these two strains of mice were similar. The hypothesis that Fv-5 may control the rates of proliferation of a late erythroid (cell(s) is also supported by the significantly higher spleen weights found in the infected DBA/2 (approximately 2.5 g/spleen) mice than in the CBA (approximately 1 g/spleen) strain.",,PMC2186760,,,,,,,

DNA intercalating agents induce the formation of strand breaks which are unusual in that they are associated with tightly or covalently bound protein. In order to determine whether the intercalator-induced strand breaks are associated with poly-(ADP-R) synthesis, L1210 cells were treated with the intercalating agent, 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide. Poly(ADP-R) synthesis, measured by [3H]NAD incorporation following cell permeabilization, was enhanced in x-irradiated cells, but not in cells exposed to 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide at doses which produced equivalent strand breaks frequencies. The permeabilized cell system did not support DNA synthesis and x-ray-induced strand breaks did not reseal. The intercalator-induced strand breaks, however, resealed within 10 min. Hence, the strand breaks observed in intercalator-treated cells may not constitute DNA damage in the usual sense. The resealing of intercalator-induced DNA breaks in the absence of DNA or poly(ADP-R) synthesis is unique among chemical or physical agents which produce DNA scissions.",,,,,,,,,

The effect on NK activity was selective, as treatment of mice with anti-asialo-GM1 serum did not affect the development of other cytotoxic cells including cytotoxic macrophages following injection of poly I:C, or cytotoxic T cells in response to allogeneic cells. The role of NK cells in controlling tumor cell growth was investigated using an NK-sensitive (cl 27v-1C2) and an NK-resistant (cl 27av) subline of the murine lymphoma L5178Y. Initial studies showed that cl 27v-1C2 cells were at least 100 times less tumorigenic than were cl 27av cells in both syngeneic DBA/2 mice and BALB/c nu/nu mice. In addition, treatment of DBA/2 mice with poly I:C, which boosted NK activity, markedly depressed the growth of cl 27v-1C2 cells, but not of cl 27av cells. On the other hand, treatment of DBA/2 mice and BALB/c nu/nu mice with anti-asialo-GM1 serum led to a marked increase in tumorigenicity of cl 27v 1C2 cells, but had no effect on the tumorigenicity of cl 27av cells. In addition, the protection against cl 27v-1C2 growth afforded by poly-I:C treatment was abrogated by injection oif anti-asialo-GM1 serum. The possibility that the effects observed were caused by binding of the injected antibodies to the tumor cells was minimized by: (1) using a clone of tumor cells (cl 27v-1C2) that lacks chemically detectable asialo-GM1, and (2) pretreating animals with anti-asialo-GM1 rather than administering antiserum and tumor cells concurrently. These studies provided compelling evidence that NK cells could play an active role in controlling tumor growth. Selective depletion of NK activity by injection of anti-asialo-GM1 serum is a method which would be generally applicable to studying the role of NK cells in disease processes.",,,,,,,,,

The virus infection correlates with a block in differentiation which was studied at a specific cellular gene level, namely that of the globin genes. In live birds, the viral transformation has been found to affect the transcriptional activity to two out of three adult globin genes and the phenotypic expression of the third. Indeed, the alpha A gene that is transcribed is silent as well, since its transcription product is fully eliminated in the nucleus following an ""abortive processing"". Chick bone marrow cells can also be transformed in vitro by AEV in which case the virus recruits, as targets, cells of the erythroid lineage belonging to a wider spectrum and hence in varying degrees of differentiation. In contrast to the results obtained with in vivo transformed cells, molecular hybridization with globin cDNA probes showed that in the erythroblasts transformed in vitro under tissue culture conditions all the three adult globin genes are transcriptionally active. In fact, low but detectable amounts of globin mRNA sequences are present in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartment of the cell prior to exposure to any chemical inducers of red cell differentiation. Judging from our present results, we may propose that AEV transformation in vitro does not shut off out only modulates the already functioning erythroid cell differentiation program.",,,,,,,,,

Techniques are employed to minimize confounding due to industrialization, urbanization or selected cultural characteristics. Cancer mortality data for U.S. counties averaged over the 20-year period, 1950--1969, were used. For most comparisons a deficit in cancer mortality in high altitude counties was observed. The largest differences between the low and high altitude groups were found for cancers of the tongue and mouth, esophagus, larynx, lung and melanoma.

Peptichemio was administered intravenously at doses of 40-80 mg/48 h, courses including 4-17 administrations in association with moderate doses of prednisone (15-50 mg/day) and androstanes at high dosages (250 mg weekly). In two patients PTC was associated with vincristine (VCR) administered on the first day of the course. Eight patients were previously untreated, four had been resistant to melphalan (MPH) and/or cyclophosphamide (CTX), and three had been treated irregularly with one or both of these alkylating agents. The criteria of response to therapy are reported. Out of a total of 15 PTC courses administered we obtained 13 responses, eight complete and five partial; no response was achieved in the other two patients. In the four patients who were resistant to MPH and/or CTX we obtained three responses, which were maintained with the same alkylating agent to which they had been resistant previously. The time needed to obtain a response in 90% of the patients was 6 weeks. Peptichemio was shown to be effective in patients in an advanced stage of the disease, in patients with light-chain myeloma and in those with plasma cell leukemia. The association of VCR potentiated the antitumor effect, but also increased the myelotoxicity. The PTC treatment was well tolerated. It is suggested that PTC be used in induction treatment of myelomatosis and in patients resistant to traditional alkylating agents.",,,,,,,,,

Other toxic effects included nausea and vomiting, anemia, and hepatic dysfunction. The hematologic toxicity tended to be more pronounced in patients with hepatic dysfunction, poor marrow reserve, and heavy prior chemotherapy and radiotherapy. There were no complete or partial responses. One patient with skin melanoma and another with ovarian carcinoma had improvement lasting 2 months. The maximally tolerated dose is 9 g/m2 in our population. A recommended dose for therapeutic study is 7 g/m2. High-risk patients should be started at a dose of 5 g/m2.

Twenty-one factors were found to be significantly associated with probability of obtaining a complete response. In addition to characteristics previously known to provide prognostic information such as age, temperature status at the start of treatment, morphology, the presence of Auer rods, sex, and hemoglobin level, we identified the presence of a documented antecedent hematologic disorder and the finding of insufficient metaphases on cytogenetic analysis using the squash technique as being major prognostic variables.

Based on these observations we proposed that fluctuation in cellular cation concentrations may act as a link between the membrane structure and ornithine decarboxylase. To test this proposal, we studied the effects of selective membrane perturbing agents such as ionophores and local anesthetics, on the serum-stimulated increase of ornithine decarboxylase activity in L1210 cells. Among the six ionophores tested, valinomycin was the most potent one, with I50 value (concentration that gives 50% inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase activity) of 6.10(-9) M. Dibucaine and tetracaine were also effective inhibitors at 10(-4)-10(-5) M. The I50 values of valinomycin on the protein synthesis and RNA synthesis, however, were greater than 1.10(-6) M. These results substantiate the notion that ornithine decarboxylase activity can be regulated at plasma membrane level and such regulation is related to the perturbation of cellular cation pools.",,,,,,,,,

The findings confirm the absence of any excess mortality from bladder cancer among men entering the industry after 1 January 1951 (the presumed bladder carcinogens were withdrawn from production processes in July 1949), but they confirm also a statistically significant excess of both lung and stomach cancer mortality. A small excess of oesophageal cancer was also observed in both the tyre and general rubber goods manufacturing sectors. American reports of an excess of leukaemia among rubber workers receive only limited support from the present study, where a small numerical excess of deaths from leukaemia is not statistically significant.

Between the years 1969 and 1981, ten children were operated on at the Babies Hospital for stress ulcer. Their illnesses included connective tissue disorders (3), sepsis (2), Reye's syndrome (1), hemolytic uremic syndrome (1), leukemia (1), closed head injury (1), and renal failure (1). In those with bleeding (8), aggressive conventional medical management was attempted prior to operation. Four children also received intravenous cimetidine. Four patients underwent embolization of a feeding artery and/or selective vasopressin infusion. In those patients who perforated (2), operation was performed after a brief period of resuscitation. Ten patients underwent 11 operations. In those who bled, multiple ulcerations were the most common finding. Operative procedures consisted of partial gastrectomy and vagotomy (4), partial gastrectomy alone (2), and vagotomy and pyloroplasty (2). One child who underwent vagotomy and pyloroplasty required partial gastrectomy for recurrent bleeding. Of the two children who perforated, one was managed by plication and the other by partial gastrectomy. There were two deaths (20%), both occurring in patients who had undergone gastrectomy. One survivor has mild dumping. This experience suggests that in children (1) stress ulcers are commonly multiple when associated with major medical illnesses; (2) partial gastrectomy with or without vagotomy affords maximum protection against recurrent bleeding; (3) lesser procedures are effective for solitary bleeding duodenal ulcers or perforation; and (4) selective arterial embolization or vasopressin infusion are unreliable methods for controlling bleeding.",,PMC1352489,,,,,,,

Some tumors, such as thyroid cancer, have very low, if any, threshold dose for tumor induction. Sarcomas appear to require higher doses (approximately 100 rads) for induction. Controversy exists as to whether high doses of irradiation are less carcinogenic than lower doses due to greater cell killing at high doses. Acute leukemia has been induced by either irradiation alone or chemotherapy alone. Current intensive therapy protocols using combinations of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, or prolonged chemotherapy, are more leukemogenic, with the 4-year actuarial risk of leukemia in the range 4-17%. Immunosuppression due to various disease states or treatments had been accompanied by malignant tumors, often lymphomas in unusual sites such as the central nervous system. Unusual non-Hodgkin's lymphomas have recently been observed in patients treated for Hodgkin's disease, suggesting that some secondary neoplasms in cancer patients are related to immunosuppression.",,,,,,,,,

Once treatment has been successful, however, the emphasis must shift to helping the patient resume a normal and productive life. The primary care physician will probably be responsible for the long-term care of these patients. He or she should be alert to the possible disease- and therapy-induced problems such patients face (even years after treatment), especially those common problems in which informed intervention is most effective. The approach summarized here can be readily integrated with normal health surveillance measures but should be modified to suit the individual patient and supplemented as new information appears.

The cephalic phycomycosis has two forms: 1. rhino-orbital cerebral which may be fatal, and 2. rhino-paranasal sinuses form which usually has a benign clinical course. From 1943 to 1967, only 45 cases of the cephalic form were described with a mortality rate of 50%. Since then several series have been added to the literature with improved survival, probably due to the addition of amphotericin B to the therapy. Even with modern therapy, the mortality rate is still about 30%. Modern technology C.T. scan is very helpful to establish orbital and intracranial extension.

Viral RNAs from three cell lines, SL3, 4, and 7, were indistinguishable from one another. The fingerprint patterns indicated that these cell lines produce equal amounts of two prototype, leukomogenic SL viruses that were previously isolated from the SL3 cell line. Viral RNA produced by the SL1 and SL2 cell lines contained similar components, but at a different ratio. Two other cell lines (SL5 and SL11) produced viral RNAs that resemble those of AKR mink cell focus-forming viruses. One additional line, SL9, produced viral RNA of a novel structure. The complex pattern of viral RNA expression observed for these lymphoid cell lines can be interpreted in terms of recombination among three types of endogenous viral sequences: the Akv virus, a xenotropic virus, and an SL (for spontaneous leukemia) virus.",,PMC256722,,,,,,,

Compounds which produced high T/C % values (170-272) resulted in ID50 of 5.4-15.5 microM for inhibition of whole cell protein synthesis, ID50 of 1.3-13 microM for inhibition of endogenous protein synthesis in cell homogenates, and ID50 of 1.9-6 microM for inhibition of polyuridine directed polyphenylalanine synthesis using ""runoff"" ribosomes and a ""pH 5"" enzyme preparation. The polyuridine directed polyphenylalanine synthesis requires neither initiation nor termination factors, suggesting that quassinoids are exclusively elongation inhibitors. Bruceantin, brusatol, and bisbrusatolyl malonate allowed a runoff of the polyribosomes to 80S free ribosomes. However, formation of the ternary complex and 80S initiation complex were not inhibited by the quassinoids. Thus, these agents do not affect the individual steps leading to the formation of a stable 80S initiation complex in P-388 cells. Brusatol, bruceantin, and bisbrusatolyl malonate inhibited the formation of the first peptide bond between puromycin and [3H]methionyl-transfer RNA bound to the initiation complex, indicating peptidyl transferase activity is inhibited by the quassinoids in P-388 cells. These studies also suggest that the free 80S ribosome is the site of binding by the quassinoid. Ribosomes actively conducting protein synthesis will continue protein synthesis and terminate before the quassinoids bind. This proves quassinoids are elongation inhibitors of tumor cells. A strong correlation was observed between potent antileukemic activity and the ability to inhibit protein synthesis in P-388 lymphocytic leukemia cells.",,,,,,,,,
