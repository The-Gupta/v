To investigate the role of HTLV-1 subgroups in viral pathogenesis, we studied the functional difference in the subgroup-specific viral transcriptional regulators Tax and HBZ using microarray analysis, reporter gene assays, and evaluation of viral-host protein-protein interaction. RESULTS: (1) Transcriptional changes in Jurkat Tet-On human T-cells that express each subgroup of Tax or HBZ protein under the control of an inducible promoter revealed different target gene profiles; (2) the number of differentially regulated genes induced by HBZ was 2-3 times higher than that induced by Tax; (3) Tax and HBZ induced the expression of different classes of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs); (4) the chemokine CXCL10, which has been proposed as a prognostic biomarker for HAM/TSP, was more efficiently induced by subgroup-A Tax (Tax-A) than subgroup-B Tax (Tax-B), in vitro as well as in unmanipulated (ex vivo) PBMCs obtained from HAM/TSP patients; (5) reporter gene assays indicated that although transient Tax expression in an HTLV-1-negative human T-cell line activated the CXCL10 gene promoter through the NF-kappaB pathway, there was no difference in the ability of each subgroup of Tax to activate the CXCL10 promoter; however, (6) chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that the ternary complex containing Tax-A is more efficiently recruited onto the promoter region of CXCL10, which contains two NF-kappaB binding sites, than that containing Tax-B. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that different HTLV-1 subgroups are characterized by different patterns of host gene expression. Differential expression of pathogenesis-related genes by subgroup-specific Tax or HBZ may be associated with the onset of HAM/TSP.","['Naito, Tadasuke', 'Yasunaga, Jun-Ichirou', 'Mitobe, Yuichi', 'Shirai, Kazumasa', 'Sejima, Hiroe', 'Ushirogawa, Hiroshi', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Nakamura, Tatsufumi', 'Hanada, Kousuke', 'Fujii, Masahiro', 'Matsuoka, Masao', 'Saito, Mineki']","['Naito T', 'Yasunaga JI', 'Mitobe Y', 'Shirai K', 'Sejima H', 'Ushirogawa H', 'Tanaka Y', 'Nakamura T', 'Hanada K', 'Fujii M', 'Matsuoka M', 'Saito M']","['Department of Microbiology, Kawasaki Medical School, 577 Matsushima, Kurashiki, Okayama, 701-0192, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Division of Gene Regulation and Signal Transduction, Research Center for Genomic Medicine, Saitama Medical University, Saitama, Japan.', 'Department of Bioscience and Bioinformatics, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology, Kawasaki Medical School, 577 Matsushima, Kurashiki, Okayama, 701-0192, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology, Kawasaki Medical School, 577 Matsushima, Kurashiki, Okayama, 701-0192, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Department of Social Work, Faculty of Human and Social Studies, Nagasaki International University, 2825-7 Huis Ten Bosch Machi, Sasebo, Nagasaki, 859-3298, Japan.', 'Department of Bioscience and Bioinformatics, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Virology, Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Rheumatology and Infectious Disease, Faculty of Life Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology, Kawasaki Medical School, 577 Matsushima, Kurashiki, Okayama, 701-0192, Japan. mineki@med.kawasaki-m.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['JP15K09345/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science/International', '16ek0109026h0003/Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development/International', '16ek0109010h0003/Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181106,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (RNA, Untranslated)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Gene Products, tax/*genetics', 'HTLV-I Infections/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/classification/*genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Male', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*genetics/virology', 'RNA, Untranslated/genetics', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Transcriptome', 'Viral Proteins/genetics']",PMC6219256,['NOTNLM'],"['*HAM/TSP', '*HBZ', '*HTLV-1', '*Microarray', '*Tax', '*Virus subgroup']",2018/11/08 06:00,2019/04/24 06:00,['2018/11/08 06:00'],"['2018/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12977-018-0454-x [doi]', '10.1186/s12977-018-0454-x [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2018 Nov 6;15(1):72. doi: 10.1186/s12977-018-0454-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although experimental studies have clearly demonstrated the efficacy of imatinib, up-to-date data on its effectiveness at the population level are limited. Our study aims to assess the change in disease-specific survival for chronic myeloid leukemia after introducing tyrosine kinase inhibitors in first-line treatment. METHODS: This study analyzed data from two population-based cancer registries in Italy. Disease-specific survival for chronic myeloid leukemia cases diagnosed before and after the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (February 2002) were calculated up to 10 years. Hazard ratios were calculated using Cox regression models adjusted for sex, age at diagnosis and residency. An interrupted time series analysis was also performed. RESULTS: Between 1996 and 2012, 357 new cases of chronic myeloid leukemia were diagnosed (standardized incidence rate of 1.2 per 100,000 residents), quite constant throughout the period. The interrupted time series analysis showed a gain of 40.4% in 5 years of disease-specific survival for chronic myeloid leukemia (from 47.3, 95%CI 38.5-55.5% to 80.8%, 95%CI 74.5-85.8%) after the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The hazard ratio was 0.36 (95%CI 0.25-0.52) for cases diagnosed after tyrosine kinase inhibitor introduction, with differences per age at diagnosis: <65yo 0.17 (95%CI 0.08-0.39), >74yo 0.41 (95%CI 0.23-0.73). An improvement in survival (hazard ratio 0.66, 95%CI 0.36-1.20) was also observed in cases diagnosed before, and alive at, tyrosine kinase inhibitors introduction. CONCLUSIONS: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors increased disease-specific survival both for new and prevalent chronic myeloid leukemia cases. The effectiveness was similar to that observed in trials only in patients ages 65 years or younger.","['Di Felice, Enza', 'Roncaglia, Francesca', 'Venturelli, Francesco', 'Mangone, Lucia', 'Luminari, Stefano', 'Cirilli, Claudia', 'Carrozzi, Giuliano', 'Giorgi Rossi, Paolo']","['Di Felice E', 'Roncaglia F', 'Venturelli F', 'Mangone L', 'Luminari S', 'Cirilli C', 'Carrozzi G', 'Giorgi Rossi P']","['Epidemiology Unit, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy.', 'Department of Health, Emilia-Romagna Region, Bologna, Italy.', 'Epidemiology Unit, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy.', 'Epidemiology Unit, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy. venturelli.dr.francesco@gmail.com.', 'Clinical and Experimental Medicine PhD Program, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy. venturelli.dr.francesco@gmail.com.', 'Epidemiology Unit, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy.', 'Department of Diagnostics, Clinical and Public Health Medicine, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Epidemiology Unit, AUSL of Modena, Modena, Italy.', 'Epidemiology Unit, AUSL of Modena, Modena, Italy.', 'Epidemiology Unit, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181106,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*therapeutic use', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use']",PMC6219019,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interrupted time series analysis', 'Population registers', 'Survival analysis']",2018/11/08 06:00,2019/02/12 06:00,['2018/11/08 06:00'],"['2018/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-018-4984-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-018-4984-3 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2018 Nov 6;18(1):1069. doi: 10.1186/s12885-018-4984-3.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9190-8668'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As one of the accepted methods of lncRNA function is affecting chromatin structure; lncRNA binding has been shown for different chromatin modifiers. Histone lysine methyltransferases (HKMTs) are also subject of lncRNA regulation as demonstrated for example in the case of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL) proteins that catalyze the methylation of H3K4 have been implicated in several different cancers; yet many details of their regulation and targeting remain elusive. In this work we explored the RNA binding capability of two; so far uncharacterized regions of MLL4; with the aim of shedding light to the existence of possible regulatory lncRNA interactions of the protein. We demonstrated that both regions; one that contains a predicted RNA binding sequence and one that does not; are capable of binding to different RNA constructs in vitro. To our knowledge, these findings are the first to indicate that an MLL protein itself is capable of lncRNA binding.","['Szabo, Beata', 'Murvai, Nikoletta', 'Abukhairan, Rawan', 'Schad, Eva', 'Kardos, Jozsef', 'Szeder, Balint', 'Buday, Laszlo', 'Tantos, Agnes']","['Szabo B', 'Murvai N', 'Abukhairan R', 'Schad E', 'Kardos J', 'Szeder B', 'Buday L', 'Tantos A']","['Institute of Enzymology, Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary. szabo.beata@ttk.mta.hu.', 'Institute of Enzymology, Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary. murvai.nikoletta@ttk.mta.hu.', 'Institute of Enzymology, Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary. rawan.abukhairan@ttk.mta.hu.', 'Institute of Enzymology, Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary. schad.eva@ttk.mta.hu.', 'ELTE NAP Neuroimmunology Research Group, Department of Biochemistry, Eotvos Lorand University, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary. kardos@elte.hu.', 'Institute of Enzymology, Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary. szeder.balint@ttk.mta.hu.', 'Institute of Enzymology, Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary. buday.laszlo@ttk.mta.hu.', 'Institute of Enzymology, Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary. tantos.agnes@ttk.mta.hu.']",['eng'],"['K 125340/Orszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi Alapprogramok', 'K 120391/Orszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi Alapprogramok', 'KH 125597/Orszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi Alapprogramok', 'TET_16-1-2016-0134/Nemzeti Kutatasi es Technologiai Hivatal', 'Synergy IV/MedInProt Protein Science Research Synergy Program']",['Journal Article'],20181105,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intrinsically Disordered Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Intrinsically Disordered Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'RNA/*metabolism', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC6274713,['NOTNLM'],"['HOTAIR', 'MEG3', 'MLL proteins', 'MLL4', 'RNA binding', 'histone lysine methyltransferase', 'intrinsically disordered protein', 'leukemia', 'lncRNA']",2018/11/08 06:00,2019/02/05 06:00,['2018/11/08 06:00'],"['2018/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/01 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms19113478 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms19113478 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2018 Nov 5;19(11). pii: ijms19113478. doi: 10.3390/ijms19113478.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-2135-2932'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this assay, a short single-stranded 76-mer DNA aptamer with a unique DNA sequence, which binds towards the cyto-c like an antibody with a high binding affinity and specificity, was conjugated to gold nanorods (AuNR) for LSPR sensing. Practically, cyto-c was first grabbed by a capturing antibody functionalized on the surface of micro-magnetic particles (MMPs). Subsequently, the AuNR-conjugated aptamer was added to form a complex sandwich structure with cyto-c (i.e., (MMP-Ab)-(cyto-c)-(AuNR-aptamer)) after washing away the non-target impurities, such as serum residues and intracellular contents, in a microfluidic chip. The sandwich complex led to formation of AuNR aggregates, which changed the LSPR signals in relation to the amount of cyto-c. With the LSPR signal enhancement effects from the AuNRs, the detection limit of cyto-c, sparked in human serum or culture medium, was found to be 0.1 ng/mL in our platform and the whole sensing process could be completed within two hours. Moreover, we have applied this assay to monitor the apoptosis in leukemia cancer cells induced by a potential anti-cancer agent phenylarsine oxide.","['Loo, Jacky Fong-Chuen', 'Lau, Pui-Man', 'Kong, Siu-Kai', 'Ho, Ho-Pui']","['Loo JF', 'Lau PM', 'Kong SK', 'Ho HP']","['Department of Biomedical Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong, China. jackyfcloo@gmail.com.', 'School of Life Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong, China. jackyfcloo@gmail.com.', 'School of Life Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong, China. irenelau@cuhk.edu.hk.', 'School of Life Sciences, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong, China. skkong@cuhk.edu.hk.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong, China. aaron.ho@bme.cuhk.edu.hk.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20171122,Switzerland,Micromachines (Basel),Micromachines,101640903,,,,PMC6190337,['NOTNLM'],"['aptamer', 'gold-nanorod', 'localized surface plasmon resonance']",2018/11/08 06:00,2018/11/08 06:01,['2018/11/08 06:00'],"['2017/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/10/31 00:00 [revised]', '2017/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/08 06:01 [medline]']","['mi8110338 [pii]', '10.3390/mi8110338 [doi]']",epublish,Micromachines (Basel). 2017 Nov 22;8(11). pii: mi8110338. doi: 10.3390/mi8110338.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-0355-8865'],['All authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This unequivocal relationship offers receptors as suitable targets of selection and biotechnological manipulation with the aim of obtaining virus-resistant poultry. This approach is further supported by the existence of natural knock-outs of receptor genes that segregate in inbred lines of chickens. We used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tools to introduce frame-shifting indel mutations into tva, tvc, and tvj loci encoding receptors for the A, C, and J ALV subgroups, respectively. For all three loci, the homozygous frame-shifting indels generating premature stop codons induced phenotypes which were fully resistant to the virus of respective subgroup. In the tvj locus, we also obtained in-frame deletions corroborating the importance of W38 and the four amino-acids preceding it.

Earlier reports suggested that overexpression of BCR-ABL1 either through amplification of BCR-ABL1 fusion gene or by the up regulation of BCR-ABL1 transcript level might be an early phenomenon in the establishment of IM resistance and disease evolution in CML. In the current study, we performed dual color dual fusion locus specific BCR/ABL1 FISH analysis along with karyotype analysis using GTG banding (G-banding using trypsin and Giemsa) technique in 489 patients with different clinical stages of CML at diagnosis or during the course of the disease to unravel the spectrum of BCR-ABL1 fusion gene amplification status. Among the study group analyzed, it was found that prevalence of occurrence of BCR-ABL1 fusion gene amplification was significantly higher in advanced stages of disease and in IM resistant CML-CP patients when compared to initial stage of disease, de novo CML-CP. Cytogenetic and metaphase FISH characterization on our study samples revealed that BCR-ABL1 fusion gene amplification was occurred through the formation of extra copies Ph chromosomes and isoderived Ph chromosomes. Current study suggests that unrestrained activity of BCR-ABL1 played a vital role in resistance to targeted therapy and disease evolution in CML. In our study population, patients in progressive stage CML and in IM resistant CP with multiple copies of BCR-ABL1 fusion gene displayed a poor response to targeted treatment with IM. Hence, the early identification of BCR-ABL1 fusion gene amplification using FISH technique will lead to improved interventions and outcome in future CML patients.","['Chandran, Ramachandran Krishna', 'Geetha, Narayanan', 'Sakthivel, Kunnathur Murugesan', 'Aswathy, Chandran Geetha', 'Gopinath, Preethi', 'Raj, Thampirajan Vimaladevi Akhila', 'Priya, Geetha', 'Nair, Jagathnath Krishna Kumarapillai Mohanan', 'Sreedharan, Hariharan']","['Chandran RK', 'Geetha N', 'Sakthivel KM', 'Aswathy CG', 'Gopinath P', 'Raj TVA', 'Priya G', 'Nair JKKM', 'Sreedharan H']","['Laboratory of Cytogenetics and Molecular Diagnostics, Division of Cancer Research, Regional Cancer Centre, Medical College Post, Thiruvananthapuram 695011, Kerala, India.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Regional Cancer Centre, Medical College Post, Thiruvananthapuram 695011, Kerala, India.', 'Laboratory of Cytogenetics and Molecular Diagnostics, Division of Cancer Research, Regional Cancer Centre, Medical College Post, Thiruvananthapuram 695011, Kerala, India; Department of Biochemistry, PSG College of Arts and Science, Civil Aerodrome Post, Coimbatore 641014, India.', 'Laboratory of Cytogenetics and Molecular Diagnostics, Division of Cancer Research, Regional Cancer Centre, Medical College Post, Thiruvananthapuram 695011, Kerala, India.', 'Laboratory of Cytogenetics and Molecular Diagnostics, Division of Cancer Research, Regional Cancer Centre, Medical College Post, Thiruvananthapuram 695011, Kerala, India.', 'Laboratory of Cytogenetics and Molecular Diagnostics, Division of Cancer Research, Regional Cancer Centre, Medical College Post, Thiruvananthapuram 695011, Kerala, India.', 'Laboratory of Cytogenetics and Molecular Diagnostics, Division of Cancer Research, Regional Cancer Centre, Medical College Post, Thiruvananthapuram 695011, Kerala, India.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Regional Cancer Centre, Medical College Post, Thiruvananthapuram 695011, Kerala, India.', 'Laboratory of Cytogenetics and Molecular Diagnostics, Division of Cancer Research, Regional Cancer Centre, Medical College Post, Thiruvananthapuram 695011, Kerala, India.

The optimal use of antileukemic agents in cooperative group protocols, central nervous system-directed treatment, improvements in supportive care, and recognition of biological, clinical, and treatment response characteristics that predict patients with a higher or a lower risk of treatment failure have improved 5-year event-free survival rates, reaching more than 85%, and 5-year overall survival rates, reaching more than 90%. Consequently, it has become increasingly important to characterize the occurrence of long-term late effects. ALL treatments have been associated with increased risks for adverse outcomes such as late mortality, secondary malignancies, and neurological, cardiac, endocrine, and social/psychological disorders. In recent decades, cooperative groups in Europe and in the United States have provided essential information about the long-term effects of ALL therapy, giving recommendations for screening as well as facilitating new approaches for reducing late-term morbidity and mortality. Current frontline protocols continue to examine ways to lower the intensity and amount of therapy to reduce late effects, whereas survivorship studies attempt to predict such adverse effects precisely and develop targeted prevention and treatment strategies.","['Kizilocak, Hande', 'Okcu, Fatih']","['Kizilocak H', 'Okcu F']","['Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Istanbul, Turkey', ""Texas Children's Hematology and Oncology Centers, Baylor College of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Houston, TX, USA""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180801,Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,,IM,"['Cancer Survivors', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Progression-Free Survival']",PMC6373511,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Cancer survivorship', '*Late effects']",2018/11/07 06:00,2019/03/13 06:00,['2018/11/07 06:00'],"['2018/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4274/tjh.galenos.2018.2018.0150 [doi]'],ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2019 Feb 7;36(1):1-11. doi: 10.4274/tjh.galenos.2018.2018.0150.

METHODS: We extracted demographics and clinical data from the SEER-18 registry for adult patients with MGs. The cases were separated based on the sequence of MG diagnosis relative to the other primary tumors: Group (A) One primary only or first primary of multiple primaries and Group (B) second primary or subsequent primary tumor. Incidences, frequencies, and glioma-related survivals were analyzed. RESULTS: Group B constituted 12.8% of new MG. The incidences of group B, relative to those of all new MG, range from 0.14 to 0.18. Compared to group A, group B exhibited an older age. Moreover, group B exhibited a higher proportion of females, Caucasians, smaller tumors, non-operative cases, and those receiving radiation (p < 0.05); the proportion with GTR remained comparable. Multiple groupings (oral cavity, digestive system, respiratory system, skin, breast, genital systems, urinary system, lymphoma) exhibited lower glioma-related observed survival (p < 0.05) compared to Group A. An active diagnosis of ""leukemia"" appears to confer longer glioma-related survival while a history of ""breast"" or ""digestive system"" malignancies portends a shorter glioma-related survival. CONCLUSION: For newly diagnosed MG, a high proportion does have history of extra-CNS primary tumors. Generally, these patients appear to have worse glioma-related observed survival compare to those with malignant glioma as the only primary or the first of multiple primary tumors. Knowledge regarding epidemiology, clinical factors, and observed survival can help guide clinical management/consultation for this subset of patients.","['Nguyen, Ha Son', 'Doan, Ninh B', 'Gelsomino, Michael', 'Shabani, Saman', 'Awad, Ahmed J', 'Kaushal, Mayank', 'Mortazavi, Martin M']","['Nguyen HS', 'Doan NB', 'Gelsomino M', 'Shabani S', 'Awad AJ', 'Kaushal M', 'Mortazavi MM']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.

It occurs due to an immunological imbalance and is responsible for intestinal mucosal lesions and complications such as fistulas and stenoses. Treatment aims to stabilize the disease, reducing the symptoms and healing intestinal lesions. Surgical procedures are common in patients. Cell therapy was initially used to treat this disease in patients who also suffered from lymphoma and leukemia and were considered to be good candidates for autologous and allogeneic transplantation. After transplantation, an improvement was also observed in their CD. In 2003, the procedure began to be used to treat the disease itself, and several case series and randomized studies have been published since then; this approach currently comprises a new option in the treatment of CD. However, considerable doubt along with significant gaps in our knowledge continue to exist in relation to cell therapy for CD. Cell therapy is currently restricted to the autologous modality of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and, experimentally, to mesenchymal stromal cells to directly treat lesions of the anal mucosa. This article presents the supporting claims for transplantation as well as aspects related to the mobilization regime, conditioning and perspectives of cell therapy.","['Ruiz, Milton Artur', 'Kaiser Junior, Roberto Luiz', 'Piron-Ruiz, Lilian', 'Pena-Arciniegas, Tatiana', 'Saran, Priscila Samara', 'De Quadros, Luiz Gustavo']","['Ruiz MA', 'Kaiser Junior RL', 'Piron-Ruiz L', 'Pena-Arciniegas T', 'Saran PS', 'De Quadros LG']","['Bone Marrow Transplant Department, Associacao Portuguesa de Beneficencia, Sao Jose do Rio Preto, SP 15090 470, Brazil. milruiz@yahoo.com.br.', 'Bone Marrow Transplant Department, Associacao Portuguesa de Beneficencia, Sao Jose do Rio Preto, SP 15090 470, Brazil.', 'Bone Marrow Transplant Department, Associacao Portuguesa de Beneficencia, Sao Jose do Rio Preto, SP 15090 470, Brazil.', 'Bone Marrow Transplant Department, Associacao Portuguesa de Beneficencia, Sao Jose do Rio Preto, SP 15090 470, Brazil.', 'Bone Marrow Transplant Department, Associacao Portuguesa de Beneficencia, Sao Jose do Rio Preto, SP 15090 470, Brazil.', 'Bone Marrow Transplant Department, Associacao Portuguesa de Beneficencia, Sao Jose do Rio Preto, SP 15090 470, Brazil.']",['eng'],,['Editorial'],,United States,World J Stem Cells,World journal of stem cells,101535826,,,,PMC6212546,['NOTNLM'],"[""Crohn's disease"", 'Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Stem cell therapy', 'Treatment']",2018/11/07 06:00,2018/11/07 06:01,['2018/11/07 06:00'],"['2018/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/15 00:00 [revised]', '2018/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4252/wjsc.v10.i10.134 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Stem Cells. 2018 Oct 26;10(10):134-137. doi: 10.4252/wjsc.v10.i10.134.,,"['Conflict-of-interest statement: The authors have no conflict of interest to', 'declare.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Demographic data, and relevant laboratory and clinical parameters were analyzed, emphasizing the outcome after first-line treatment with cladribine. RESULTS: Data on 203 patients was collected from 12 medical centers during 1985-2015. Mean and median follow-up were 7.5 years and 5.18 years (interquartile range=0.1-40 years), and 5- and 10-year survival were 96% and 90.62%, respectively. The median age of diagnosis was 55.5 years for Jews and 49 years for Arabs (p=0.021), and most patients were males (81.77%); 52.2% were Ashkenazi Jews, 36.1% Sephardic Jews and 11.7% were Arab, Druze or other ethnicity. Cladribine was given to 159 patients (80.7%%) and most (62%) received intravenous (i.v.) and 38% received subcutaneous (s.c.) therapy. Overall survival and time to next treatment were not significantly different between the two schedules (i.v., s.c.).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Myeloid and T-lymphoblastic leukaemia cell lines (NB4, THP-1, Jurkat, and DND-41) were transfected with small interfering RNAs targeting the glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1) and catenin beta-1 (CTNNB1) genes involved in the regulation of HH and WNT pathways, respectively, and we examined cell proliferation and gene expression. RESULTS: The knockdown of GLI1 and CTNNB1 did not significantly affect proliferation of any cell line; however, it up-regulated the expression of NOTCH1, cleaved NOTCH1 fragment, and phosphorylated mTOR in NB4 cells, but not in the other cell lines. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that HH and WNT act upstream of NOTCH and mTOR pathways and negatively regulate them in myeloid NB4 cells.

Therefore, potent and effective compounds for treatment of this cancer type are essential. Phoyunnanin E, isolated from Dendrobium venustum (Orchidaceae), has promising pharmacological activities; however, it is unknown if phoyunnanin E affects apoptosis of lung cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The apoptosis-inducing activity of phoyunnanin E on H460 lung cancer cells was investigated by Hoechst 33342, and annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide staining. The underlying mechanism was determined via monitoring apoptosis-regulatory proteins by western blot analysis. The apoptotic effect of the compound was confirmed in H23 lung cancer cells. RESULTS: Phoyunnanin E significantly induced apoptotic cell death of H460 lung cancer cells, as indicated by condensed and fragmented nuclei with the activation of caspase-3 and -9 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Phoyunnanin E mediated apoptosis via a p53-dependent pathway by increasing the accumulation of cellular p53 protein. As a consequence, anti-apoptotic proteins including induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein (MCL1) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) were found to be significantly depleted, while pro-apoptotic BCL-2-associated X protein (BAX) protein was up-regulated. Furthermore, it was found that expression of an inhibitor of apoptosis, survivin, markedly reduced in response to phoyunnanin E treatment. The apoptosis-inducting effect was also found in phoyunnanin E-treated H23 lung cancer cells. CONCLUSION: These results indicate the promising effect of phoyunnanin E in induction of apoptosis, that may be useful for the development of novel anticancer agents.","['Phiboonchaiyanan, Preeyaporn Plaimee', 'Petpiroon, Nalinrat', 'Sritularak, Boonchoo', 'Chanvorachote, Pithi']","['Phiboonchaiyanan PP', 'Petpiroon N', 'Sritularak B', 'Chanvorachote P']","['Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Rangsit University, Pathumthani, Thailand.', 'Cell-based Drug and Health Product Development Research Unit, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Cell-based Drug and Health Product Development Research Unit, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Botany, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Cell-based Drug and Health Product Development Research Unit, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand pithi.c@chula.ac.th pithi_chan@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Phenanthrenes)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (phoyunnanin E)']",IM,"['Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Phenanthrenes/*pharmacology', 'Survivin', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Dendrobium venustum', 'Phoyunnanin E', 'apoptosis', 'lung cancer']",2018/11/07 06:00,2018/11/09 06:00,['2018/11/07 06:00'],"['2018/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/05 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/09 06:00 [medline]']","['38/11/6281 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.12984 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2018 Nov;38(11):6281-6290. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.12984.,,,"['Copyright(c) 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: TAK-733 alone at 5 muM significantly reduced MAPK activity and did not influence viability and apoptosis in HL60 cells. Voreloxin at concentration of 0.03-0.48 muM reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis rate. Incubation with both drugs caused further inhibition of cell viability and increased apoptosis associated with generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nuclear translocation of AIF.

Optimal conditioning intensity for allo-HCT for CML in the era of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is unknown. Using the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research database, we sought to determine whether reduced-intensity/nonmyeloablative conditioning (RIC) allo-HCT and myeloablative conditioning (MAC) result in similar outcomes in CML patients. We evaluated 1395 CML allo-HCT recipients between the ages of 18 and 60 years. The disease status at transplant was divided into the following categories: chronic phase 1, chronic phase 2 or greater, and accelerated phase. Patients in blast phase at transplant and alternative donor transplants were excluded. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS) after allo-HCT. MAC (n = 1204) and RIC allo-HCT recipients (n = 191) from 2007 to 2014 were included. Patient, disease, and transplantation characteristics were similar, with a few exceptions. Multivariable analysis showed no significant difference in OS between MAC and RIC groups. In addition, leukemia-free survival and nonrelapse mortality did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. Compared with MAC, the RIC group had a higher risk of early relapse after allo-HCT (hazard ratio [HR], 1.85; P = .001). The cumulative incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) was lower with RIC than with MAC (HR, 0.77; P = .02). RIC provides similar survival and lower cGVHD compared with MAC and therefore may be a reasonable alternative to MAC for CML patients in the TKI era.","['Chhabra, Saurabh', 'Ahn, Kwang Woo', 'Hu,

We conducted a phase I dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and feasibility of a single infusion of NKG2D-chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, without lymphodepleting conditioning in subjects with acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome or relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Autologous T cells were transfected with a gamma-retroviral vector encoding a CAR fusing human NKG2D with the CD3zeta signaling domain. Four dose levels (1 x 10(6)-3 x 10(7) total viable T cells) were evaluated. Twelve subjects were infused [7 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 5 multiple myeloma]. NKG2D-CAR products demonstrated a median 75% vector-driven NKG2D expression on CD3(+) T cells. No dose-limiting toxicities, cytokine release syndrome, or CAR T cell-related neurotoxicity was observed. No significant autoimmune reactions were noted, and none of the >/= grade 3 adverse events were attributable to NKG2D-CAR T cells. At the single injection of low cell doses used in this trial, no objective tumor responses were observed. However, hematologic parameters transiently improved in one subject with AML at the highest dose, and cases of disease stability without further therapy or on subsequent treatments were noted.

Aims: To determine the cytotoxic effects of flavonoids and drug resistance related to P-gp on K562 human chronic myeloid leukemia cells. We also aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of imatinib and flavonoid combinations. Study Design: Cell culture study. Methods: In this study, K562 cells were treated with apigenin, luteolin, 5-desmethyl sinensetin and the anticancer drug imatinib mesylate. The effect of flavonoids on K562 cell proliferation was detected using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl)2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Concentrations of apigenin, luteolin, and 5-desmethyl sinensetin ranging from 25 to 200 muM and of imatinib from 5 to 50 muM administered for 72 h were studied. Apoptosis/necrosis and P-gp activity were measured using flow cytometry. The combined effects of different concentrations of flavonoids with imatinib were evaluated according to combination index values calculated using CompuSyn software. Results: In our study, the IC50 values for apigenin, luteolin, and 5-desmethyl sinensetin were found to be 140 muM, 100 muM, and >200 muM, respectively. Luteolin (100 muM) had the highest cytotoxic activity of these flavonoids. These results were statistically significant (p<0.05). Among the flavonoids studied, the combination of luteolin and imatinib was the most effective and is therefore recommended for its cytotoxic activity in the K562 cell line. After 72 h of incubation at their respective IC50 concentrations, all flavonoids were associated with an apoptosis rate of approximately 50%. P-glycoprotein activity was increased in all groups. Combination treatment may provide better outcomes in terms of cytotoxicity and thus reduce the dosages of imatinib used. Conclusion: The combination of some flavonoids and imatinib mesylate may increase the cytotoxic effect; However, the antagonistic effect should be considered in combined use on k562 cells.","['Danisman Kalindemirtas, Ferdane', 'Birman, Husniye', 'Candoken, Eda', 'Bilgis Gazioglu, Sema', 'Melikoglu, Gulay', 'Kuruca, Serap']","['Danisman Kalindemirtas F', 'Birman H', 'Candoken E', 'Bilgis Gazioglu S', 'Melikoglu G', 'Kuruca S']","['Department of Physiology, Istanbul University Istanbul School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Department of Physiology, Istanbul University Istanbul School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Department of Biochemistry, Istanbul University Istanbul School of Pharmacy, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Department of Immunology, Istanbul University Institute of Experimental Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Department of Pharmacognosy, Istanbul University Istanbul School of Pharmacy, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Department of Physiology, Istanbul University Istanbul School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181105,Turkey,Balkan Med J,Balkan medical journal,101571817,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cytotoxins/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Data Analysis', 'Flavonoids/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'K562 Cells/*drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics']",PMC6409953,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cell culture', '*cell cytotoxicity', '*flavonoids', '*imatinib mesylate', '*K562 cells']",2018/11/07 06:00,2019/07/31 06:00,['2018/11/07 06:00'],"['2018/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4274/balkanmedj.galenos.2018.2017.1244 [doi]'],ppublish,Balkan Med J. 2019 Feb 28;36(2):96-105. doi: 10.4274/balkanmedj.galenos.2018.2017.1244.

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. SETTING: A literature search was performed using MEDLINE, PUBMED, CINAHL, and EMBASE until May 2017. Only randomized controlled trials were included, and a meta-analysis was carried out where appropriate. PATIENT(S): Women undergoing IVF treatment with or without a history of recurrent implantation failure and women with idiopathic RPL. INTERVENTION(S): Assessment of the efficacy of commonly used immunomodulators such as IV use of [1] immunoglobulin, [2] lymphocyte immunotherapy and [3] intralipid; intrauterine infusion of [4] granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and [5] peripheral blood mononuclear cells; subcutaneous administration of [6] TNF-alpha inhibitors, [7] leukaemia inhibitory factor; and oral administration of [8] glucocorticoids. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The primary outcomes were live birth rate and miscarriage rate; secondary outcome was clinical pregnancy rate. RESULT(S): Of the 7,226 publications identified, 53 were selected during the initial screening; 30 satisfied the selection criteria and were included in this review. CONCLUSION(S): The available medical literature shows controversial results about the role of immunotherapy when used for improving reproductive outcomes. This study did not show a role for immunotherapy in improving the live birth rate in women undergoing IVF treatment or in the prevention of idiopathic RPL. Currently, immunotherapy should be used in the context of research and should not be used in routine clinical practice to improve reproductive outcomes.","['Achilli, Chiara', 'Duran-Retamal, Montserrat', 'Saab, Wael', 'Serhal, Paul', 'Seshadri, Srividya']","['Achilli C', 'Duran-Retamal M', 'Saab W', 'Serhal P', 'Seshadri S']","['Centre for Reproductive and Genetic Health, London, United Kingdom.

Emerging evidence suggest that immune alterations favor leukemogenesis and/or AML relapse thereby negatively impacting disease outcome. Over the last years myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) have been gaining momentum in the field of cancer research. MDSCs are a heterogeneous cell population morphologically resembling either monocytes or granulocytes and sharing some key features including myeloid origin, aberrant (immature) phenotype, and immunosuppressive activity. Increasing evidence suggests that accumulating MDSCs are involved in hampering anti-tumor immune responses and immune-based therapies. Here, we demonstrate increased frequencies of CD14(+) monocytic MDSCs in newly diagnosed AML that co-express CD33 but lack HLA-DR (HLA-DR(lo)). AML-blasts induce HLA-DR(lo) cells from healthy donor-derived monocytes in vitro that suppress T-cells and express indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). We investigated whether a CD33/CD3-bispecific BiTE(R) antibody construct (AMG 330) with pre-clinical activity against AML-blasts by redirection of T-cells can eradicate CD33(+) MDSCs. In fact, T-cells eliminate IDO(+)CD33(+) MDSCs in the presence of AMG 330. Depletion of total CD14(+) cells (including MDSCs) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from AML patients did not enhance AMG 330-triggered T-cell activation and expansion, but boosted AML-blast lysis. This finding was corroborated in experiments showing that adding MDSCs into co-cultures of T- and AML-cells reduced AML-blast killing, while IDO inhibition promotes AMG 330-mediated clearance of AML-blasts. Taken together, our results suggest that AMG 330 may achieve anti-leukemic efficacy not only through T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity against AML-blasts but also against CD33(+) MDSCs, suggesting that it is worth exploring the predictive role of MDSCs for responsiveness towards an AMG 330-based therapy.","['Jitschin, Regina', 'Saul, Domenica', 'Braun, Martina', 'Tohumeken, Sehmus', 'Volkl, Simon', 'Kischel, Roman', 'Lutteropp, Michael', 'Dos Santos, Cedric', 'Mackensen, Andreas', 'Mougiakakos, Dimitrios']","['Jitschin R', 'Saul D', 'Braun M', 'Tohumeken S', 'Volkl S', 'Kischel R', 'Lutteropp M', 'Dos Santos C', 'Mackensen A', 'Mougiakakos D']","['Department of Internal Medicine 5, Hematology and Oncology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Ulmenweg 18, 91054, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5, Hematology and Oncology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Ulmenweg 18, 91054, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5, Hematology and Oncology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Ulmenweg 18, 91054, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5, Hematology and Oncology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Ulmenweg 18, 91054, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5, Hematology and Oncology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Ulmenweg 18, 91054, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Amgen Research GmbH, Munich, Germany.', 'Amgen Research GmbH, Munich, Germany.', 'Clinical Biomarkers and Diagnostics, Amgen Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5, Hematology and Oncology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Ulmenweg 18, 91054, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5, Hematology and Oncology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Ulmenweg 18, 91054, Erlangen, Germany. dimitrios.mougiakakos@uk-erlangen.de.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181105,England,J Immunother Cancer,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,101620585,"['0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)']",IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells/*immunology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3/*metabolism']",PMC6217777,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Bispecific antibodies', '*Myeloid derived suppressor cells']",2018/11/07 06:00,2019/10/28 06:00,['2018/11/07 06:00'],"['2018/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40425-018-0432-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s40425-018-0432-9 [pii]']",epublish,J Immunother Cancer. 2018 Nov 5;6(1):116. doi: 10.1186/s40425-018-0432-9.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-2817-6660'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we demonstrated that supplementation with SCF increases the hematopoietic differentiation of hPSCs via the interaction with its receptor tyrosine kinase c-KIT, which is modulated by miR-221 and miR-222. c-KIT is comparably expressed in undifferentiated human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells. The inhibition of SCF signaling via treatment with a c-KIT antagonist (imatinib) during hPSC-derived hematopoiesis resulted in reductions in the yield and multi-lineage potential of hematopoietic progenitors. We found that the transcript levels of miR-221 and miR-222 targeting c-KIT were significantly lower in the pluripotent state than they were in terminally differentiated somatic cells. Furthermore, suppression of miR-221 and miR-222 in undifferentiated hPSC cultures induced more hematopoiesis by increasing c-KIT expression. Collectively, our data implied that the modulation of c-KIT by miRs may provide further potential strategies to expedite the generation of functional blood cells for therapeutic approaches and the study of the cellular machinery related to hematologic malignant diseases such as leukemia.","['Lee, Ji Yoon', 'Kim, MyungJoo', 'Heo, Hye-Ryeon', 'Ha, Kwon-Soo', 'Han, Eun-Taek', 'Park, Won Sun', 'Yang, Se-Ran', 'Hong, Seok-Ho']","['Lee JY', 'Kim M', 'Heo HR', 'Ha KS', 'Han ET', 'Park WS', 'Yang SR', 'Hong SH']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Stem Cell Institute, CHA University, Seongnam, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 24341, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 24341, Korea.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 24341, Korea.', 'Department of Medical Environmental Biology and Tropical Medicine, School of Medicine, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 24341, Korea.', 'Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 24341, Korea.', 'Department of Thoracic & Cardiovascular Surgery, School of Medicine, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 24341, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 24341, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181101,Korea (South),Mol Cells,Molecules and cells,9610936,"['0 (MIRN221 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN222 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cell Factor/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC6277561,['NOTNLM'],"['SCF', 'c-KIT', 'hPSCs', 'hematopoiesis', 'miR-221/222']",2018/11/07 06:00,2019/01/12 06:00,['2018/11/07 06:00'],"['2018/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/27 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/11/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['molcells.2018.0244 [pii]', '10.14348/molcells.2018.0244 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cells. 2018 Nov 30;41(11):971-978. doi: 10.14348/molcells.2018.0244.

Besides the translocation t(8; 21) that leads to the RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion, somatic mutations of RUNX1 have been discovered. METHODS: Four bone marrow trephine biopsies of patients with CD79a-positive and/or PAX5-positive acute leukemias were investigated by immunohistochemistry (IHC), karyotyping, and next-generation sequencing-based genetic analysis. Data were then compared to a historical collective of AML (n = 42) and 42 cases of AML newly diagnosed at our institution between June 2017 and May 2018. RESULTS: We report on 4 cases of acute leukemia with an equivocal immunophenotype showing expression of CD79a and/or PAX5, which led to a preliminary histopathologic classification as probable ALL/unclassifiable acute leukemia. All cases were positive for CD34 and TdT but negative for several myeloid markers on IHC. Mutational analysis revealed point mutations and indels of RUNX1 and further mutations typical for AML such as TET2, DNMT3A, and SRSF2, and 2 cases had tetrasomy 13 characteristic of RUNX1 mutant AML. CONCLUSION: Aberrant CD79a and/or PAX5 expression can be found in AML cases with RUNX1 mutations even without the translocation t(8; 21). Our series shows the expression of CD79a and PAX5 to be a potential pitfall in the classification of RUNX1 mutant acute leukemia.","['Menter, Thomas', 'Lundberg, Pontus', 'Wenzel, Friedel', 'Dirks, Jan', 'Fernandez, Paula', 'Friess, Dorothea', 'Dirnhofer, Stefan', 'Tzankov, Alexandar']","['Menter T', 'Lundberg P', 'Wenzel F', 'Dirks J', 'Fernandez P', 'Friess D', 'Dirnhofer S', 'Tzankov A']","['Institute of Pathology and Medical Genetics, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Pathology and Medical Genetics, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cantonal Hospital Aarau, Aarau, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematology, Cantonal Hospital Olten, Olten, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Pathology and Medical Genetics, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Pathology and Medical Genetics, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland, alexandar.tzankov@usb.ch.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20181105,Switzerland,Pathobiology,"Pathobiology : journal of immunopathology, molecular and cellular biology",9007504,"['0 (CD79 Antigens)', '0 (CD79A protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)']",,"['Adult', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'CD79 Antigens/*genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/diagnosis/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Acute myelogenous leukemia', 'CD79a', 'PAX5', 'RUNX1']",2018/11/06 06:00,2019/08/10 06:00,['2018/11/06 06:00'],"['2018/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/10 06:00 [medline]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['000493688 [pii]', '10.1159/000493688 [doi]']",ppublish,Pathobiology. 2019;86(2-3):162-166. doi: 10.1159/000493688.

Dox structure modification could be used to develop conjugates with an improved biological profile, such as antiproliferative activity and higher cellular retention. Thus, Dox thiol conjugates, Dox thiol (Dox-SH), thiol-reactive Dox-SS-pyridine (SS=disulfide), and a Dox-SS-cell-penetrating cyclic peptide, Dox-SS-[C(WR)4K], were synthesized. Dox was reacted with Traut's reagent to generate Dox-SH. The thiol group was activated by the reaction with dithiodipyridine to afford the corresponding Dox-SS-Pyridine (Dox-SS-Pyr). A cyclic cell-penetrating peptide containing a cysteine residue [C(WR)4K] was prepared using Fmoc solid-phase strategy. Dox-SS-Py was reacted with the free sulfhydryl of cysteine in [C(WR)4K] to generate Dox-SS-[C(WR)4K] as a Dox-cyclic peptide conjugate. Cytotoxicity of the compounds was examined in human embryonic kidney (HEK-293), human ovarian cancer (SKOV-3), human fibrosarcoma (HT-1080), and human leukemia (CCRF-CEM) cells. Dox-SH and Dox-SS-pyridine were found to have significantly higher or comparable cytotoxicity when compared to Dox in HEK-293, HT-1080, and CCRF-CEM cells after 24h and 72 incubation, presumably because of higher activity and retention of the compounds in these cells. Furthermore, Dox-SS-[C(WR)4K] showed significantly higher cytotoxic activity in HEK-293, HT-1080, and SKOV-3cells when compared with Dox after 72h incubation. Dox-SS-Pyr exhibited higher cellular uptake than Dox-SS-[C(WR)4K] in HT-1080 and HEK-293cells as shown by flow cytometry. Fluorescence microscopy exhibited that Dox-SS-Pyr, Dox-SH, and Dox-SS-[C(WR)4K] localized in the nucleus as shown in four cell lines, HT-1080, SKOV-3, MDA-MB-468, and MCF-7. Of note, Dox-SS-[C(WR)4K] was significantly less toxic in mouse myoblast cells compared to Dox at the same concentration. Further mechanistic study demonstrated that the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in myoblast cells exposed to Dox-SS-[C(WR)4K] was reduced in comparison of Dox when co-treated with FeCl2. These data indicate that Dox-SH, Dox-SS-Pyr, and Dox-SS-[C(WR)4K] have the potential to be further examined as Dox alternatives and anticancer agents.","['Darwish, Shaban', 'Sadeghiani, Neda', 'Fong, Shirley', 'Mozaffari, Saghar', 'Hamidi, Parinaz', 'Withana, Thimanthi', 'Yang, Sun', 'Tiwari, Rakesh Kumar', 'Parang, Keykavous']","['Darwish S', 'Sadeghiani N', 'Fong S', 'Mozaffari S', 'Hamidi P', 'Withana T', 'Yang S', 'Tiwari RK', 'Parang K']","['Center for Targeted Drug Delivery, Department of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chapman University School of Pharmacy, Harry and Diane Rinker Health Science Campus, Irvine, CA, 92618, United States; Organometallic and Organometalloid Chemistry Department, National Research Centre, El Bohouth st, Dokki, Giza, Egypt.', 'Center for Targeted Drug Delivery, Department of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chapman University School of Pharmacy, Harry and Diane Rinker Health Science Campus, Irvine, CA, 92618, United States.', 'Center for Targeted Drug Delivery, Department of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chapman University School of Pharmacy, Harry and Diane Rinker Health Science Campus, Irvine, CA, 92618, United States.', 'Center for Targeted Drug Delivery, Department of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chapman University School of Pharmacy, Harry and Diane Rinker Health Science Campus, Irvine, CA, 92618, United States.', 'Center for Targeted Drug Delivery, Department of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chapman University School of Pharmacy, Harry and Diane Rinker Health Science Campus, Irvine, CA, 92618, United States.', 'Department of Pharmacy Practice, Chapman University School of Pharmacy, Harry and Diane Rinker Health Science Campus, Irvine, CA, 92618, United States.', 'Department of Pharmacy Practice, Chapman University School of Pharmacy, Harry and Diane Rinker Health Science Campus, Irvine, CA, 92618, United States.', 'Center for Targeted Drug Delivery, Department of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chapman University School of Pharmacy, Harry and Diane Rinker Health Science Campus, Irvine, CA, 92618, United States.

Activating PKCalpha induces WT1 gene expression via signalling through downstream JNK and c-JUN. In the present study, the effect of c-JUN/AP-1 binding and transcriptional regulation of the WT1 gene promoter was investigated in K562 leukaemic cells. The non-cytotoxic dose (IC20 values) of curcumin (WT1 and AP-1 inhibitors) was employed to examine its effect on WT1 gene-mediated WT1 and AP-1 protein expression. Non-cytotoxic doses of both tanshinone IIA (AP-1 DNA-binding inhibitor) and SP600125 (JNK inhibitor) were used to test the role of c-JUN/AP-1 in WT1 gene expression. Curcumin, tanshinone IIA, and SP600125 inhibited WT1 protein expression in a dose-dependent manner (5-15muM) at 24h as shown by immunoblotting. A ChIP assay showed that curcumin and tanshinone IIA inhibited AP-1 and WT1 binding to the proximal WT1 promoter (-301bp), and a luciferase reporter assay showed that the WT1 luciferase gene reporter activity was decreased after curcumin, tanshinone IIA, and SP600126 treatments. Furthermore, depletion of c-JUN abrogated WT1 gene expression. In summary, AP-1 contributes to the WT1 autoregulation of WT1 gene expression in leukaemic K562 cells.","['Anuchapreeda, Songyot', 'Rungrojsakul, Methee', 'Tima, Singkome', 'Chiampanichayakul, Sawitree', 'Krig, Sheryl R']","['Anuchapreeda S', 'Rungrojsakul M', 'Tima S', 'Chiampanichayakul S', 'Krig SR']","['Department of Medical Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand; Cancer Research Unit of Associated Medical Sciences (AMS-CRU), Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand; Center for Research and Development of Natural Products for Health, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.

In this study, we established a doxorubicin (ADM)-resistant THP-1 AML cell line (THP-1/ADM). A high-throughput microarray was used to identify circRNA expression profiles of THP-1/ADM cells and naive THP-1 cells. The identified potential functional circRNA molecule was further validated in THP-1/ADM cells and bone marrow (BM) specimens from 42 AML patients. The interactions with target microRNAs (miRNAs) and downstream messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were also explored. As a result, 49 circRNAs that are significantly differentially expressed between THP-1/ADM and THP-1 cells were identified. Of these circRNAs, downregulation of circPAN3 by small interfering RNA significantly restored ADM sensitivity of THP-1/ADM cells. Furthermore, BM samples from patients with refractory and recurrent AML showed increased expression of circPAN3. A detailed circRNA/miRNA/mRNA interaction network was predicated for this circRNA. Subsequent mechanistic experiments showed that downregulation of circPAN3 could decrease the expression of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), but this effect was counteracted by miR-153-3p or miR-183-5p specific inhibitors. Luciferase experiments further demonstrated that these molecules are involved in the circPAN3 regulatory network. Our results revealed that circPAN3 may be a key mediator for chemoresistance of AML cells, which may depend on the circPAN3-miR-153-5p/miR-183-5p-XIAP axis. Our findings provide evidence that circPAN3 can be a valuable indicator for predicting clinical efficacy of chemotherapy in AML patients and also can serve as a potential target for reversing drug resistance in AML.","['Shang, Jin', 'Chen, Wei-Min', 'Wang, Zhi-Hong', 'Wei, Tian-Nan', 'Chen, Zhi-Zhong', 'Wu, Wen-Bing']","['Shang J', 'Chen WM', 'Wang ZH', 'Wei TN', 'Chen ZZ', 'Wu WB']","['Provincial Clinical Medical College of Fujian Medical University; Department of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.', 'Provincial Clinical Medical College of Fujian Medical University; Department of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.

Our previous studies have uncovered that the predominant isoform elavl1a is required for zebrafish embryonic erythropoiesis. However, the exact mechanism of how elav11 spatiotemporally stabilizes target mRNAs to regulate specific erythropoiesis is not yet understood. Here we show that phosphorylation of elavl1a at Ser219 and Ser316 by PKC is necessarily required for cytosolic shuttling from the nucleus to stabilize gata1 mRNA and thus promotes erythropoiesis. Knockdown of elavl1a resulted in the hindrance of erythropoiesis and Hemin-induced erythroid differentiation of human myeloid leukemia K562 cells. Interestingly, inhibition of PKC reproduced the phenotype seen during zebrafish embryogenesis and erythroid differentiation of myeloid leukemia. Mechanistically, Hemin induced elavl1a export from nuclear to cytoplasmic space in K562 cells in a manner dependent on phosphorylation on Ser219 and Ser316, as overexpression of elavl1a with mutations on Ser219 and Ser316 resulted in erythropoiesis failure. Additionally, co-administration of low doses of elavl1a morpholino (MO) and three PKC inhibitors showed a combined effect in zebrafish embryonic erythropoiesis dysplasia. In conclusion, our study reveals that PKC-mediated phosphorylation of elavl1a at Ser219 and Ser316 sites controls its nucleo-cytoplasmic translocation in zebrafish, thereby regulating embryonic erythropoiesis.","['Zhou, Xianyong', 'Wang, Shao', 'Zheng, Miaomiao', 'Kuver, Aarti', 'Wan, Xiaoyang', 'Dai, Kezhi', 'Li, Xi']","['Zhou X', 'Wang S', 'Zheng M', 'Kuver A', 'Wan X', 'Dai K', 'Li X']","['School of Mental Health, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China; The Affiliated Kangning Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'School of Mental Health, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China; The Affiliated Kangning Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'The Affiliated Kangning Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'The Affiliated Kangning Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Institute of Infectious Liver Disease, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China.', 'School of Mental Health, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China; The Affiliated Kangning Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.

After exposing cancerous (17) and non-cancerous (2) cells to PND for 72 hr, PND was found to exhibit consistent and potent cytotoxic activity at low micromolar (muM) concentrations that ranged from 1.6 muM to 9.4 muM. Moreover, PND exerted a significant selective cytotoxicity index (SCI) on five out of seven breast cancer cell lines tested, with favorable values of 2.5 to 4.4, as compared with the non-cancerous breast MCF-10A cell line. By using the same comparison, PND exhibited a significant SCI on three out of four leukemia/lymphoma cell lines with promising values of 3.3 to 3.5. One breast cancer and one leukemia cell line were tested further in order to determine the likely mode of action of PND. PND was found to consistently elicit phosphatidylserine externalization, mitochondrial depolarization, and DNA fragmentation, in both the triple negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer and HL-60 leukemia cell lines. In addition, PND treatment altered cell cycle progression in both cancer cells. Subsequent DNA mobility-shift assays, UV-Visible spectroscopic titrations, and circular dichroism (CD) experiments revealed that PND intercalates with DNA. The findings presented in this study indicates that PND induces apoptosis and interfered with cell cycle progression of cancer cell lines and these results indicate that this drug has the potential as a repurposed drug for cancer therapy.","['Villanueva, Paulina J', 'Martinez, Alberto', 'Baca, Sarah T', 'DeJesus, Rebecca E', 'Larragoity, Manuel', 'Contreras, Lisett', 'Gutierrez, Denisse A', 'Varela-Ramirez, Armando', 'Aguilera, Renato J']","['Villanueva PJ', 'Martinez A', 'Baca ST', 'DeJesus RE', 'Larragoity M', 'Contreras L', 'Gutierrez DA', 'Varela-Ramirez A', 'Aguilera RJ']","['The Cytometry, Screening and Imaging Core Facility & Border Biomedical Research Center & Department of Biological Sciences, the University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, Texas, United States of America.', 'Chemistry Department, New York City College of Technology, The City University of New York, Brooklyn, New York, United States of America.', 'The Cytometry, Screening and Imaging Core Facility & Border Biomedical Research Center & Department of Biological Sciences, the University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, Texas, United States of America.', 'The Cytometry, Screening and Imaging Core Facility & Border Biomedical Research Center & Department of Biological Sciences, the University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, Texas, United States of America.', 'The Cytometry, Screening and Imaging Core Facility & Border Biomedical Research Center & Department of Biological Sciences, the University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, Texas, United States of America.', 'The Cytometry, Screening and Imaging Core Facility & Border Biomedical Research Center & Department of Biological Sciences, the University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, Texas, United States of America.', 'The Cytometry, Screening and Imaging Core Facility & Border Biomedical Research Center & Department of Biological Sciences, the University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, Texas, United States of America.', 'The Cytometry, Screening and Imaging Core Facility & Border Biomedical Research Center & Department of Biological Sciences, the University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, Texas, United States of America.', 'The Cytometry, Screening and Imaging Core Facility & Border Biomedical Research Center & Department of Biological Sciences, the University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, Texas, United States of America.']",['eng'],['R25 GM069621/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181105,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Naphthyridines)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'TD3P7Q3SG6 (pyronaridine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Naphthyridines/*pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylserines/metabolism']",PMC6218039,,,2018/11/06 06:00,2019/04/09 06:00,['2018/11/06 06:00'],"['2018/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0206467 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-18185 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2018 Nov 5;13(11):e0206467. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0206467. eCollection 2018.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-3765-2793'],['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A multicenter, open-label treatment protocol provided early access to daratumumab for patients who had progressive MM after they received >/=3 prior lines of therapy that included a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent or if they were refractory to both a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent. Patients received daratumumab 16 mg/kg weekly for 8 weeks, every other week for 16 weeks, and monthly until they developed disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or 60 days after the drug gained US approval. Treatment-emergent grade >/=3 adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, and AEs of special interest were collected. RESULTS: Three hundred forty-eight patients were enrolled at 39 US sites between June and December 2015. Patients received study therapy for a median of 1.9 months (range, 0.03-6.0 months). Fifty-two percent of patients transitioned to commercially-available daratumumab and 37% discontinued because of progressive disease. Grade >/=3 AEs occurred in 50% of patients, including thrombocytopenia (15%) and anemia (14%). Serious AEs occurred in 35% of patients (12% were drug-related), including infections (11%). Infusion reactions occurred in 56%, 2%, and 2% of patients during the first, second, and all subsequent infusions, respectively; respiratory symptoms (cough, dyspnea, throat irritation, nasal congestion) were common. The infusion reaction rate for the first infusion was 38% in 50 patients at 2 sites who received montelukast as premedication for their first infusion and 59% in patients who did not receive montelukast.

To address this, we designed two different relevant OSCC chemoresistant models: (i) acquired chemoresistant cells, where OSCC lines were treated with conventional chemotherapy for a prolonged period to develop chemoresistance, and (ii) chemoresistant patient-derived cells, where primary cells were established from tumor of neoadjuvant-treated OSCC patients who do not respond to TPF. Among all Bcl-2 antiapoptotic members, Mcl-1 expression (but not Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL) was found to be upregulated in both chemoresistant OSCC lines and chemoresistant tumors when compared with their respective sensitive counterparts. Irrespective of all three chemotherapy drugs, Mcl-1 expression was elevated in OSCC cells that are resistant to either cisplatin or 5FU or docetaxel. In chemoresistant OSCC, Mcl-1 mRNA was upregulated by signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation, and the protein was stabilized by AKT-mediated glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3beta) inactivation. Genetic (siRNA) or pharmacological (Triptolide, a transcriptional repressor of Mcl-1) inhibition of Mcl-1 induces drug-mediated cell death in chemoresistant OSCC. In patient-derived xenograft model of advanced stage and chemoresistant OSCC tumor, Triptolide restores cisplatin-mediated cell death and facilitates significant reduction of tumor burdens. Overall, our data suggest Mcl-1 dependency of chemoresistant OSCC. A combination regimen of Mcl-1 inhibitor with conventional chemotherapy deserves further clinical investigation in advanced OSCC.","['Maji, Santanu', 'Shriwas, Omprakash', 'Samal, Sabindra K', 'Priyadarshini, Manashi', 'Rath, Rachna', 'Panda, Sanjay', 'Das Majumdar, Saroj Kumar', 'Muduly, Dillip Kumar', 'Dash, Rupesh']","['Maji S', 'Shriwas O', 'Samal SK', 'Priyadarshini M', 'Rath R', 'Panda S', 'Das Majumdar SK', 'Muduly DK', 'Dash R']","['Institute of Life Sciences, Nalco Square, Chandrasekharpur, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India.', 'Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, Karnataka, India.', 'Institute of Life Sciences, Nalco Square, Chandrasekharpur, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India.', 'Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, Karnataka, India.', 'Institute of Life Sciences, Nalco Square, Chandrasekharpur, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India.', 'Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, Karnataka, India.', 'Institute of Life Sciences, Nalco Square, Chandrasekharpur, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India.', 'Department of Oral Pathology and Microbiology, SCB Dental College and Hospital, Cuttack, Odisha, India.', 'Department of Head and Neck Oncology, Acharya Harihar Regional Cancer Centre, Cuttack, Odisha, India.', 'HCG Panda Cancer Centre, Cuttack, Odisha, India.', 'Department of Radiotherapy, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India.', 'Institute of Life Sciences, Nalco Square, Chandrasekharpur, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phenanthrenes)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Taxoids)', '19ALD1S53J (triptolide)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (GSK3B protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'TPF protocol']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Diterpenes/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Epoxy Compounds/pharmacology', 'Fluorouracil/therapeutic use', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mouth Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Phenanthrenes/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/physiology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*physiology', 'Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck/*drug therapy', 'Taxoids/therapeutic use']",,,,2018/11/06 06:00,2019/11/08 06:00,['2018/11/06 06:00'],"['2018/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/10 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/08 06:00 [medline]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['5159576 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgy135 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2019 Mar 12;40(1):173-183. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgy135.,,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2018.

Here we demonstrate genome-wide screening of lncRNA function using sgRNAs to target splice sites and achieve exon skipping or intron retention. Splice-site targeting outperformed a conventional CRISPR library in a negative selection screen targeting 79 ribosomal genes. Using a genome-scale library of splicing-targeting sgRNAs, we performed a screen covering 10,996 lncRNAs and identified 230 that are essential for cellular growth of chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells. Screening GM12878 lymphoblastoid cells and HeLa cells with the same library identified cell-type-specific differences in lncRNA essentiality. Extensive validation confirmed the robustness of our approach.","['Liu, Ying', 'Cao, Zhongzheng', 'Wang, Yinan', 'Guo, Yu', 'Xu, Ping', 'Yuan, Pengfei', 'Liu, Zhiheng', 'He, Yuan', 'Wei, Wensheng']","['Liu Y', 'Cao Z', 'Wang Y', 'Guo Y', 'Xu P', 'Yuan P', 'Liu Z', 'He Y', 'Wei W']","['Biomedical Pioneering Innovation Center (BIOPIC), Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Genomics, Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Peking University Genome Editing Research Center, State Key Laboratory of Protein and Plant Gene Research, School of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Biomedical Pioneering Innovation Center (BIOPIC), Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Genomics, Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Peking University Genome Editing Research Center, State Key Laboratory of Protein and Plant Gene Research, School of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Biomedical Pioneering Innovation Center (BIOPIC), Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Genomics, Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Peking University Genome Editing Research Center, State Key Laboratory of Protein and Plant Gene Research, School of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Biomedical Pioneering Innovation Center (BIOPIC), Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Genomics, Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Peking University Genome Editing Research Center, State Key Laboratory of Protein and Plant Gene Research, School of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Biomedical Pioneering Innovation Center (BIOPIC), Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Genomics, Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Peking University Genome Editing Research Center, State Key Laboratory of Protein and Plant Gene Research, School of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Biomedical Pioneering Innovation Center (BIOPIC), Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Genomics, Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Peking University Genome Editing Research Center, State Key Laboratory of Protein and Plant Gene Research, School of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Biomedical Pioneering Innovation Center (BIOPIC), Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Genomics, Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Peking University Genome Editing Research Center, State Key Laboratory of Protein and Plant Gene Research, School of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Biomedical Pioneering Innovation Center (BIOPIC), Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Genomics, Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Peking University Genome Editing Research Center, State Key Laboratory of Protein and Plant Gene Research, School of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Biomedical Pioneering Innovation Center (BIOPIC), Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Genomics, Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Peking University Genome Editing Research Center, State Key Laboratory of Protein and Plant Gene Research, School of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181105,United States,Nat Biotechnol,Nature biotechnology,9604648,,,,,,,2018/11/06 06:00,2018/11/06 06:00,['2018/11/06 06:00'],"['2017/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['nbt.4283 [pii]', '10.1038/nbt.4283 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Nat Biotechnol. 2018 Nov 5. pii: nbt.4283. doi: 10.1038/nbt.4283.,,,,,,"['Nat Biotechnol. 2020 May;38(5):573-576.

Bone marrow suppression, one of the adverse side effects of chemotherapy, may decrease immune function, increasing the risk of serious, fatal infections. PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to evaluate the effectiveness of noninvasive acupressure in preventing and diminishing chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression in patients with gynecologic cancer and to determine whether this effect is associated with the regulation of the expressions of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and stem cell factor (SCF). METHODS: In total, 28 women with gynecological cancer were randomly assigned either to the experimental group (n = 10) or to the control group (n = 18). The experimental group received acupressure of 5-minute duration to the Hegu (LI4), Quchi (LI11), Xuehai (SP10), Sanyinjiao (SP6), Taixi (K3), Zusanli (ST36), Taichong (LR3), and Baihui (GV20) points, respectively, three times per day for 6 weeks. The control group did not receive the acupressure intervention. The blood count, including white blood cells, platelets, and hemoglobin, and serum levels for SCF and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor were assessed before (pretest) and 6 weeks after (posttest) the participants' first course of chemotherapy. RESULTS: At posttest, blood hemoglobin had significantly decreased from (mean +/- SD) 11.6 +/- 2.2 to 10.8 +/-1.6 mg/dl (p = .03) in the control group. However, no significant pretest-posttest difference in hemoglobin concentration (11.4 +/- 1.0 vs. 10.9 +/- 1.1 mg/dl) was detected in the experimental group. Levels of SCF increased significantly between pretest and posttest in both the control group (from 1196.10 +/- 293.17 to 1325.05 +/- 253.77 ng/ml; p = .01) and the acupressure group (from 1046.78 +/- 469.52 to 1387.06 +/- 310.00 ng/ml; p = .007). In addition, a borderline difference (p = .05) in mean pretest-posttest SCF increase was found between the acupressure group (340.28 +/- 255.46 ng/ml) and the control group (128.94 +/- 250.64 ng/ml). Finally, a significant time-dependent interactive effect was found between acupressure and the increased blood level of SCF at posttest (beta = 211.34, p = .02). CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The findings support that acupressure on specific acupoints increases blood SCF levels significantly, which may help protect chemotherapy patients from experiencing reduced hemoglobin levels and may relieve chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression in patients with gynecologic cancer. This noninvasive approach is suggested for practical implementation in patients undergoing a course of chemotherapy.","['Shih, Ya-Wen', 'Yang, Shun-Fa', 'Chien, Ming-Hsien', 'Chang, Ching-Wen', 'Chang, Vincent H S', 'Tsai, Hsiu-Ting']","['Shih YW', 'Yang SF', 'Chien MH', 'Chang CW', 'Chang VHS', 'Tsai HT']","['MSN, RN, Doctoral Student, School of Nursing, College of Nursing, Taipei Medical University.', 'PhD, Professor, Institute of Biochemistry, Chung Shan Medical University.', 'PhD, Professor, Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University.', 'MD, Director Physician, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Taipei Medical University Hospital, and Clinical Associate Professor, Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University.', 'PhD, Associate Professor, The PhD program for Translational Medicine, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",,China (Republic : 1949- ),J Nurs Res,The journal of nursing research : JNR,101128757,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)']",IM,"['Acupressure/*methods', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Genital Neoplasms, Female/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology/*prevention & control', 'Middle Aged', 'Stem Cell Factor/*blood', 'Taiwan']",,,,2018/11/06 06:00,2019/02/27 06:00,['2018/11/06 06:00'],"['2018/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/jnr.0000000000000257 [doi]', '00134372-201812000-00007 [pii]']",ppublish,J Nurs Res. 2018 Dec;26(6):411-419. doi: 10.1097/jnr.0000000000000257.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies showed DADS induction of HL-60 cell differentiation involves down-regulation of calreticulin (CRT). Here, we investigated the mechanism of DADS-induced differentiation of human leukaemia cells and the potential involvement of CRT and CCAAT enhancer binding protein-alpha (C/EBPalpha). We explored the expression of CRT and C/EBPalpha in clinical samples (20 healthy people and 19 acute myeloid leukaemia patients) and found that CRT and C/EBPalpha expressions were inversely correlated. DADS induction of differentiation of HL-60 cells resulted in down-regulated CRT expression and elevated C/EBPalpha expression. In severe combined immunodeficiency mice injected with HL-60 cells, DADS inhibited the growth of tumour tissue and decreased CRT levels and increased C/EBPalpha in vivo. We also found that DADS-mediated down-regulation of CRT and up-regulation of C/EBPalpha involved enhancement of reactive oxidative species. RNA immunoprecipitation revealed that CRT bound C/EBPalpha mRNA, indicating its regulation of C/EBPalpha mRNA degradation by binding the UG-rich element in the 3' untranslated region of C/EBPalpha. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates the C/EBPalpha expression was correlated with CRT expression in vitro and in vivo and the molecular mechanism of DADS-induced leukaemic cell differentiation.","['Sun, Jing', 'Mu, Hongxiang', 'Yu, Jia', 'Li, Linwei', 'Yan, Hongxia', 'Li, Guoqing', 'Tan, Hui', 'Yang, Nanyang', 'Yang, Xiaoyan', 'Yi, Lan']","['Sun J', 'Mu H', 'Yu J', 'Li L', 'Yan H', 'Li G', 'Tan H', 'Yang N', 'Yang X', 'Yi L']","['Hunan Province Cooperative Innovation Center for Molecular Target New Drug Study, University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan, China.', 'Biology Research Institute, College of Pharmacy and Biological Sciences, University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan, China.', 'Hunan Province Cooperative Innovation Center for Molecular Target New Drug Study, University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan, China.', 'Biology Research Institute, College of Pharmacy and Biological Sciences, University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan, China.', 'Hunan Province Cooperative Innovation Center for Molecular Target New Drug Study, University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan, China.', 'Biology Research Institute, College of Pharmacy and Biological Sciences, University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital, University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital, University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan, China.', 'Hunan Province Cooperative Innovation Center for Molecular Target New Drug Study, University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan, China.', 'Biology Research Institute, College of Pharmacy and Biological Sciences, University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan, China.', 'Hunan Province Cooperative Innovation Center for Molecular Target New Drug Study, University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan, China.', 'Biology Research Institute, College of Pharmacy and Biological Sciences, University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan, China.', 'Hunan Province Cooperative Innovation Center for Molecular Target New Drug Study, University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan, China.', 'Biology Research Institute, College of Pharmacy and Biological Sciences, University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan, China.', 'Hunan Province Cooperative Innovation Center for Molecular Target New Drug Study, University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan, China.', 'Biology Research Institute, College of Pharmacy and Biological Sciences, University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan, China.', 'Hunan Province Cooperative Innovation Center for Molecular Target New Drug Study, University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan, China.', 'Biology Research Institute, College of Pharmacy and Biological Sciences, University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181105,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Allyl Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (CALR protein, human)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (Calreticulin)', '0 (Disulfides)', '5HI47O6OA7 (diallyl disulfide)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Allyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Calreticulin/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Disulfides/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'Young Adult']",PMC6307788,['NOTNLM'],"['*C/EBPalpha', '*calreticulin', '*diallyl disulphide', '*differentiation', '*human leukaemia cells']",2018/11/06 06:00,2020/06/12 06:00,['2018/11/06 06:00'],"['2018/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jcmm.13904 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2019 Jan;23(1):194-204. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.13904.

In this review, we discuss important factors to consider prior to stopping treatment. In addition, published and presented data with the first-generation TKI imatinib, as well as current clinical trials evaluating TFR with the second-generation TKIs dasatinib and nilotinib, are examined. Results obtained outside of clinical trials have been included as well. Because successful TKI discontinuation depends upon accurate BCR-ABL1 monitoring, emerging technologies are also discussed. Clinical data obtained to date indicate that for many patients who achieve deep molecular response (DMR) on TKI therapy, TFR is a safe treatment goal, and, if the response is lost, patients can expect to regain their responses immediately upon reinitiation of TKI.

CASE REPORT: We report a case of a pregnant woman who presented with a leukocyte count of 250 x 10(9) cells/L at gestational age (GA) 26 weeks and was diagnosed with CML in the chronic phase. Because the patient deliberately opted out of interferon alpha and tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment, the main goal was to reduce the leukocyte count to postpone delivery beyond the number of weeks considered severely premature and avoid thromboembolic complications while continuously evaluating the clinical safety of the mother and fetus. Hence therapeutic leukapheresis was initiated, and we report the first application of an apheresis approach for this procedure using the Spectra Optia instrument without sedimentation agents. Leukapheresis was conducted 2 to 4 times per week for 9 weeks. RESULTS: During treatment the leukocyte count decreased remarkably, and the patient developed lymphopenia together with a paradoxical increase in her blood platelet count. Premature labor was induced at GA 35 weeks, and a healthy boy was delivered. Thereafter, the patient initiated imatinib treatment and was in major molecular and complete cytogenetic remission after 1 year. Despite the remarkable reduction of the leukocyte count, we observed a pronounced increase in expression of BCR-ABL1 transcripts, implying the need for close monitoring of patients with CML during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: We report a pregnant woman who was diagnosed with CML and treated solely with apheresis procedures using the Spectra Optia instrument for 9 weeks, ensuring the safe delivery of her child.","['Lund, Kit Peiter', 'Larsen, Maria Torp', 'Haastrup, Eva Kannik', 'Pedersen, Berit Woetman', 'Maroun, Lisa Leth', 'Andersen, Morten Tolstrup', 'Bjerrum, Ole Weis', 'Fischer-Nielsen, Anne']","['Lund KP', 'Larsen MT', 'Haastrup EK', 'Pedersen BW', 'Maroun LL', 'Andersen MT', 'Bjerrum OW', 'Fischer-Nielsen A']","['Department of Clinical Immunology, Rigshospitalet, University Hospital of Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Rigshospitalet, University hospital of Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, Rigshospitalet, University Hospital of Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Obstetrics, Juliane Marie Centre for Children, Women and Reproduction, Rigshospitalet, University hospital of Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pathology, Rigshospitalet, University hospital of Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Rigshospitalet, University Hospital Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Rigshospitalet, University hospital of Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, Rigshospitalet, University Hospital of Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20181105,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,['8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Component Removal/*methods', 'Cell Separation/*methods', 'Female', 'Gestational Age', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/therapeutic use', 'Leukapheresis/methods', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Pregnancy']",,,,2018/11/06 06:00,2019/05/07 06:00,['2018/11/06 06:00'],"['2018/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/15 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/07 06:00 [medline]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/trf.15006 [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2019 Jan;59(1):39-45. doi: 10.1111/trf.15006.

The focus of the field is now on emulating these successes in other hematological malignancies where less impressive complete response rates are observed. Further engineering of CAR T cells or co-administration of other treatment modalities may successfully overcome obstacles to successful therapy in other cancer settings. We therefore present a model in which others can conduct pre-clinical testing of CD19 CAR T cells. Results in this well tested B-cell lymphoma model are likely to be informative CAR T-cell therapy in general. This protocol allows the reproducible production of mouse CAR T cells through calcium phosphate transfection of Plat-E producer cells with MP71 retroviral constructs and pCL-Eco packaging plasmid followed by collection of secreted retroviral particles and transduction using recombinant human fibronectin fragment and centrifugation. Validation of retroviral transduction, and confirmation of the ability of CAR T cells to kill target lymphoma cells ex vivo, through the use of flow cytometry, luminometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), is also described. Protocols for testing CAR T cells in vivo in lymphoreplete and lymphodepleted syngeneic mice, bearing established, systemic lymphoma are described. Anti-cancer activity is monitored by in vivo bioluminescence and disease progression. We show typical results of eradication of established B-cell lymphoma when utilizing 1(st) or 2(nd) generation CARs in combination with lymphodepleting pre-conditioning and a minority of mice achieving long term remissions when utilizing CAR T cells expressing IL-12 in lymphoreplete mice. These protocols can be used to evaluate CD19 CAR T cells with different additional modification, combinations of CAR T cells and other therapeutic agents or adapted for the use of CAR T cells against different target antigens.","['Kueberuwa, Gray', 'Zheng, Weiming', 'Kalaitsidou, Milena', 'Gilham, David E', 'Hawkins, Robert E']","['Kueberuwa G', 'Zheng W', 'Kalaitsidou M', 'Gilham DE', 'Hawkins RE']","['Manchester Cancer Research Centre Building, Department Cancer Sciences, University of Manchester; gray.kueberuwa@manchester.ac.uk.', 'Manchester Cancer Research Centre Building, Department Cancer Sciences, University of Manchester.', 'Manchester Cancer Research Centre Building, Department Cancer Sciences, University of Manchester.', 'Manchester Cancer Research Centre Building, Department Cancer Sciences, University of Manchester; Celyad.', 'Manchester Cancer Research Centre Building, Department Cancer Sciences, University of Manchester.']",['eng'],['Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Video-Audio Media']",20181016,United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/*immunology', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*transplantation', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6235544,,,2018/11/06 06:00,2019/04/04 06:00,['2018/11/06 06:00'],"['2018/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3791/58492 [doi]'],epublish,J Vis Exp. 2018 Oct 16;(140). doi: 10.3791/58492.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study investigated inhibitory effects of enasidenib and its metabolite AGI-16903 on (a) recombinant human nucleoside transporters (hNTs) in hNT-producing Xenopus laevis oocytes, and (b) azacitidine uptake in a normal B-lymphoblast peripheral blood cell line (PBC) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines. 2. Enasidenib inhibited hENT1, hENT2, hENT3, and hENT4 in oocytes with IC50 values of 7, 63, 27, and 76 muM, respectively, but exhibited little inhibition of hCNT1-3. AGI-16903 exhibited little inhibition of any hNT produced in oocytes. 3. Azacitidine uptake was more than 2-fold higher in AML cells than in PBC. Enasidenib inhibited azacitidine uptake into OCI-AML2, TF-1 and PBC cells in a concentration-dependent manner with IC50 values of 0.27, 1.7, and 1.0 microM in sodium-containing transport medium, respectively. 4. IC50 values shifted approximately 100-fold higher when human plasma was used as the incubation medium (27 microM in OCI-AML2, 162 microM in TF-1, and 129 microM in PBC), likely due to high human plasma protein binding of enasidenib (98.5% bound). 5. Although enasidenib inhibits hENTs and azacitidine uptake in vitro, plasma proteins attenuate this inhibitory effect, likely resulting in no meaningful in vivo effects in humans.","['Tong, Zeen', 'Yerramilli, Usha', 'Yao, Sylvia', 'Young, James D', 'Hoffmann, Matthew', 'Surapaneni, Sekhar']","['Tong Z', 'Yerramilli U', 'Yao S', 'Young JD', 'Hoffmann M', 'Surapaneni S']","['a Nonclinical Development , Celgene Corporation , Summit , NJ , USA.', 'a Nonclinical Development , Celgene Corporation , Summit , NJ , USA.', 'b Department of Physiology, Membrane Protein Disease Research Group , University of Alberta , Edmonton , Canada.', 'b Department of Physiology, Membrane Protein Disease Research Group , University of Alberta , Edmonton , Canada.', 'a Nonclinical Development , Celgene Corporation , Summit , NJ , USA.', 'a Nonclinical Development , Celgene Corporation , Summit , NJ , USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181129,England,Xenobiotica,Xenobiotica; the fate of foreign compounds in biological systems,1306665,"['0 (Aminopyridines)', '0 (Nucleoside Transport Proteins)', '0 (Triazines)', '3T1SS4E7AG (enasidenib)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['*Aminopyridines/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Animals', '*Azacitidine/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Nucleoside Transport Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Triazines/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Xenopus laevis']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'azacitidine', 'enasidenib', 'isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 inhibitor', 'nucleoside transporter']",2018/11/06 06:00,2019/12/20 06:00,['2018/11/06 06:00'],"['2018/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/00498254.2018.1539783 [doi]'],ppublish,Xenobiotica. 2019 Oct;49(10):1229-1236. doi: 10.1080/00498254.2018.1539783.

A prior report demonstrated worse outcome among young children <5 years old compared with older children. METHODS: We evaluated outcomes for pediatric patients (<18 years old; N = 83) with APL treated on North American intergroup study CALGB 9710 at Children's Oncology Group sites. Induction and consolidation included ATRA, cytarabine, and anthracyclines. Patients >/=15 years old were randomized to addition of arsenic trioxide (ATO) consolidation. All patients were randomized to ATRA maintenance with versus without oral chemotherapy. RESULTS: The estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 82%, and the event-free survival (EFS) rate was 54%. Seven patients (8.4%) died during induction due to coagulopathy. Maintenance randomization demonstrated that addition of oral chemotherapy to ATRA significantly reduced relapse rate, but difference in EFS did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.12; 5-year rates [95% CI]: 41% [17%-64%] ATRA only vs 72% [56%-88%] ATRA plus chemotherapy). There was no difference (P = 0.93) in EFS for age <5 years versus 5-12.99 years versus 13-17.99 years (5-year rates: 56%, 47%, and 45%, respectively). Among adolescents 15-17.99 years old in the ATO randomization, there was a significantly lower relapse risk at 5 years for those receiving ATO (0% ATO vs 44% no ATO; P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that intensified ATRA, cytarabine, and anthracycline chemotherapy is effective for pediatric APL including very young patients, but early deaths and relapses remain barriers to cure. Further improvements are likely with incorporation of ATO into pediatric APL regimens.","['Kutny, Matthew A', 'Geyer, Susan', 'Laumann, Kristina M', 'Gregory, John', 'Willman, Cheryl L', 'Stock, Wendy', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Feusner, James H']","['Kutny MA', 'Geyer S', 'Laumann KM', 'Gregory J', 'Willman CL', 'Stock W', 'Larson RA', 'Powell BL', 'Feusner JH']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'Health Informatics Institute, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida.', 'Alliance Statistics and Data Center, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', ""Atlantic Health System, Goryeb Children's Hospital, Morristown, New Jersey."", 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, University of New Mexico Cancer Center, Albuquerque, New Mexico.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Section on Hematology and Oncology, Comprehensive Cancer Center of Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital and Research Center Oakland, Oakland, California.""]",['eng'],"['U10CA031946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10CA180836/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA031946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA033601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180821/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10CA003927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180836/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10CA180882/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10CA041287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10CA033601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA041287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180882/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10CA180821/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA003927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20181104,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage']",PMC6392047,['NOTNLM'],"['*APL', '*ATRA', '*arsenic trioxide', '*pediatric']",2018/11/06 06:00,2019/11/13 06:00,['2018/11/06 06:00'],"['2018/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/11 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/13 06:00 [medline]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27542 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 Mar;66(3):e27542. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27542.

In this context, we evaluated the bone marrow miRNA profile of Brazilian children exhibiting T- or B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL or B-ALL), using massive parallel sequencing, using the HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina). The differential expression analysis was conducted considering a leave-one-out approach and FDR </= 0.05. Machine learning algorithms were applied to search for the disease subset biomarkers. Target prediction, functional enrichment, and classification of biological categories were also performed. Sixteen miRNAs were differentially expressed between T- and B-ALL, of which 10 (miR-708-5p, miR-497-5p, miR-151a-5p, miR-151b, miR-371b-5p, miR-455-5p, miR-195-5p, miR-1266-5p, miR-574-5p, and miR-425-5p) were downregulated and six (miR-450b-5p, miR-450a-5p, miR-542-5p, miR-424-5p, miR-629-5p, and miR-29c-5p) were upregulated in childhood T-ALL. These miRNAs may be used for distinguishing childhood lymphoblastic leukemia subtypes, since it provided the clear separation of patients in these two distinct groups. Six relevant biological pathways were identified according to their role in leukemia, namely, viral carcinogenesis, cell cycle, and B-cell receptor signaling pathways for induced miRNAs and TGF-beta signaling, apoptosis, and NF-kappa B signaling for the repressed miRNAs, of which several miRNA gene targets participate in cell differentiation and hematopoiesis processes. Machine learning analysis pointed out miR-29c-5p expression as the best discriminator between childhood T- and B-ALL, which is involved in calcium signaling, critical for B-cell lymphocyte fate. Further studies are needed to assure the role of the 16 miRNAs and miR-29c-5p on acute lymphoblastic leukemia subtypes and on disease prognosis.","['Almeida, Renata Santos', 'Costa E Silva, Matheus', 'Coutinho, Luiz Lehmann', 'Garcia Gomes, Renan', 'Pedrosa, Francisco', 'Massaro, Juliana Doblas', 'Donadi, Eduardo Antonio', 'Lucena-Silva, Norma']","['Almeida RS', 'Costa E Silva M', 'Coutinho LL', 'Garcia Gomes R', 'Pedrosa F', 'Massaro JD', 'Donadi EA', 'Lucena-Silva N']","['Laboratory of Immunogenetics, Department of Immunology, Aggeu Magalhaes Institute, Recife, Brazil.', 'Division of Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', 'Animal Biotechnology Laboratory, Animal Science Department, University of Sao Paulo (USP)/Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture (ESALQ), Piracicaba, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Immunogenetics, Department of Immunology, Aggeu Magalhaes Institute, Recife, Brazil.', 'Pediatric Oncology, Instituto de Medicina Integral Professor Fernando Figueira (IMIP) Hospital, Recife, Brazil.', 'Division of Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', 'Division of Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Immunogenetics, Department of Immunology, Aggeu Magalhaes Institute, Recife, Brazil.', 'Pediatric Oncology, Instituto de Medicina Integral Professor Fernando Figueira (IMIP) Hospital, Recife, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['310364/2015-9/CNPq', 'PROCAD-177382/2013/CAPES', 'APQ-0040-4.00/13/FACEPE', 'APQ-1044-4.01/15/FACEPE']",['Journal Article'],20181127,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Machine Learning', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Signal Transduction', '*Transcriptome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['B-ALL', 'T-ALL', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'biomarker', 'miRNome sequencing', 'microRNAs']",2018/11/06 06:00,2019/03/06 06:00,['2018/11/06 06:00'],"['2018/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/10 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/06 06:00 [medline]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2567 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2019 Feb;37(1):103-112. doi: 10.1002/hon.2567.

Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is caused by loss-of-function mutations in WASp and most frequently associated with lymphoreticular tumors of poor prognosis. X-linked neuropenia (XLN) is caused by gain-of-function mutations in WASp and associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). To understand the role of WASp in tumorigenesis, we bred WASp(+), WASp(-), and WASp-XLN mice onto tumor susceptible p53(+/-) background and sub-lethally irradiated them to enhance tumor development. We followed the cohorts for 24 weeks and tumors were characterized by histology and flow cytometry to define the tumor incidence, onset, and cell origin. We found that p53(+/-)WASp(+) mice developed malignancies, including solid tumors and T cell lymphomas with 71.4% of survival 24 weeks after irradiation. p53(+/-)WASp(-) mice showed lower survival rate and developed various early onset malignancies. Surprisingly, the p53(+/-)WASp-XLN mice developed malignancy mostly with late onset, which caused delayed mortality in this colony. This study provides evidence for that loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations in WASp influence tumor incidence and onset.","['Keszei, Marton', 'Kritikou, Joanna S', 'Sandfort, Deborah', 'He, Minghui', 'Oliveira, Mariana M S', 'Wurzer, Hannah', 'Kuiper, Raoul V', 'Westerberg, Lisa S']","['Keszei M', 'Kritikou JS', 'Sandfort D', 'He M', 'Oliveira MMS', 'Wurzer H', 'Kuiper RV', 'Westerberg LS']","['Department of Microbiology Tumor and Cell biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Microbiology Tumor and Cell biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Microbiology Tumor and Cell biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Microbiology Tumor and Cell biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Microbiology Tumor and Cell biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Microbiology Tumor and Cell biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Microbiology Tumor and Cell biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180730,United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,,,,PMC6209425,['NOTNLM'],"['*WASp', '*genetic model', '*immunodeficiency', '*malignancies', '*p53']",2018/11/06 06:00,2018/11/06 06:01,['2018/11/06 06:00'],"['2018/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/16 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/2162402X.2018.1468954 [doi]', '1468954 [pii]']",epublish,Oncoimmunology. 2018 Jul 30;7(9):e1468954. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2018.1468954. eCollection 2018.,['ORCID: 0000-0001-5816-1286'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imatinib pharmacokinetics is affected by a number of transport proteins and enzymes. Material and methods: In the present study we evaluated the association of eight polymorphisms in the seven genes CYP3A5*3 (rs776746), CYP3A4*1 (rs2740574), CYP2C9*3 (rs1057910), SLC22A1 (rs683369), ABCB1 (rs1045642, rs1128503), ABCG2 (rs2231142) and ABCC2 (rs717620) with imatinib plasma level and achieving an optimal clinical response in 112 CML patients (53 men and 59 women). Results: No association was found between the examined polymorphisms in rs776746, rs2740574, rs1057910, rs683369, rs1045642, rs1128503, rs2231142, rs717620 and the achieved imatinib plasma level. The influence of rs776746 (CYP3A5*3) on the achievement of a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) at 6 months was borderline non-significant (p = 0.06). Furthermore, no association was demonstrated between rs776746 polymorphisms and the achievement of a major molecular response (MMR) at 12 or 18 months. Polymorphisms rs776746, rs2740574, rs1057910, rs683369, rs1045642, rs1128503, rs2231142, rs717620 showed no impact on the optimal therapeutic response. Conclusions: Despite the results of some other studies, no other polymorphism we analyzed was associated with imatinib plasma level or clinical response. The treatment outcomes cannot be predicted using the candidate gene approach and treatment decisions cannot be made according to the polymorphisms investigated in this study.","['Belohlavkova, Petra', 'Vrbacky, Filip', 'Voglova, Jaroslava', 'Racil, Zdenek', 'Zackova, Daniela', 'Hrochova, Katerina', 'Malakova, Jana', 'Mayer, Jiri', 'Zak, Pavel']","['Belohlavkova P', 'Vrbacky F', 'Voglova J', 'Racil Z', 'Zackova D', 'Hrochova K', 'Malakova J', 'Mayer J', 'Zak P']","['4 Department of Internal Medicine - Hematology, Charles University Hospital, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', '4 Department of Internal Medicine and Hematology, Charles University, Faculty Hospital and Faculty of Medicine, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', '4 Department of Internal Medicine and Hematology, Charles University, Faculty Hospital and Faculty of Medicine, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, Masaryk University and University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, Masaryk University and University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Charles University, Faculty Hospital and Faculty of Medicine, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Charles University, Faculty Hospital and Faculty of Medicine, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, Masaryk University and University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.', '4 Department of Internal Medicine and Hematology, Charles University, Faculty Hospital and Faculty of Medicine, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180215,Poland,Arch Med Sci,Archives of medical science : AMS,101258257,,,,PMC6209720,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic myeloid leukemia', 'clinical response', 'genetic polymorphisms', 'imatinib']",2018/11/06 06:00,2018/11/06 06:01,['2018/11/06 06:00'],"['2017/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.5114/aoms.2018.73538 [doi]', '31830 [pii]']",ppublish,Arch Med Sci. 2018 Oct;14(6):1416-1423. doi: 10.5114/aoms.2018.73538.

Drug-induced pulmonary fibrosis is associated with pulmonary hypoplasia. A case of acquired platythorax is presented in a young man previously treated with cyclophosphamide in childhood. CASE REPORT A 20-year-old man began to experience cough, chest pain, and mild exertional dyspnea. He was admitted to the hospital at 23 years of age with respiratory failure. Chest imaging showed pleural thickening and platythorax. He had been successfully treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), at 3 years of age, with chemotherapy that included a cumulative dose of cyclophosphamide of 15.6 g/m(2). His ALL relapsed six years later and he was the treated again with cyclophosphamide and underwent a second and complete remission. A clinical diagnosis of late-onset cyclophosphamide-induced lung disease with progressive platythorax was made on the basis of his clinical history and on imaging findings of the ratio of the AP to lateral chest wall diameter when compared with age-matched controls. Despite continued remission of his ALL, he died of progressive cardiopulmonary failure at 25 years of age. CONCLUSIONS This report described a rare case of acquired platythorax, or flattening of the chest, in a young adult. The use of the ratio of the chest wall AP diameter to lateral diameter may be used in the early detection of this rare chemotherapy-induced complication in children and adults.","['Ito, Tsuyoshi', 'Koyama, Satoshi', 'Iwamoto, Shotaro', 'Hirayama, Masahiro', 'Azuma, Eiichi']","['Ito T', 'Koyama S', 'Iwamoto S', 'Hirayama M', 'Azuma E']","['Department of Pediatrics, Toyohashi Municipal Hospital, Toyohashi, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Toyohashi Municipal Hospital, Toyohashi, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Engineering, Suzuka University of Medical Science, Suzuka, Mie, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20181105,United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)'],IM,"['Chest Pain/diagnosis/etiology', 'Child', 'Cyclophosphamide/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Emergency Service, Hospital', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Heart Failure/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis/*chemically induced/complications/diagnostic imaging', 'Respiratory Insufficiency/diagnostic imaging/*etiology/therapy', 'Risk Assessment', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",PMC6238677,,,2018/11/06 06:00,2019/02/27 06:00,['2018/11/06 06:00'],"['2018/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/27 06:00 [medline]']","['911701 [pii]', '10.12659/AJCR.911701 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2018 Nov 5;19:1317-1323. doi: 10.12659/AJCR.911701.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have showed that stat3 a crucial gene implicated in this pathway can regulate self-renewal in male germline stem cell. In our previous study, we demonstrated that miR-19b-3p induces cell proliferation and reduces heterochromatin through Plzf which also regulates the balance between cell self-renewal and differentiation. Because miRNA can target several genes and to understand more about Plzf, a crucial transcription factor of SSCs, we performed microarray and found that miR-19b-3p integrate Jak-Stat through Plzf to regulate cell self-renewal. Our results demonstrated that miR-19b-3p induces Jak-Stat when Plzf is downregulated; overexpression of Plzf reversed the trend and shown an existence of feedback (-/+) between Plzf and GHR. The cell self-renewal markers CD49f, GFRalpha1, Oct4 and cKIT analyzed in the both groups miR-19b-3p and Plzf-overexpressing compared to their respective control confirm miR-19b-3p regulates cell pluripotency and self-renewal in goat male germline stem cells through Plzf.

Molecular subtypes have been defined by recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities and somatic mutations that are prognostic and predictive. Karyotype and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) have historically been used to guide management; however, new technologies and markers raise the need to reassess current testing algorithms. METHODS: We convened a panel of representatives from international clinical laboratories to capture current state-of-the-art testing from published reports and to put forward recommendations for cytogenomic testing of plasma cell neoplasms. We reviewed 65 papers applying FISH, chromosomal microarray (CMA), next-generation sequencing, and gene expression profiling for plasma cell neoplasm diagnosis and prognosis. We also performed a survey of our peers to capture current laboratory practice employed outside our working group. RESULTS: Plasma cell enrichment is widely used prior to FISH testing, most commonly by magnetic bead selection. A variety of strategies for direct, short- and long-term cell culture are employed to ensure clonal representation for karyotyping. Testing of clinically-informative 1p/1q, del(13q) and del(17p) are common using karyotype, FISH and, increasingly, CMA testing. FISH for a variety of clinically-informative balanced IGH rearrangements is prevalent. Literature review found that CMA analysis can detect abnormalities in 85-100% of patients with PCNs; more specifically, in 5-53% (median 14%) of cases otherwise normal by FISH and cytogenetics. CMA results in plasma cell neoplasms are usually complex, with alteration counts ranging from 1 to 74 (median 10-20), primarily affecting loci not covered by FISH testing. Emerging biomarkers include structural alterations of MYC as well as somatic mutations of KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and TP53. Together, these may be measured in a comprehensive manner by a combination of newer technologies including CMA and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Our survey suggests most laboratories have, or are soon to have, clinical CMA platforms, with a desire to move to NGS assays in the future. CONCLUSION: We present an overview of current practices in plasma cell neoplasm testing as well as an algorithm for integrated FISH and CMA testing to guide treatment of this disease.","['Pugh, Trevor J', 'Fink, James M', 'Lu, Xinyan', 'Mathew, Susan', 'Murata-Collins, Joyce', 'Willem, Pascale', 'Fang, Min']","['Pugh TJ', 'Fink JM', 'Lu X', 'Mathew S', 'Murata-Collins J', 'Willem P', 'Fang M']","['Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network; Ontario Institute for Cancer Research; and Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.

Within standard-risk medulloblastoma, patients in the WNT subgroup are established as having a favourable prognosis; however, outcome prediction for the remaining majority of patients is imprecise. We sought to identify novel prognostic biomarkers to enable improved risk-adapted therapies. METHODS: The HIT-SIOP PNET 4 trial recruited 338 patients aged 4-21 years with medulloblastoma between Jan 1, 2001, and Dec 31, 2006, in 120 treatment institutions in seven European countries to investigate hyperfractionated radiotherapy versus standard radiotherapy. In this retrospective analysis, we assessed the remaining tumour samples from patients in the HIT-SIOP PNET 4 trial (n=136). We assessed the clinical behaviour of the molecularly defined WNT and SHH subgroups, and identified novel independent prognostic markers and models for standard-risk patients with non-WNT/non-SHH disease. Because of the scarcity and low quality of available genomic material, we used a mass spectrometry-minimal methylation classifier assay (MS-MIMIC) to assess methylation subgroup and a molecular inversion probe array to detect genome-wide copy number aberrations. Prognostic biomarkers and models identified were validated in an independent, demographically matched cohort (n=70) of medulloblastoma patients with non-WNT/non-SHH standard-risk disease treated with conventional therapies (maximal surgical resection followed by adjuvant craniospinal irradiation [all patients] and chemotherapy [65 of 70 patients], at UK Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group and European Society for Paediatric Oncology (SIOPE) associated treatment centres between 1990 and 2014. These samples were analysed by Illumina 450k DNA methylation microarray. HIT-SIOP PNET 4 is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01351870. FINDINGS: We analysed methylation subgroup, genome-wide copy number aberrations, and mutational features in 136 assessable tumour samples from the HIT-SIOP PNET 4 cohort, representing 40% of the 338 patients in the trial cohort. This cohort of 136 samples consisted of 28 (21%) classified as WNT, 17 (13%) as SHH, and 91 (67%) as non-WNT/non-SHH (we considered Group3 and Group4 medulloblastoma together in our analysis because of their similar molecular and clinical features). Favourable outcomes for WNT tumours were confirmed in patients younger than 16 years, and all relapse events in SHH (four [24%] of 17) occurred in patients with TP53 mutation (TP53(mut)) or chromosome 17p loss. A novel whole chromosomal aberration signature associated with increased ploidy and multiple non-random whole chromosomal aberrations was identified in 38 (42%) of the 91 samples from patients with non-WNT/non-SHH medulloblastoma in the HIT-SIOP PNET 4 cohort. Biomarkers associated with this whole chromosomal aberration signature (at least two of chromosome 7 gain, chromosome 8 loss, and chromosome 11 loss) predicted favourable prognosis. Patients with non-WNT/non-SHH medulloblastoma could be reclassified by these markers as having favourable-risk or high-risk disease. In patients in the HIT-SIOP PNET4 cohort with non-WNT/non-SHH medulloblastoma, with a median follow-up of 6.7 years (IQR 5.8-8.2), 5-year event-free survival was 100% in the favourable-risk group and 68% (95% CI 57.5-82.7; p=0.00014) in the high-risk group. In the validation cohort, with a median follow-up of 5.6 years (IQR 3.1-8.1), 5-year event-free survival was 94.7% (95% CI 85.2-100) in the favourable-risk group and 58.6% (95% CI 45.1-76.1) in the high-risk group (hazard ratio 9.41, 95% CI 1.25-70.57; p=0.029). Our comprehensive molecular investigation identified subgroup-specific risk models which allowed 69 (51%) of 134 accessible patients from the standard-risk medulloblastoma HIT-SIOP PNET 4 cohort to be assigned to a favourable-risk group. INTERPRETATION: We define a whole chromosomal signature that allows the assignment of non-WNT/non-SHH medulloblastoma patients normally classified as standard-risk into favourable-risk and high-risk categories. In addition to patients younger than 16 years with WNT tumours, patients with non-WNT/non-SHH tumours with our defined whole chromosomal aberration signature and patients with SHH-TP53(wild-type) tumours should be considered for therapy de-escalation in future biomarker-driven, risk-adapted clinical trials. The remaining subgroups of patients with high-risk medulloblastoma might benefit from more intensive therapies.

First, we examined the expression level of miR-26b in human normal fetal lung fibroblasts (NFLFs) and three SCLC cell lines NCI-H466, NCI-H1688, and NCI-H196. In the following experiments, the three SCLC cell lines were transfected with miR-26b mimic and inhibitor. Cell growth and survival, as well as migration and invasion capacities were determined by MTT, colony formation, Transwell migration and invasion, and wound healing assays. Cell apoptosis, production of reactive oxygen species, and mitochondrial membrane potential were also measured in the three cell lines following various treatments. As a result, we found that the level of miR-26b was significantly lower in SCLC cells than in NFLFs. Additionally, transfection with miR-26b mimic could inhibit proliferation, colony formation, and migration, as well as induce apoptosis in these SCLC cell lines; while miR-26b inhibitor showed the opposite effects. Further mechanistic experiment revealed that miR-26b could suppress the expression of myeloid cell leukemia 1 protein (Mcl-1) and the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of Mcl-1 may be the direct binding site of miR-26b, suggesting that the effect of miR-26b may be mediated by targeting Mcl-1. Collectively, our findings offer a new insight into the role of miR-26b in the pathogenesis of SCLC, and provide primary evidence supporting the potential of miR-26b-based therapy for the treatment of SCLC.","['Yu, Jin-Guo', 'Ji, Cheng-Hong', 'Shi, Min-Hua']","['Yu JG', 'Ji CH', 'Shi MH']","['Department of Respiratory Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China.

In the analyzed period of time, within the studied group of 328 children diagnosed and treated for lymphomas, at least one infectious complication (IC) was diagnosed i.e. 39.3% children. In these patients there were 350 episodes of IC, therein 80.6% episodes of BI, 11.1% episodes of VI, and 8.3% episodes of IFD. In both groups, NHL and HL patients, a stable level of bacterial infections, with an increase in resistance rates, and increased levels of viral and fungal infections were observed. Profile of BI does not depend on lymphoma type, with predominance of Gram-negative bacteria and higher prevalence of MDR pathogens. The overall survival of lymphoma patients with IC was comparable for different types of infections.","['Zajac-Spychala, Olga', 'Wachowiak, Jacek', 'Szmydki-Baran, Anna', 'Hutnik, Lukasz',

Methods: ABO promoter methylation level of 182 malignant hematological disease patients and 68 normal controls were detected by bisulfite sequencing PCR.Then clinical features and outcome were compared between hypermethylation group and hypomethylation group. Results: The median methylation rate of ABO promoter in newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) were 46.98% and 11.01% respectively, which were both higher than that in controls (2.30%, P<0.05). The methylation rates in remission AML and ALL were 1.58% and 2.30% respectively, which were comparable with that in normal group (P>0.05). As to relapse AML and ALL, methylation rates were 41.26% and 17.50% respectively, also significantly higher than that in controls (P<0.05).In patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) chronic phase, the median methylation rate was 1.00%, which was similar to normal group. But a CML patient who transformed to ALL hadextremely high methylation rate 92.56%. The median methylation rate in patients with MDS significantly elevated as 5.81% compared with that in controls (P<0.05). The median overall survival (OS) of ALL and AML (non-M3) patients with hypermethylation were 12.5 months and 15.3 months, which were significantly shorter than those with hypomethylation (24.0 months and 20.0 months)(P<0.05).The median disease-free survival (DFS) of ALL and AML (non-M3) patients with hypermethylation were 9.9 months and 12.0 months, which were significantly shorter than those with hypomethylation (22.3 months and 18.5 months), (P<0.05). Multivariable analysis suggested that ABO promoter methylation level was an independent predictive factor of OS and DFS in ALL and AML (non-M(3)) patients. Conclusion: ABO promoter hypermethylation is closely related to genesis, development and prognosis of leukemia and MDS. Hypermethylationis related to a clinical poor prognosis compare with hypomethylation.","['Shao, M', 'Tang, P', 'Lyu, X P', 'Yang, Q K', 'Zhu, W T', 'Jin, H F', 'Wang, L', 'Zhao, X Q', 'Liu, X', 'Sun, L']","['Shao M', 'Tang P', 'Lyu XP', 'Yang QK', 'Zhu WT', 'Jin HF', 'Wang L', 'Zhao XQ', 'Liu X', 'Sun L']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, China.']",['chi'],"['81400108/National Natural Science Fund of China', '13A320431/; Key Project of Science and Technology Research of Henan Provincial', 'Education Department']",['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,16210490R,['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)'],IM,"['ABO Blood-Group System/*genetics', 'Acute Disease', 'Adult', '*DNA Methylation', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Remission Induction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",,['NOTNLM'],"['ABO blood group system', 'Leukemia', 'Methylation', 'Prognosis']",2018/11/06 06:00,2018/11/09 06:00,['2018/11/06 06:00'],"['2018/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0578-1426.2018.11.005 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi. 2018 Nov 1;57(11):816-823. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0578-1426.2018.11.005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pearson correlation coefficient is estimated to reveal how the cancers closely associated with PM2.5 long-term exposure. Then linear regression is conducted to evaluate sex- and area-specific increased risks of those cancers from high level PM2.5 long-term exposure. The major finding is with the increase of every 10mug/m(3) of annual mean PM2.5 concentration, the increase of relative risks for lung cancer incidence and mortality are 15% and 23% for males, and 22% and 24% for females in rural area. For urban area, the increase of relative risk for ovarian cancer incidence is 9% for females, while that for prostatic cancer increases 17% for males. For leukemia, the increase of relative risks for incidence and mortality are 22% and 19% for females in rural area, while in urban area the increase of relative risk for mortality is 9% for males and for incidence is 6% for females. It is also found that with increased PM2.5 exposure, the risks for ovarian and prostatic cancer rise significantly in urban area, while risks for lung cancer and leukemia rise significantly in rural area. The results demonstrate the higher risks for lung cancer and leukemia with increased PM2.5 exposure are more significant for female. This study also suggests that the carcinogenic effects of PM2.5 have obvious sex and urban-rural differences.","['Wang, Hong', 'Gao, Zhiqiu', 'Ren, Jingzheng', 'Liu, Yibo', 'Chang, Lisa Tzu-Chi', 'Cheung, Kevin', 'Feng, Yun', 'Li, Yubin']","['Wang H', 'Gao Z', 'Ren J', 'Liu Y', 'Chang LT', 'Cheung K', 'Feng Y', 'Li Y']","['Key Laboratory of Meteorological Disaster of Ministry of Education, Collaborative Innovation Centre on Forecast and Evaluation of Meteorological Disasters, School of Atmospheric Physics, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, 210044, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Boundary Layer Physics and Atmospheric Chemistry, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100029, China.

MATERIALS & METHODS: All the newly synthesized nalidixic acid derivatives were submitted to the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Bethesda, USA and were accepted for single dose screening. Further investigation via IC50 determination of the most potent compound 6a against K-562 and SR leukemia cell lines. Finally, the topoisomerase II inhibitory activity, the cell cycle analysis and molecular docking of 6a were performed in order to identify the possible mechanism of the anticancer activity. RESULTS: Compound 6a showed interesting selectivity against leukemia especially K-562 and SR subpanels with IC50 35.29microM and 13.85microM respectively. Moreover, compound 6a revealed potent topoisomerase IIalpha and topoisomerase IIbeta inhibitory activity compared with known topoisomerase inhibitors such as doxorubicin and topotecan with IC50 1.30microM and 0.017microM respectively. Cell cycle analysis indicated that compound 6a induced cell cycle arrest at G2-M phase leading to inhibition of cell proliferation and apoptosis. Molecular modeling demonstrated that the potent topoisomerase inhibitory activity of 6a was due to the interaction with the topoisomerase II enzyme through coordinate bonding with the magnesium ion Mg(2+), hydrogen bonding with Asp 545 and arene cation interaction with His 759.","['Khalil, Omneya M', 'Gedawy, Ehab M', 'El-Malah, Afaf A', 'Adly, Mina E']","['Khalil OM', 'Gedawy EM', 'El-Malah AA', 'Adly ME']","['Pharmaceutical Organic Chemistry Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Cairo 11562, Egypt.', 'Pharmaceutical Organic Chemistry Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Cairo 11562, Egypt; Pharmaceutical Chemistry Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Badr University In Cairo BUC, Cairo, Egypt.

Here, we describe the seminal findings that led to the discovery of RUNX1 and of its critical role in blood cell formation in the embryo from hemogenic endothelium (HE). We also present RNA-sequencing data demonstrating that HE cells in different anatomic sites, which produce hematopoietic progenitors with dissimilar differentiation potentials, are molecularly distinct. Hemogenic and non-HE cells in the yolk sac are more closely related to each other than either is to hemogenic or non-HE cells in the major arteries. Therefore, a major driver of the different lineage potentials of the committed erythro-myeloid progenitors that emerge in the yolk sac versus hematopoietic stem cells that originate in the major arteries is likely to be the distinct molecular properties of the HE cells from which they are derived. We used bioinformatics analyses to predict signaling pathways active in arterial HE, which include the functionally validated pathways Notch, Wnt, and Hedgehog. We also used a novel bioinformatics approach to assemble transcriptional regulatory networks and predict transcription factors that may be specifically involved in hematopoietic cell formation from arterial HE, which is the origin of the adult hematopoietic system.","['Gao, Long', 'Tober, Joanna', 'Gao, Peng', 'Chen, Changya', 'Tan, Kai', 'Speck, Nancy A']","['Gao L', 'Tober J', 'Gao P', 'Chen C', 'Tan K', 'Speck NA']","[""Division of Oncology and Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA; Department of Genetics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA; Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', ""Division of Oncology and Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", ""Division of Oncology and Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", ""Division of Oncology and Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA; Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA; Department of Genetics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA; Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.

CD7 is expressed by the leukemic blasts and malignant progenitor cells of approximately 30% of AML patients but is absent on normal myeloid and erythroid cells. Since CD7 expression by malignant blasts is also linked with chemoresistance and poor outcomes, targeting this antigen may be beneficial for this subset of AML patients. Here, we show that expression of a CD7-directed CAR in CD7 gene-edited (CD7(KO)) T cells effectively eliminates CD7(+) AML cell lines, primary CD7(+) AML, and colony-forming cells but spares myeloid and erythroid progenitor cells and their progeny. In a xenograft model, CD7 CAR T cells protect mice against systemic leukemia, prolonging survival.

The potential of Rasaaushadhis need to be explored by subjecting them against newer life threatening diseases like cancer where contemporary medicine has limitations. Abhrak Bhasma, one of the drugs of Rasashastra, has some peculiar attributes. According to classical Rasashastra texts, Shataputi Abhrak Bhasma is regarded as a Rasayan, whose efficacy is in direct proportion to the number of Putas. Thus increasing number of Putas not only has a significant effect on the physical, analytical aspects but also the therapeutic effect of the Abhrak Bhasma. OBJECTIVES: To screen in vitro anticancer activity of Abhrak Bhasma at various stages of Putas (20, 50, 100). To evaluate and thus validate the principle from classical Rasashastra texts, which explains direct relation of number of Putas with therapeutic efficacy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Shataputi Abhrak Bhasma, at various stages of its preparation was subjected to in vitro anticancer activity on three different cancer cell lines (LungHOP62, LeukemiaU937, ProstateDU145) at Tata Memorial Centre- Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research Education in Cancer, Navi Mumbai. SRB assay was followed to evaluate the anti-proliferative activity. RESULTS: It was found that Abhrak Bhasma shows concentration dependent positive in vitro anticancer activity on all three cell lines with highly significant activity on prostate cancer cell lines. Anticancer activity of Abhrak Bhasma is in the order 100 Puti > 50 Puti > 20 Puti. Shataputi Abhrak Bhasma had maximum activity on prostate cancer cell lines almost equivalent to positive control drug adriamycin. CONCLUSION: The in vitro anticancer activity of Shataputi Abhrak Bhasma increases with increasing number of Putas, thus revalidating the direct relation between number of Putas and efficacy of the drug.","['Tamhankar, Yogesh L', 'Gharote, Archana P']","['Tamhankar YL', 'Gharote AP']","['Rasashastra and Bhaishajya Kalpana Dept., D.Y.

Due to its high prevalence and morbidity, there is an avid necessity to find new therapies that slow the progression and promote the regression of the disease. Imatinib mesylate is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that binds to the Abelson tyrosine kinase and related proteins. It enhances beta-cell survival in response to toxins and pro-inflammatory cytokine. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of imatinib on fasting plasma glucose in subjects with normal fasting glucose, subjects with impaired fasting glucose and in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: We identified 284 subjects diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia or gastrointestinal stromal tumors from the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran database. 106/284 subjects were treated with imatinib. We compared the effect of imatinib on fasting plasma glucose after 1 and 6 months of treatment. We used ANOVA test of repeated samples to determine statistical significance in fasting plasma glucose before imatinib treatment and the follow-up. Statistical analysis was performed with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences v22. RESULTS: We included a total of 106 subjects: 76 with fasting plasma glucose concentrations < 100 mg/dL (normal FG), 19 subjects with fasting plasma glucose concentrations >/=100 mg/dL (impaired fasting glucose), and 11 subjects with >/=126 mg/dL (type 2 diabetes mellitus). We found a significant increase in fasting plasma glucose concentration in the normal fasting glucose group (p = 0.048), and a significant decrease in fasting plasma glucose concentration in the type 2 diabetes mellitus group (p = 0.042). In the impaired fasting glucose group, we also found a tendency towards a decrease in fasting plasma glucose (p = 0.076). We identified 11 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, of whom, 7 (64%) had a reduction in their fasting plasma glucose concentrations after 6 months. A significant glycosylated hemoglobin reduction (p = 0.04) was observed. CONCLUSION: Subjects with chronic myeloid leukemia or gastrointestinal stromal tumor with type 2 diabetes mellitus had a significant reduction in fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin at 1 and 6 months while using imatinib.","['Gomez-Samano, Miguel Angel', 'Baquerizo-Burgos, Jorge Enrique', 'Coronel, Melissa Fabiola Coronel', 'Wong-Campoverde, Buileng Daniela', 'Villanueva-Martinez, Fernando', 'Molina-Botello, Diego', 'Avila-Rojo, Jose Alonso', 'Palacios-Baez, Lucia', 'Cuevas-Ramos, Daniel', 'Gomez-Perez, Francisco Javier', 'Zentella-Dehesa, Alejandro', 'Aguayo-Gonzalez, Alvaro', 'Gulias-Herrero, Alfonso']","['Gomez-Samano MA', 'Baquerizo-Burgos JE', 'Coronel MFC', 'Wong-Campoverde BD', 'Villanueva-Martinez F', 'Molina-Botello D', 'Avila-Rojo JA', 'Palacios-Baez L', 'Cuevas-Ramos D', 'Gomez-Perez FJ', 'Zentella-Dehesa A', 'Aguayo-Gonzalez A', 'Gulias-Herrero A']","['Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Vasco de Quiroga #15, Seccion XVI Tlalpan, 14000, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Universidad Catolica de Santiago de Guayaquil, Av.

In spite of favorable survival rates, some patients relapse and achieve a poor outcome. METHODS: We analyzed miR-125b and Bcl-2 expressions in pediatric patients with ALL and evaluated their clinical utility as molecular markers for the prediction of disease outcomes. RESULTS: Downregulation of miR-125b and increased Bcl-2 expression levels in pediatric patients with ALL were associated with poor prognosis at diagnosis. At day 28 of induction, miR-125b was significantly increased, whereas Bcl-2 was downregulated. Loss of miR-125b during diagnosis and its elevation after therapy are strongly correlated with short leukemia-free survival and worse survival. Moreover, the combination of miR-125b with Bcl-2 markers can clearly enhance the prediction of the disease outcome. Finally, a univariate analysis highlighted the independent prognostic value of miR-125 in a pediatric patient with ALL. CONCLUSIONS: miR-125b and Bcl-2 together are potent predictors for the prognosis and, therefore, can be used as therapeutic targets in childhood ALL.","['El-Khazragy, Nashwa', 'Elshimy, Amal Ali', 'Hassan, Safaa Shawky', 'Matbouly, Safa', 'Safwat, Gehan', 'Zannoun, Mohamed', 'Riad, Ramez A']","['El-Khazragy N', 'Elshimy AA', 'Hassan SS', 'Matbouly S', 'Safwat G', 'Zannoun M', 'Riad RA']","['Department of Clinical Pathology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams Medical Research Institute (MASRI), Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Former Department of Biomedical Research, Armed Forces College of Medicine (AFCM), Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, New Giza University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Faculty of Biotechnology, October University for Modern Sciences and Art (MSA) University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Al Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Biotechnology and Molecular Biology, Global Research Lab, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181102,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bcl-2', 'childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', 'miR-125b', 'prognostic factors']",2018/11/06 06:00,2018/11/06 06:00,['2018/11/04 06:00'],"['2018/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.28017 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Cell Biochem. 2018 Nov 2. doi: 10.1002/jcb.28017.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6646-4674'],,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While non-inferior to the dynamic international prognostic scoring system (DIPSS), the lack of overlapping prognostic variables between the models leads to increased risk for disagreement between two valid prognostic models and presents a challenging clinical situation. In an external cohort of 266 molecularly annotated myelofibrosis (MF) patients, we demonstrated that the GIPSS model significantly differentiated between four risk groups (low, int-1, int-2, high) with median OS that was not reached, not reached, 60.5 and 28.9 months, respectively. High-risk patients had significantly inferior leukemia-free survival (LFS) (P < 0.0001). We identified a cohort of prognostically ambiguous patients (n = 39) in which GIPSS and DIPSS models differed by >/=2 risk groups. Among these patients, a similar proportion were up-staged by DIPSS (n = 19) and GIPSS (n = 20). Patients upstaged by GIPSS (genetically high-risk) had a trend toward inferior OS compared with patients upstaged by DIPSS (clinically high-risk) (P = .08) and significantly worse LFS (P = .04). Patients deemed intermediate-2 and high-risk by GIPSS who underwent allogeneic transplant had improved OS compared with those that did not (P = .04). GIPSS is a valid disease-specific prognostic system and outperforms DIPSS in patients where the two models disagree. Additionally, while GIPSS was developed for PMF; the current study shows, however, that the contemporary genetic model performs equally well for both primary and secondary myelofibrosis.","['Kuykendall, Andrew T', 'Talati, Chetasi', 'Padron, Eric', 'Sweet, Kendra', 'Sallman, David', 'List, Alan F', 'Lancet, Jeffrey E', 'Komrokji, Rami S']","['Kuykendall AT', 'Talati C', 'Padron E', 'Sweet K', 'Sallman D', 'List AF', 'Lancet JE', 'Komrokji RS']","['H.

The role of BTK as a downstream kinase in the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway is well described. As a key player in the pathogenesis of B-cell malignancies, targeting of dysregulated BCR signaling has been explored by development of inhibitors of downstream mediators. Discovery of the biological function of BTK and the development of covalent inhibitors for clinical use, ibrutinib as the lead agent and acalabrutinib as the second clinically approved BTK inhibitor, have revolutionized the treatment options for B-cell malignancies. Currently, ibrutinib is approved for mantle cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, small lymphocytic lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma and chronic graft versus host disease, while acalabrutinib is approved for mantle cell lymphoma. Potential expansion of indications in other diseases is under investigation in several clinical trials, while combination of BTK inhibitors with either chemoimmunotherapy or other targeted agents is being systematically explored in B-cell malignancies.","['da Cunha-Bang, Caspar', 'Niemann, Carsten Utoft']","['da Cunha-Bang C', 'Niemann CU']","['Department of Hematology, Zealand University Hospital, Sygehusvej 10, 4000, Roskilde, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Blegdamsvej 9, 2100, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Blegdamsvej 9, 2100, Copenhagen, Denmark.

DNA methylation profile was preserved in PDX mice in 97.5% of the promoters (rho = 0.99). Similarly, the genome-wide chromatin accessibility (ATAC-Seq) was preserved remarkably well (rho = 0.96). Interestingly, both the ATAC regions, which showed a significant decrease in accessibility in PDXs and the regions hypermethylated in PDXs, were associated with immune response, which might reflect the immune deficiency of the mice and potentially the incomplete interaction between murine cytokines and human receptors. The longitudinal approach of this study allowed an observation that samples collected from patients who developed a type 1 relapse (clonal mutations maintained at relapse) preserved their genomic composition; whereas in patients who developed a type 2 relapse (subset of clonal mutations lost at relapse), the preservation of the leukemia's composition was more variable. In sum, this study underlines the remarkable genomic stability, and for the first time documents the preservation of the epigenomic landscape in T-ALL-derived PDX models.","['Richter-Pechanska,

The successful development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) requires an assay system that permits a critical evaluation of their physicochemical and biological characteristics. At present a number of ADCC assay systems have been reported, however, there is still room for improvement in terms of usability, operability and sensitivity. Here we report a novel flow cytometric ADCC assay that uses a human natural killer cell line stably transfected with mouse FcgammaRIII, and Fc receptor common-gamma chain (FcRgamma) and a reporter gene as effector cells. This assay relies on discriminating effector and target cells by their differential immunofluorescence, which allows for clear-cut gating and accurate calculation of the number of surviving cells in a target population. This assay is easy and quick to perform and provides reliable data even for low frequency target cells in assay samples and with low concentrations of mAbs.

The overexpression of mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) causes the inactivation of p53 in acute leukemia. MDM2 inhibitors that activate p53 and induce apoptosis are currently being developed for potential treatment of acute leukemia. However, MDM2 inhibitors alone have limited efficacy in acute leukemia therapeutics. Combining other drugs to enhance the efficacy of MDM2 inhibitors is the thus considered as a potential treatment scheme. Here, we report that the combination of Nutlin-3 and Tanshinone IIA synergistically induces cytotoxicity, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and autophagic cell death, thereby imparting anti-leukemia effect in an acute leukemia cell line with wild-type p53 by effectively activating p53, inhibiting the AKT/mTOR pathway, and activating the RAF/MEK pathway. Using primary samples from acute leukemia patients, we show that the combination of Nutlin-3 plus Tanshinone IIA synergistically induces cytotoxicity by activating p53 and inhibiting the AKT/mTOR pathway. This specific combination of Nutlin-3 and Tanshinone IIA is also effective in preventing the recurrence of refractory leukemia, such as Ph+ ALL with the ABL kinase T315I mutation and AML with the FLT3-ITD mutation. Taken together, the results of this study demonstrate that the Nutlin-3 plus Tanshinone IIA combination exerts synergistic anti-leukemia effects by regulating the p53 and AKT/mTOR pathways, although further investigation is warranted. Small-molecule MDM2 antagonists plus Tanshinone IIA may thus be a promising strategy for the treatment of acute leukemia.","['Guo, Yong', 'Li, Yi', 'Wang, Fang-Fang', 'Xiang, Bing', 'Huang, Xiao-Ou', 'Ma, Hong-Bing', 'Gong, Yu-Ping']","['Guo Y', 'Li Y', 'Wang FF', 'Xiang B', 'Huang XO', 'Ma HB', 'Gong YP']","['Department of Hematology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, China.', 'Department of Human Sciences, Texas A&M University-Kingsville, Kingsville, TX 78363, USA.', 'School of Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, China.', 'Department of Hematology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, China.', 'Department of Hematology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, China.', 'Department of Hematology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, China.', 'Department of Hematology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, China.

Herein, we present an MRD monitoring strategy for B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of immunoglobulin (Ig) clonality before implementation into routine practice. METHODS: We selected 74 bone marrow (BM) specimens from 47 patients who were diagnosed with B-ALL. Ig clonality was analyzed using both fragment analysis and HTS. The performance of Ig clonality was evaluated through comparison of the results from real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of leukemia-specific fusion transcripts and flow cytometry. RESULTS: IGH clonality was observed in all patients, and the sum of clonal burden varied (9.47%-96.77%). IGK clonality was identified in 70% of patients and availed in cases with low IGH clonal burden. The total IGH clonal burden was significantly correlated with the proportion of leukemic blasts, leukemia-specific fusion transcripts, and flow cytometry. We recognized the different responses of each clone and emerging clones originating from the trace of Ig rearrangement presented in the initial specimen. IGH clonal burden after chemotherapy represented patient outcomes well. IGH assay also provided information of repertoire diversity of IGH rearrangement. CONCLUSION: The Ig clonality assay via HTS will be a promising tool for MRD monitoring of B-ALL through an adequate strategy to identify and monitor individual clones and determine repertoire diversity.","['Jo, Irene', 'Chung, Nack-Gyun', 'Lee, Seok', 'Kwon, Ahlm', 'Kim, Jiyeon', 'Choi, Hayoung', 'Jang, Woori', 'Kim, Seongkoo', 'Lee, Jae Wook', 'Yoon, Jae-Ho', 'Cho, Bin', 'Han, Kyungja', 'Kim, Yonggoo', 'Kim, Myungshin']","['Jo I', 'Chung NG', 'Lee S', 'Kwon A', 'Kim J', 'Choi H', 'Jang W', 'Kim S', 'Lee JW', 'Yoon JH', 'Cho B', 'Han K', 'Kim Y', 'Kim M']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, South Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, South Korea.', 'Department of Hematology, Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, South Korea.', 'Catholic Genetic Laboratory Center, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, South Korea.', 'Catholic Genetic Laboratory Center, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, South Korea.', 'Catholic Genetic Laboratory Center, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, South Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, South Korea; Catholic Genetic Laboratory Center, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, South Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, South Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, South Korea.', 'Department of Hematology, Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, South Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, South Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, South Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, South Korea; Catholic Genetic Laboratory Center, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, South Korea.

Accumulating evidence indicates that resistance to apoptosis in GB is mediated via upregulation of pro-survival BCL2-family members. The synthetic BH3-mimetic ABT-737 effectively targets BCL2, BCL2 like 1 and BCL2 like 2 but still barely affects cell survival which is presumably due to its inability to inhibit myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1). The constitutively active serine/threonine kinase proviral integration site for moloney murine leukemia virus 1 (PIM1) was recently found to be overexpressed in GB patient samples and to maintain cell survival in these tumors. For different GB cell lines, Western Blot, mitochondrial fractionation, fluorescence microscopy, effector caspase assays, flow cytometry, and an adult organotypic brain slice transplantation model were used to investigate the putative PIM1/MCL1 signaling axis regarding potential synergistic effects with ABT-737. We demonstrate that combination of the PIM1 inhibitor SGI-1776 or the pan-PIM kinase inhibitor AZD1208 with ABT-737 strongly sensitizes GB cells to apoptosis. Unexpectedly, this effect was found to be MCL1-independent, but could be partially blocked by caspase 8 (CASP8) inhibition. Remarkably, the analysis of autophagy markers in combination with the observation of massive accumulation and hampered degradation of autophagosomes suggests a completely novel function of PIM1 as a late stage autophagy regulator, maintaining the autophagic flux at the level of autophagosome/lysosome fusion. Our data indicate that PIM1 inhibition and ABT-737 synergistically induce apoptosis in an MCL1-independent but CASP8-dependent manner in GB. They also identify PIM1 as a suitable target for overcoming apoptosis resistance in GB.","['Remy, J', 'Linder, B', 'Weirauch, U', 'Konovalova, J', 'Marschalek, R', 'Aigner, A', 'Kogel, D']","['Remy J', 'Linder B', 'Weirauch U', 'Konovalova J', 'Marschalek R', 'Aigner A', 'Kogel D']","['Experimental Neurosurgery, Goethe University Hospital, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Experimental Neurosurgery, Goethe University Hospital, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Rudolf-Boehm-Institute for Pharmacology and Toxicology, Clinical Pharmacology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Experimental Neurosurgery, Goethe University Hospital, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Rudolf-Boehm-Institute for Pharmacology and Toxicology, Clinical Pharmacology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Experimental Neurosurgery, Goethe University Hospital, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.

Since such targets may be lost at relapse, appropriate selection of antigen receptor genes as MRD-PCR target is critical. Recently, next-generation sequencing (NGS) - much more sensitive and quantitative than classical PCR-heteroduplex approaches - has been introduced for identification of MRD-PCR targets. We evaluated 42 paired diagnosis-relapse samples by NGS (IGH, IGK, TRG, TRD, and TRB) to evaluate clonal evolution patterns and to design an algorithm for selection of antigen receptor gene rearrangements most likely to remain stable at relapse. Overall, only 393 out of 1446 (27%) clonal rearrangements were stable between diagnosis and relapse. If only index clones with a frequency >5% at diagnosis were taken into account, this number increased to 65%; including only index clones with an absolute read count >10,000, indicating truly major clones, further increased the stability to 84%. Over 90% of index clones at relapse were also present as index clone at diagnosis. Our data provide detailed information about the stability of antigen receptor gene rearrangements, based on which we propose an algorithm for selecting stable MRD-PCR targets, successful in >97% of patients.","['Theunissen, Prisca M J', 'de Bie, Maaike', 'van Zessen, David', 'de Haas, Valerie', 'Stubbs, Andrew P', 'van der Velden, Vincent H J']","['Theunissen PMJ', 'de Bie M', 'van Zessen D', 'de Haas V', 'Stubbs AP', 'van der Velden VHJ']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, The Netherlands; Department of Bioinformatics, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Bioinformatics, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

We aimed to assess the therapeutic equivalence of single-agent CT-P10 and rituximab in patients with newly diagnosed low-tumour burden follicular lymphoma. METHODS: In this ongoing, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, active-controlled, phase 3 trial, adult patients (>/=18 years) with stage II-IV low-tumour-burden follicular lymphoma were randomly assigned (1:1) using an interactive web or voice response system stratified by region, stage, and age to CT-P10 or US-sourced rituximab. Patients received CT-P10 or rituximab (375 mg/m(2) intravenous) on day 1 of four 7-day cycles (induction period). Patients who had disease control after the induction period continued to a maintenance period of CT-P10 or rituximab administered every 8 weeks for six cycles and, if completed, a second year of maintenance therapy of additional CT-P10 (every 8 weeks for six cycles) was offered. The study was partially unmasked after database lock (Feb 23, 2018) for all data up to 7 months (before cycle 3 of the maintenance period). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved an overall response by 7 months in the intention-to-treat population. Efficacy equivalence was shown if the two-sided 90% CIs for the treatment difference in the proportion of responders between CT-P10 and rituximab was within the equivalence margin of 17%. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02260804. FINDINGS: Between Nov 9, 2015, and Jan 4, 2018, 402 patients were assessed for eligibility, of whom 258 were randomly assigned: 130 to CT-P10 and 128 to rituximab. 108 (83%) of 130 patients assigned to CT-P10 and 104 (81%) of 128 assigned to rituximab achieved an overall response by month 7 (treatment difference estimate 1.8%; 90% CI -6.43 to 10.20). Therapeutic equivalence was shown (90% CIs were within the prespecified margin of 17%). The most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse events were decreased neutrophil count (two grade 3 in the CT-P10 group) and neutropenia (one in each group); all other grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in one patient each. Six (5%) of 130 patients who received CT-P10 and three (2%) of 128 who received rituximab experienced at least one treatment-emergent serious adverse event. INTERPRETATION: CT-P10 was equivalent to rituximab in terms of efficacy and was well tolerated. CT-P10 monotherapy is suggested as a new therapeutic option for patients with low-tumour-burden follicular lymphoma.

Eight imidazo[1,2-b]pyrazole-7-carboxamides have been tested for cytotoxic activity against five leukemia cell lines: Acute promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60), acute monocytic leukemia (THP-1), acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia (MOLT-4), biphenotypic B myelomonocytic leukemia (MV-4-11), and erythroleukemia (K-562) cells in vitro. Imidazo[1,2-b]pyrazole-7-carboxamides hampered the viability of all five leukemia cell lines with different potential. Optimization through structure activity relationship resulted in the following IC50 values for the most effective lead compound DU385: 16.54 nM, 27.24 nM, and 32.25 nM on HL-60, MOLT-4, MV-4-11 cells, respectively. Human primary fibroblasts were much less sensitive in the applied concentration range. Both monolayer or spheroid cultures of murine 4T1 and human MCF7 breast cancer cells were less sensitive to treatment with 1.5(-)10.8 muM IC50 values. Flow cytometry confirmed the absence of necrosis and revealed 60% late apoptotic population for MV-4-11, and 50% early apoptotic population for HL-60. MOLT-4 cells showed only about 30% of total apoptotic population. Toxicogenomic study of DU385 on the most sensitive MV-4-11 cells revealed altered expression of sixteen genes as early (6 h), midterm (12 h), and late response (24 h) genes upon treatment. Changes in ALOX5AP, TXN, and SOD1 expression suggested that DU385 causes oxidative stress, which was confirmed by depletion of cellular glutathione and mitochondrial membrane depolarization induction.

The conditions that promote ascendancy of particular clones are unclear. We found that mutations in PPM1D (protein phosphatase Mn(2+)/Mg(2+)-dependent 1D), a DNA damage response regulator that is frequently mutated in CH, were present in one-fifth of patients with therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome and strongly correlated with cisplatin exposure. Cell lines with hyperactive PPM1D mutations expand to outcompete normal cells after exposure to cytotoxic DNA damaging agents including cisplatin, and this effect was predominantly mediated by increased resistance to apoptosis. Moreover, heterozygous mutant Ppm1d hematopoietic cells outcompeted their wild-type counterparts in vivo after exposure to cisplatin and doxorubicin, but not during recovery from bone marrow transplantation. These findings establish the clinical relevance of PPM1D mutations in CH and the importance of studying mutation-treatment interactions.

The Fli-1 oncogene, a member of ETS gene family, plays a critical role in hematopoiesis and is overexpressed in diverse hematological malignancies. This ETS transcription factor regulates genes controlling several hallmarks of cancer and thus represents an excellent target for cancer therapy. By screening compounds isolated from the medicinal plant Dysoxylum binectariferum in China, we identified two chemically related flavagline-like compounds including 4'-demethoxy-3',4'-methylenedioxyrocaglaol and rocaglaol that strongly inhibited Fli-1 transactivation ability. These compounds altered expression of Fli-1 target genes including GATA1, EKLF, SHIP1, and BCL2. Consequently, the flavagline-like compounds suppressed proliferation, induced apoptosis, and promoted erythroid differentiation of leukemic cells in culture. These compounds also suppressed erythroleukemogenesis in vivo in a Fli-1-driven mouse model. Mechanistically, the compounds blocked c-Raf-MEK-MAPK/ERK signaling, reduced phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), and inhibited Fli-1 protein synthesis. Consistent with its high expression in myelomas, B-cell lymphoma, and B chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), pharmacological inhibition of Fli-1 by the flavagline-like compounds or genetic knock-down via shRNA significantly hindered proliferation of corresponding cell lines and patients' samples. These results uncover a critical role of Fli-1 in growth and survival of various hematological malignancies and point to flavagline-like agents as lead compounds for the development of anti-Fli-1 drugs to treat leukemias/lymphomas overexpressing Fli-1.","['Song, Jialei', 'Yuan, Chunmao', 'Yang, Jue', 'Liu, Tangjingjun', 'Yao, Yao', 'Xiao, Xiao', 'Gajendran, Babu', 'Xu, Dahai', 'Li, You-Jun',

The majority harbor translocations involving the MLL gene with AF9 as one of its most common fusion partners. MLL and AF9 loci contain breakpoint cluster regions (bcrs) with sequences hypothesized to be targets of topoisomerase II inhibitors that promote translocation formation. Overlap of MLL bcr sequences associated with both infant acute leukemia and therapy-related leukemia following exposure to the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide led to the hypothesis that exposure during pregnancy to biochemically similar compounds may promote infant acute leukemia. We established a reporter system to systematically quantitate and stratify the potential for such compounds to promote chromosomal translocations between the MLL and AF9 bcrs analogous to those in infant leukemia. We show bioflavonoids genistein and quercetin most biochemically similar to etoposide have a strong association with MLL-AF9 bcr translocations, while kaempferol, fisetin, flavone, and myricetin have a weak but consistent association, and other compounds have a minimal association in both embryonic stem (ES) and hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) populations. The frequency of translocations induced by bioflavonoids at later stages of myelopoiesis is significantly reduced by more than one log. The MLL and AF9 bcrs are sensitive to these agents and recombinogenic independent of their native context suggesting bcr sequences themselves are drivers of illegitimate DNA repair reactions and translocations, not generation of functional oncogenic fusions. This system provides for rapid systematic screening of relative risk, dose dependence, and combinatorial impact of multitudes of dietary and environmental exposures on MLL-AF9 translocations.

To unravel the relevance of NOTCH1/FBXW7 mutations associated with relapse, we performed whole-exome sequencing in 30 pediatric T-ALL cases, among which 11 diagnosis-relapse paired cases were further investigated to track the clonal evolution of relapse using amplicon-based deep sequencing. NOTCH1/FBXW7 alterations were detected in 73.3% (diagnosis) and 72.7% (relapse) of cases. Single nucleotide variations in the heterodimerization domain were the most frequent (40.0%) at diagnosis, whereas proline, glutamic acid, serine, threonine-rich (PEST) domain alterations were the most frequent at relapse (54.5%). Comparison between non-relapsed and relapsed cases at diagnosis showed a predominance of PEST alterations in relapsed cases (P = .045), although we failed to validate this in the TARGET cohort. Based on the clonal analysis of diagnosis-relapse samples, we identified NOTCH1 ""switching"" characterized by different NOTCH1 mutations in a major clone between diagnosis and relapse samples in 2 out of 11 diagnosis-relapse paired cases analyzed. We found another NOTCH1 ""switching"" case in a previously reported Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster cohort (n = 13), indicating NOTCH1 importance in both the development and progression of T-ALL. Despite the limitations of having a small sample size and a non-minimal residual disease-based protocol, our results suggest that the presence of NOTCH1 mutations might contribute to the disease relapse of T-ALL.","['Kimura, Shunsuke', 'Seki, Masafumi', 'Yoshida, Kenichi', 'Shiraishi, Yuichi', 'Akiyama, Masaharu', 'Koh, Katsuyoshi', 'Imamura, Toshihiko', 'Manabe, Atsushi', 'Hayashi, Yasuhide', 'Kobayashi, Masao', 'Oka, Akira', 'Miyano, Satoru', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Takita, Junko']","['Kimura S', 'Seki M', 'Yoshida K', 'Shiraishi Y', 'Akiyama M', 'Koh K', 'Imamura T', 'Manabe A', 'Hayashi Y', 'Kobayashi M', 'Oka A', 'Miyano S', 'Ogawa S', 'Takita J']","['Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Laboratory of DNA Information Analysis, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Saitama Children's Medical Center, Saitama, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto, Japan.', ""Department of Pediatrics, St. Luke's International Hospital, Tokyo, Japan."", ""Gunma Children's Medical Center, Shibukawa, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of DNA Information Analysis, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['17H04224/KAKENHI', '15H05909/KAKENHI', '16cm0106509h001/Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED)', 'Practical Research for Innovative Cancer Control and Project for Cancer Research', 'and Therapeutic Evolution (P-CREATE)', ""Children's Cancer Association of Japan"", 'the Friends of Leukemia Research Fund']",['Journal Article'],20190109,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7)', '0 (FBXW7 protein, human)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clonal Evolution/*genetics', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7/genetics', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology']",PMC6361559,['NOTNLM'],"['NOTCH1', 'T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'pediatric leukemia', 'relapse', 'whole-exome sequencing']",2018/11/06 06:00,2019/02/12 06:00,['2018/11/03 06:00'],"['2018/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/30 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/11/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.13859 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2019 Feb;110(2):784-794. doi: 10.1111/cas.13859.

Our aim was to estimate the PPV of BAL-GM in a contemporary cohort of patients with positive BAL-GM. METHODS: We identified consecutive patients with >/=1 positive BAL-GM value (index >/= 0.5) at Brigham and Women's Hospital from 11/2009 to 3/2016. We classified patients as having no, possible, probable, or proven IA, excluding BAL-GM as mycological criterion. RESULTS: We studied 134 patients: 54% had hematologic malignancy (HM), and 10% were solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. A total of 42% of positive (>/=0.5) BAL-GM results were falsely positive (PPV 58%). The number of probable IA cases was increased by 23% using positive BAL-GM as mycologic criterion alone. PPV was higher in patients with HM or SOT (P < 0.001) and with use of higher thresholds for positivity (BAL-GM >/= 1 vs 1-0.8 vs 0.8-0.5: P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: 42% of positive BAL-GM values were falsely positive. We propose a critical reassessment of BAL-GM cutoff values in different patient populations. Accurate noninvasive tests for diagnosis of IA are urgently needed.","['Farmakiotis, Dimitrios', 'Le, Audrey', 'Weiss, Zoe', 'Ismail, Nour', 'Kubiak, David W', 'Koo, Sophia']","['Farmakiotis D', 'Le A', 'Weiss Z', 'Ismail N', 'Kubiak DW', 'Koo S']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, Rhode Island Hospital, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Rhode Island Hospital, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Rhode Island Hospital, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island.', ""Brigham and Women's Hospital, Rhode Island Hospital, Division of Infectious Diseases, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Brigham and Women's Hospital, Rhode Island Hospital, Division of Infectious Diseases, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Brigham and Women's Hospital, Rhode Island Hospital, Division of Infectious Diseases, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.""]",['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",20181125,Germany,Mycoses,Mycoses,8805008,"['0 (Mannans)', '11078-30-1 (galactomannan)', 'X2RN3Q8DNE (Galactose)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/*chemistry', 'Clinical Laboratory Techniques/*methods', '*False Positive Reactions', 'Female', 'Galactose/analogs & derivatives', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications', 'Humans', 'Mannans/*analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Pulmonary Aspergillosis/*diagnosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Aspergillus', 'aspergillosis', 'galactomannan', 'haematologic malignancy', 'hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation', 'leukaemia', 'mould', 'transplantation']",2018/11/06 06:00,2019/03/19 06:00,['2018/11/03 06:00'],"['2018/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/19 06:00 [medline]', '2018/11/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/myc.12867 [doi]'],ppublish,Mycoses. 2019 Mar;62(3):204-213. doi: 10.1111/myc.12867.

Evolution of this technology has produced a robust antitumor immunotherapeutic strategy that has resulted in dramatic outcomes in liquid cancers. CAR-expressing T-cells (CARTs) targeting CD19 and CD20 have been successfully used in the treatment of hematologic malignancies, producing sustained tumor regressions in a majority of treated patients. These encouraging results have led to a historic and unprecedented FDA approval of CTL019, Novartis' CAR T-cell therapy for the treatment of children and young adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, the translation of this technology to solid tumors, like malignant gliomas (MG), has thus far been unsuccessful. This review provides a timely analysis of the factors leading to the success of CART immunotherapy in the setting of hematologic malignancies, barriers limiting its success in the treatment of solid tumors, and approaches to overcome these challenges and allow the application of CART immunotherapy as a treatment modality for refractory tumors, like malignant gliomas, that are in desperate need of effective therapies.","['Filley, Anna C', 'Henriquez, Mario', 'Dey, Mahua']","['Filley AC', 'Henriquez M', 'Dey M']","['Department of Neurosurgery, IU Simon Cancer Center, IU School of Medicine, Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis, Indianapolis, IN, United States.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, IU Simon Cancer Center, IU School of Medicine, Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis, Indianapolis, IN, United States.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, IU Simon Cancer Center, IU School of Medicine, Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis, Indianapolis, IN, United States.']",['eng'],['K08 NS092895/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20181017,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC6199385,['NOTNLM'],"['CAR T-cells', 'chimeric antigen receptor', 'glioblastoma', 'immunotherapy', 'malignant glioma']",2018/11/06 06:00,2018/11/06 06:01,['2018/11/03 06:00'],"['2018/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2018.00453 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2018 Oct 17;8:453. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2018.00453. eCollection 2018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine (AZA) has produced good results in the treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. The mechanism underlying its pharmacological activity involves many cellular processes including histone modifications, but chromatin regulation in AZA-resistant cells is still largely unknown. Therefore, we compared human leukemia cells with AZA resistance and their AZA-sensitive counterparts with regard to the response of histone modifications and their readers to AZA treatment to identify novel molecular target(s) in hematologic neoplasms with AZA resistance. We observed an a decrease of HP1gamma, a methylated lysine 9 of histone H3-specific reader protein, in AZA-sensitive cells after treatment, whereas AZA treatment did not affect HP1 family proteins in AZA-resistant cells. The expression of shRNA targeting HP1gamma reduced viability and induced apoptosis specifically in AZA-resistant cells, which accompanied with down-regulation of ATM/BRCA1 signaling, indicating that chromatin regulation by HP1gamma plays a key role in the survival of AZA-resistant cells. In addition, the amount of HP1gamma protein in AZA-sensitive and AZA-resistant cells was decreased after treatment with the bromodomain inhibitor I-BET151 at a dose that inhibited the growth of AZA-resistant cells more strongly than that of AZA-sensitive cells. Our findings demonstrate that treatment with AZA, which affects an epigenetic reader protein and targets HP1gamma, or a bromodomain inhibitor is a novel strategy that can be used to treat patients with hematopoietic neoplasms with AZA resistance.","['Imanishi, Satoshi', 'Umezu, Tomohiro', 'Kobayashi, Chiaki', 'Ohta, Tomohiko', 'Ohyashiki, Kazuma', 'Ohyashiki, Junko H']","['Imanishi S', 'Umezu T', 'Kobayashi C', 'Ohta T', 'Ohyashiki K', 'Ohyashiki JH']","['Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Translational Oncology, St. Marianna University Graduate School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181016,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,,PMC6198088,['NOTNLM'],"['azacytidine', 'bromodomain inhibitor', 'drug resistance', 'heterochromatin protein 1', 'histone modification', 'leukemia']",2018/11/06 06:00,2018/11/06 06:01,['2018/11/03 06:00'],"['2018/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2018.01166 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2018 Oct 16;9:1166. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2018.01166. eCollection 2018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deciphering these deranged T cell functional states and how they are impacted by induction chemotherapy is essential for incorporation of novel immune-based strategies to restore and maintain antileukemia immunity. METHODS: We utilized high-dimensional immunophenotyping, gene expression, and functional studies to characterize peripheral blood and bone marrow CD8+ T cells in 72 AML patients at diagnosis and after induction chemotherapy. RESULTS: Our data suggest that multiple aspects of deranged T cell function are operative in AML at diagnosis, with exhaustion and senescence being the dominant processes. Following treatment, the phenotypic and transcriptional profile of CD8+ T cells diverged between responders and nonresponders. Response to therapy correlated with upregulation of costimulatory, and downregulation of apoptotic and inhibitory, T cell signaling pathways, indicative of restoration of T cell function. In functional studies, AML blasts directly altered CD8+ T cell viability, expansion, co-signaling and senescence marker expression. This CD8+ T cell dysfunction was in part reversible upon PD-1 blockade or OX40 costimulation in vitro. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the uniqueness of AML in sculpting CD8+ T cell responses and the plasticity of their signatures upon chemotherapy response, providing a compelling rationale for integration of novel immunotherapies to augment antileukemia immunity.

A MERTK-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, MRX-2843, mediated therapeutic anti-leukemia effects in immunocompromised mice bearing a MERTK-expressing human leukemia xenograft. In addition, inhibition of host MERTK by genetic deletion (Mertk-/- mice) or treatment with MRX-2843 significantly decreased tumor burden and prolonged survival in immune-competent mice inoculated with a MERTK-negative ALL, suggesting immune-mediated therapeutic activity. In this context, MERTK inhibition led to significant decreases in expression of the coinhibitory ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 on CD11b+ monocytes/macrophages in the leukemia microenvironment. Furthermore, although T cells do not express MERTK, inhibition of MERTK indirectly decreased PD-1 expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and decreased the incidence of splenic FOXP3+ Tregs at sites of leukemic infiltration, leading to increased T cell activation. These data demonstrate direct and immune-mediated therapeutic activities in response to MERTK inhibition in ALL models and provide validation of a translational agent targeting MERTK for modulation of tumor immunity.","['Lee-Sherick, Alisa B', 'Jacobsen, Kristen M', 'Henry, Curtis J', 'Huey, Madeline G', 'Parker, Rebecca E', 'Page, Lauren S', 'Hill, Amanda A', 'Wang, Xiaodong', 'Frye, Stephen V', 'Earp, H Shelton', 'Jordan, Craig T', 'DeRyckere, Deborah', 'Graham, Douglas K']","['Lee-Sherick AB', 'Jacobsen KM', 'Henry CJ', 'Huey MG', 'Parker RE', 'Page LS', 'Hill AA', 'Wang X', 'Frye SV', 'Earp HS', 'Jordan CT', 'DeRyckere D', 'Graham DK']","['Department of Pediatrics.', 'Department of Immunology and Microbiology, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.', ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.', ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.', ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.', ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics.', 'Department of Pediatrics.', 'Center for Integrative Chemical Biology and Drug Discovery, Division of Chemical Biology and Medicinal Chemistry, Eshelman School of Pharmacy.', 'Center for Integrative Chemical Biology and Drug Discovery, Division of Chemical Biology and Medicinal Chemistry, Eshelman School of Pharmacy.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, and.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, and.', 'Departments of Medicine and Pharmacology, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Colorado, Aurora, Colorado, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.', ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.', ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.""]",['eng'],"['P30 DK057516/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA046934/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA137078/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 HD068372/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261200800001C/RC/CCR NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261200800001E/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181102,United States,JCI Insight,JCI insight,101676073,"['0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Foxp3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Mertk protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (c-Mer Tyrosine Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/metabolism', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Macrophages/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Monocytes/drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Microenvironment/drug effects', 'c-Mer Tyrosine Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",PMC6238750,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer immunotherapy', '*Oncology', '*Therapeutics']",2018/11/06 06:00,2019/11/22 06:00,['2018/11/03 06:00'],"['2017/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/22 06:00 [medline]']","['97941 [pii]', '10.1172/jci.insight.97941 [doi]']",epublish,JCI Insight. 2018 Nov 2;3(21). pii: 97941. doi: 10.1172/jci.insight.97941.,,,,,,,,,,,['JCI Insight. 2020 Dec 3;5(23):.

Although ultrasonography of ITET demonstrates a characteristic appearance similar to that of normal thymus, accurate differentiation from other thyroid nodule etiologies by ultrasonography is difficult, and so that fine needle aspiration (FNA) is usually performed for further analysis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of flow cytometry (FCM) in confirming the diagnosis of ITET in thyroid FNA samples. METHODS: Five cases of ITET were retrieved from our thyroid FNA database within a 3-year period. Their clinical information, ultrasonographic features, cytology and FCM findings were retrospectively reviewed. The FCM results were compared with those of 22 T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-ALL/LBL) cases. RESULTS: The FNA smears of all five ITET cases demonstrated abundant lymphocytes of variable sizes, which included some immature lymphoid cells. No Hassall's bodies or atypical epithelioid cells were recognised. By multicolour FCM analysis including antibodies against CD1a, CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, CD10, CD34, TDT and TCR, all ITET cases showed antigen expression patterns consistent with normal thymocyte maturation. All T-ALL/LBL cases exhibited significant immunophenotypic aberrancy. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of ITET based on FNA cytology is often inconclusive. The presence of immature lymphocytes often raises the concern for LBL. FCM with adequate antigen coverage can reliably distinguish ITET from T-ALL/LBL and make the diagnosis of ITET in FNA samples. Avoiding unnecessary further invasive procedures, providing reassurance to clinician and patient, the accurate diagnosis of ITET by FCM in FNA samples is clinically important.","['Li, Weijie', 'Dim, Daniel', 'Paulson, Lorien', 'Rivard, Douglas']","['Li W', 'Dim D', 'Paulson L', 'Rivard D']","[""Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Children's Mercy Hospital, Kansas City, Missouri, USA wli@cmh.edu."", 'Department of Pathology, Truman Medical Center, University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine, Kansas City, Missouri, USA.', ""Department of Otolaryngology, Children's Mercy Hospital, Kansas City, Missouri, USA."", ""Department of Radiology, Children's Mercy Hospital, Kansas City, Missouri, USA.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181101,England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biopsy, Fine-Needle', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Choristoma/*diagnosis', 'Cytodiagnosis/methods', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Thyroid Gland', 'Thyroid Nodule/*diagnosis']",,['NOTNLM'],"['ectopic thymus', 'fine needle aspiration', 'flow cytometry', 'thyroid']",2018/11/06 06:00,2019/01/27 06:00,['2018/11/03 06:00'],"['2018/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/27 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/27 06:00 [medline]', '2018/11/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['jclinpath-2018-205424 [pii]', '10.1136/jclinpath-2018-205424 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2019 Feb;72(2):145-151. doi: 10.1136/jclinpath-2018-205424.

As targetable mutations in AML are rare, novel oncogenic mechanisms are needed to define new therapeutic targets. We identified AML cells that exhibit an aberrant pool of nuclear glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta). This nuclear fraction drives AML growth and drug resistance. Nuclear, but not cytoplasmic, GSK3beta enhances AML colony formation and AML growth in mouse models. Nuclear GSK3beta drives AML partially by promoting nuclear localization of the NF-kappaB subunit, p65. Finally, nuclear GSK3beta localization has clinical significance as it strongly correlates to worse patient survival (n = 86; hazard ratio = 2.2; P < .01) and mediates drug resistance in cell and animal models.

Here we evaluated the influence of pretransplantation minimal residual disease (MRD) on leukemia relapse and survival after single- versus double-UCB transplantation (UCBT). Among 137 children and young adults who underwent UCBT in this randomized study, 115 had available data on MRD assessment done immediately before initiation of the pretransplantation conditioning regimen. MRD was considered positive at a level of >/=10(-4), which was the case of 43 out of 115 patients. Overall, the mean 3-year survival probability was 69.1 +/- 4.4%, and it was not significantly influenced by the MRD level: 70.7 +/- 5.4% in MRD-negative (<10(-4)) patients (n=72), 71.1 +/- 9.4% in MRD-positive patients with 10(-4) </= MRD <10(-3) (n=26) and 58.8 +/- 11.9% in MRD-positive patients with >/=10(-3) (n=17). In the MRD-positive group, the mean risk of relapse was significantly lower in the double-UCBT arm compared with the single-UCBT arm (10.5 +/- 7.2% versus 41.7 +/- 10.4%; P=.025) leading to a higher mean 3-year survival rate (82.6 +/- 9.3% versus 53.6 +/- 10.3%; P=.031).

Few studies have evaluated the clinicopathological significance of programmed death-1 (PD-1) expression in the cutaneous lesions of ATL. METHODS: Skin biopsy specimens from 29 ATL patients with cutaneous lesions were evaluated regarding the clinicopathological feature, survival outcome, and PD-1 expression level on infilitrated CD3+CD4+CD25+ cells. The optimal cut-off point of PD-1 expression for clinicopathological feature and outcome was determined as the value of the maximum Youden index by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: PD-1 was expressed broadly from zero to 90% on the skin biopsy specimens of the 29 patints, with the median value of 50%. The PD-1-expression level was significantly higher in the poorer-prognosis eruption group (nodulotumoral, erythrodermic and purpuric types) (P=0.003), in the poorer histopathological infiltration patterns (diffuse and nodular) (P=0.007), and in the poorer infiltrating cell-size group (large-sized cells) (P=0.017) than in the corresponding group. ROC curve analyses showed that the optimal cut-off value for PD-1-expression level to predict the poorer-prognosis eruption, the poorer- histopathological infiltration pattern, the poorer infiltration cell size, and the poorer outcome (death) was 60%, 50%, 50%, and 80%, respectively. Patients with high PD-1 expression had a shorter median survival time than those with low PD-1 expression (18.2 months vs. 26.0 months), but the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: ATL patients with cutaneous lesions in which PD-1 were highly expressed have more advanced dermatological and histopathological patterns and possibly worse survival than those with low PD-1 expression on cutaneous lesions. Further large-scale studies are warranted to verify these findings.","['Higuchi, Maho', 'Kuwatsuka, Yutaka', 'Murota, Hiroyuki', 'Iwanaga, Masako', 'Niino, Daisuke']","['Higuchi M', 'Kuwatsuka Y', 'Murota H', 'Iwanaga M', 'Niino D']","['Department of Dermatology and Allergology, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan; Department of Dermatology, National Hospital Organization Nagasaki Medical Center, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Frontier Life Sciences, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.

The aim of this study was to explore the role of Ednra in leukemogenesis further. In a murine bone marrow transplantation model, mice transplanted with cells overexpressing Ednra and Hoxa9 succumbed to leukemia significantly earlier than mice transplanted with cells overexpressing Hoxa9 only. Furthermore, overexpression of Ednra led to increased proliferation and resistance to apoptosis of bone marrow cells in vitro. We could also show that Meis1 binds to the Ednra promoter region, suggesting a regulatory role for Meis1 in Ednra expression. Taken together, our results suggest a role for Ednra in Hoxa9/Meis1-driven leukemogenesis.","['Arabanian, Laleh S', 'Johansson, Pegah', 'Staffas, Anna', 'Nilsson, Tina', 'Rouhi, Arefeh', 'Fogelstrand, Linda', 'Palmqvist, Lars']","['Arabanian LS', 'Johansson P', 'Staffas A', 'Nilsson T', 'Rouhi A', 'Fogelstrand L', 'Palmqvist L']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Gothenburg, Sweden; Department of Clinical Chemistry, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Gothenburg, Sweden; Department of Clinical Chemistry, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.

Many studies have reported the promising role of retinoids in attaining better outcomes for adult or pediatric patients suffering from several types of cancer, especially acute myeloid leukemia and neuroblastoma. However, even this promising differentiation therapy has some limitations: retinoid toxicity and intrinsic or acquired resistance have been observed in many patients. Therefore, the identification of molecular markers that predict the therapeutic response to retinoid treatment is undoubtedly important for retinoid use in clinical practice. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current knowledge on candidate markers, including both genetic alterations and protein markers, for retinoid resistance and sensitivity in human malignancies.","['Dobrotkova, Viera', 'Chlapek, Petr', 'Mazanek, Pavel', 'Sterba, Jaroslav', 'Veselska, Renata']","['Dobrotkova V', 'Chlapek P', 'Mazanek P', 'Sterba J', 'Veselska R']","['Laboratory of Tumor Biology, Department of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Kotlarska 2, 61137, Brno, Czech Republic.', ""International Clinical Research Center, St. Anne's University Hospital, Pekarska 53, 65691, Brno, Czech Republic."", 'Laboratory of Tumor Biology, Department of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Kotlarska 2, 61137, Brno, Czech Republic.', ""International Clinical Research Center, St. Anne's University Hospital, Pekarska 53, 65691, Brno, Czech Republic."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Cernopolni 9, 61300, Brno, Czech Republic.', ""International Clinical Research Center, St. Anne's University Hospital, Pekarska 53, 65691, Brno, Czech Republic."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Cernopolni 9, 61300, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Laboratory of Tumor Biology, Department of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Kotlarska 2, 61137, Brno, Czech Republic. veselska@sci.muni.cz.', ""International Clinical Research Center, St. Anne's University Hospital, Pekarska 53, 65691, Brno, Czech Republic. veselska@sci.muni.cz."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Cernopolni 9, 61300, Brno, Czech Republic. veselska@sci.muni.cz.']",['eng'],"['15-34621A/Ministerstvo Zdravotnictvi Ceske Republiky', 'LQ1605/Ministerstvo Skolstvi, Mladeze a Telovychovy']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20181101,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoids)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Disease Management', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/chemistry/metabolism', 'Retinoids/chemistry/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6211450,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Breast carcinoma', 'Cell differentiation', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma', 'Predictive biomarkers', 'Retinoid resistance', 'Retinoid sensitivity', 'Retinoids']",2018/11/06 06:00,2019/02/12 06:00,['2018/11/03 06:00'],"['2018/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-018-4966-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-018-4966-5 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2018 Nov 1;18(1):1059. doi: 10.1186/s12885-018-4966-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Importantly, the initiation of apoptosis often results in the activation of caspases, which, in turn, culminates in the generation of proteolytically-activated protein fragments with potentially new or altered roles. Recent investigations have revealed that the activity of a significant number of the protease-generated, activated, pro-apoptotic protein fragments can be curbed via their selective degradation by the N-end rule degradation pathways. Of note, previous work revealed that several proteolytically-generated, pro-apoptotic fragments are unstable in cells, as their destabilizing N-termini target them for proteasomal degradation via the N-end rule degradation pathways. Remarkably, previous studies also showed that the proteolytically-generated anti-apoptotic Lyn kinase protein fragment is targeted for degradation by the UBR1/UBR2 E3 ubiquitin ligases of the N-end rule pathway in chronic myeloid leukemia cells. Crucially, the degradation of cleaved fragment of Lyn by the N-end rule counters imatinib resistance in these cells, implicating a possible linkage between the N-end rule degradation pathway and imatinib resistance. Herein, we highlight recent studies on the role of the N-end rule proteolytic pathways in regulating apoptosis in mammalian cells, and also discuss some possible future directions with respect to apoptotic proteolysis signaling.","['Eldeeb, Mohamed A', 'Fahlman, Richard P', 'Esmaili, Mansoore', 'Ragheb, Mohamed A']","['Eldeeb MA', 'Fahlman RP', 'Esmaili M', 'Ragheb MA']","['Department of Chemistry (Biochemistry Division), Faculty of Science, Cairo University, Giza 12613, Egypt. eldeeb@ualberta.ca.', 'Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, Montreal, QC H3A 2B4, Canada. eldeeb@ualberta.ca.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H7, Canada. rfahlman@ualberta.ca.', 'Department of Oncology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H7, Canada. rfahlman@ualberta.ca.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H7, Canada. esmaili@ualberta.ca.', 'Department of Chemistry (Biochemistry Division), Faculty of Science, Cairo University, Giza 12613, Egypt. mattia@sci.cu.edu.eg.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20181031,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diet therapy/*metabolism', '*Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', '*Peptides/chemistry/metabolism', '*Proteolysis']",PMC6274719,['NOTNLM'],"['N-end-rule', 'N-terminal arginylation', 'apoptosis', 'cancer biology', 'caspases', 'cell death', 'proteases', 'protein degradation', 'proteolysis', 'ubiquitination']",2018/11/06 06:00,2019/01/30 06:00,['2018/11/03 06:00'],"['2018/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/24 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/30 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms19113414 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms19113414 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2018 Oct 31;19(11). pii: ijms19113414. doi: 10.3390/ijms19113414.,['ORCID: 0000-0001-9671-9340'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to explore the association between common foods and MGUS and progression to MM. Data from the population-based AGES Study (N = 5,764) were utilized. Food frequency questionnaire was used to assess dietary intake during adolescence, midlife, and late life. Serum protein electrophoresis and serum free light-chain assay was performed to identify MGUS (n = 300) and LC-MGUS cases (n = 275). We cross linked our data with the Icelandic Cancer Registry to find cases of MM in the study group. We found that intake of fruit at least three times per week during adolescence was associated with lower risk of MGUS when compared to lower fruit consumption (OR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.41-0.95). We additionally found that intake of fruit at least three times per week during the late life period was associated with decreased risk of progressing from MGUS to MM (HR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.13-0.89) when compared to lower intake. Adolescent intake of fruit may reduce risk of MGUS, whereas fruit intake after MGUS onset may reduce risk of progressing to MM. Our findings suggest that diet might alter the risk of developing MGUS and progression to MM.","['Thordardottir, Marianna', 'Lindqvist, Ebba K', 'Lund, Sigrun H', 'Costello, Rene', 'Burton, Debra', 'Steingrimsdottir, Laufey', 'Korde, Neha', 'Mailankody, Sham', 'Eiriksdottir, Gudny', 'Launer, Lenore J', 'Gudnason, Vilmundur', 'Harris, Tamara B', 'Landgren, Ola', 'Torfadottir, Johanna E', 'Kristinsson, Sigurdur Y']","['Thordardottir M', 'Lindqvist EK', 'Lund SH', 'Costello R', 'Burton D', 'Steingrimsdottir L', 'Korde N', 'Mailankody S', 'Eiriksdottir G', 'Launer LJ', 'Gudnason V', 'Harris TB', 'Landgren O', 'Torfadottir JE', 'Kristinsson SY']","['Faculty of Medicine, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital and Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Centre of Public Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'Multiple Myeloma Section, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Multiple Myeloma Section, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Faculty of Food Science and Human Nutrition, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'Myeloma Service, Division of Hematologic Oncology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, United States of America.', 'Myeloma Service, Division of Hematologic Oncology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, United States of America.', 'The Icelandic Heart Association, Kopavogur, Iceland.', 'Laboratory of Epidemiology and Population Sciences, Intramural Research Program, National Institute on Aging, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'The Icelandic Heart Association, Kopavogur, Iceland.', 'Laboratory of Epidemiology and Population Sciences, Intramural Research Program, National Institute on Aging, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Myeloma Service, Division of Hematologic Oncology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, United States of America.', 'Centre of Public Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'The Icelandic Cancer Society, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital and Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 AG012100/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181101,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,['0 (Blood Proteins)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Blood Proteins/metabolism', 'Bread/analysis', 'Diet', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', '*Food Analysis', '*Fruit', 'Humans', 'Iceland', 'Male', 'Meat', 'Middle Aged', 'Milk/metabolism', 'Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance/epidemiology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Multiple Myeloma/epidemiology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",PMC6211667,,,2018/11/02 06:00,2019/04/05 06:00,['2018/11/02 06:00'],"['2018/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0206047 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-22940 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2018 Nov 1;13(11):e0206047. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0206047. eCollection 2018.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-1273-3493'],"['Dr. Korde has previously received research funding from Amgen.

This report provides a comprehensive assessment of recent tobacco-associated cancer incidence for each cancer type by sex, age, race/ethnicity, metropolitan county classification, tumor characteristics, U.S. census region, and state. These data are important for initiation, monitoring, and evaluation of tobacco prevention and control measures. PERIOD COVERED: 2010-2014. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: Cancer incidence data from CDC's National Program of Cancer Registries and the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program were used to calculate average annual age-adjusted incidence rates for 2010-2014 and trends in annual age-adjusted incidence rates for 2010-2014. These cancer incidence data cover approximately 99% of the U.S. POPULATION: This report provides age-adjusted cancer incidence rates for each of the 12 cancer types known to be causally associated with tobacco use, including liver and colorectal cancer, which were deemed to be causally associated with tobacco use by the U.S. Surgeon General in 2014. Findings are reported by demographic and geographic characteristics, percentage distributions for tumor characteristics, and trends in cancer incidence by sex. RESULTS: During 2010-2014, approximately 3.3 million new tobacco-associated cancer cases were reported in the United States, approximately 667,000 per year. Age-adjusted incidence rates ranged from 4.2 AML cases per 100,000 persons to 61.3 lung cancer cases per 100,000 persons. By cancer type, incidence rates were higher among men than women (excluding cervical cancer), higher among non-Hispanics than Hispanics (for all cancers except stomach, liver, kidney, and cervical), higher among persons in nonmetropolitan counties than those in metropolitan counties (for all cancers except stomach, liver, pancreatic, and AML), and lower in the West than in other U.S. census regions (all except stomach, liver, bladder, and AML). Compared with other racial/ethnic groups, certain cancer rates were highest among whites (oral cavity and pharyngeal, esophageal, bladder, and AML), blacks (colon and rectal, pancreatic, laryngeal, lung and bronchial, cervical, and kidney), and Asians/Pacific Islanders (stomach and liver). During 2010-2014, the rate of all tobacco-associated cancers combined decreased 1.2% per year, influenced largely by decreases in cancers of the larynx (3.0%), lung (2.2%), colon and rectum (2.1%), and bladder (1.3%). INTERPRETATION: Although tobacco-associated cancer incidence decreased overall during 2010-2014, the incidence remains high in several states and subgroups, including among men, whites, blacks, non-Hispanics, and persons in nonmetropolitan counties. These disproportionately high rates of tobacco-related cancer incidence reflect overall demographic patterns of cancer incidence in the United States and also reflect patterns of tobacco use. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: Tobacco-associated cancer incidence can be reduced through prevention and control of tobacco use and comprehensive cancer-control efforts focused on reducing cancer risk, detecting cancer early, and better assisting communities disproportionately affected by cancer. Ongoing surveillance to monitor cancer incidence can identify populations with a high incidence of tobacco-associated cancers and evaluate the effectiveness of tobacco control programs and policies. Implementation research can be conducted to achieve wider adoption of existing evidence-based cancer prevention and screening programs and tobacco control measures, especially to reach groups with the largest disparities in cancer rates.","['Gallaway, M Shayne', 'Henley, S Jane', 'Steele, C Brooke', 'Momin, Behnoosh', 'Thomas, Cheryll C', 'Jamal, Ahmed', 'Trivers, Katrina F', 'Singh, Simple D', 'Stewart, Sherri L']","['Gallaway MS', 'Henley SJ', 'Steele CB', 'Momin B', 'Thomas CC', 'Jamal A', 'Trivers KF', 'Singh SD', 'Stewart SL']","['Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC.', 'Commissioned Corps, U.S. Public Health Service, Rockville, Maryland.', 'Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC.', 'Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC.', 'Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC.', 'Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC.', 'Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic Disease and Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC.', 'Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic Disease and Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC.', 'Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC.', 'Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181102,United States,MMWR Surveill Summ,"Morbidity and mortality weekly report.

The coexistence of CML and MGUS is an uncommon event, which is seldom reported in literature. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 52-year-old female was diagnosed with CML in April 2001. From November 2006, the patient started on imatinib mesylate and kept a complete hematologic and cytogenetic response for nearly 11 years. During her follow-up on July 7, 2017, thrombocytopenia (35*109/L) was found. Bone marrow aspiration revealed 6% plasma cell infiltration. Serum immunoelectrophoresis revealed 1.24 g/dL of serum monoclonal (M) protein of IgG-kappa type. DIAGNOSIS: MGUS was diagnosed because of absence of anemia, hypercalcemia, lytic bone lesions, or renal failure. Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) was also diagnosed in this patient following the detection of antiplatelet autoantibodies. Complex karyotype and missense mutation in PRDM1 were identified. INTERVENTIONS: Because of her obvious decrease of platelets, she started treatment with thalidomide and prednisone. OUTCOMES: Three months later, bone marrow aspirate showed disappearance of plasma cells. There developed an abrupt decrease in IgG and the absence of M-spike in serum immunoelectrophoresis. The platelet count kept normal during 1 year follow-up. LESSONS: Karyotypic event and gene mutation found in this case may be the initiation of disease transformation. Administration of thalidomide and prednisone proved effective in this patient.","['Ouyang, Wanyan', 'Zhao, Xiaohong', 'Lu, Shiyun', 'Wang, Zhi']","['Ouyang W', 'Zhao X', 'Lu S', 'Wang Z']","['Nanjing Medical University, Affiliated Wuxi Second Hospital, Department of Hematology, Wuxi, China.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,"['138415-26-6 (PRDM1 protein, human)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1)']",IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*complications/drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance/*diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1/genetics', 'Prednisolone/*therapeutic use', 'Prevalence', 'Thalidomide/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6221681,,,2018/11/02 06:00,2018/11/16 06:00,['2018/11/02 06:00'],"['2018/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000013103 [doi]', '00005792-201811020-00074 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2018 Nov;97(44):e13103. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000013103.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rTM) is a therapeutic DIC drug that is manufactured and sold in Japan only. We evaluated the efficacy of rTM compared to that of gabexate mesilate (GM), which was previously used routinely for treating DIC in Japan, in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This retrospective study enrolled 43 AML patients, including 17 with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), that was complicated with DIC. DIC resolution rates in non-APL AML and rTM-treated APL patients were 68.4% and 81.8%, respectively. In non-APL AML patients, the duration of rTM administration was significantly shorter than that of GM (7 vs 11 days), suggesting that rTM could improve DIC earlier than GM, although rTM was used in patients with more severe DIC. Moreover, treatment with rTM significantly improved DIC score, fibrinogen, fibrin/fibrinogen degradation product (FDP), and prothrombin time (PT) ratio. Conversely, treatment with GM only improved the DIC score and FDP. In APL patients, the duration of rTM administration was also significantly shorter than that of GM. No severe side effects associated with the progression of bleeding were observed during rTM administration. These findings suggest that rTM is safe, and its anti-DIC effects are more prompt than GM for treating AML patients with DIC.","['Ookura, Miyuki', 'Hosono, Naoko', 'Tasaki, Toshiki', 'Oiwa, Kana', 'Fujita, Kei', 'Ito, Kazuhiro', 'Lee, Shin', 'Matsuda, Yasufumi', 'Morita, Mihoko', 'Tai, Katsunori', 'Negoro, Eiju', 'Kishi, Shinji', 'Iwasaki, Hiromichi', 'Ueda, Takanori', 'Yamauchi, Takahiro']","['Ookura M', 'Hosono N', 'Tasaki T', 'Oiwa K', 'Fujita K', 'Ito K', 'Lee S', 'Matsuda Y', 'Morita M', 'Tai K', 'Negoro E', 'Kishi S', 'Iwasaki H', 'Ueda T', 'Yamauchi T']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Science, University of Fukui.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Science, University of Fukui.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Science, University of Fukui.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Science, University of Fukui.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Science, University of Fukui.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Science, University of Fukui.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Science, University of Fukui.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Science, University of Fukui.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Science, University of Fukui.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Science, University of Fukui.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Science, University of Fukui.', 'Department of Health and Nutrition, Jin-ai University.', 'Division of Infection Control, University of Fukui Hospital.', 'University of Fukui, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Science, University of Fukui.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,"['0 (Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (THBD protein, human)', '0 (Thrombomodulin)', '4V7M9137X9 (Gabexate)', '9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Female', 'Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products', 'Fibrinogen', 'Gabexate/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prothrombin Time', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thrombomodulin/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC6221668,,,2018/11/02 06:00,2018/11/15 06:00,['2018/11/02 06:00'],"['2018/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000012981 [doi]', '00005792-201811020-00028 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2018 Nov;97(44):e12981. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000012981.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a clear distinction between de novo Ph+ AML and chronic myeloid leukemia blast crisis is challenging. It is still a matter of debate whether Ph+ AML patients should be treated with chemotherapy or tyrosine kinase inhibitors as first-line therapy. PATIENT CONCERNS: We reported here a case of a 46-year-old man who was diagnosed as Ph+ AML. This diagnosis was confirmed by bone marrow pathology and karyotype analysis of 46, XY, t (9; 22). Further examination, molecular genetic analysis showed BCR/ABL1 (p190) without ABL1 kinase domain mutations, and direct evidence demonstrated in AML by flow cytometry. DIAGNOSIS: The diagnosis of Ph+ AML was made on May 2016 according to morphology, immunology, cytogenetic, and molecular criteria, and multiple organ failure was also diagnosed. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with dasatinib as the only medication after experiencing multiple organ failure. Then, he received 2 cycles of chemotherapy with IA (idarubicin 8 mg/m, day 1-3; cytarabine 100 mg/m, day 1-7) in August, 2016. OUTCOMES: The patient finally achieved a complete molecular remission. LESSONS: This case study suggests that dasatinib can be a safe and effective treatment for Ph+ AML patients with poor physical condition.","['Shao, Xiaoyan', 'Chen, Dangui', 'Xu, Peipei', 'Peng, Miaoxin', 'Guan, Chaoyang', 'Xie, Pinhao', 'Yuan, Cuiying', 'Chen, Bing']","['Shao X', 'Chen D', 'Xu P', 'Peng M', 'Guan C', 'Xie P', 'Yuan C', 'Chen B']","['Department of Hematology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School.', ""Department of Hematology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, Clinical College of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Hematology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School.', ""Department of Hematology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, Clinical College of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Examination/methods', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Dasatinib/*therapeutic use', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/therapeutic use', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Organ Failure/etiology', 'Mutation', 'Philadelphia Chromosome']",PMC6221582,,,2018/11/02 06:00,2018/11/15 06:00,['2018/11/02 06:00'],"['2018/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000012949 [doi]', '00005792-201811020-00023 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2018 Nov;97(44):e12949. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000012949.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare event, reported only of limited numbers. The present study reports a very rare case of t(8;21;22)(q22;q22;q11.2) with AML, not reported previously, and developed HLH at the same time. PATIENT CONCERNS AND DIAGNOSIS: A 15-year-old girl presented with a history of bleeding gums and high fever, leukocytosis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. While waiting the result of bone marrow aspirate, the HLH-associated examinations were abnormal. Bone marrow aspirate showed a hypercellular marrow with 1% myeloblasts. The cytogenetic and molecular studies revealed the presence of abnormal karyotype-46, XX, t(8;21;22)(q22;q22;q11.2) and RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion gene. Genetic detections of HLH showed heterozygous genetic variants in lysosomal trafficking regulator (LYST). Hence, she was diagnosed with AML with t(8;21;22)(q22;q22;q11.2) and HLH. INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES: All HLH clinical symptoms disappeared after the 4 weeks treatment of HLH. Then the patient received standard AML induction chemotherapy and the leukemia relapsed after 2 cycles of high-dosed consolidation therapy. Eventually, the patient received emergent paternal haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation based on the complex variant translocation, leukemia replased state and HLH with compound heterozygotes mutation, and achieved sustained remission with RUNX1-RUNX1T1 negative for more than 1 year. LESSONS: Patients with some specific recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities should be diagnosed with AML regardless of the blast count, for example t(8;21). We should improve the understanding of complex variant translocations. HLH-related genetic mutations were not only found in primary HLH, but also in second HLH.","['Wu, Yuling', 'Xu, Juan', 'Shen, Kai', 'Ji, Jie', 'Yang, Chenlu', 'Liu, Ting', 'Xiang, Bing']","['Wu Y', 'Xu J', 'Shen K', 'Ji J', 'Yang C', 'Liu T', 'Xiang B']","[""Department of Hematology, Hematology Research Laboratory, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*genetics/therapy', 'Lymphohistiocytosis, Hemophagocytic/complications/*genetics/therapy', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",PMC6221639,,,2018/11/02 06:00,2018/11/15 06:00,['2018/11/02 06:00'],"['2018/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000012762 [doi]', '00005792-201811020-00009 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2018 Nov;97(44):e12762. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000012762.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is the most common risk factor for gastric cancer (GC). The current study aimed to investigate the association between interleukin-11 (IL-11) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) levels among H. pylori-infected Egyptian patients with gastritis and GC. One hundred forty-seven patients with gastric lesions were endoscopically biopsied and assessed using rapid urease test and immunohistochemistry. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was done for the detection of H. pylori load in gastric biopsies and detection of LIF as well as IL-11 relative gene expression. The mean values of H. pylori load, LIF, and IL-11 were significantly elevated in GC patients compared to gastritis group (P < 0.0001). A positive significant correlation was detected between mucosal levels of LIF, IL-11, and H. pylori load in both groups. Both LIF and IL-11 had the same pattern of expression in gastric tissues with different types of gastritis and different types and grades of gastric carcinoma. This report could clarify the molecular events associated with the immune response against H. pylori infection and H. pylori-associated pathology. Therefore, development of immunotherapy strategies against H. pylori-induced cytokines becomes inevitable.","['Sabry, Dina', 'Abdelaleem, Omayma O', 'Hefzy, Enas M', 'Ibrahim, Amal A', 'Ahmed, Tarek I', 'Hassan, Essam A', 'Abdel-Hameed, Nehal D', 'Khalil, Mahmoud A F']","['Sabry D', 'Abdelaleem OO', 'Hefzy EM', 'Ibrahim AA', 'Ahmed TI', 'Hassan EA', 'Abdel-Hameed ND', 'Khalil MAF']","['1 Department of Medical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University , Cairo, Egypt .', '1 Department of Medical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University , Cairo, Egypt .', '2 Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Fayoum University , Fayoum, Egypt .', '2 Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Fayoum University , Fayoum, Egypt .', '3 Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Fayoum University , Fayoum, Egypt .', '4 Department of Tropical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Fayoum University , Fayoum, Egypt .', '5 Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University , Cairo, Egypt .', '6 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Fayoum University , Fayoum, Egypt .']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181031,United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,"['0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Egypt', 'Female', 'Gastritis/genetics/immunology/microbiology', 'Helicobacter Infections/genetics/*immunology/*microbiology', 'Helicobacter pylori/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/genetics/*immunology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Stomach Neoplasms/genetics/immunology/microbiology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Helicobacter pylori, gastric cancer', '*interleukin-11', '*leukemia inhibitory factor']",2018/11/02 06:00,2019/10/28 06:00,['2018/11/02 06:00'],"['2018/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/28 06:00 [medline]', '2018/11/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jir.2018.0065 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 2018 Nov;38(11):517-525. doi: 10.1089/jir.2018.0065.

This study was aimed to analyze percentage of apoptosis and apoptosis mediated through the intrinsic pathway with clinical outcomes in patients with pediatric AML. METHODS: This prospective study included pediatric AML patients enrolled from July 2013 to August 2016. Annexin-V (marker of total apoptosis) and caspase-9 expression (marker of intrinsic pathway) was determined in baseline bone marrow (BM) samples by flow cytometery and compared with controls (unaffected BM of solid tumors and peripheral blood [PB] of unaffected siblings). Overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were compared using log-rank test. RESULTS: A total of 151 AML patients were enrolled, median age 10 (range: 0.7-18 years). Annexin-V expression in blast cells was significantly high in AML patients as compared to BM of subjects with solid tumors (P = 0.01) and PB of healthy subjects (P = 0.04). Caspase-9 expression in blast cells was not significantly different. Median annexin-V expression was significantly higher in patients with WBC count >/=11 000/mm(3) (P = 0.02), poor-risk cytogenetics (P = 0.02), the absence of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 translocation (P = 0.004), and the absence of NPM1 mutation (P = 0.05). Patients with high annexin-V expression had significantly inferior OS (P = 0.05) in univariate analysis but not in multivariate analysis (P = 0.32). CONCLUSION: Apoptosis as a whole was found to be activated in baseline BM samples of AML patients. High apoptosis may be associated with high-risk phenotype in this disease.","['Tyagi, Anudishi', 'Pramanik, Raja', 'Bakhshi, Radhika', 'Vishnubhatla, Sreenivas', 'Bakhshi, Sameer']","['Tyagi A', 'Pramanik R', 'Bakhshi R', 'Vishnubhatla S', 'Bakhshi S']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dr. B.

This study provides recent data regarding the incidence of CML in Calgary, a major Canadian city. Data from patients diagnosed with CML by bone marrow sample analysis from 2011 to 2015 were collected from the database of the sole centralized cytogenetics facility in service of Calgary and its surrounding area. RESULTS: With an average of 10.2 newly diagnosed cases per year in Calgary from 2011 to 2015, the incidence rate was calculated to be 0.75 cases per 100,000 person-years (95% CI 0.57-0.99). With age standardization, the incidence was 0.87 cases per 100,000 person-years (95% CI 0.82-0.91) for the Canadian population, which was low compared to other developed Western nations. The highest incidence rates were observed in the older patient categories, however there was a broad age distribution for incident cases and the median age at diagnosis was 48. There was a general male bias for CML most pronounced at the younger ages. Our description of CML incidence will help to inform healthcare planners amidst the dramatically altered treatment of this hematological neoplasm.","['Nguyen, Leonard Tu', 'Guo, Maggie', 'Naugler, Christopher', 'Rashid-Kolvear, Fariborz']","['Nguyen LT', 'Guo M', 'Naugler C', 'Rashid-Kolvear F']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'Departments of Family Medicine and Community Health, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada. fariborz.kolvear@albertahealthservices.ca.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada. fariborz.kolvear@albertahealthservices.ca.', 'Diagnostic and Scientific Centre, 2E-415, 9 3535 Research Road NW, Calgary, AB, T2L2K8, Canada. fariborz.kolvear@albertahealthservices.ca.']",['eng'],['RN254781-333204/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],['Journal Article'],20181101,England,BMC Res Notes,BMC research notes,101462768,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alberta/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Young Adult']",PMC6211485,['NOTNLM'],"['Canada', 'Cancer epidemiology', 'Chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Hematological neoplasm, incidence', 'Myeloproliferative neoplasm']",2018/11/02 06:00,2019/02/23 06:00,['2018/11/02 06:00'],"['2018/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13104-018-3890-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s13104-018-3890-8 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Res Notes. 2018 Nov 1;11(1):780. doi: 10.1186/s13104-018-3890-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of concern are potential dysregulations in immunity, which could increase the likelihood of cancer and latent viral reactivation. Natural killer (NK) cells are critical effectors of the innate immune system, and their function and phenotype are important to immunosurveillance of nascent tumors and latent viral infections. We compared changes in NK cell phenotype and function in eight crew members who completed an ~6-mo mission to the International Space Station (ISS) with healthy controls who remained on Earth. Assessments were made before (180 and 60 days before launch), during [flight day + 90 days (FD+90) and 1 day before return (R-1)], and after the mission (at R+0, R+18, R+33, and R+66). These samples, plus an additional in-flight sample (FD+180), were collected from a crew member who spent 340 days (~1 yr) on the ISS. NK cell cytotoxic activity (NKCA) against K562 leukemia targets in vitro was reduced by ~50% at FD+90 in ISS crew but not controls. This decrease was more pronounced in ""rookie"" compared with ""veteran"" crew members. The ~1-yr mission crew member did not show declines in NKCA against K562 until late in the mission (R-1 and R+0). NK cell numbers, expression of activating and inhibitory receptors, target cell binding, and expression and degranulation of perforin and granzyme B were unaltered with spaceflight. Similarly, when we exposed an immortalized NK cell line (NK-92) to sera collected at different mission time points (before, during, and after flight), there was no effect on NKCA. This is the first study to report impaired NK cell function during long-duration space travel. Countermeasures may be needed to mitigate immune system impairment in exploration class mission crew during long-duration spaceflight missions. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Immune system impairment may inhibit future human space exploration missions to Mars. Natural killer (NK) cells are key components of immunity and vital for tumor surveillance and the prevention of latent virus reactivation.

Abnormal expression of micro-RNAs has been found in nearly all types of pathologies, including cancers. MiR-155 has been the first microRNA to be implicated in the regulation of the innate and adaptative immune responses, and its expression is either increased or decreased in a variety of liquid and solid malignancies. In this review, we examine the oncogenic and antitumor potentials of miR-155, with special emphasize on its dose-dependent effects. We describe the impact of miR-155 levels on antitumor activity of lymphocytes and myeloid cells. We discuss miR-155 dose-dependent effects in leukemias and analyze results showing that miR-155 intermediate levels tend to be detrimental, whereas high levels of miR-155 expression usually prove beneficial. We also examine the beneficial effects of high levels of miR-155 expression in solid tumors. We discuss the possible causal involvement of miR-155 in leukemias and dementia in individuals with Down's syndrome. We finally propose that increasing miR-155 levels in immune cells might increase the efficiency of newly developed cancer immunotherapies, due to miR-155 ability to target transcripts encoding immune checkpoints such as cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 or programmed death-ligand 1.","['Michaille, Jean-Jacques', 'Awad, Hamdy', 'Fortman, Emily C', 'Efanov, Alexander A', 'Tili, Esmerina']","['Michaille JJ', 'Awad H', 'Fortman EC', 'Efanov AA', 'Tili E']","['BioPerox-IL, Universite de Bourgogne-Franche Comte (EA 7270), Dijon, France.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, Wexner Medical Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, Wexner Medical Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, Wexner Medical Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, Wexner Medical Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, Wexner Medical Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, Wexner Medical Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (MIRN155 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogenesis/*genetics/immunology', 'Down Syndrome/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Leukemia/*genetics/immunology/therapy', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Escape/*genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['* miR-155', ""*Down's syndrome"", '*cancer immunity', '*dose effect', '*microRNA']",2018/11/02 06:00,2019/04/12 06:00,['2018/11/02 06:00'],"['2018/09/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/25 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/11/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.22698 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2019 Apr;58(4):208-218. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22698.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-3540-8220'],,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, current understanding of the lncRNA deleted in lymphocytic leukemia 1 (DLEU1) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains limited. Our studies indicated that the DLEU1 expression level was upregulated in PDAC tissue samples compared with adjacent normal tissue. Moreover, the aberrant overexpression of DLEU1 indicated poor prognosis of patients with PDAC. Loss-of-function experiments revealed that DLEU1 knockdown inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of PDAC cells in vitro and decreased tumor growth in vivo. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that miR-381 potentially targeted the DLEU1 3'-untranslated region (UTR), suggesting an interaction between miR-381 and DLEU1. Furthermore, miR-381 also targeted the chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4) messenger RNA 3'-UTR, which was validated by luciferase reporter assay. Taken together, our study demonstrated the oncogenic role of DLEU1 in clinical PDAC specimens and cellular experiments, showing the potential involvement of DLEU1/miR-381/CXCR4 pathway.

METHODS: A lifetime partitioned survival model with four health states (active disease, complete remission [CR], relapse, and death) was constructed. Efficacy inputs (time to CR or death, time to relapse or death, and overall survival) were estimated using data from the RATIFY trial (NCT00651261). Costs (inflated to 2016 US dollars) included treatment, drug monitoring, stem cell transplantation (SCT), adverse events costs, and medical costs associated with health states. Incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and life-year (LY) gained were estimated. Deterministic (DSA) and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (and PSA) were performed to assess model robustness. RESULTS: In the base case, patients in the midostaurin arm incurred higher total direct costs over a lifetime compared with the placebo arm ($4,043,470 vs. $3,959,741), resulting in an incremental cost of $83,729; however, the midostaurin arm had better effectiveness, with 1.59 more LYs and 1.37 more QALYs. These led to a base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $52,596 per LY, or $61,167 per QALY. Results were robust in the DSA. In the PSA, the probability of the midostaurin arm being cost-effective compared with the placebo arm was 65.9%, at a willingness to pay of $150,000/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that midostaurin is a cost-effective treatment for adult patients with newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated AML, from a US third-party payer perspective.","['Stein, Eytan', 'Xie, Jipan', 'Duchesneau, Emilie', 'Bhattacharyya, Subrata', 'Vudumula, Umakanth', 'Ndife, Briana', 'Bonifacio, Gaetano', 'Guerin, Annie', 'Li, Nanxin', 'Joseph, George']","['Stein E', 'Xie J', 'Duchesneau E', 'Bhattacharyya S', 'Vudumula U', 'Ndife B', 'Bonifacio G', 'Guerin A', 'Li N', 'Joseph G']","['Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Analysis Group, Inc., 333 South Hope Street, 27th Floor, Los Angeles, CA, 90071, USA.

We have demonstrated that pre-treating irradiated immune-deficient mice with hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) prior to UCB CD34+ cell transplantation lowered host systemic erythropoietin (EPO) and improved UCB CD34+ cell homing and engraftment. These findings suggested that EPO-EPO-R signaling plays a role in UCB CD34+ homing and engraftment. In a pilot clinical trial, we showed that recipients of HBO therapy prior to UCB cell infusion had reduced systemic EPO, which was associated with improved kinetics of blood count recovery. Although early clinical outcomes at day 100 were encouraging, with improved overall survival, the long-term effects of HBO therapy on UCB-transplanted patients were not evaluated. In this study, we examined the long-term outcome of patients in our pilot study, compared with a historic control group, and correlated their clinical outcomes to serum EPO response to HBO. While 50% of HBO-treated patients received single UCB units, ~ 90% of the control patients received double UCB units. Although HBO patients had much better rates of survival at 6 months, their 1-year survival did not significantly differ from the control group. HBO-treated patients had on average lower relapse and non-relapse mortality rates, and less chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD), but had increased acute GVHD. However, these differences were not statistically significant, probably because of the small sample size. In the HBO-treated cohort, immune reconstitution analysis showed significant improvement in early B cell recovery, with a trend toward improvement in early NK cell recovery. When we evaluated the ratio of 8 h to baseline EPO levels, we found a non-significant trend toward lower EPO values in those who neither relapsed nor died by 1 year, compared to those who died or relapsed. This result suggests that EPO response to HBO may be associated with better outcomes. Disease progression-free survival was also improved in those who had more than 80% reduction in EPO levels in response to HBO. Our study highlights the long-term safety of HBO therapy when used prior to UCB transplantation.

Monoclonal antibody, especially rituximab, has been a conventional strategy in the treatment of B-cell malignancies such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, treatment with monoclonal antibodies has not been enough to overcome the refractory/relapse problems. Chimeric antigen receptor engineered T (CAR-T) cells have exhibited excellent therapeutic effect on lymphocytic leukemia in recent years. In this study, a CD20-specific CAR was constructed and the cytotoxic efficacy of CD20 CAR-T cells on B-cell malignant cells was evaluated by CD107a degranulation, pro-inflammation cytokine production, and true lytic ability in vitro and in vivo. It was found that CD20 CAR-T cells possessed stronger cytotoxic ability against CD20 highly expressed cells. Furthermore, when histone deacetylase inhibitor was used to enhance the expression of CD20 antigen on the surface of B-cell malignant cells via inducing acetylation of H3K9 on CD20 promoter site, it revealed that the cytotoxicity of CD20 CAR-T cells against histone deacetylase inhibitor-treated B-cell malignant cells was significantly enhanced.","['Xu, Yingxi', 'Li, Saisai', 'Wang, Ying', 'Liu, Jia', 'Mao, Xinhe', 'Xing, Haiyan', 'Tian, Zheng', 'Tang, Kejing', 'Liao, Xiaolong', 'Rao, Qing', 'Xiong, Dongsheng', 'Wang, Min', 'Wang, Jianxiang']","['Xu Y', 'Li S', 'Wang Y', 'Liu J', 'Mao X', 'Xing H', 'Tian Z', 'Tang K', 'Liao X', 'Rao Q', 'Xiong D', 'Wang M', 'Wang J']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190123,United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD20/*genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/methods', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/*metabolism', 'T-Cell Antigen Receptor Specificity/genetics/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*B-cell malignancies', '*CD20', '*HDAC inhibitor', '*Immunotherapy', '*chimeric antigen receptor']",2018/11/02 06:00,2020/03/12 06:00,['2018/11/02 06:00'],"['2018/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/11/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.2018.119 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2019 Apr;30(4):497-510. doi: 10.1089/hum.2018.119.

Acalabrutinib is a second generation BTK inhibitor that binds covalently to the Cys481 residue on BTK and has half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 3 nM. In preclinical mouse models, acalabrutinib significantly reduced proliferation of CLL cells. Results of Phase I/II trials revealed overall response rates (ORR) of 96% in treatment-naive, 93% in relapsed/refractory and 76% in ibrutinib intolerant patients with CLL.

With underlying childhood leukemia, the child suffered from recurrent bacterial and fungal infection and even underwent abdominal surgery during the treatment. Fortunately, the therapeutic effect was finally achieved by adjusting the treatment program to dual anti-fungal treatment with micafungin and amphotericin B. Information regarding the epidemiological, clinical, and therapeutic features, in this case, shows significant perspectives for anti-fungal treatment for immunocompromised individuals, wherefore the rate of recovery and survival can be achieved.","['Liu, Xingxin', 'Zhou, Wei', 'Jiang, Yongmei', 'Kuang, Linghan']","['Liu X', 'Zhou W', 'Jiang Y', 'Kuang L']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University.', 'Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University.', 'Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University.', 'Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University.', 'Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20181031,Japan,Jpn J Infect Dis,Japanese journal of infectious diseases,100893704,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', 'R10H71BSWG (Micafungin)']",IM,"['Amphotericin B/administration & dosage', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'China', 'Geotrichosis/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Geotrichum/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Invasive Fungal Infections/drug therapy/*etiology/*pathology', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Male', 'Micafungin/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Geotrichum clavatum', 'chemotherapy', 'invasive fungal infections', 'leukemia']",2018/11/02 06:00,2019/04/23 06:00,['2018/11/02 06:00'],"['2018/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/23 06:00 [medline]', '2018/11/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.7883/yoken.JJID.2018.351 [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Infect Dis. 2019 Mar 25;72(2):130-132. doi: 10.7883/yoken.JJID.2018.351.

In this study, we performed whole-exome sequencing (n = 9) and targeted sequencing (n = 56) of samples from pediatric MLL-rearranged AML patients enrolled in the Japanese Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group AML-05 study. Additionally, we analyzed 105 pediatric t(8;21) AML samples and 30 adult MLL-rearranged AML samples. RNA-sequencing data from 31 patients published in a previous study were also reanalyzed. As a result, we identified 115 mutations in pediatric MLL-rearranged AML patients (2.1 mutations/patient), with mutations in signaling pathway genes being the most frequently detected (60.7%). Mutations in genes associated with epigenetic regulation (21.4%), transcription factors (16.1%), and the cohesin complex (8.9%) were also commonly detected. Novel CCND3 mutations were identified in 5 pediatric MLL-rearranged AML patients (8.9%) and 2 adult MLL-rearranged AML patients (3.3%). Recurrent mutations of CCND1 (n = 3, 2.9%) and CCND2 (n = 8, 7.6%) were found in pediatric t(8;21) AML patients, whereas no CCND3 mutations were found, suggesting that D-type cyclins exhibit a subtype-specific mutation pattern in AML. Treatment of MLL-rearranged AML cell lines with CDK4/6 inhibitors (abemaciclib and palbociclib) blocked G1 to S phase cell-cycle progression and impaired proliferation. Pediatric MLL-MLLT3-rearranged AML patients with coexisting mutations (n = 16) had significantly reduced relapse-free survival and overall survival compared with those without coexisting mutations (n = 9) (P = .048 and .046, respectively).

A targeted therapy approach is not available for children with this subtype of leukemia. To identify the molecular mechanisms underlying ETV6-RUNX1-driven leukemia, we performed gene expression profiling of healthy hematopoietic progenitors in which we ectopically expressed ETV6-RUNX1. We reveal an ETV6-RUNX1-driven transcriptional network that induces proliferation, survival and cellular homeostasis. In addition, Vps34, an important regulator of autophagy, was found to be induced by ETV6-RUNX1 and up-regulated in ETV6-RUNX1-positive leukemic patient cells. We show that induction of Vps34 was transcriptionally regulated by ETV6-RUNX1 and correlated with high levels of autophagy. Knockdown of Vps34 in ETV6-RUNX1-positive cell lines severely reduced proliferation and survival. Inhibition of autophagy by hydroxychloroquine, a well-tolerated autophagy inhibitor, reduced cell viability in both ETV6-RUNX1-positive cell lines and primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples, and selectively sensitized primary ETV6-RUNX1-positive leukemia samples to L asparaginase. These findings reveal a causal relationship between ETV6-RUNX1 and autophagy, and provide pre-clinical evidence for the efficacy of autophagy inhibitors in ETV6-RUNX1-driven leukemia.","['Polak, Roel', 'Bierings, Marc B', 'van der Leije, Cindy S', 'Sanders, Mathijs A', 'Roovers, Onno', 'Marchante, Joao R M', 'Boer, Judith M', 'Cornelissen, Jan J', 'Pieters, Rob', 'den Boer, Monique L', 'Buitenhuis, Miranda']","['Polak R', 'Bierings MB', 'van der Leije CS', 'Sanders MA', 'Roovers O', 'Marchante JRM', 'Boer JM', 'Cornelissen JJ', 'Pieters R', 'den Boer ML', 'Buitenhuis M']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Erasmus MC - Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, University Medical Center Utrecht.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Erasmus MC - Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Erasmus MC - Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam."", 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Erasmus MC - Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam m.l.denboer@prinsesmaximacentrum.nl."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181031,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class III Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Asparaginase/*pharmacology', 'Autophagic Cell Death/*drug effects/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Class III Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology']",PMC6442983,,,2018/11/02 06:00,2020/05/07 06:00,['2018/11/02 06:00'],"['2018/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/07 06:00 [medline]', '2018/11/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.193631 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.193631 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2019 Apr;104(4):738-748. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.193631.

AIM: We aim to assess the neurocognitive functions of ALL survivors who had been treated with chemotherapy only using two different protocols, and to identify treatment-related risk factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We carried a multicenter study involving 3 pediatric oncology centers on 100 children who were treated for ALL. Fifty patients were treated by the modified Children's Cancer Group (CCG) 1991 protocol with low dose methotrexate and 50 children were treated by Total XV protocol with high dose methotrexate. Fifty healthy children were included as a control group. Psychometric assessment using Arabic version of Wechsler intelligence scale for children (WISC III) was performed for all patients and controls. RESULTS: Patients had significantly lower mean full scale IQ, performance IQ and verbal IQ than controls. Patients </= 5 years at diagnosis had significantly lower mean full scale IQ and performance IQ than patients>5 years at diagnosis, while the verbal IQ showed no significant difference between both age groups. Female patients had significantly lower mean full scale IQ, performance IQ and verbal IQthan males. Patients who received Total XV protocol with high dose methotrexate had significantly lower mean full scale IQ, performance IQ and verbal IQ than patients who received modified CCG 1991 protocol with low dose methotrexate. CONCLUSIONS: CNS directed chemotherapy might appear to affect neurocognitive functions in children with ALL, which is more significant in young children at diagnosis, in girls and in those receiving high dose methotrexate.","['Sherief, Laila M', 'Sanad, Reda', 'ElHaddad, Alaa', 'Shebl, Adel', 'Abdelkhalek, Elhamy R', 'Elsafy, Eman R', 'Hassan, Tamer H', 'Raafat, Nelly', 'Kamal, Naglaa M', 'Attia, Eman I']","['Sherief LM', 'Sanad R', 'ElHaddad A', 'Shebl A', 'Abdelkhalek ER', 'Elsafy ER', 'Hassan TH', 'Raafat N', 'Kamal NM', 'Attia EI']","['Pediatric Oncology Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt.', 'Pediatric Department, Benha Pediatric Special Hospital, Benha, Egypt.', 'Pediatric oncology department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Pediatric Department, Benha Pediatric Special Hospital, Benha, Egypt.', 'Pediatric Oncology Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt.', 'Psychiatry Department, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt.', 'Pediatric Oncology Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt.', 'Psychiatry Department, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt.', 'Pediatric Department, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Pediatric Oncology Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Pediatr Rev,Current pediatric reviews,101240290,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cancer Survivors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition/drug effects', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Egypt', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intelligence Tests', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage', 'Neurocognitive Disorders/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy', 'Psychometrics/methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6416189,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'Neurocognitive', 'chemotherapy', 'children', 'leukemia', 'survivors.']",2018/11/02 06:00,2019/01/12 06:00,['2018/11/02 06:00'],"['2018/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/03 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/11/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['CPR-EPUB-94153 [pii]', '10.2174/1573396314666181031134919 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Pediatr Rev. 2018;14(4):253-260. doi: 10.2174/1573396314666181031134919.,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cancer stem cells (CSC) have recently been characterized as being responsible for resistance to radio/chemotherapies and metastasis formation, opening up perspectives for new targeted therapies. Those CSCs express biomarkers such as cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44) and display high aldehyde dehydrogenase activity that converts vitamin A-derived retinal into retinoic acids. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), which has pro-differentiating properties, has revolutionized the prognosis of acute promyelotic leukemia by increasing its remission rate from 15% to 85%. Recent studies have started to show that ATRA also has an anti-tumoral role on solid cancers such as GC. The purpose of this review is therefore to summarize the work that evaluated the effects of ATRA in GC and to evaluate whether its anti-cancerous action involves gastric CSCs targeting. It has been demonstrated that ATRA can block the cell cycle, enhance apoptosis, and decrease gastric CSCs properties in GC cell lines, tumorspheres, and patient-derived xenograft mice models. Therefore, retinoids and new synthetic retinoids seem to be a promising step forward in targeted therapy of gastric CSC in combination with existing chemotherapies. Future studies should probably focus on these points.","['Bouriez, Damien', 'Giraud, Julie', 'Gronnier, Caroline', 'Varon, Christine']","['Bouriez D', 'Giraud J', 'Gronnier C', 'Varon C']","['INSERM, U1053, Bordeaux Research in Translational Oncology, 33000 Bordeaux, France. damienbouriezbt@gmail.com.', 'Department of Digestive Surgery, Haut-Leveque Hospital, 33000 Bordeaux, France. damienbouriezbt@gmail.com.', 'INSERM, U1053, Bordeaux Research in Translational Oncology, 33000 Bordeaux, France. julie.giraud@u-bordeaux.fr.', 'Department of Life and Health Sciences, University of Bordeaux, 33000 Bordeaux, France. julie.giraud@u-bordeaux.fr.', 'INSERM, U1053, Bordeaux Research in Translational Oncology, 33000 Bordeaux, France. caroline.gronnier@chu-bordeaux.fr.', 'Department of Digestive Surgery, Haut-Leveque Hospital, 33000 Bordeaux, France. caroline.gronnier@chu-bordeaux.fr.', 'Department of Life and Health Sciences, University of Bordeaux, 33000 Bordeaux, France. caroline.gronnier@chu-bordeaux.fr.', 'INSERM, U1053, Bordeaux Research in Translational Oncology, 33000 Bordeaux, France. christine.varon@u-bordeaux.fr.', 'Department of Life and Health Sciences, University of Bordeaux, 33000 Bordeaux, France. christine.varon@u-bordeaux.fr.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20181029,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/analysis/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Retinoid X Receptors/analysis/metabolism', 'Stomach/drug effects/pathology', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",PMC6275086,['NOTNLM'],"['CD44', 'cancer stem cell', 'differentiation therapy', 'retinoic X receptor', 'retinoic acid', 'retinoic acid receptor', 'stomach neoplasms', 'tretinoin']",2018/11/02 06:00,2019/02/05 06:00,['2018/11/02 06:00'],"['2018/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/26 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms19113388 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms19113388 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2018 Oct 29;19(11). pii: ijms19113388. doi: 10.3390/ijms19113388.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-4039-9469'],['The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Severe perturbations of cellular homeostasis result in rapid HSC loss to maintain clonal purity. However, normal homeostatic processes can also generate lower-level stress; how HSCs survive these conditions remains unknown. Here we show that the integrated stress response (ISR) is uniquely active in HSCs and facilitates their persistence. Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) mediates the ISR and is highly expressed in HSCs due to scarcity of the eIF2 translation initiation complex. Amino acid deprivation results in eIF2alpha phosphorylation-dependent upregulation of ATF4, promoting HSC survival.

It has been reported previously to be associated with a variety of malignant cancers, such as breast, thyroid and acute myeloid leukemia. The aim of the present study was to investigate the FTO mRNA expression in human clear cell renal cell carcinoma and its clinical value. FTO mRNA expression and its prognostic value were investigated by bioinformatic analysis of the data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, https://cancergenome.nih.gov/). The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that FTO mRNA expression in the lower quartile is significantly associated with poor survival in clear cell renal cell carcinoma patients (P<0.0001). This study indicated that higher FTO mRNA expression may have a protective role and it may be a vital molecular marker in the prognosis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma patients.","['Wen, Lijie', 'Yu, Yang', 'Lv, Hang', 'He, Yi', 'Yang, Bo']","['Wen L', 'Yu Y', 'Lv H', 'He Y', 'Yang B']","['Department of Urology, The Second Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Department of Urology, The Second Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Department of Urology, The Second Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Department of Urology, The Second Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.', 'Department of Urology, The Second Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.

30380386,NLM,MEDLINE,20181211,20210422,1533-4406 (Electronic) 0028-4793 (Linking),379,18,2018 Nov 1,CD47 Blockade by Hu5F9-G4 and Rituximab in Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.,1711-1721,10.1056/NEJMoa1807315 [doi],"BACKGROUND: The Hu5F9-G4 (hereafter, 5F9) antibody is a macrophage immune checkpoint inhibitor blocking CD47 that induces tumor-cell phagocytosis. 5F9 synergizes with rituximab to eliminate B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cells by enhancing macrophage-mediated antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis. This combination was evaluated clinically. METHODS: We conducted a phase 1b study involving patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Patients may have had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or follicular lymphoma. 5F9 (at a priming dose of 1 mg per kilogram of body weight, administered intravenously, with weekly maintenance doses of 10 to 30 mg per kilogram) was given with rituximab to determine safety and efficacy and to suggest a phase 2 dose. RESULTS: A total of 22 patients (15 with DLBCL and 7 with follicular lymphoma) were enrolled. Patients had received a median of 4 (range, 2 to 10) previous therapies, and 95% of the patients had disease that was refractory to rituximab. Adverse events were predominantly of grade 1 or 2. The most common adverse events were anemia and infusion-related reactions. Anemia (an expected on-target effect) was mitigated by the strategy of 5F9 prime and maintenance dosing. Dose-limiting side effects were rare. A selected phase 2 dose of 30 mg of 5F9 per kilogram led to an approximate 100% CD47-receptor occupancy on circulating white and red cells. A total of 50% of the patients had an objective (i.e., complete or partial) response, with 36% having a complete response. The rates of objective response and complete response were 40% and 33%, respectively, among patients with DLBCL and 71% and 43%, respectively, among those with follicular lymphoma. At a median follow-up of 6.2 months among patients with DLBCL and 8.1 months among those with follicular lymphoma, 91% of the responses were ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: The macrophage checkpoint inhibitor 5F9 combined with rituximab showed promising activity in patients with aggressive and indolent lymphoma. No clinically significant safety events were observed in this initial study.

We hypothesized that the immune-mediated selective pressure imposed by allogeneic transplantation may cause distinct patterns of tumor evolution in relapsed disease. METHODS: We performed enhanced exome sequencing on paired samples obtained at initial presentation with AML and at relapse from 15 patients who had a relapse after hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (with transplants from an HLA-matched sibling, HLA-matched unrelated donor, or HLA-mismatched unrelated donor) and from 20 patients who had a relapse after chemotherapy. We performed RNA sequencing and flow cytometry on a subgroup of these samples and on additional samples for validation. RESULTS: On exome sequencing, the spectrum of gained and lost mutations observed with relapse after transplantation was similar to the spectrum observed with relapse after chemotherapy. Specifically, relapse after transplantation was not associated with the acquisition of previously unknown AML-specific mutations or structural variations in immune-related genes. In contrast, RNA sequencing of samples obtained at relapse after transplantation revealed dysregulation of pathways involved in adaptive and innate immunity, including down-regulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes ( HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQB1, and HLA-DRB1) to levels that were 3 to 12 times lower than the levels seen in paired samples obtained at presentation. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemical analysis confirmed decreased expression of MHC class II at relapse in 17 of 34 patients who had a relapse after transplantation. Evidence suggested that interferon-gamma treatment could rapidly reverse this phenotype in AML blasts in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: AML relapse after transplantation was not associated with the acquisition of relapse-specific mutations in immune-related genes. However, it was associated with dysregulation of pathways that may influence immune function, including down-regulation of MHC class II genes, which are involved in antigen presentation. These epigenetic changes may be reversible with appropriate therapy.

In the present study, we used both in vitro and in vivo models to evaluate the functional mechanisms of a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), small nucleolar RNA host gene 16 (SNHG16) in ALL. SNHG16 gene expression was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) in both in vitro ALL cell lines and in vivo human samples of T lymphocytes. Lentivirus-mediated SNHG16 downregulation was performed in MOLT3 and SUP-B15 cells, to evaluate its functional effects on ALL cell proliferation, migration in vitro, and ALL transplant in vivo. Epigenetic regulation of SNHG16 on human miR-124-3p (hsa-miR-124-3p) was evaluated by dual-luciferase activity assay and qPCR. Hsa-miR-124-3p was inhibited in SNHG16-downregulated MOLT3 and SUP-B15 cells to further evaluate the functional correlation between SNHG16 and hsa-miR-124-3p in ALL. SNHG16 is upregulated in both in vitro ALL cell lines and in vivo human leukemic T-cells. SNHG16 downregulation suppressed ALL proliferation and migration in vitro, and ALL explant in vivo. Hsa-miR-124-3p was demonstrated to interact with SNHG16, and upregulated in SNHG16-downregulated ALL cells. In addition, inhibiting hsa-miR-124-3p reversed SNHG16-downregulation-mediated tumor suppressive functions in ALL. SNHG16 is upregulated in ALL, and its inhibition has tumor suppressive effect in ALL, likely through epigenetic interaction on hsa-miR-124-3p.

Parallel progress has been in addressing aspects underlying immune dysregulation in disease pathogenesis. Novel insights into the molecular and biologic mechanisms have led to a shift in the paradigm of AA, from a solely autoimmune pathogenic concept toward its recognition as a multifaceted pathophysiology characterized by cytogenetic abnormalities, recurrent somatic mutations, telomere attrition, and immune dysregulation. The detection of recurrent driver mutations disrupting myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-associated genes has suggested a pathophysiologic link between clonal hematopoiesis in AA and the later development of these clonal disorders. Further, certain AA-related somatic genetic alterations may have clinical implications on treatment response, disease progression, and survival following immunosuppressive therapy. Going forward, wider validation of these genetic abnormalities will allow for their incorporation into a more informative risk stratification system that does not rely solely on clinical factors.","['Boddu, Prajwal C', 'Kadia, Tapan M']","['Boddu PC', 'Kadia TM']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],['P30 CA16672/University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20181218,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/blood/diagnosis/*etiology/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Clonal Evolution/genetics', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunogenetic Phenomena', 'Mutation', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['acquired aplastic anemia', 'clonal evolution', 'cytogenetics', 'immunosuppressive', 'next-generation sequencing', 'somatic mutations']",2018/11/01 06:00,2019/04/26 06:00,['2018/11/01 06:00'],"['2018/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/03 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/26 06:00 [medline]', '2018/11/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13182 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2019 Feb;102(2):103-110. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13182.

Top scoring pair (TSP)-based decision tree using a robust analytical algorithm with statistical rigor offers a promising alternative. We describe CytoPred as a 7-gene pair signature based on the analysis of 2547 AML patient sample gene expression data using a modified TSP algorithm to estimate cytogenetic risk. The essential modification in TSP that helped computational encumbrance includes the filtration of gene pairs above random weighted guessers as well as sampling the gene pairs from the original gene pair pool to reduce overfitting issue. The CytoPred classifies AML cohort into clinically relevant `good' and `Int_poor' prognosis groups with distinct survival differences. The 7-gene pair was derived using 1248 AML patient samples in training set and 675 samples used for internal testing of the algorithm. The finest classifier 7-gene pair was picked from an initial pool size of 6.1 x 107 gene pairs that generated 57 687 decision trees. Further, for unbiased evaluation of CytoPred performance, we did an independent validation in 624 AML patient cohort. The CytoPred well qualifies the cutoffs for diagnostic application with 98.27% sensitivity and 99.27% specificity to predictive value in Int_poor class while 97.09% sensitivity and 91.74% specificity to predictive value for good class. Furthermore, CytoPred predicts almost identical survival probabilities like cytogenetics and its performance is not much influenced by various recurrent mutations as well as individual French-American-British (FAB) subtypes. In summary, we present a robust 7-gene pair-based metric to clinically prognosticate AML patients.","['Salunkhe, Sameer', 'Chandran, Naren', 'Chandrani, Pratik', 'Dutt, Amit', 'Dutt, Shilpee']","['Salunkhe S', 'Chandran N', 'Chandrani P', 'Dutt A', 'Dutt S']","['Shilpee Dutt laboratory, Tata Memorial Centre, Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer, Navi Mumbai, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute,Training School Complex, Anushakti Nagar, Mumbai, India.', 'Shilpee Dutt laboratory, Tata Memorial Centre, Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer, Navi Mumbai, India.', 'Integrated Genomics Laboratory, Advanced Centre for Treatment Research Education in Cancer (ACTREC).', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute,Training School Complex, Anushakti Nagar, Mumbai, India.', 'Integrated Genomics Laboratory, Advanced Centre for Treatment Research Education in Cancer (ACTREC).', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute,Training School Complex, Anushakti Nagar, Mumbai, India.', 'Shilpee Dutt laboratory, Tata Memorial Centre, Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer, Navi Mumbai, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute,Training School Complex, Anushakti Nagar, Mumbai, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181030,England,Brief Bioinform,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,,,,,,,2018/11/01 06:00,2018/11/01 06:00,['2018/11/01 06:00'],"['2018/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/01 06:00 [medline]']","['5144166 [pii]', '10.1093/bib/bby100 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Brief Bioinform. 2018 Oct 30. pii: 5144166. doi: 10.1093/bib/bby100.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The impact of early-onset cardiotoxicity on treatment outcomes is less well understood. Thus, we evaluated the risk factors for incident early cardiotoxicity and the impacts of cardiotoxicity on event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). METHODS: Cardiotoxicity was ascertained through adverse event monitoring over the course of follow-up among 1,022 pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia treated in the Children's Oncology Group trial AAML0531. It was defined as grade 2 or higher left ventricular systolic dysfunction on the basis of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3) definitions. RESULTS: Approximately 12% of patients experienced cardiotoxicity over a 5-year follow-up, with more than 70% of incident events occurring during on-protocol therapy. Documented cardiotoxicity during on-protocol therapy was significantly associated with subsequent off-protocol toxicity. Overall, the incidence was higher among noninfants and black patients, and in the setting of a bloodstream infection. Both EFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.1; P = .004) and OS (HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.2, P = .005) were significantly worse in patients with documented cardiotoxicity. Impacts on EFS were equivalent whether the incident cardiotoxicity event occurred in the absence (HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.2; P = .017) or presence of infection (HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.7; P = .069) compared with patients without documented cardiotoxicity. However, the reduction in OS was more pronounced for cardiotoxicity not associated with infection (HR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.5; P = .004) than for infection-associated cardiotoxicity (HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.7 to 2.4; P = .387). CONCLUSION: Early treatment-related cardiotoxicity may be associated with decreased EFS and OS. Cardioprotective strategies are urgently needed to improve relapse risk and both short- and long-term mortality outcomes.","['Getz, Kelly D', 'Sung, Lillian', 'Ky, Bonnie', 'Gerbing, Robert B', 'Leger, Kasey J', 'Leahy, Allison Barz', 'Sack, Leah', 'Woods, William G', 'Alonzo, Todd', 'Gamis, Alan', 'Aplenc, Richard']","['Getz KD', 'Sung L', 'Ky B', 'Gerbing RB', 'Leger KJ', 'Leahy AB', 'Sack L', 'Woods WG', 'Alonzo T', 'Gamis A', 'Aplenc R']","[""1 The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", '2 The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', '3 University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', ""4 Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, CA."", ""5 Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA."", ""1 The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", ""1 The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", ""5 Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA."", '7 University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA.', ""8 Children's Mercy Hospital and Clinics, Kansas City, MO."", ""1 The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA.""]",['eng'],"['K01 HL143153/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181031,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cardiotoxicity/diagnostic imaging/*etiology/*physiopathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Echocardiography', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6354770,,,2018/11/01 06:00,2019/10/29 06:00,['2018/11/01 06:00'],"['2018/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/29 06:00 [medline]', '2018/11/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.18.00313 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2019 Jan 1;37(1):12-21. doi: 10.1200/JCO.18.00313.

The objective of this study was to describe pregnancy outcomes of women exposed to cancer chemotherapy, recorded in the French Terappel database. METHODS: We performed a descriptive, prospective study of the pregnancies of women exposed to cancer chemotherapy recorded in Terappel between June 1984 and December 2016. Terappel is a French database that has recorded questions of health professionals and/or individuals at the Regional Pharmacovigilance Centres about drugs and pregnancy. For each question, pregnancies are monitored and the outcome is recorded in the database. RESULTS: In total, 75 questions about ""anti-cancer drugs and pregnancy"" received by 16 Regional Pharmacovigilance Centres between 1997 and 2016 were recorded in Terappel. Breast cancer accounted for 62.7% of the cases, followed by leukaemia (13.3%) and lymphoma (9.3%). Cyclophosphamide is the leading anti-cancer drug with 40.0% of exposed pregnant women, followed by 5-fluorouracil (34.7%), epirubicin (32.0%), tamoxifen (26.7%), and doxorubicin (16.0%). Among the 75 pregnancies, we observed 55 births with 57 children (73.3%) (two cases of twins), nine medical terminations of pregnancy (12.0%), six voluntary terminations of pregnancy (8.0%), three intrauterine foetal deaths (4.0%), and two miscarriages (2.7%). We found a malformation rate of 7.8%. Sixteen of 57 (28.1%) newborns developed one or more neonatal pathologies. CONCLUSION: Pregnancy of women taking anti-cancer drugs resulted in birth in 73% of cases. Nevertheless, pregnant women exposed to cancer chemotherapy remains at risk of malformations and neonatal conditions related to prematurity and drugs.","['Danet, Chloe', 'Araujo, Melanie', 'Bos-Thompson, Marie-Andree', 'Portolan, Ghyslaine', 'Gautier, Sophie', 'Vanlemmens, Laurence', 'Bonenfant, Sophie', 'Jonville-Bera, Annie-Pierre', 'Cottin, Judith', 'Vial, Thierry', 'Bavoux, Francoise', 'Montastruc, Jean-Louis', 'Damase-Michel, Christine', 'Benevent, Justine', 'Bourgeois-Mondon, Isabelle', 'Lacroix, Isabelle']","['Danet C', 'Araujo M', 'Bos-Thompson MA', 'Portolan G', 'Gautier S', 'Vanlemmens L', 'Bonenfant S', 'Jonville-Bera AP', 'Cottin J', 'Vial T', 'Bavoux F', 'Montastruc JL', 'Damase-Michel C', 'Benevent J', 'Bourgeois-Mondon I', 'Lacroix I']","['Service de Pharmacologie Medicale et Clinique, Centre Regional de Pharmacovigilance, CHU de Toulouse, Universite de Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Service de Pharmacologie Medicale et Clinique, Centre Regional de Pharmacovigilance, CHU de Toulouse, Universite de Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Service de Pharmacologie Medicale, Hopital Lapeyronie, Montpellier, France.', 'Service de Pharmacologie Medicale et Clinique, Centre Regional de Pharmacovigilance, CHU de Toulouse, Universite de Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Centre de Pharmacovigilance, CHU de Lille, France.', 'Centre Oscar-Lambret, Centre Regional de lutte contre le cancer, Lille, France.', 'Service de Pharmacologie Medicale et Clinique, Centre Regional de Pharmacovigilance, CHU de Toulouse, Universite de Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Centre de Pharmacovigilance, CHU de Tours, France.', 'Centre de Pharmacovigilance, CHU de Lyon, France.', 'Centre de Pharmacovigilance, CHU de Lyon, France.', 'Centre Regional de Pharmacovigilance, Hopital Saint-Vincent de Paul, Paris, France.', 'Service de Pharmacologie Medicale et Clinique, Centre Regional de Pharmacovigilance, CHU de Toulouse, Universite de Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Service de Pharmacologie Medicale et Clinique, Centre Regional de Pharmacovigilance, CHU de Toulouse, Universite de Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Service de Pharmacologie Medicale et Clinique, Centre Regional de Pharmacovigilance, CHU de Toulouse, Universite de Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Service de Pharmacologie Medicale et Clinique, Centre Regional de Pharmacovigilance, CHU de Toulouse, Universite de Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Service de Pharmacologie Medicale et Clinique, Centre Regional de Pharmacovigilance, CHU de Toulouse, Universite de Toulouse, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181031,England,Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf,Pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety,9208369,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Abnormalities, Drug-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Databases, Factual/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Pharmacovigilance', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications/*drug therapy', '*Pregnancy Outcome', 'Prospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*cancer', '*chemotherapy', '*malformation', '*neonatal pathology', '*pharmacoepidemiology', '*pregnancy']",2018/11/01 06:00,2019/09/24 06:00,['2018/11/01 06:00'],"['2018/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/06 00:00 [revised]', '2018/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/24 06:00 [medline]', '2018/11/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pds.4689 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf. 2018 Dec;27(12):1302-1308. doi: 10.1002/pds.4689.

However, the difficulty in obtaining compounds bearing skeletally novel structures has recently led to a decline of pharmaceutical research into natural products. This paper reports the construction of a meroterpenoid-like library containing 25 compounds with diverse molecular scaffolds obtained from diversity-enhanced extracts. This method constitutes an approach for increasing the chemical diversity of natural-product-like compounds by combining natural product chemistry and diversity-oriented synthesis. Extensive pharmacological screening of the library revealed promising compounds for anti-osteoporotic and anti-lymphoma/leukemia drugs. This result indicates that the use of diversity-enhanced extracts is an effective methodology for producing chemical libraries for the purpose of drug discovery.","['Kikuchi, Haruhisa', 'Kawai, Kosuke', 'Nakashiro, Yota', 'Yonezawa, Takayuki', 'Kawaji, Kumi', 'Kodama, Eiichi N', 'Oshima, Yoshiteru']","['Kikuchi H', 'Kawai K', 'Nakashiro Y', 'Yonezawa T', 'Kawaji K', 'Kodama EN', 'Oshima Y']","['Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tohoku University, 6-3, Aza-Aoba, Aoba-ku, Sendai, 980-8578, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tohoku University, 6-3, Aza-Aoba, Aoba-ku, Sendai, 980-8578, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tohoku University, 6-3, Aza-Aoba, Aoba-ku, Sendai, 980-8578, Japan.', 'Reseach Institute for Biological Functions, Chubu University, 1200 Matsumoto-cho, Kasugai, Aichi, 487-8501, Japan.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, International Research Institute of Disaster Science, Tohoku University and Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization, Sendai, 980-8575, Japan.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, International Research Institute of Disaster Science, Tohoku University and Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization, Sendai, 980-8575, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tohoku University, 6-3, Aza-Aoba, Aoba-ku, Sendai, 980-8578, Japan.']",['eng'],"['16H05346/The Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research from MEXT', '16H03279/The Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research from MEXT', 'JP18am0101095/Practical Research for Innovative Cancer Control from AMED', 'JP18am0101100/Practical Research for Innovative Cancer Control from AMED', 'JP18ck0106282/Practical Research for Innovative Cancer Control from AMED', 'The Shorai Foundation for Science and Technology', 'Kobayashi International Scholarship Foundation', 'The Takeda Science Foundation', 'Suzuken Memorial Foundation', 'The Uehara Memorial Foundation']",['Journal Article'],20181213,Germany,Chemistry,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",9513783,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['chemical library', 'diversity-enhanced extracts', 'drug discovery', 'natural products', 'terpenoids']",2018/11/01 06:00,2018/11/01 06:01,['2018/11/01 06:00'],"['2018/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/01 06:01 [medline]', '2018/11/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/chem.201805417 [doi]'],ppublish,Chemistry. 2019 Jan 18;25(4):1106-1112. doi: 10.1002/chem.201805417.

METHOD: this is an observational and longitudinal research with 55 participants. Data collection was performed in six steps: before transplantation, pancytopenia, before hospital discharge, after 100, 180 and 360 days, in a reference hospital in Brazil for this treatment. The international instruments Quality of Life Questionnaire - Core 30 and Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy - Bone Marrow Transplantation were validated and translated into Portuguese (Brazil). RESULTS: the mean age of participants was 36 years, 65% (n = 36) had leukemia diagnosis and 71% (n = 39) had undergone allogenic transplantation. In the Quality of Life Questionnarie - Core30 instrument, the pain symptom was significant between the first and second stages, and loss of appetite between the third and fourth stages, both in the allogenic group. In the Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy - Bone Marrow Transplantation, the functional well-being domain was significant between the third and fourth stages, also in the allogenic group. CONCLUSIONS: although the aggressiveness of treatment affects quality of life, patients consider it satisfactory after the first year. There are few significant differences between autologous and allogenic patients, and both groups have recovered in the course of the process.","['Marques, Angela da Costa Barcellos', 'Szczepanik, Ana Paula', 'Machado, Celina Angelica Mattos', 'Santos, Pamella Naiana Dias', 'Guimaraes, Paulo Ricardo Bittencourt', 'Kalinke, Luciana Puchalski']","['Marques ADCB', 'Szczepanik AP', 'Machado CAM', 'Santos PND', 'Guimaraes PRB', 'Kalinke LP']","['Universidade Federal do Parana, Complexo Hospital de Clinicas, Curitiba, PR, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal do Parana, Complexo Hospital de Clinicas, Curitiba, PR, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal do Parana, Complexo Hospital de Clinicas, Curitiba, PR, Brazil.', 'Hospital Vita Curitiba, Supervisao de Enfermagem, Curitiba, PR, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal do Parana, Departamento de Estatistica, Curitiba, PR, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal do Parana, Departamento de Enfermagem, Curitiba, PR, Brazil.']","['eng', 'por', 'spa']",,"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20181025,Brazil,Rev Lat Am Enfermagem,Revista latino-americana de enfermagem,9420934,,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*psychology', 'Brazil', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*psychology/*surgery', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncology Nursing', 'Quality of Life', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",PMC6206822,,,2018/11/01 06:00,2019/06/04 06:00,['2018/11/01 06:00'],"['2017/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0104-11692018000100369 [pii]', '10.1590/1518-8345.2474.3065 [doi]']",epublish,Rev Lat Am Enfermagem. 2018 Oct 25;26:e3065. doi: 10.1590/1518-8345.2474.3065.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4868-8193'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, possible interactions between NRP-1 and Sema3A and VEGF165 in acute leukemia remain unclear, especially whether Sema3A plays a role in acute leukemia. In this study, both of the proportion of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and their expression of NRP-1 were found to increase in acute leukemia patients compared with healthy controls. In contrast, lower mRNA and plasma levels of Sema3A were detected in the acute leukemia patients. In vitro, the addition of exogenous Sema3A inhibited the expression of NRP-1 on Tregs and it promoted apoptosis of leukemia cells. However, in the presence of anti-Sema3A antibody, the effect of rhSema3A on NRP-1 expression was reversed. These results suggest that Sema3A promotes apoptosis in leukemia cells by inhibiting expression of NRP-1, and thus, represents a tumor suppressor protein with a role in the pathogenesis of acute leukemia. Consequently, NRP-1/Sema3A signaling may represent a novel target for the treatment of acute leukemia and should be further studied. Anat Rec, 302:1127-1135, 2019.

Both technologies have been utilized for analysis of the cell cycle state of ex vivo samples from patients with hematologic malignancies. Clinical samples are frequently stored for hours at room temperature or cryogenically frozen before processing and analysis; however, how these processing methods alter cell cycle state is not well described. To understand how storage time and temperature affect the analysis of cell cycle distribution by MCM, two leukemia cell lines, HL-60 and MOLM13, and primary human cells from three human bone marrow aspirates were stored and frozen under a variety of conditions that are likely to be encountered in a clinical setting. Our findings indicate that short delays in sample processing (less than 1 h), have little to no effect on cell cycle distribution, while longer delays or cryopreservation cause significant disruptions to the cell cycle fraction characterized by consistent reductions in IdU incorporation and variable alterations in other cell cycle phases. Analysis of the recovery of cryopreserved leukemia cell lines and marrow cells demonstrated that cell cycle alterations persist for at least 48 h after thawing. Our findings demonstrate that accurate cell cycle analysis requires that samples be processed rapidly after collection, and that cryopreservation significantly alters cell cycle fractions. Measurement of IdU incorporation was the most sensitive to both delays in processing and cryopreservation, while estimation of the total cycling cell fraction using Ki-67 or phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein were least altered by the conditions tested. These findings provide guidance for the ideal approach to collection of samples for cell cycle analysis and can aid interpretation of cell cycle data from samples that cannot be collected under ideal circumstances.

The diagnosis of HLH is made late by most physicians. METHODS: To confirm the diagnosis of acquired HLH made in a single-institution series of adult patients with HLH-04 criteria, we applied the HScore and evaluated prognostic factors associated with clinical outcome. RESULTS: A total of 174 patients with a median age of 51 years (range 17-90) were included. Male/female ratio was 111/63. In 92/174 (52.9%) patients, there were potential haematological diseases (4 acute leukaemia, 1 thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, 3 Hodgkin's lymphoma [HL], 17 B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [NHL], 67 T-cell NHL including 22 natural killer / T-cell NHL [NK/t-cell NHL). Six (3.4%) patients had autoimmune disease and 76 (43.7%) undiagnosed underlying disease. There were 44 (25.3%) patients with Epstein-Barr virus infection, 11 (6.3%) with cytomegalovirus, 1 (0.5%) syphilis, 9 (5.2%) hepatitis B virus and 3 (1.7%) human immunodeficiency virus. More than 95% of patients had hyperferritinaemia, high lactate dehydrogenase, fever and low albumin, whereas 89.1% of patients had bone marrow phagocytosis. By the HScore, 4/174 patients had a >50% and 16/174 patients had a >90% probability of not having HLH. All 174 patients fulfilled more than five of the HLH-04 diagnostic criteria, but 16 of them had a low probability of HLH by the HScore. In a multivariate analysis, lymphopenia and hypofibrinogenaemia were independent prognostic factors for death. CONCLUSION: In our study, viral infection was not an independent prognostic factor. NK/T-cell -NHL was associated with worse prognosis compared with B-cell NHL and T-cell NHL (p = 0.036) and similar to other aetiologies.","['Zhang, Qiaolei', 'Li, Li', 'Zhu, Lixia', 'Zhu, Jingjing', 'Yang, Xiudi', 'Zhou, De', 'Zheng, Yanglong', 'Zhu, Mingyu', 'Xie, Mixue', 'Sun, Jianai', 'Li, Xueying', 'Wu, Ying', 'Wei, Zhangyue', 'Xie, Wanzhuo', 'Ye, Xiujin']","['Zhang Q', 'Li L', 'Zhu L', 'Zhu J', 'Yang X', 'Zhou', 'Zheng Y', 'Zhu M', 'Xie M', 'Sun J', 'Li X', 'Wu Y', 'Wei Z', 'Xie W', 'Ye X']","[""Department of Haematology, Lishui People's Hospital, Lishui, Zhejiang Province, China."", 'Senior Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Senior Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Senior Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Senior Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Senior Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Senior Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Senior Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Senior Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Senior Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Senior Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Senior Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Senior Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Senior Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Senior Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180923,Switzerland,Swiss Med Wkly,Swiss medical weekly,100970884,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)']",IM,"['Afibrinogenemia', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', '*Delayed Diagnosis', 'Female', 'Ferritins/blood', 'Humans', 'Lymphohistiocytosis, Hemophagocytic/*diagnosis/mortality', 'Lymphoma/*complications', 'Lymphopenia', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Phagocytosis/immunology', 'Prognosis', '*Survival Rate']",,,,2018/11/01 06:00,2018/12/19 06:00,['2018/11/01 06:00'],"['2018/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.4414/smw.2018.14641 [doi]', 'Swiss med Wkly. 2018;148:w14641 [pii]']",epublish,Swiss Med Wkly. 2018 Sep 23;148:w14641. doi: 10.4414/smw.2018.14641. eCollection 2018 Sep 10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Samples of bone marrow or peripheral blood were collected from the adult patients with de novo AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in our hospital from July 1st, 2014 to March 1st, 2017. NUP98 fusuion genes and their karyotype were detected by PCR. The AML patients with chromosome 11p15 rearrangement or NUP98 fusion genes were studied as the research group and the remaining AMLs in this period as the control group. Meanwhile, the control AML group was divided into low-risk, medium-risk and high-risk groups respectively. Through comparison, analyzing the hematological characteristics, CR rates, the frequency of coexpression with other prognosis-related genes, and over all survival were done between these NUP98 fusion gene positive AMLs and control. RESULTS: A total of 197 AML patients participated in this study, including 16 (8.1%) having NUP98 fusion genes and the first case of positive NUP98-topoisomerase1 (TOP1) fusion gene. The NUP98 positive AMLs were mainly M2 and M5 in FAB classifications. Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3)- internal tandem duplication (ITD)(FLT3-ITD) occurred [31.25% (5/16)] and mortality [80.00% (4/5)] of the patients with NUP98 positive AMLs, higher than control group [occurred: 9.95% (19/181), mortality: 42.11% (8/19) , P<0.05]. The CR rate of the study group induced chemotherapy was 78.57%, higher than the control group and the middle, high and middle rick control group. The median overall survival (OS) and leukemia free survival (LFS) of the patients with NUP98 positive AMLs were 13 months and 5 months, respectively. CONCLUSION: NUP98 fusion positive AMLs have high level of coexistence with other prognostic-related genes, especially FLT3-ITD, leading to poor prognosis, short survival.","['Lun, Yan', 'Huang, Jing-Cao', 'Long, Dan', 'Wang, Fang-Fang', 'Dai, Yang', 'Yang, Yan', 'Zhao, Ting-Ting', 'Li, Qing', 'Wu, Yu']","['Lun Y', 'Huang JC', 'Long D', 'Wang FF', 'Dai Y', 'Yang Y', 'Zhao TT', 'Li Q', 'Wu Y']","['Department of Hematology, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Transplant Engineering and Immunology, Ministry of Health, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Sichuan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Sichuan da xue xue bao.

The interaction between Mtb and macrophages, which is regulated by microRNAs, determines the development of TB. However, the function of microRNA-20b-5p (miR-20b-5p) in RAW 264.7 macrophages against Mtb remains unknown. In this study, we analyzed the expression level of miR-20b-5p in macrophage responses to Mtb infection and exosomes derived from macrophages after Mtb infection. MiR-20b-5p mimics and inhibitor were, respectively, transfected to evaluate the effect of miR-20b-5p on Mtb and macrophages. In addition, the targets of miR-20b-5p were predicted by a bioinformatics analysis. The macrophages were respectively transfected with miR-20b-5p mimics and inhibitor to determine the messenger RNA expression levels of the targets by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay. The results revealed that the miR-20b-5p expression level was decreased in the infected macrophages at different times. MiR-20b-5p was shown in the exosomes released from macrophages infected with Mtb. Upregulation of the miR-20b-5p level suppressed the survival of Mtb in macrophages, while downregulation of the miR-20b-5p level enhanced the survival of Mtb in macrophages. Overexpression of miR-20b-5p decreased the cell viability and induced apoptosis in Mtb-infected macrophages, while underexpression of miR-20b-5p increased the cell vitality and attenuated apoptosis in Mtb-infected macrophages. The bioinformatics analysis revealed that Mcl-1 was a target of miR-20b-5p. MiR-20b-5p negatively regulated the expression of Mcl-1. Overall, this study is the first to demonstrate the effect of miR-20b-5p on Mtb infection and present miR-20b-5p and exosomes as the potential therapeutic targets of TB.","['Zhang, Defeng', 'Yi, Zhengjun', 'Fu, Yurong']","['Zhang D', 'Yi Z', 'Fu Y']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Key Laboratory of Clinical Laboratory Diagnostics in Universities of Shandong, Weifang Medical University, Weifang, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Key Laboratory of Clinical Laboratory Diagnostics in Universities of Shandong, Weifang Medical University, Weifang, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Medical Microbiology, Clinical Medicine College, Weifang Medical University, Weifang, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Key Laboratory of Clinical Laboratory Diagnostics in Universities of Shandong, Weifang Medical University, Weifang, Shandong, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181030,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (MIRN21 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Exosomes/metabolism', 'Macrophages/*metabolism/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'RAW 264.7 Cells', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection', 'Tuberculosis/*metabolism/microbiology', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)', '*exosomes', '*macrophages', '*microRNA-20b-5p (miR-20b-5p)']",2018/11/01 06:00,2020/07/22 06:00,['2018/11/01 06:00'],"['2018/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/22 06:00 [medline]', '2018/11/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.27874 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2019 Apr;120(4):5889-5896. doi: 10.1002/jcb.27874.

Forty female Kunming mice aged 9 weeks were randomly divided into two groups (control and COH groups). The COH group received intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of aminocyclin acetate (GnRHa), human menopausal gonadotropin (HMG) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), while the control group was given equal amount of physiological saline by i.p. injection. One male mouse and two female mice were put into the same cage at 16:00 on the hCG injection day, and on the fourth day of pregnancy, 10 mice from each group were killed. The levels of serum estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P) were measured by radioimmunoassay; HE staining was used to observe the morphology of ovarian and endometrial tissues. The protein expression levels of endometrial leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (p-STAT3), heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) and glycodelin A were detected by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Ten mice from each group were sacrificed on the eighth day of pregnancy, and the status of the uterus and the average number of blastocysts were observed. The results showed that, compared with control group, the serum E2 level in COH group was significantly decreased (P < 0.05), while the P level was increased significantly (P < 0.05); the ovarian follicles at different developmental stages were rare, corpus lutea (CL) were visible and multiple, the endometrium was thinned, and the number of endometrial glands was reduced (P < 0.05); the contents of LIF, p-STAT3, HB-EGF and glycodelin A in the endometrium were decreased significantly (P < 0.05) on the fourth day of pregnancy; mouse blastocysts developed slowly and were decreased in number on the eighth day of pregnancy (P < 0.05). The above results suggest that GnRHa COH can affect embryo implantation in mice. The mechanism may be related to the imbalance of gonadal hormone, the changes in the structure of the endometrium and the expressions of LIF, p-STAT3, HB-EGF and glycodelin A in the implantation stage, which may lead to the decrease of endometrial receptivity and the abnormal dialogue between the embryo and the uterus.","['Wu, Qiong', 'Xu, Hua-Zhou', 'Yang, Jiang-Xia', 'Li, Zhi-Li', 'Fu, Tian', 'DU, Hui-Lan', 'Song, Cui-Miao']","['Wu Q', 'Xu HZ', 'Yang JX', 'Li ZL', 'Fu T', 'DU HL', 'Song CM']","['Hebei University of Chinese Medicine, Collaborative Innovation Center of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine on Reproductive Disease, Hebei Key Laboratory of Integrative Medicine on Liver-kidney Patterns, Shijiazhuang 050200, China.', 'Hebei University of Chinese Medicine, Collaborative Innovation Center of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine on Reproductive Disease, Hebei Key Laboratory of Integrative Medicine on Liver-kidney Patterns, Shijiazhuang 050200, China.', 'Hebei University of Chinese Medicine, Collaborative Innovation Center of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine on Reproductive Disease, Hebei Key Laboratory of Integrative Medicine on Liver-kidney Patterns, Shijiazhuang 050200, China.', 'Hebei University of Chinese Medicine, Collaborative Innovation Center of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine on Reproductive Disease, Hebei Key Laboratory of Integrative Medicine on Liver-kidney Patterns, Shijiazhuang 050200, China.', 'Hebei University of Chinese Medicine, Collaborative Innovation Center of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine on Reproductive Disease, Hebei Key Laboratory of Integrative Medicine on Liver-kidney Patterns, Shijiazhuang 050200, China.', 'Hebei University of Chinese Medicine, Collaborative Innovation Center of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine on Reproductive Disease, Hebei Key Laboratory of Integrative Medicine on Liver-kidney Patterns, Shijiazhuang 050200, China.', 'Hebei University of Chinese Medicine, Collaborative Innovation Center of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine on Reproductive Disease, Hebei Key Laboratory of Integrative Medicine on Liver-kidney Patterns, Shijiazhuang 050200, China. songcuimiao@126.com.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Sheng Li Xue Bao,Sheng li xue bao : [Acta physiologica Sinica],20730130R,"['0 (Chorionic Gonadotropin)', '0 (Glycodelin)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '33515-09-2 (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '61489-71-2 (Menotropins)', 'FYY3R43WGO (Minocycline)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin/pharmacology', 'Embryo Implantation/*drug effects', 'Endometrium/drug effects', 'Estradiol/blood', 'Female', 'Glycodelin/metabolism', 'Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone/*agonists', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Menotropins/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Minocycline/*pharmacology', 'Ovarian Follicle/drug effects', '*Ovulation Induction', 'Pregnancy', 'Progesterone/blood', 'Random Allocation', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism']",,,,2018/11/01 06:00,2019/01/09 06:00,['2018/11/01 06:00'],"['2018/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/09 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Sheng Li Xue Bao. 2018 Oct 25;70(5):489-496.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We attributed the strong leukemogenic activity of Kras(G12D) at least partially to its unique capability to hyperactivate wild-type (WT) Nras and Hras. Here, we report that Sos1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, is required to mediate this process. Sos1 is overexpressed in Kras (G12D/+) cells, but not in Nras (Q61R/+) and Nras (G12D/+) cells. Kras(G12D) proteins form a complex with Sos1 in vivo. Sos1 deficiency attenuates hyperactivation of WT Nras, Hras, and the downstream ERK signaling in Kras (G12D/+) cells. Thus, Sos1 deletion ameliorates oncogenic Kras-induced myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) phenotypes and prolongs the survival of Kras (G12D/+) mice. In contrast, Sos1 is dispensable for hyperactivated granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor signaling in Nras (Q61R/+) cells, and Sos1 (-/-) does not affect MPN phenotypes in Nras (Q61R/+) mice. Moreover, the survival of Kras (G12D/+) ; Sos1 (-/-) recipients is comparable to that of Kras (G12D/+) recipients treated with combined MEK and JAK inhibitors. Our study suggests that targeting Sos1-oncogenic Kras interaction may improve the survival of cancer patients with KRAS mutations.","['You, Xiaona', 'Kong, Guangyao', 'Ranheim, Erik A', 'Yang, David', 'Zhou, Yun', 'Zhang, Jing']","['You X', 'Kong G', 'Ranheim EA', 'Yang D', 'Zhou Y', 'Zhang J']","['McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI.', 'McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI.', ""National Local Joint Engineering Research Center of Biodiagnostics and Biotherapy, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, People's Republic of China; and."", 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center, Madison, WI.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center, Madison, WI.', 'McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI.', 'McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA014520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA152108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL113066/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181030,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (SOS1 Protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Hras protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/genetics/*metabolism', 'SOS1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC6293870,,,2018/11/01 06:00,2019/07/17 06:00,['2018/11/01 06:00'],"['2018/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/17 06:00 [medline]', '2018/11/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)42934-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2018-09-874107 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Dec 13;132(24):2575-2579. doi: 10.1182/blood-2018-09-874107.

Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) are important epigenetic regulators with critical roles in cancer initiation and progression. LncRNA HOTAIRM1 transcribes from the antisense strand of HOXA gene cluster which locus in chromosome 7p15.2. Recent studies have shown that HOTAIRM1 is involved in acute myeloid leukemia and colorectal cancer. Here we sought to investigate the role of HOTAIRM1 in GBM and explore its mechanisms of action. METHODS: The expressions of HOTAIRM1 and HOXA1 in GBM tissues and cells were determined by qRT-PCR, and the association between HOTAIRM1, HOXA1 transcription and tumor grade were analyzed. The biological function of HOTAIRM1 in GBM was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and quantitative Sequenom MassARRAY methylation analysis were performed to explore whether HOTAIRM1 could regulate histone and DNA modification status of the HOXA1 gene transcription start sites (TSS) and activate its transcription. ChIP and RNA-ChIP were further performed to determine the molecular mechanism of HOTAIRM1 in epigenetic regulation of the HOXA1 gene. RESULTS: HOTAIRM1 was abnormally up-regulated in GBM tissues and cells, and this up-regulation was correlated with grade malignancy in glioma patients. HOTAIRM1 silencing caused tumor suppressive effects via inhibiting cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and inducing cell apoptosis. In vivo experiments showed knockdown of HOTAIRM1 lessened the tumor growth. Additionally, HOTAIRM1 action as regulating the expression of the HOXA1 gene. HOXA1, as an oncogene, it's expression levels were markedly elevated in GBM tissues and cell lines. Mechanistically, HOTAIRM1 mediated demethylation of histone H3K9 and H3K27 and reduced DNA methylation levels by sequester epigenetic modifiers G9a and EZH2, which are H3K9me(2) and H3K27me(3) specific histone methyltransferases, and DNA methyltransferases (DnmTs) away from the TSS of HOXA1 gene. CONCLUSIONS: We investigated the potential role of HOTAIRM1 to promote GBM cell proliferation, migration, invasion and inhibit cell apoptosis by epigenetic regulation of HOXA1 gene that can be targeted simultaneously to effectively treat GBM, thus putting forward a promising strategy for GBM treatment. Meanwhile, this finding provides an example of transcriptional control over the chromatin state of gene and may help explain the role of lncRNAs within the HOXA gene cluster.","['Li, Qi', 'Dong, Chengya', 'Cui, Jiayue', 'Wang, Yubo', 'Hong, Xinyu']","['Li Q', 'Dong C', 'Cui J', 'Wang Y', 'Hong X']","['China National Clinical Research Center for Neurological Diseases, Beijing Tian Tan Hospital, Capital Medical University, 6 Tiantan Xili, Dongcheng District, Beijing, 100050, China. liqibjtt@ccmu.edu.cn.', 'China National Clinical Research Center for Neurological Diseases, Beijing Tian Tan Hospital, Capital Medical University, 6 Tiantan Xili, Dongcheng District, Beijing, 100050, China.', 'Department of Histology and Embryology of Basic Medicine College, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin Province, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, The First Hospital of Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Street, Changchun, 130021, Jilin Province, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, The First Hospital of Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Street, Changchun, 130021, Jilin Province, China. hongxy@jlu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['2018SCZWSZX-014/Health Special Science Foundation of Jilin Province', '7152098/National Science Foundation of Beijing City']",['Journal Article'],20181030,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (homeobox A1 protein)', '0 (long non-coding RNA HOTAIRM1, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EHMT2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Brain Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/genetics', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein/genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glioblastoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcription Initiation Site', '*Up-Regulation']",PMC6208043,['NOTNLM'],"['Epigenetic regulation', 'Glioblastoma multiforme', 'HOTAIRM1', 'HOXA1 gene', 'LncRNA']",2018/11/01 06:00,2019/01/10 06:00,['2018/11/01 06:00'],"['2018/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13046-018-0941-x [doi]', '10.1186/s13046-018-0941-x [pii]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2018 Oct 30;37(1):265. doi: 10.1186/s13046-018-0941-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to explore the role of NER in relapsed ALL patients. We hypothesized that increased expression of NER genes was associated with drug resistance and relapse in ALL. METHODS: We performed secondary data analysis on two sets of pediatric ALL patients that all ultimately relapsed, and who had matched diagnosis-relapse gene expression microarray data (GSE28460 and GSE18497). GSE28460 included 49 precursor-B-ALL patients, and GSE18497 included 27 precursor-B-ALL and 14 T-ALL patients. Microarray data were processed using the Plier 16 algorithm and the 20 canonical NER genes were extracted. Comparisons were made between time of diagnosis and relapse, and between early and late relapsing subgroups. The Chi-square test was used to evaluate whether NER gene expression was altered at the level of the entire pathway and individual gene expression was compared using t-tests. RESULTS: We found that gene expression of the NER pathway was significantly increased upon relapse in patients that took 3 years or greater to relapse (late relapsers, P = .007), whereas no such change was evident in patients that relapsed in less than 3 years (early relapsers, P = .180). Moreover, at diagnosis, the NER gene expression of the early relapsing subpopulation was already significantly elevated over that of the late relapsing group (P < .001). This pattern was validated by an 'NER score' established by averaging the relative expression of the 20 canonical NER genes. The NER score at diagnosis was found to be significantly associated with disease-free survival in precursor-B-ALL (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Patients are over two times more likely to undergo early relapse if they have a high NER score at diagnosis, hazard ratio 2.008, 95% CI (1.256-3.211). The NER score may provide a underlying mechanism for ""time to remission"", a known prognostic factor in ALL, and a rationale for differential treatment.","['Ibrahim, Omar M', 'As Sobeai, Homood M', 'Grant, Stephen G', 'Latimer, Jean J']","['Ibrahim OM', 'As Sobeai HM', 'Grant SG', 'Latimer JJ']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, 3200 S University Drive, Fort Lauderdale, FL, 33328, USA. oi23@nova.edu.', 'AutoNation Institute for Breast and Solid Tumor Cancer Research, 3301 College Avenue, Fort Lauderdale, FL, 33314, USA. oi23@nova.edu.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, 3200 S University Drive, Fort Lauderdale, FL, 33328, USA.', 'AutoNation Institute for Breast and Solid Tumor Cancer Research, 3301 College Avenue, Fort Lauderdale, FL, 33314, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, P.O.

Furthermore, numerous gammaH2AX/53BP1 foci in CLL cells suggest activation of error-prone non-homologous end-joining repair mechanisms. Signatures of DDR proteins further indicate alterations of the DDR in CLL in contrast to a largely regular activation in MBL and healthy controls. In summary, our results provide evidence for the stepwise accumulation of DNA damage in the progression of MBL towards CLL and suggest increased DNA damage, error-prone DNA repair and altered DDR signaling to be critical mechanisms of clonal evolution in MBL and CLL.","['Popp, Henning D', 'Flach, Johanna', 'Brendel, Susanne', 'Ruppenthal, Sabrina', 'Kleiner, Helga', 'Seifarth, Wolfgang', 'Schneider, Sven', 'Schulze, Torsten J', 'Weiss, Christel', 'Wenz, Frederik', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Fabarius, Alice']","['Popp HD', 'Flach J', 'Brendel S', 'Ruppenthal S', 'Kleiner H', 'Seifarth W', 'Schneider S', 'Schulze TJ', 'Weiss C', 'Wenz F', 'Hofmann WK', 'Fabarius A']","['a Department of Hematology and Oncology , Heidelberg University , Mannheim , Germany.', 'a Department of Hematology and Oncology , Heidelberg University , Mannheim , Germany.', 'a Department of Hematology and Oncology , Heidelberg University , Mannheim , Germany.', 'a Department of Hematology and Oncology , Heidelberg University , Mannheim , Germany.', 'a Department of Hematology and Oncology , Heidelberg University , Mannheim , Germany.', 'a Department of Hematology and Oncology , Heidelberg University , Mannheim , Germany.', 'b Institute for Clinical Chemistry , Heidelberg University , Mannheim , Germany.', 'c Institute of Transfusion Medicine and Immunology , Heidelberg University, German Red-Cross Blood Service Baden-Wurttemberg - Hessen , Mannheim , Germany.', 'd Department of Medical Statistics and Biomathematics , Heidelberg University , Mannheim , Germany.', 'e Department of Radiation Oncology , Heidelberg University , Mannheim , Germany.', 'a Department of Hematology and Oncology , Heidelberg University , Mannheim , Germany.', 'a Department of Hematology and Oncology , Heidelberg University , Mannheim , Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181031,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CD19 molecule, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD19/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Biomarkers', 'Clonal Evolution/*genetics', 'Cytogenetics/methods', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', '*DNA Damage', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genomic Instability', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphocytosis/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA damage response', '*DNA double-strand breaks', '*Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*genetic instability']",2018/11/01 06:00,2020/05/01 06:00,['2018/11/01 06:00'],"['2018/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/01 06:00 [medline]', '2018/11/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2018.1498494 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2019 Mar;60(3):795-804. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2018.1498494.

The objective of this study was to assess the utility of a novel marker, NKX2.2, in the diagnosis of ES in cytologic material and its ability to distinguish ES from its mimics. METHODS: NKX2.2 immunohistochemistry was performed on cell blocks from 107 fine-needle aspirations, and nuclear expression was scored semiquantitatively for extent and intensity. The study cohort included ES (n = 10), well differentiated neuroendocrine tumor (n = 20), melanoma (n = 11), Merkel cell carcinoma (n = 10), small cell carcinoma (n = 10), alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 2), spindle cell/sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 2), synovial sarcoma (n = 12), solitary fibrous tumor (n = 2), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 10), lymphoblastic lymphoma (n = 11), adenoid cystic carcinoma (n = 6), and CIC-rearranged sarcoma (n = 1). RESULTS: NKX2.2 had high sensitivity (100%) and moderate specificity (85%) for the diagnosis of ES in cytologic material. NKX2.2 expression also was present in a subset of mesenchymal and epithelial mimics, and staining was most commonly observed in small cell carcinoma (80%) and well differentiated neuroendocrine tumor (45%). Among mesenchymal mimics, 42% exhibited NKX2.2 expression. NKX2.2 staining was absent in melanoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, and lymphoproliferative neoplasms. CONCLUSIONS: NKX2.2 is a highly sensitive but only moderately specific marker for ES. Neuroendocrine neoplasms exhibit variable NKX2.2 expression and remain a significant potential diagnostic pitfall. Thus, NKX2.2 expression should be interpreted in the context of an appropriate immunohistochemical panel (and often with confirmatory molecular testing) for the accurate diagnosis of ES.","['Russell-Goldman, Eleanor', 'Hornick, Jason L', 'Qian, Xiaohua', 'Jo, Vickie Y']","['Russell-Goldman E', 'Hornick JL', 'Qian X', 'Jo VY']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181030,United States,Cancer Cytopathol,Cancer cytopathology,101499453,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Homeobox Protein Nkx-2.2)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (NKX2-2 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (nkx2.2b protein, zebrafish)']",,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis', 'Biopsy, Fine-Needle/*methods', 'Carcinoma, Merkel Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Homeobox Protein Nkx-2.2', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/*methods', 'Melanoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Neuroendocrine Tumors/metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/metabolism/*pathology', 'Sarcoma, Small Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Transcription Factors', 'Zebrafish Proteins/*biosynthesis']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Ewing sarcoma', '*NK2 homeobox 2 (NKX2.2)', '*cytology', '*fine-needle aspiration (FNA)', '*immunohistochemistry', '*small round blue cell tumors']",2018/10/31 06:00,2019/07/30 06:00,['2018/10/31 06:00'],"['2018/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/19 00:00 [revised]', '2018/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncy.22056 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Cytopathol. 2018 Nov;126(11):942-949. doi: 10.1002/cncy.22056.

Lipidomics represents a promising approach to discriminate lipid profiles of malignant phenotype cells. Alterations in phospholipid distribution or chemical composition have been reported in various pathologies including cancer. Here we were curious whether quantitative differences in phospholipid composition between cisplatin-resistant and -sensitive model cancer cell lines could be revealed by mass spectrometric means. METHODS: The phospholipid contents of cell membranes of the cancer cell lines CCRF-CEM and A2780, both responsive and resistant to cisplatin, were analyzed by solid-phase extraction (SPE) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)). Extracts were obtained by disruption of cells with a dounce tissue grinder set followed by centrifugation. To minimize the enzymatic activity, phospholipids were extracted from cell extracts by SPE immediately after the cell lysis and analyzed by MS. Both supernatant and pellet fractions of cell extracts were analyzed. RESULTS: A phospholipid profile specific for cell lines and their phenotypes was revealed. We have documented by quantitative analysis that phosphocholines PC P-34:0, PC 34:1, PC 20:2_16:0, LPC 18:1 and LPC 16:0 PLs were present in the 200-400 muM concentration range in CCRF-CEM cisplatin-responsive cells, but absent in their cisplatin-resistant cells. Similarly, PC 34:1, LPC 18:1 and LPC 16:0 were increased in cisplatin-responsive A2780 cells, and PC 20:2_16:0 was downregulated in cisplatin-resistant A2780 cells. CONCLUSIONS: In this work we showed that the ESI-MS analysis of the lipid content of the therapy-resistant and -sensitive cells can clearly distinguish the phenotypic pattern and determine the potential tumor response to cytotoxic therapy. Lipid entities revealed by mass spectrometry and associated with development of therapy resistance can thus support molecular diagnosis and provide a potential complementary cancer biomarker.","['Cadoni, Enzo', 'Vanhara, Petr', 'Valletta, Elisa', 'Pinna, Elisabetta', 'Vascellari, Sarah', 'Caddeo, Graziano', 'Isaia, Francesco', 'Pani, Alessandra', 'Havel, Josef', 'Pivetta, Tiziana']","['Cadoni E', 'Vanhara P', 'Valletta E', 'Pinna E', 'Vascellari S', 'Caddeo G', 'Isaia F', 'Pani A', 'Havel J', 'Pivetta T']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Chimiche e Geologiche, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', ""International Clinical Research Center, St. Anne's University Hospital, Brno, Czech Republic."", 'Dipartimento di Scienze Chimiche e Geologiche, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Chimiche e Geologiche, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Chimiche e Geologiche, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.', ""International Clinical Research Center, St. Anne's University Hospital, Brno, Czech Republic."", 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Chimiche e Geologiche, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.']",['eng'],['NV18-08-00299./Czech Health Research Council'],['Journal Article'],,England,Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom,Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM,8802365,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phospholipids)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/chemistry/drug therapy/pathology', 'Phospholipids/*analysis/chemistry', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Solid Phase Extraction', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",,,,2018/10/31 06:00,2019/01/05 06:00,['2018/10/31 06:00'],"['2018/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/20 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/05 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/rcm.8320 [doi]'],ppublish,Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom. 2019 Jan 15;33(1):97-106. doi: 10.1002/rcm.8320.,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8149-2830', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7470-177X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2139-8188', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0437-2499', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6675-5671', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9881-3584']",,"['(c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this review we will address some unresolved issues that support this concept. First, we will address the issue of the identity of cancer-initiating cells and the presence of cancer stem cells in growing tumors. We will also ask are there rare and distinct populations of cancer stem cells in established tumor cell lines, or are all of the cells cancer stem cells? Second, the most important clinical problem with cancer is its metastasis, and here a challenging question arises: by employing radio-chemotherapy for tumor treatment, do we unintentionally create a prometastatic microenvironment in collateral organs? Specifically, many factors upregulated in response to radio-chemotherapy-induced injury may attract highly migratory cancer cells that survived initial treatment. Third, what is the contribution of normal circulating stem cells to the growing malignancy? Do circulating normal stem cells recognize a tumor as a hypoxia-damaged tissue that needs vascular and stromal support and thereby contribute to tumor expansion? Fourth, is it reasonable to inhibit only one prometastatic ligand-receptor axis when cancer stem cells express several receptors for several chemotactic factors that may compensate for inhibition of the targeted receptor? Fifth, since most aggressive cancer cells mimic early-development stem cells, which properties of embryonic stem cells are retained in cancer cells? Would it be reasonable to inhibit cancer cell signaling pathways involved in the migration and proliferation of embryonic stem cells? We will also briefly address some new players in cancerogenesis, including extracellular microvesicles, bioactive phospholipids, and extracellular nucleotides.","['Ratajczak, Mariusz Z', 'Bujko, Kamila', 'Mack, Aaron', 'Kucia, Magda', 'Ratajczak, Janina']","['Ratajczak MZ', 'Bujko K', 'Mack A', 'Kucia M', 'Ratajczak J']","['Stem Cell Institute, Division of Hematology and Oncology, James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University Louisville, 500 South Floyd Street, Louisville, 40202, Kentucky, USA. mzrata01@louisville.edu.', 'Department of Regenerative Medicine, Center for Preclinical Research and Technology, Warsaw Medical University, Warsaw, Poland. mzrata01@louisville.edu.', 'Stem Cell Institute, Division of Hematology and Oncology, James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University Louisville, 500 South Floyd Street, Louisville, 40202, Kentucky, USA.', 'Stem Cell Institute, Division of Hematology and Oncology, James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University Louisville, 500 South Floyd Street, Louisville, 40202, Kentucky, USA.', 'Stem Cell Institute, Division of Hematology and Oncology, James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University Louisville, 500 South Floyd Street, Louisville, 40202, Kentucky, USA.', 'Department of Regenerative Medicine, Center for Preclinical Research and Technology, Warsaw Medical University, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Stem Cell Institute, Division of Hematology and Oncology, James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University Louisville, 500 South Floyd Street, Louisville, 40202, Kentucky, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 DK074720/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL134644/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL112788/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20181030,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Movement/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Regeneration/genetics/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/physiology', 'Tumor Microenvironment/genetics/physiology', 'Up-Regulation/genetics/physiology']",PMC6286324,,,2018/10/31 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2018/10/31 06:00'],"['2018/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0294-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0294-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Dec;32(12):2519-2526. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0294-7.

The goal was to define disease entities that should be modified, removed, or added based on new insights. In particular, to improve a biologically meaningful classification, a number of new molecular genetic markers were included, which had proved to be of diagnostic and/or prognostic relevance. The resulting differentiated diagnostic procedure is a challenge for the hematopathologist. Not only is it necessary to pool the information from a multimodal diagnostic process and to compare the results of morphology, immunophenotyping, and clinical information. It is also essential to integrate the techniques of fluorescence in situ hybridization and next generation sequencing into the diagnostic process.

In order to achieve the ultrasensitive detection of the target mRNA, the cyclic target chain displacement polymerization of leukemia marker mRNA assisted with Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase is employed. The determination is carried out by recording the ECL emission of pyridine ruthenium (Ru(bpy)3(2+)) complexes embedded into the assistance DNA (ADNA) loaded on the nanogold surface, after the hybridization reaction between the probe DNA (PDNA) and the remaining sequence of the CP's stem part, and the formation of a core-shell sun-like structure. The mercapto-modified capture DNA (CP) is immobilized on the surface of a magneto-controlled glassy carbon electrode by Au-S bond. The CP is opened and hybridized with the target mRNA to form double-stranded DNA. In the presence of polymerase, primer DNA, and bases (dNTPs), the primer chain gets access to its complementary sequence of the stem part and then triggers a polymerization of the DNA strand, leading to the release of mRNA and starting the next polymerization cycle. Finally, the composite of PDNA-covered and ADNA-covered (embedded with Ru(bpy)3(2+)) gold nanoparticles (hereafter called AuNPs@(PDNA+ADNA-Ru(bpy)3(2+)) is added, and the ECL intensity is recorded. Because of the polymerization cycle and the aggregation of the illuminator of Ru(bpy)3(2+), the detected signal is amplified significantly. The results showed that the corresponding ECL signal has a good linear relationship with a logarithm of target mRNA concentration in the range of 1 x 10(-16) to 1 x 10(-7) mol/L, with a detection limit of 4.3 x 10(-17) mol/L. The mRNA spiked in the human serum sample is determined, and the recoveries are from 97.2 to 102.0%. This sensor demonstrates good selectivity, stability, and reproducibility.

Mcl-1 inhibitors, such as the BH3-mimetic EU-5346, therefore represent an exciting new class of targeting agents and are a current focus of widespread cancer-drug development efforts. METHODS: ONCOMINE analysis was utilized to compare expression profiles of Bcl-2 family members across all major BC subgroups. Potential toxicities of EU-5346 were evaluated using iPS-generated cardiomyocytes, blood cells and astrocytes. The anti-BC cell activity of EU-5346-based therapies was evaluated using [(3)H]-thymidine uptake and spheroid-forming assays as well as immunoblotting and the Chou-Talalay method. Protein level-based activity of EU-5346, the specific anti-Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-199 and the specific anti-Bcl-xL inhibitor WEHI-539 was verified in Mcl-1(Delta/null) versus Mcl-1(wt/wt) MEFs. RESULTS: We previously demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity of EU-5346 in all BC subtypes. Our present results go further and suggest that EU-5346 may induce limited adverse events such as cardiotoxicity, hematotoxicity, and neurotoxicity, frequently observed with other BH3 mimetics. As demonstrated by our mathematical scoring model, the prediction of EU-5643-induced IC50 not only relies on the protein level of Mcl-1 but also on Bak, Bim, and Noxa. Synergistic anti-BC activity of low-dose EU-5346 with the BH3 mimetics ABT-199 or WEHI-539 was observed only in those BC cells expressing Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, respectively. Similarly, when combined with tamoxifen or trastuzumab, low-dose EU-5346 induced significant anti-BC activity in hormone receptor positive or Her2-positive BC cells, respectively. Finally, EU-5346 in combination with paclitaxel induced synergistic anti-BC activity in both paclitaxel-sensitive and paclitaxel-resistant TNBC cells. CONCLUSION: These data strongly support the further clinical development of EU-5346 to improve BC patient survival.","['Vallet, Sonia', 'Fan, Fengjuan', 'Malvestiti, Stefano', 'Pecherstorfer, Martin', 'Sattler, Martin', 'Schneeweiss, Andreas', 'Schulze-Bergkamen, Henning', 'Opferman, Joseph T', 'Cardone, Michael H', 'Jager, Dirk', 'Podar, Klaus']","['Vallet S', 'Fan F', 'Malvestiti S', 'Pecherstorfer M', 'Sattler M', 'Schneeweiss A', 'Schulze-Bergkamen H', 'Opferman JT', 'Cardone MH', 'Jager D', 'Podar K']","['Department of Medical Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, University Hospital Krems, Karl Landsteiner University of Health Sciences, Krems an der Donau, Austria.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, University Hospital Krems, Karl Landsteiner University of Health Sciences, Krems an der Donau, Austria.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', ""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", 'Eutropics Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Applied Tumor Immunity, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany. klaus.podar@krems.lknoe.at.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, University Hospital Krems, Karl Landsteiner University of Health Sciences, Krems an der Donau, Austria. klaus.podar@krems.lknoe.at.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181029,Netherlands,Breast Cancer Res Treat,Breast cancer research and treatment,8111104,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Combinations', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['BH3 mimetics', 'Breast cancer', 'Combination therapies', 'Mathematical scoring model', 'Mcl-1']",2018/10/31 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2018/10/31 06:00'],"['2018/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10549-018-5022-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s10549-018-5022-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2019 Feb;173(3):585-596. doi: 10.1007/s10549-018-5022-5.

Guided by the structural analysis of a YEATS-Kcr complex, we developed a series of peptide-based inhibitors of YEATS domains by targeting a unique pi-pi-pi stacking interaction at the proteins' Kcr recognition site. Further structure optimization resulted in the selective inhibitors preferentially binding to individual YEATS-containing proteins including AF9 and ENL with submicromolar affinities. We demonstrate that one of the ENL YEATS-selective inhibitors, XL-13m, engages with endogenous ENL, perturbs the recruitment of ENL onto chromatin, and synergizes the BET and DOT1L inhibition-induced downregulation of oncogenes in MLL-rearranged acute leukemia.","['Li, Xin', 'Li, Xiao-Meng', 'Jiang, Yixiang', 'Liu, Zheng', 'Cui, Yiwen', 'Fung, Ka Yi', 'van der Beelen, Stan H E', 'Tian, Gaofei', 'Wan, Liling', 'Shi, Xiaobing', 'Allis, C David', 'Li, Haitao', 'Li, Yuanyuan', 'Li, Xiang David']","['Li X', 'Li XM', 'Jiang Y', 'Liu Z', 'Cui Y', 'Fung KY', 'van der Beelen SHE', 'Tian G', 'Wan L', 'Shi X', 'Allis CD', 'Li H', 'Li Y', 'Li XD']","['Department of Chemistry, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Chemistry, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Chemistry, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Chemistry, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Chemistry, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Chemistry, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Chemistry, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Chemistry, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Laboratory of Chromatin Biology & Epigenetics, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Epigenetics and Molecular Carcinogenesis, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Laboratory of Chromatin Biology & Epigenetics, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Protein Sciences, Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Structural Biology, Department of Basic Medical Sciences, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.', 'Tsinghua-Peking Joint Center for Life Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Protein Sciences, Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Structural Biology, Department of Basic Medical Sciences, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. liyuanyuan@tsinghua.edu.cn.', 'Tsinghua-Peking Joint Center for Life Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. liyuanyuan@tsinghua.edu.cn.', 'Department of Chemistry, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China. xiangli@hku.hk.']",['eng'],['R01 CA204639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181029,United States,Nat Chem Biol,Nature chemical biology,101231976,"['0 ((+)-JQ1 compound)', '0 (Azepines)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (ELL protein, human)', '0 (MLLT3 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)', '0 (Triazoles)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DOT1L protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Azepines/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', '*Drug Design', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Methyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Nuclear Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Peptides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Protein Domains', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Triazoles/pharmacology']",PMC6503841,,,2018/10/31 06:00,2019/05/09 06:00,['2018/10/31 06:00'],"['2018/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/09 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41589-018-0144-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41589-018-0144-y [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Chem Biol. 2018 Dec;14(12):1140-1149. doi: 10.1038/s41589-018-0144-y.

In vivo and in vitro stage-specific deletions globally identified Bcl11b-controlled target genes in pro-T cells. Proteomics analysis revealed that Bcl11b associated with multiple cofactors and that its direct action was needed to recruit those cofactors to selective target sites. Regions near functionally regulated target genes showed enrichment for those sites of Bcl11b-dependent recruitment of cofactors, and deletion of individual cofactors relieved the repression of many genes normally repressed by Bcl11b. Runx1 collaborated with Bcl11b most frequently for both activation and repression. In parallel, Bcl11b indirectly regulated a subset of target genes by a gene network circuit via the transcription inhibitor Id2 (encoded by Id2) and transcription factor PLZF (encoded by Zbtb16); Id2 and Zbtb16 were directly repressed by Bcl11b, and Id2 and PLZF controlled distinct alternative programs.

Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) is a pivotal mechanism of antitumor action of clinically employed antitumor antibodies. IL-15 administered to patients with metastatic malignancy by continuous i.v. infusion at 2 mug/kg/d for 10 days was associated with a 38-fold increase in the number and activation status of circulating natural killer (NK) cells and activation of macrophages which together are ADCC effectors. We investigated combination therapy of IL-15 with rituximab in a syngeneic mouse model of lymphoma transfected with human CD20 and with alemtuzumab (Campath-1H) in a xenograft model of human adult T cell leukemia (ATL). IL-15 greatly enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of both rituximab and alemtuzumab in tumor models. The additivity/synergy was shown to be associated with augmented ADCC. Both NK cells and macrophages were critical elements in the chain of interacting effectors involved in optimal therapeutic responses mediated by rituximab with IL-15. We provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that NK cells interact with macrophages to augment the NK-cell activation and expression of FcgammaRIV and the capacity of these cells to become effectors of ADCC.

To further evaluate the platform, we generated and assessed different murine sCAR constructs to determine the factors that afford efficacy, persistence, and expansion of sCAR T cells in a competent immune system. We find that sCAR T cells undergo significant in vivo expansion, which is correlated with potent antitumor efficacy. Most importantly, we show that the switch dosing regimen not only allows control over B cell populations through iterative depletion and repopulation, but that the ""rest"" period between dosing cycles is the key for induction of memory and expansion of sCAR T cells.

In humans, OSM exerts its effects through activation of either of two different heterodimeric receptor complexes, formed by glycoprotein 130 (gp130) and either OSM receptor (OSMR) or leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR). In contrast, the mouse OSM orthologue acts mainly through dimers containing OSMR and gp130 and shows limited activity through mouse LIFR. Despite their structural similarity, neither human nor mouse OSM signal through the other species' OSMR. The molecular basis for such species-specific signaling, however, remains poorly understood. To identify key molecular features of OSM that determine receptor activation in humans and mice, we generated chimeric mouse-human cytokines. Replacing regions within binding site III of murine OSM with the human equivalents showed that the cytokine's AB loop was critical for receptor selection. Substitutions of individual amino acids within this region demonstrated that residues Asn-37, Thr-40, and Asp-42 of the murine cytokine were responsible for limited LIFR activation and absence of human OSMR/LIFR signaling. In human OSM, Lys-44 appeared to be the main residue preventing mouse OSMR activation. Our data reveal that individual amino acids within the AB loop of OSM determine species-specific activities.

These are variably downmodulated in vivo and recover in vitro, suggesting a reversible influence of tissue-located antigen. Therapeutic targeting of sIgM function via ibrutinib, an inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK), causes inhibition and tumor cell redistribution into the blood, with significant clinical benefit. Circulating CLL cells persist in an inhibited state, offering a tool to investigate the effects of drug on BTK-inhibited sIgM. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We investigated the consequences of ibrutinib therapy on levels and function of sIgM in circulating leukemic cells of patients with CLL. RESULTS: At week 1, there was a significant increase of sIgM expression (64% increase from pretherapy) on CLL cells either recently released from tissue or persisting in blood. In contrast, surface IgD (sIgD) and a range of other receptors did not change. SIgM levels remained higher than pretherapy in the following 3 months despite gradual cell size reduction and ongoing autophagy and apoptotic activity. Conversely, IgD and other receptors did not increase and gradually declined. Recovered sIgM was fully N-glycosylated, another feature of escape from antigen, and expression did not increase further during culture in vitro. The sIgM was fully capable of mediating phosphorylation of SYK, which lies upstream of BTK in the B-cell receptor pathway. CONCLUSIONS: This specific IgM increase in patients underpins the key role of tissue-based engagement with antigen in CLL, confirms the inhibitory action of ibrutinib, and reveals dynamic adaptability of CLL cells to precision monotherapy.See related commentary by Burger, p. 2372.","['Drennan, Samantha', 'Chiodin, Giorgia', ""D'Avola, Annalisa"", 'Tracy, Ian', 'Johnson, Peter W', 'Trentin, Livio', 'Steele, Andrew J', 'Packham, Graham', 'Stevenson, Freda K', 'Forconi, Francesco']","['Drennan S', 'Chiodin G', ""D'Avola A"", 'Tracy I', 'Johnson PW', 'Trentin L', 'Steele AJ', 'Packham G', 'Stevenson FK', 'Forconi F']","['Cancer Sciences Unit, Cancer Research UK and NIHR Experimental Cancer Medicine Centres, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Cancer Research UK and NIHR Experimental Cancer Medicine Centres, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Cancer Research UK and NIHR Experimental Cancer Medicine Centres, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Cancer Research UK and NIHR Experimental Cancer Medicine Centres, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Cancer Research UK and NIHR Experimental Cancer Medicine Centres, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Padua University School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padua, Italy.', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Cancer Research UK and NIHR Experimental Cancer Medicine Centres, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Cancer Research UK and NIHR Experimental Cancer Medicine Centres, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Cancer Research UK and NIHR Experimental Cancer Medicine Centres, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Cancer Research UK and NIHR Experimental Cancer Medicine Centres, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom. f.forconi@soton.ac.uk.', 'Haematology Department, Cancer Care Directorate, University Hospital Southampton NHS Trust, Southampton, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181029,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', 'Piperidines', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrazoles', 'Pyrimidines']",,,,2018/10/31 06:00,2019/07/04 06:00,['2018/10/31 06:00'],"['2018/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/26 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/04 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-18-1286 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-1286 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2019 Apr 15;25(8):2503-2512. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-1286.

Leukemic cells expressing constitutively active FLT3 mutants are resistance to the current cancer therapies (radiotherapy and chemotherapy); hence, there is an increased interest to identify new agents for the treatment of AML. The main aim of this study was evaluating cytotoxic effects of novel pyrimidocyanoacrylates and quinoline derivatives on FLT3 overexpressing cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five novel pyrimidocyanoacrylates & 2-chloro 3-carbaldehyde quinolone derivative compounds, E1QAC1, E1QAC2, E1QAC3, E1QAC4, and E1QAC5 were designed and synthesized at the Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences, Ferdowsi University, Mashhad, Iran. FDC-P1 cells expressing human wild-type FLT3 (FD-FLT3-WT) and internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutants (FD-FLT3-ITD) used in this study. The cells maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and murine granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (mGM-CSF). Potency for induction of cytotoxicity (IC50 value) and apoptosis was determined after treating the cells with concentration of the compounds by resazurin assay. Bax and Bcl2 activation status was also investigated by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: All the compounds had concentration-dependent effects on inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in both cell lines. E1QAC4 was the most potent compound for inhibition of cell proliferation (with IC50 value of 19 muM) and apoptosis induction in the FLT3-WT cells. However, FD-FLT3-ITD cells were nearly five-times more resistant to all the compounds (except than E1QAC2) that the FLT3-WT expressing cells. Western blotting results also showed that FD-FLT3-ITD cells had lower levels of Bax and higher levels of Bcl2 than the FD-FLT3-WT cells. CONCLUSION: The five novel heterocyclic compounds (E1QAC1-5) had cytotoxic effects and induced apoptosis in FD-FLT3 cells. Therefore, it is worthwhile to consider them as potential lead compound for development of new therapeutic agents for AML patients.","['Sobhanifar, Mohammad-Ali', 'Mashkani, Baratali', 'Saadatmandzadeh, Mohammad', 'Sadeghnia, Hamid Reza', 'Mousavi, Seyed Hadi']","['Sobhanifar MA', 'Mashkani B', 'Saadatmandzadeh M', 'Sadeghnia HR', 'Mousavi SH']","['Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences, Ferdowsi University, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Medical Toxicology Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the incremental improvement of transplanted AML patients in the last two decades. METHODS: Patients included in this analysis were adult AML patients who underwent allo-SCT from an HLA-matched sibling donor (MSD) or HLA-matched unrelated donor (MUD) in first remission. Patient outcomes were assessed between three cohorts according to the year of transplant (1993-2002, 2003-2007 and 2008-2012). RESULTS: The analysis comprised a total of 20 187 patients of whom 4763 were transplanted between 1993 and 2002, 5835 in 2003 and 2007, and 9589 in 2008 and 2012. In multivariate analysis, leukaemia-free survival (LFS) rates were significantly improved in more recently transplanted patients compared to patients transplanted in 1993-2002 [Hazard ratio (HR) = 0.84, confidence interval (CI) 95%, 0.77-0.92; P = 0.003], a benefit which also extended to improved overall survival (OS; HR = 0.8, CI 95%, 0.73-0.89; P < 0.0001), and decreased nonrelapse mortality (NRM) rates (HR = 0.65, CI 95%, 0.56-0.75; P < 0.0001). Subset analysis revealed that in MSD, the rates of LFS, NRM and OS significantly improved in patients in the more recent cohort with similar results also seen in MUD. Finally, the incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was significantly reduced leading to improved GVHD-free/relapse-free survival (GRFS) rates in more recently transplanted patients. CONCLUSION: Outcome of allo-SCT for AML patients has markedly improved in the last two decades owing to decreased nonrelapse mortality and improved rates of leukaemia-free survival resulting in significantly longer survival.","['Canaani, J', 'Beohou, E', 'Labopin, M', 'Ghavamzadeh, A', 'Beelen, D', 'Hamladji, R-M', 'Niederwieser, D', 'Volin, L', 'Markiewicz, M', 'Arnold, R', 'Mufti, G', 'Ehninger, G', 'Socie, G', 'Kroger, N', 'Mohty, M', 'Nagler, A']","['Canaani J', 'Beohou E', 'Labopin M', 'Ghavamzadeh A', 'Beelen D', 'Hamladji RM', 'Niederwieser D', 'Volin L', 'Markiewicz M', 'Arnold R', 'Mufti G', 'Ehninger G', 'Socie G', 'Kroger N', 'Mohty M', 'Nagler A']","['Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.', 'Acute Leukemia Working Party -EBMT and Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.', 'Acute Leukemia Working Party -EBMT and Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.', 'Hematology-Oncology and BMT Research, Shariati Hospital, Teheran, Iran.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, University Hospital, Essen, Germany.', 'Service Hematologie Greffe de Moelle, Centre Pierre et Marie Curie, Alger, Algeria.', 'Division of Haematology & Oncology, University Hospital Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Comprehensive Cancer Centre, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Haematology and BMT, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland.', 'Medizinische Klinik m.

In order to address these unmet medical needs, we carried out a high-throughput screen of an in-house library of on- and off-patent drugs with the OCI/AML-2 cell line. Through this screen, we discovered adefovir dipi-voxil (adefovir-DP) as being active against human AML. In addition to adefovir-DP, there are second-generation formulations of adefovir, including octadecyloxyethyl adefovir (ODE-adefovir) and hexadecyloxypropyl adefovir (HDP-adefovir), which were designed to overcome the pharmacokinetic problems of the parent compound adefovir. Given the known clinical benefit of nucleoside analogs for the treatment of AML, we undertook studies to evaluate the potential benefit of adefovir-based molecules. In AML cell lines and patient samples, adefovir-DP and ODE-adefovir were highly potent, whereas HDP-adefovir was significantly less active. Interestingly, ODE-adefovir was remarkably less toxic than adefovir-DP towards normal hematopoietic cells. In addition, ODE-adefovir at a dose of 15 mg/kg/day showed potent activity against human AML in a NOD/SCID mouse model, with a reduction of human leukemia in mouse bone marrow of > 40% in all mice tested within 20 days of treatment. Based on its chemical structure, we hypothesized that the cytotoxicity of ODE-adefovir toward AML was through cell cycle arrest and DNA damage. Indeed, ODE-adefovir treatment induced cell cycle arrest in the S phase and increased levels of pH2Ax, indicating the induction of DNA damage. Furthermore, there was an increase in phospho-p53, transactivation of proapoptotic genes and activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Subsequent investigation unveiled strong synergism between ODE-adefovir and ara-C, making their coadministration of potential clinical benefit. Expression of MRP4, a nucleoside transporter, appeared to influence the response of AML cells to ODE-adefovir, as its inhibition potentiated ODE-adefovir killing. Taken together, our findings indicate that clinical development of ODE-adefovir or related compounds for the treatment of AML is warranted.","['Khoury, Haytham', 'He, Ruijuan', 'Schimmer, Aaron', 'Beadle, James R', 'Hostetler, Karl Y', 'Minden, Mark D']","['Khoury H', 'He R', 'Schimmer A', 'Beadle JR', 'Hostetler KY', 'Minden MD']","['Princess Margaret Hospital, Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Hospital, Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Hospital, Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.', 'Princess Margaret Hospital, Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canadamark.minden@uhn.ca.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181029,Switzerland,Chemotherapy,Chemotherapy,0144731,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Organophosphonates)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6GQP90I798 (adefovir)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Drug Compounding', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Organophosphonates/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Adefovir', 'DNA damage', 'MRP4', 'Nucleoside analogs']",2018/10/30 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/10/30 06:00'],"['2018/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['000491705 [pii]', '10.1159/000491705 [doi]']",ppublish,Chemotherapy. 2018;63(4):225-237. doi: 10.1159/000491705.

METHODS: We searched 5 English databases and 4 Chinese databases, from their inception until August 2017. Quantitative syntheses of RCTs were conducted using RevMan 5.3 software. Study selection, data extraction, and validation were performed independently by 2 reviewers. Cochrane criteria for risk-of-bias were used to assess the methodological quality of the trials. RESULTS: Five RCTs met the inclusion criteria, and most were of low methodological quality. All RCTs compared AA + routine care with routine care alone. Our analysis found that complementary effects of AA can improve the scores of the Bristol Stool Form (BSF), the Constipation Assessment Scale (CAS), and the Patient Assessment of Constipation-Quality of Life (PAC-QOL). However, the same positive results were not found in terms of the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), the EuroQoL 5-domain (EQ-5D), and the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, as a potential safety therapy, AA may be recommended in addition to routine care including use of laxatives to prevent constipation in leukemia patients undergoing chemotherapy. In the future, more rigorous RCTs must be conducted to overcome the limitations of our existing data and to confirm the effect and safety of AA for managing constipation in leukemia patients undergoing chemotherapy.","['Chen, Chun-Ye', 'Lin, Xiao-Xu', 'Wang, Xing']","['Chen CY', 'Lin XX', 'Wang X']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Systematic Review']",20181030,Switzerland,Complement Med Res,Complementary medicine research,101698453,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Acupuncture, Ear/*standards', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Constipation/*etiology/*therapy', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/*drug therapy']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Auricular acupressure therapy', 'Chemotherapy', 'Constipation', 'Leukemia', 'Meta-analysis', 'Systematic review']",2018/10/30 06:00,2019/09/19 06:00,['2018/10/30 06:00'],"['2018/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['000491693 [pii]', '10.1159/000491693 [doi]']",ppublish,Complement Med Res. 2018;25(6):406-412. doi: 10.1159/000491693.

DDM is based on the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) algorithm to generate a visualization of molecular and biological similarity. DDM maps chemical and target space and predicts the activities of novel kinase inhibitors across the kinome. The model was validated using independent data sets and in a prospective experimental setting, where DDM predicted new inhibitors for FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), a therapeutic target for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. Compounds were resynthesized, yielding highly potent, cellularly active FLT3 inhibitors. Biochemical assays confirmed most of the predicted off-targets. DDM is further unique in that it is completely open-source and available as a ready-to-use executable to facilitate broad and easy adoption.","['Janssen, Antonius P A', 'Grimm, Sebastian H', 'Wijdeven, Ruud H M', 'Lenselink, Eelke B', 'Neefjes, Jacques', 'van Boeckel, Constant A A', 'van Westen, Gerard J P', 'van der Stelt, Mario']","['Janssen APA', 'Grimm SH', 'Wijdeven RHM', 'Lenselink EB', 'Neefjes J', 'van Boeckel CAA', 'van Westen GJP', 'van der Stelt M']","['Molecular Physiology, Leiden Institute of Chemistry , Leiden University , 2333 CC Leiden , The Netherlands.', 'Molecular Physiology, Leiden Institute of Chemistry , Leiden University , 2333 CC Leiden , The Netherlands.', 'Department of Cell and Chemical Biology , Leiden University Medical Centre , 2333 ZC Leiden , The Netherlands.', 'Drug and Target Discovery , Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research, Leiden University , 2333 CC Leiden , The Netherlands.', 'Department of Cell and Chemical Biology , Leiden University Medical Centre , 2333 ZC Leiden , The Netherlands.', 'Pivot Park Screening Centre , 5349 AB Oss , The Netherlands.', 'Drug and Target Discovery , Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research, Leiden University , 2333 CC Leiden , The Netherlands.', 'Molecular Physiology, Leiden Institute of Chemistry , Leiden University , 2333 CC Leiden , The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181108,United States,J Chem Inf Model,Journal of chemical information and modeling,101230060,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Drug Discovery/*methods', 'Machine Learning', 'Models, Molecular', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinases/chemistry/*metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism']",PMC6437696,,,2018/10/30 06:00,2020/05/08 06:00,['2018/10/30 06:00'],"['2018/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/08 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00640 [doi]'],ppublish,J Chem Inf Model. 2019 Mar 25;59(3):1221-1229. doi: 10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00640.

Evaluating bone accrual in children with bone health-threatening conditions requires consideration of these determinants. The objective of this study was to develop prediction equations for calculating BMC/aBMD velocity SD scores (velocity-Z) and to evaluate bone accrual in youth with health conditions. Bone and body compositions via DXA were obtained for up to six annual intervals in healthy youth (n = 2014) enrolled in the Bone Mineral Density in Childhood Study (BMDCS) . Longitudinal statistical methods were used to develop sex- and pubertal-status-specific reference equations for calculating velocity-Z for total body less head-BMC and lumbar spine (LS), total hip (TotHip), femoral neck, and 1/3-radius aBMD. Equations accounted for (1) height velocity, (2) height velocity and weight velocity, or (3) height velocity and LBM velocity. These equations were then applied to observational, single-center, 12-month longitudinal data from youth with cystic fibrosis (CF; n = 65), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors (n = 45), or Crohn disease (CD) initiating infliximab (n = 72). Associations between BMC/aBMD-Z change (conventional pediatric bone health monitoring method) and BMC/aBMD velocity-Z were assessed. The BMC/aBMD velocity-Z for CF, ALL, and CD was compared with BMDCS. Annual changes in the BMC/aBMD-Z and the BMC/aBMD velocity-Z were strongly correlated, but not equivalent; LS aBMD-Z = 1 equated with LS aBMD velocity-Z = -3. In CF, BMC/aBMD velocity-Z was normal. In posttherapy ALL, BMC/aBMD velocity-Z was increased, particularly at TotHip (1.01 [-.047; 1.7], p < 0.0001). In CD, BMC/aBMD velocity-Z was increased at all skeletal sites. LBM-velocity adjustment attenuated these increases (eg, TotHip aBMD velocity-Z: 1.13 [0.004; 2.34] versus 1.52 [0.3; 2.85], p < 0.0001). Methods for quantifying the BMC/aBMD velocity that account for maturation and body composition changes provide a framework for evaluating childhood bone accretion and may provide insight into mechanisms contributing to altered accrual in chronic childhood conditions.

As circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) carries cancer-specific modifications, it has great potential as a noninvasive biomarker for detection of incipient tumors. Patients and methods: We collected cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples of 1002 elderly without a prior malignancy, carried out whole-genome massive parallel sequencing and scrutinized the mapped sequences for the presence of (sub)chromosomal copy number alterations (CNAs) predictive for a malignancy. When imbalances were detected, 6-monthly clinical follow-up was carried out. Results: In 3% of participants chromosomal imbalances were detected. Follow-up analyses, including whole-body MRI screening, confirmed the presence of five hematologic malignancies: one Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), stage II; three non-HL (type chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Rai I-Binet A; type SLL, stage III; type mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, stage I) and one myelodysplastic syndrome with excess blasts, stage II. The CNAs detected in cfDNA were tumor-specific. Furthermore, one case was identified with monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis, a potential precursor of B-cell malignancy. In 24 additional individuals, CNAs were identified but no cancer diagnosis was made. For 9 of them, the aberrant cfDNA profile originated from peripheral blood cells. For 15 others the origin of aberrations in cfDNA remains undetermined. Conclusion(s): Genomewide profiling of cfDNA in apparently healthy individuals enables the detection of incipient hematologic malignancies as well as clonal mosaicism with unknown clinical significance. CNA screening of cellular DNA of peripheral blood in elderly has established that clonal mosaicism for these chromosomal anomalies predicts a 5- to 10-fold enhanced risk of a subsequent cancer. We demonstrate that cfDNA screening detects CNAs, which are not only derived from peripheral blood, but even more from other tissues. Since the clinical relevance of clonal mosaics in other tissues remains unknown, long-term follow-up is warranted. Taken together, this study demonstrates that genomewide cfDNA analysis has potential as an unbiased screening approach for hematological malignancies and premalignant conditions.","['Lenaerts, L', 'Vandenberghe, P', 'Brison, N', 'Che, H', 'Neofytou, M', 'Verheecke, M', 'Leemans, L', 'Maggen, C', 'Dewaele, B', 'Dehaspe, L', 'Vanderschueren, S', 'Dierickx, D', 'Vandecaveye, V', 'Amant, F', 'Vermeesch, J R']","['Lenaerts L', 'Vandenberghe P', 'Brison N', 'Che H', 'Neofytou M', 'Verheecke M', 'Leemans L', 'Maggen C', 'Dewaele B', 'Dehaspe L', 'Vanderschueren S', 'Dierickx D', 'Vandecaveye V', 'Amant F', 'Vermeesch JR']","['Departments of Oncology.', 'Departments of Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven; Departments of Hematology.', 'Departments of Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven.', 'Departments of Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven.', 'Departments of Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven.', 'Departments of Oncology; Departments of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven.', 'Departments of Oncology.', 'Departments of Oncology; Departments of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven.', 'Departments of Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven.', 'Departments of Genomics Core Facility.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, KU Leuven, Leuven; Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven.', 'Departments of Oncology; Departments of Hematology.', 'Department of Imaging & Pathology, KU Leuven, Leuven; Department of Radiology, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Departments of Oncology; Departments of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven; Center for Gynecological Oncology Amsterdam, Amsterdam; Academic Medical Centre Amsterdam-University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam; The Netherlands Cancer Institute-Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

However, the low concentration of cancer-derived exosomes present in biofluids makes early diagnosis strenuous. Here, we developed a fluorescent biosensing platform, namely a dual signal amplification, for the ultrasensitive detection of leukemia cell-derived exosomes. The protocol consists of three steps: first, leukemia-derived exosomes containing CD63 and nucleolin were captured by anti-CD63 antibody modified magnetic bead conjugates (MB-CD63); then, a DNA primer comprising a nucleolin-recognition aptamer (AS1411) was applied to bind the exosomes which further initiated a rolling circle amplification (RCA) reaction to generate many repeat sequences for hybridization with gold nanoparticle (GNP)-DNA-fluorescent dye (FAM) conjugates (GNP-DNA-FAM); finally, nicking endonuclease (Nb.BbvCI) assisted target recycling was introduced. As a result, FAM was released from GNP-DNA-FAM conjugates, transformed from the quenching state to the emission state and thus fluorescence signals continuously accumulated. With this dual signal amplification platform, as low as 1 x 102 particles per muL exosomes could be detected. Furthermore, we have successfully applied this method for the detection of exosomes in spiked serum samples, indicating a promising tool for clinical application.","['Huang, Lin', 'Wang, Dian-Bing', 'Singh, Netrapal', 'Yang, Fang', 'Gu, Ning', 'Zhang, Xian-En']","['Huang L', 'Wang DB', 'Singh N', 'Yang F', 'Gu N', 'Zhang XE']","['School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing 210096, PR China. guning@seu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Nanoscale,Nanoscale,101525249,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Tetraspanin 30)', '7440-57-5 (Gold)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Antibodies/chemistry/immunology', '*Biosensing Techniques', 'DNA/chemistry/metabolism', 'DNA Primers/chemistry/metabolism', 'Exosomes/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Fluorescent Dyes/*chemistry', 'Gold/chemistry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Magnetics', 'Metal Nanoparticles/chemistry', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', '*Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Tetraspanin 30/immunology/*metabolism']",,,,2018/10/30 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/10/30 06:00'],"['2018/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/c8nr07720g [doi]'],ppublish,Nanoscale. 2018 Nov 8;10(43):20289-20295. doi: 10.1039/c8nr07720g.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A large number of studies has shown that the pathogenesis of AS is the result of interactions between the lipid metabolism disorders and chronic inflammatory responses in the body. Albiflorin can inhibit the inflammatory response and it has shown a therapeutic effect on certain inflammatory diseases. METHODS: In this study, a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1)-derived foam cell model was established via oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) to observe the effects of albiflorin on the AS-characteristic foam cells. RESULTS: Our results showed that, after the treatment with ox-LDL, macrophages induced by propylene glycol methyl ether acetate (PMA), presented large amounts of lipid deposition in their cytoplasm, indicating that the THP-1-derived foam cell model was successfully established. On the other hand, the same cells pretreated with albiflorin presented significantly reduced amounts of lipid deposition, and their contents of total cholesterol and triglyceride were also clearly lower. Besides, the expression levels of low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) were significantly decreased, and the expression levels of downstream factors interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were also obviously decreased in the cells treated with albiflorin but not in the negative control cells. Moreover, after treatment of macrophages with different concentrations of ox-LDL, the expression levels of LOX-1 and NF-kappaB were up-regulated in an ox-LDL concentration-dependent manner, and so were the expression levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha. And, it was found after treatment with LOX-1 neutralizing antibody or NF-kappaB inhibitor (during the foam cell formation induction via ox-LDL) that the lipid deposition in the cytoplasm of the cells was reduced, as in the cells treated with albiflorin. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our findings suggest that albiflorin decreases lipid deposition in the cytoplasm and blocks the foaming process by regulating the LOX-1/NF-kappaB signaling pathway.","['Sun, Jiyou', 'Li, Xiaojuan', 'Jiao, Kai', 'Zhai, Zhiwei', 'Sun, Dajun']","['Sun J', 'Li X', 'Jiao K', 'Zhai Z', 'Sun D']","['Department of Vascular Surgery, The Third Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Sanmenxia Central Hospital, Sanmenxia, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Qiqihar Medical University, Qiqihar, China.', ""Department of General Surgery, Mudanjiang City Second People's Hospital, Mudanjiang, China."", 'Department of Vascular Surgery, The Third Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China - dajun_sun123@163.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181029,Italy,Minerva Med,Minerva medica,0400732,"['0 (Bridged-Ring Compounds)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (OLR1 protein, human)', '0 (Propylene Glycols)', '0 (Scavenger Receptors, Class E)', '0 (Triglycerides)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (oxidized low density lipoprotein)', '0 (propylene glycol methyl ether acetate)', '39011-90-0 (albiflorin)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Atherosclerosis/*pathology', 'Bridged-Ring Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cholesterol/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Foam Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Lipid Metabolism/*drug effects', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/drug effects', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Propylene Glycols', 'Scavenger Receptors, Class E/metabolism', 'Triglycerides/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",,,,2018/10/30 06:00,2019/03/09 06:00,['2018/10/30 06:00'],"['2018/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/09 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0026-4806.18.05711-7 [pii]', '10.23736/S0026-4806.18.05711-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Minerva Med. 2019 Apr;110(2):107-114. doi: 10.23736/S0026-4806.18.05711-7.

Ninety patients were enrolled and were in first relapse or were refractory to induction/re-induction chemotherapy. They were randomized to the following regimens: carboplatin-topotecan (CT), each by continuous infusion for 5 days; alvocidib (formerly flavopiridol), cytarabine, and mitoxantrone (FLAM) in a timed sequential regimen; or sirolimus combined with mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine (S-MEC). The primary objective was attainment of a complete remission (CR). A Simon two-stage design was used for each of the three arms. The median age of the patients in the FLAM arm was older at 62 years compared with 55 years for the CT arm and the S-MEC arm. The overall response was 14% in the CT arm (5/35, 90% CI 7%-35%), 28% in the FLAM arm (10/36, 90% CI, 16%-43%), and 16% in the S-MEC arm (3/19, 90% CI, 4%-36%). There were nine treatment-related deaths, seven of which occurred in the FLAM arm with four of these in elderly patients. We conclude that the FLAM regimen had an encouraging response rate and should be considered for further clinical development but should be used with caution in elderly patients.","['Litzow, Mark R', 'Wang, Xin V', 'Carroll, Martin P', 'Karp, Judith E', 'Ketterling, Rhett P', 'Zhang, Yanming', 'Kaufmann, Scott H', 'Lazarus, Hillard M', 'Luger, Selina M', 'Paietta, Elisabeth M', 'Pratz, Keith W', 'Tun, Han Win', 'Altman, Jessica K', 'Broun, Edward R', 'Rybka, Witold B', 'Rowe, Jacob M', 'Tallman, Martin S']","['Litzow MR', 'Wang XV', 'Carroll MP', 'Karp JE', 'Ketterling RP', 'Zhang Y', 'Kaufmann SH', 'Lazarus HM', 'Luger SM', 'Paietta EM', 'Pratz KW', 'Tun HW', 'Altman JK', 'Broun ER', 'Rybka WB', 'Rowe JM', 'Tallman MS']","['Departments of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Oncology, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Hematology/Medical Oncology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Departments of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Departments of Pathology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Departments of Oncology Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Seidman Cancer Center, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Oncology, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.', 'Hematology/Medical Oncology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Hematology/Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida.', 'Hematology/Medical Oncology, Northwestern University School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Hematology/Oncology, Oncology Hematology Care, Inc, Jewish Hospital, Cincinnati, Ohio.', 'Medicine and Pathology, Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, Hershey, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Hematology, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Hematology/Oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.']",['eng'],"['U10 CA180802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA189859/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA196172/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180795/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180790/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180820/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180794/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180853/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180791/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20181115,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Piperidines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Carboplatin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Flavonoids/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/chemically induced', 'Hematologic Diseases/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Piperidines/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', '*Salvage Therapy/adverse effects', 'Sirolimus/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Topotecan/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/etiology']",PMC6298814,,,2018/10/30 06:00,2019/11/13 06:00,['2018/10/30 06:00'],"['2018/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/21 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/13 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25333 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2019 Jan;94(1):111-117. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25333.

Some patients with AML-MLD have received upfront HCT without prior induction chemotherapy. To compare the transplant outcomes between patients who received upfront HCT and those who received induction chemotherapy followed by allogeneic HCT for AML-MLD, we retrospectively analyzed the Japanese registration data of 1445 adult patients who had received allogeneic HCT between 2007 and 2016. Propensity score matching identified 269 patients in each cohort. There were no significant differences in overall survival between the two groups. The cumulative incidence of leukemia-related mortality was significantly lower in patients who received upfront HCT than those who received induction chemotherapy before HCT. In the subgroup analyses, upfront HCT had a significantly reduced incidence of leukemia-related mortality among patients aged between 60 and 70 years, those with a lower white blood cell count at diagnosis (<3000/muL), and poor cytogenetic risk, and those who received myeloablative conditioning and cord blood transplantation. Our results suggested that induction chemotherapy before HCT did not have any benefits of survival after HCT for AML-MLD. Upfront HCT contributed to the reduced incidence of leukemia-related mortality after HCT. Upfront HCT should be considered for patients with AML-MLD who are eligible for allogeneic HCT.","['Konuma, Takaaki', 'Harada, Kaito', 'Yamasaki, Satoshi', 'Mizuno, Shohei', 'Uchida, Naoyuki', 'Takahashi, Satoshi', 'Onizuka, Makoto', 'Nakamae, Hirohisa', 'Hidaka, Michihiro', 'Fukuda, Takahiro', 'Ohashi, Kazuteru', 'Kohno, Akio', 'Matsushita, Akiko', 'Kanamori, Heiwa', 'Ashida, Takashi', 'Kanda, Junya', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Yano, Shingo']","['Konuma T', 'Harada K', 'Yamasaki S', 'Mizuno S', 'Uchida N', 'Takahashi S', 'Onizuka M', 'Nakamae H', 'Hidaka M', 'Fukuda T', 'Ohashi K', 'Kohno A', 'Matsushita A', 'Kanamori H', 'Ashida T', 'Kanda J', 'Atsuta Y', 'Yano S']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Clinical Research Institute, National Hospital Organization Kyushu Medical Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Aichi Medical University, Nagakute, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Federation of National Public Service Personnel Mutual Aid Associations Toranomon Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Therapy, The Advanced Clinical Research Center, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan.', 'Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization Kumamoto Medical Center, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Centre Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Centre, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, JA Aichi Konan Kosei Hospital, Konan, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kobe City Hospital Organization Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Faculty of Medicine, Kindai University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Japanese Data Center for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Healthcare Administration, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Division of Clinical Oncology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['18ek0510023h0002/Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development,', 'AMED/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181129,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Allografts', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Lineage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Propensity Score', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,,2018/10/30 06:00,2019/11/13 06:00,['2018/10/30 06:00'],"['2018/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/28 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/13 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25336 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2019 Jan;94(1):103-110. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25336.

Despite successful remission induction with classical chemotherapeutics and novel targeted agents, enduring remission is often hampered by disease relapse due to outgrowth of a pre-existing subclone resistant against the treatment. In this study, we show that small glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor deficient CD52-negative B-cell populations are frequently present already at diagnosis in B-ALL patients, but not in patients suffering from other B-cell malignancies. We demonstrate that the GPI-anchor negative phenotype results from loss of mRNA expression of the PIGH gene, which is involved in the first step of GPI-anchor synthesis. Loss of PIGH mRNA expression within these B-ALL cells follows epigenetic silencing rather than gene mutation or deletion. The coinciding loss of CD52 membrane expression may contribute to the development of resistance to alemtuzumab (ALM) treatment in B-ALL patients resulting in the outgrowth of CD52-negative escape variants. Additional treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine may restore expression of CD52 and revert ALM resistance.","['Loeff, Floris C', 'Rijs, Kevin', 'van Egmond, Esther H M', 'Zoutman, Willem H', 'Qiao, Xiaohang', 'Kroes, Wilhelmina G M', 'Veld, Sabrina A J', 'Griffioen, Marieke', 'Vermeer, Maarten H', 'Neefjes, Jacques', 'Frederik Falkenburg, J H', 'Halkes, Constantijn J M', 'Jedema, Inge']","['Loeff FC', 'Rijs K', 'van Egmond EHM', 'Zoutman WH', 'Qiao X', 'Kroes WGM', 'Veld SAJ', 'Griffioen M', 'Vermeer MH', 'Neefjes J', 'Frederik Falkenburg JH', 'Halkes CJM', 'Jedema I']","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Dermatology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Cell Biology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Dermatology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Cell Biology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Chemical Immunology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Doelfonds Leukemie van de Bontius Stichting/International', 'Frank Sanderse Stichting/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181125,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (CD52 Antigen)', '0 (CD52 protein, human)', '0 (Glycosylphosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PIGH protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)']",IM,"['Alemtuzumab/therapeutic use', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'CD52 Antigen/biosynthesis/*deficiency/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'Decitabine/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', '*Gene Silencing', 'Glycosylphosphatidylinositols/biosynthesis/*deficiency/genetics', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*deficiency/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics']",PMC6587464,,,2018/10/30 06:00,2019/11/13 06:00,['2018/10/30 06:00'],"['2018/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/11 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/13 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25337 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2019 Jan;94(1):93-102. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25337.

Lemon juice that is known to play the role of a biocatalyst in various organic reactions was used for this purpose. METHOD: A number of indolofuroquinoxaline derivatives were prepared via the lemon juice mediated condensation of methyl 2-(2-chloro-1H-indol-3-yl)-2-oxoacetate or its N-alkyl derivatives with 1,2- diamines under ultrasound irradiation. All the synthesized compounds were screened via an MTT assay for their potential anticancer properties in vitro using a number of cancer cell lines including MDA-MB 231, and MCF7, K562, Colo-205 and IMR-32 and the non-cancerous HEK293 cell line. Compounds 3a, 3b and 3c showed promising growth inhibition against K562, MDA-MB 231 and MCF7 cell lines but no significant effects on HEK293 cell line suggesting their selectivity towards cancer cells. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Moreover, according to their IC50 values, all these compounds appeared to be relatively more potent towards K562 cell line over MDA-MB 231 and MCF7 cell lines indicating their potential against leukemia.","['Prasanna, Gutta Lakshmi', 'Rao, Bodapati Veera Durga', 'Reddy, Alugubelli Gopi', 'Rao, Mandava V Basaveswara', 'Pal, Manojit']","['Prasanna GL', 'Rao BVD', 'Reddy AG', 'Rao MVB', 'Pal M']","['Department of Chemistry, Krishna University, Machilipatnam-521001, Andhra Pradesh, India.', 'Department of Chemistry, Krishna University, Machilipatnam-521001, Andhra Pradesh, India.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Sana College of Pharmacy, Kodad - 508206, India.', 'Department of Chemistry, Krishna University, Machilipatnam-521001, Andhra Pradesh, India.', ""Dr. Reddy's Institute of Life Sciences, University of Hyderabad Campus, Hyderabad 500046, India.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Mini Rev Med Chem,Mini reviews in medicinal chemistry,101094212,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Quinoxalines)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Carbon-13 Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', '*Citrus', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', '*Fruit and Vegetable Juices', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Quinoxalines/*chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', '*Ultrasonic Waves']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Lemon juice', 'MCF7', 'anticancer', 'antitumor', 'indolofuroquinoxaline', 'ultrasound.']",2018/10/30 06:00,2019/06/25 06:00,['2018/10/30 06:00'],"['2018/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/18 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/25 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['MRMC-EPUB-94045 [pii]', '10.2174/1389557518666181029100044 [doi]']",ppublish,Mini Rev Med Chem. 2019;19(8):671-678. doi: 10.2174/1389557518666181029100044.,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: A systematic review was updated comparing the risk of SMNs in TC patients treated with RAI to TC patients without RAI. Six electronic databases were searched (up to March, 2018), supplemented with a hand search. Two reviewers independently screened citations, reviewed full-text papers, and critically appraised/abstracted data. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted using crude data and data statistically adjusted for confounders. The outcomes were any SMN and specific SMNs for which sufficient data were available. Results: In total, 3506 unique electronic search citations and 93 full-text papers were examined, including 17 studies (3 systematic reviews and 14 original studies). Published knowledge syntheses were limited by inclusion of small numbers of studies, with two systematic reviews suggesting an increased risk of any SMN and one meta-analysis suggesting a reduced risk of breast SMN after RAI treatment. In a meta-analysis of crude data, the risk ratio of any SMN in RAI-treated TC patients was 0.98 ([confidence interval (CI) 0.76-1.27]; n = 10 studies of 65,539 individuals, heterogeneity Q = 64.26, degrees of freedom [df] = 9, p < 0.001, I(2) = 85.99). The pooled risk ratio for any SMN, adjusted for confounders, was 1.16 ([CI 0.97-1.39]; n = 6 studies, data from at least 11,241 TC patients, Q = 10.86, df = 5, p = 0.054, I(2) = 53.96). In secondary analyses examining specific SMNs, although relatively rare, the risk of subsequent leukemia was increased, but the risk of multiple myeloma was reduced in RAI-treated TC patients. There was no significant increased relative risk of breast cancer, salivary cancer, or combined hematologic malignancies according to RAI treatment status. Conclusions: The body of evidence on whether (131)I treatment of thyroid cancer is associated with the primary outcome of any SMN is highly heterogeneous and complex. More research examining the long-term risk of specific SMNs after (131)I treatment is needed.","['Yu, Chi Yun', 'Saeed, Omar', 'Goldberg, Alyse S', 'Farooq, Shafaq', 'Fazelzad, Rouhi', 'Goldstein, David P', 'Tsang, Richard W', 'Brierley, James D', 'Ezzat, Shereen', 'Thabane, Lehana', 'Goldsmith, Charlie H', 'Sawka, Anna M']","['Yu CY', 'Saeed O', 'Goldberg AS', 'Farooq S', 'Fazelzad R', 'Goldstein DP', 'Tsang RW', 'Brierley JD', 'Ezzat S', 'Thabane L', 'Goldsmith CH', 'Sawka AM']","['Medical School, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Endocrinology Fellowship, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Endocrinology, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Library and Information Services, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Endocrine Oncology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence, and Impact, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada.', 'Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence, and Impact, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada.', 'GoldStats Consulting, Simon Fraser University, and University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Department of Endocrinology, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Systematic Review']",20181127,United States,Thyroid,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,9104317,['0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)'],IM,"['Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/*adverse effects', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Risk', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*radiotherapy']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*iodine radioisotopes', '*meta-analysis', '*radioactive iodine', '*subsequent malignant neoplasms', '*systematic review', '*thyroid cancer']",2018/10/30 06:00,2020/06/17 06:00,['2018/10/30 06:00'],"['2018/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/thy.2018.0244 [doi]'],ppublish,Thyroid. 2018 Dec;28(12):1662-1673. doi: 10.1089/thy.2018.0244.

In three CML patients being monitored for urologic diseases, we observed that switching of TKI therapy affected prostate-specific antigen (PSA) titers. Urologists and other medical professionals need to be aware of the potential side-effects of drugs that patients may be receiving for other indications to modify this important prostate diseases indicator. TKIs may affect PSA titers independent of prostate growth or volume. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We followed PSA levels in urology patients who were also undergoing TKI treatment for CML. We determined the effects of nilotinib and imatinib on proliferation, AR and PSA expression in the LNCaP and 22Rv1 prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines using real-time PCR and Western blotting. RESULTS: Clinically, nilotinib and dasatinib reversibly reduced PSA titers compared to imatinib. At high doses nilotinib and imatinib both demonstrated antiproliferative effects in the PCa cells. At low doses expression of AR and PSA was decreased by both drugs, at mRNA and protein levels. Nilotinib exerted greater effects at lower doses than imatinib. CONCLUSIONS: Nilotinib down-regulates serum PSA in patients being treated for non-urological indications, potentially masking a clinical useful marker, we cannot exclude a similar but smaller effect of imatinib. Nilotinib and imatinib both decreased AR and PSA expression in PCa cell lines with the nilotinib effect evident at lower doses. Urologists must appreciate the effects of drugs provided for other diseases on PSA titers and be aware that sudden changes may not reflect underlying prostatic disease.","['Sasaki, Takeshi', 'Franco, Omar E', 'Ohishi, Kohshi', 'Filipovich, Yana', 'Ishii, Kenichiro', 'Crawford, Susan E', 'Takahashi, Naoto', 'Katayama, Naoyuki', 'Sugimura, Yoshiki', 'Hayward, Simon W']","['Sasaki T', 'Franco OE', 'Ohishi K', 'Filipovich Y', 'Ishii K', 'Crawford SE', 'Takahashi N', 'Katayama N', 'Sugimura Y', 'Hayward SW']","['Department of Surgery, NorthShore University HealthSystem, Affiliate of University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine, Evanston, Illinois.', 'Department of Nephro-Urologic Surgery and Andrology, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, NorthShore University HealthSystem, Affiliate of University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine, Evanston, Illinois.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Mie University Hospital, Tsu, Mie, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, NorthShore University HealthSystem, Affiliate of University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine, Evanston, Illinois.', 'Department of Oncologic Pathology, Mie University, Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, NorthShore University HealthSystem, Affiliate of University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine, Evanston, Illinois.', 'Department of Hematology, Nephrology and Rheumatology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, Akita, Akita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, NorthShore University HealthSystem, Affiliate of University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine, Evanston, Illinois.', 'Department of Surgery, NorthShore University HealthSystem, Affiliate of University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine, Evanston, Illinois.']",['eng'],['1R01 DK103483/NH/NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181028,United States,Prostate,The Prostate,8101368,"['0 (AR protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Androgen)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (KLK3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Kallikreins)', 'EC 3.4.21.77 (Prostate-Specific Antigen)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Kallikreins/biosynthesis/*blood/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen/biosynthesis/*blood/genetics', 'Prostatic Hyperplasia/blood', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Androgen/biosynthesis/genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*imatinib', '*nilotinib', '*prostate specific antigen', '*tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2018/10/30 06:00,2019/11/16 06:00,['2018/10/30 06:00'],"['2018/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pros.23730 [doi]'],ppublish,Prostate. 2019 Feb;79(3):259-264. doi: 10.1002/pros.23730.

However, the efficacy of induction chemotherapy before HCT is unclear. We retrospectively analyzed the Japanese registration data of 605 adult patients, who had received allogeneic HCT for advanced MDS between 2001 and 2016, to compare the post-transplant relapse between patients who received induction chemotherapy followed by allogeneic HCT and those who received upfront HCT. Propensity score matching identified 230 patients from each cohort. There were no significant differences in overall survival and non-relapse mortality between the two groups. The cumulative incidence of relapse was significantly higher in patients who received induction chemotherapy than those who received upfront HCT.

The effect of this virus extends to the fact that it causes chronic disease to the spinal cord resulting in loss of sensation and further causes blood cancer. So, to overcome the complications, we designed a subunit vaccine by the assimilation of B-cell, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte , and helper T-lymphocyte epitopes. The epitopes were joined together along with adjuvant and linkers and a vaccine was fabricated which was further subjected to 3D modeling. The physiochemical properties, allergenicity, and antigenicity were evaluated. Molecular docking and dynamics were performed with the obtained 3D model against toll like receptor (TLR-3) immune receptor. Lastly, in silico cloning was performed to ensure the expression of the designed vaccine in pET28a(+) expression vector.

Mastermind-like protein 1 (MAML1) has been functioning as crucial coactivators of Notch receptors and is required for stable formation of Notch transcriptional complexes. However, the mechanism whereby MAML1 induces T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) tumorigenesis is largely unknown. The CCK-8 and flow cytometry assay were performed to examine the effect of MAML1 knockdown on T-ALL cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle. The expression of MAML1, cell cycle, and apoptosis-related gene, as well as TRIM family members and specific protein 1 (SP1) was measured by western blot analysis and qPCR. Our results showed that MAML1 knockdown significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in Jurkat and MOLT-4 cells. Cell cycle and apoptosis-related gene expression, including CDK2, Bcl-2, Bax, and Bad, was modified by the MAML1 knockdown. MAML1 knockdown obviously inhibited the CDK2 and Bcl-2 expression and increased the Bax, p53, and Bad expression. Moreover, the TRIM family members, including TRIM13, TRIM32, TRIM44, and TRIM59, were significantly decreased by the MAML1 knockdown, with the highest decrease detected in TRIM59 expression. Interesting, overexpression of SP1 not only increased the expression of MAML1 and TRIM59, but also promoted the promoter activation of TRIM59. Taken together, knockdown of MAML1 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of T-ALL cells through SP1-dependent inactivation of TRIM59, and therefore suggest that MAML1-SP1-TRIM59 axis may serve as potentially interesting therapeutic targets for treatment of T-ALL.","['Cheng, Hui', 'Chen, Li', 'Hu, Xiaoxia', 'Qiu, Huiying', 'Xu, Xiaoqian', 'Gao, Lei', 'Tang, Gusheng', 'Zhang, Weiping', 'Wang, Jianmin', 'Yang, Jianmin', 'Huang, Chongmei']","['Cheng H', 'Chen L', 'Hu X', 'Qiu H', 'Xu X', 'Gao L', 'Tang G', 'Zhang W', 'Wang J', 'Yang J', 'Huang C']","['Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181028,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (MAML1 protein, human)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Sp1 protein, human)', '0 (TRIM59 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tripartite Motif Proteins)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tripartite Motif Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*MAML1', '*SP1', '*T-ALL', '*TRIM59', '*proliferation and apoptosis']",2018/10/30 06:00,2020/03/17 06:00,['2018/10/30 06:00'],"['2017/10/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.27323 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2019 Apr;234(4):5186-5195. doi: 10.1002/jcp.27323.

RECENT FINDINGS: The introduction of TKIs has changed the natural course of CML and markedly improved patient survival. Over the past decades, many research efforts were devoted to elucidating the leukemogenic mechanisms of BCR-ABL1 and developing novel TKIs. More recent studies have attempted to answer new questions that have emerged in the TKI era, such as the cytogenetic and molecular bases of treatment failure and disease progression, the clinical impact of genetic aberrations in Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive and Ph-negative cells, and the biological significance of Ph secondarily acquired during therapy of other hematological neoplasms. Recent progresses in the understanding of the cytogenetic and molecular mechanisms underlying therapeutic failure and disease progression have improved the risk stratification of CML and will be helpful in the design of novel therapeutic strategies.","['Zhou, Ting', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Hu, Shimin']","['Zhou T', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Hu S']","['Department of Pathology & Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, 1 Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. tingz@bcm.edu.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit 0072, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit 0072, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. shu1@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Additional chromosomal abnormality', '*BCR-ABL1', '*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*Philadelphia chromosome', '*TKI resistance', '*Tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2018/10/30 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2018/10/30 06:00'],"['2018/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-018-0474-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-018-0474-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2018 Dec;13(6):435-445. doi: 10.1007/s11899-018-0474-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations have been detected throughout the extension of the kinase domain of this gene and it is important to investigate their positions because there may be a difference in clinical relevance. Objective: To evaluate mutations in the transcripts of the BCR-ABL1 gene in Brazilian patients with chronic myeloid leukemia under tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment in the Hospital de Clinicas of the Universidade Federal do Parana. Methods: This retrospective observational cross-sectional study analyzed mutation data of BCR-ABL1 gene transcripts. Three hundred and thirty peripheral blood samples from 193 patients were evaluated with the search for mutations being achieved by Sanger sequencing. Results: Sixteen mutation types were identified in 48/193 (24.87%) patients with T315I (20.83%) being the most common. Furthermore, four polymorphisms (T240T, K247R, E275E and Y275Y) were identified. The highest incidence of mutations (19/53: 35.85%) occurred in the P-loop of the tyrosine kinase domain, whereas no mutation was found in the A-loop. In 43/48 (89.58%) patients only one mutation was found and more than one mutation was found in 5/48 (10.42%). The simultaneous presence of two mutations (E189G/V299L and E255K/T315I) was observed in 2/5 patients while the different mutations were seen in sequential samples of the other three patients (Y253Y/T315I, T315I/E255K and E255K/T315I). Conclusions: This molecular characterization contributed to the identification of the resistance profile to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in Brazilian patients, thus enabling the use of adequate therapeutic strategies in a timely manner.","['Costa, Heloisa Zorzi', 'Pereira, Noemi Farah', 'Kaminski, Luciane', 'Pasquini, Ricardo', 'Funke, Vaneuza Araujo Moreira', 'Mion, Ana Lucia Vieira']","['Costa HZ', 'Pereira NF', 'Kaminski L', 'Pasquini R', 'Funke VAM', 'Mion ALV']","['Hospital de Clinicas da Universidade Federal do Parana (HC-UFPR), Curitiba, PR, Brazil.', 'Hospital de Clinicas da Universidade Federal do Parana (HC-UFPR), Curitiba, PR, Brazil.', 'Hospital de Clinicas da Universidade Federal do Parana (HC-UFPR), Curitiba, PR, Brazil.', 'Hospital de Clinicas da Universidade Federal do Parana (HC-UFPR), Curitiba, PR, Brazil.', 'Hospital de Clinicas da Universidade Federal do Parana (HC-UFPR), Curitiba, PR, Brazil.', 'Hospital de Clinicas da Universidade Federal do Parana (HC-UFPR), Curitiba, PR, Brazil.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180611,Brazil,Hematol Transfus Cell Ther,"Hematology, transfusion and cell therapy",101725732,,,,PMC6200712,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1 gene', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Mutation', 'Resistance', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2018/10/30 06:00,2018/10/30 06:01,['2018/10/30 06:00'],"['2017/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.htct.2018.03.005 [doi]', 'S2531-1379(18)30086-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Hematol Transfus Cell Ther. 2018 Oct-Dec;40(4):363-367. doi: 10.1016/j.htct.2018.03.005.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells may also drive functional and phenotypic changes of non-malignant T cells. There are few data about the association between memory T cells and prognosis, especially related to ZAP-70, a common reliable surrogate of the gold standard chronic lymphocytic leukemia prognostic markers. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate whether the expression of ZAP-70 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients is associated with abnormal patterns of the distribution of naive and memory T cells related to crosstalk between these cells. Methods: In this cross-sectional, controlled study, patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia were compared with healthy blood donors regarding the expression of ZAP-70 and the distribution of naive and memory T cell subsets in peripheral blood as measured by flow cytometry. Results: ZAP-70 positive patients presented an increased frequency and absolute number of central memory CD4(+) T cells, but not CD8(+) T cells, compared to ZAP-70 negative patients and age-matched apparently healthy donors. Conclusions: Because central memory CD4(+) T cells are located in lymph nodes and express CD40L, we consider that malignant ZAP-70-positive B cells may receive beneficial signals from central memory CD4(+) T cells as they accumulate, which could contribute to more aggressive disease.","['Correia, Rodolfo Patussi', 'Matos E Silva, Flavia Amoroso', 'Bacal, Nydia Strachman', 'Campregher, Paulo Vidal', 'Hamerschlak, Nelson', 'Amarante-Mendes, Gustavo Pessini']","['Correia RP', 'Matos E Silva FA', 'Bacal NS', 'Campregher PV', 'Hamerschlak N', 'Amarante-Mendes GP']","['Instituto Israelita de Ensino e Pesquisa, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Ciencias Biomedicas, Universidade de Sao Paulo (ICB USP), Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Centro de Hematologia de Sao Paulo (CHSP), Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Instituto Israelita de Ensino e Pesquisa, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Instituto Israelita de Ensino e Pesquisa, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Ciencias Biomedicas, Universidade de Sao Paulo (ICB USP), Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia (INCT), Brazil.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180611,Brazil,Hematol Transfus Cell Ther,"Hematology, transfusion and cell therapy",101725732,,,,PMC6200686,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Memory T cells', 'ZAP-70 protein-tyrosine kinase']",2018/10/30 06:00,2018/10/30 06:01,['2018/10/30 06:00'],"['2017/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.htct.2018.03.008 [doi]', 'S2531-1379(18)30090-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Hematol Transfus Cell Ther. 2018 Oct-Dec;40(4):317-325. doi: 10.1016/j.htct.2018.03.008.

Hyaluronan acid receptors, namely CD168 or the receptor for hyaluronan acid-mediated motility (RHAMM) and CD44 have been implicated in promoting malignancy. There is a lacuna in data on the expression of the receptor in pediatric leukemias. Methods: Pediatric patients with acute leukemia who were diagnosed, treated and followed up in our center were enrolled. The bone marrow biopsies performed prior to treatment were subjected to immunohistochemical staining (54 biopsies: acute lymphoblastic leukemia - 45, acute myeloid leukemia - 9). Blast counts were carried out at diagnosis, end of the induction phase and end of chemotherapy, the minimal residual disease was assessed and follow up details were collected. Positivity was correlated with initial blast count, post-induction blast count, minimal residual disease and patient survival. Results: There was no correlation between the initial blast count and the percentage of blasts with RHAMM expression. The positive correlation between percentage of blasts expressing RHAMM and the post-induction blast count was moderate in acute myeloid leukemia (0.74) and mild in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (0.48). There was a statistically significant difference in RHAMM expression between the two minimal residual disease risk groups (p-value = 0.012) with a negative prognostic effect of RHAMM expression. Moreover, a negative prognostic effect of RHAMM expression was noted when patient survival was considered. Conclusion: This study shows that blasts in acute myeloid leukemia show more RHAMM positivity than those of acute lymphoblastic leukemia indicating the aggressive nature of this type of leukemia. In acute leukemias, patients with high percentages of RHAMM-positive blasts had more post-induction blasts, blasts in minimal residual disease and poorer prognosis.","['Shalini, Chinnathambi Narayanan Sai', 'Suman, Febe Renjitha', 'Jacob, Jerusha Samuela', 'Rajendran, Rithika', 'Scott, Julius Xavier', 'Latha, Magadha Sneha']","['Shalini CNS', 'Suman FR', 'Jacob JS', 'Rajendran R', 'Scott JX', 'Latha MS']","['Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Research Institute, Sri Ramachandra University, Chennai, India.', 'Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Research Institute, Sri Ramachandra University, Chennai, India.', 'Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Research Institute, Sri Ramachandra University, Chennai, India.', 'Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Research Institute, Sri Ramachandra University, Chennai, India.', 'Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Research Institute, Sri Ramachandra University, Chennai, India.', 'Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Research Institute, Sri Ramachandra University, Chennai, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180418,Brazil,Hematol Transfus Cell Ther,"Hematology, transfusion and cell therapy",101725732,,,,PMC6200675,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'CD168', 'Pediatric leukemias', 'RHAMM protein']",2018/10/30 06:00,2018/10/30 06:01,['2018/10/30 06:00'],"['2016/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.htct.2018.01.008 [doi]', 'S2531-1379(18)30058-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Hematol Transfus Cell Ther. 2018 Oct-Dec;40(4):310-316. doi: 10.1016/j.htct.2018.01.008.

The aberrant expression and/or activation of PIM kinases in various cancers follow an isoform-specific pattern. While PIM1 is predominantly expressed in hematological and solid tumors, PIM2 and PIM3 are largely expressed in leukemia and solid tumors, respectively. All of PIM kinases cause transcriptional activation of genes involved in cell survival and cell cycle progression in cancer. A variety of pro-tumorigenic signaling molecules, such as MYC, p21(Cip1/Waf1)/p27(kip1), CDC25, Notch1 and BAD have been identified as the downstream targets of PIM kinases. So far, three kinds of adenosine triphosphate-competitive PIM inhibitors, SGI-1776, AZD1208, and LGH447 have been in clinical trials for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia, prostate cancer, lymphoma, or multiple myeloma. This review sheds light on the signaling pathways involved in the PIM kinase regulation and current status of developing PIM kinase inhibitors as clinical success in combating human cancer.","['Zhang, Xinning', 'Song, Mengqiu', 'Kundu, Joydeb Kumar', 'Lee, Mee-Hyun', 'Liu, Zhen-Zhen']","['Zhang X', 'Song M', 'Kundu JK', 'Lee MH', 'Liu ZZ']","['Department of Breast Surgery, Breast Cancer Center, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Basic Medical College, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'China-US (Henan) Hormel Cancer Institute, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.', 'Basic Medical College, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'China-US (Henan) Hormel Cancer Institute, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Breast Surgery, Breast Cancer Center, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180930,Korea (South),J Cancer Prev,Journal of cancer prevention,101615965,,,,PMC6197848,['NOTNLM'],"['PIM kinase inhibitor', 'PIM signaling pathways', 'Proto-oncogene proteins PIM kinase']",2018/10/30 06:00,2018/10/30 06:01,['2018/10/30 06:00'],"['2018/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/25 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.15430/JCP.2018.23.3.109 [doi]', 'jcp-23-109 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Prev. 2018 Sep;23(3):109-116. doi: 10.15430/JCP.2018.23.3.109.

Complex interactions between the bone marrow microenvironment and hematopoietic stem cells must find a balance between proliferation, differentiation and homeostasis of the stem cell compartment. Changes in this tightly regulated network can provoke malignant transformation, leading to hematopoietic diseases. Here we focus on acute myeloid leukemia (AML), since this is the most frequent acute leukemia in adulthood with very poor overall survival rates and where relapse after chemotherapy continues to be a major challenge, driving demand for new therapeutic strategies. Current research is focusing on the identification of specific interactions between leukemic blasts and their niche components, which may be exploited as novel treatment targets along with induction chemotherapy. Significant progress has been gained over the last few years in the field of high-resolution imaging. Confocal ex vivo and intravital microscopy have revealed a detailed map of bone marrow structures and components; as well as identifying numerous alterations in the stem cell niche that correspond to disease progression. However, the underlying mechanisms are still not completely understood and due to the complexity, their elucidation remains a challenging. This review discusses the constitution of the AML niche in the bone marrow, the improvement in visualization of the complex three-dimensional niche structures and points out new therapeutic strategies to increase the overall survival of AML patients.","['Behrmann, Lena', 'Wellbrock, Jasmin', 'Fiedler, Walter']","['Behrmann L', 'Wellbrock J', 'Fiedler W']","['Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with Section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with Section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation with Section Pneumology, Hubertus Wald University Cancer Center, University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20181012,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC6195156,['NOTNLM'],"['3D confocal microscopy', 'AML', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'angiogenesis', 'bone marrow', 'endothelial cell', 'niche', 'vasculature']",2018/10/30 06:00,2018/10/30 06:01,['2018/10/30 06:00'],"['2018/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/30 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2018.00444 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2018 Oct 12;8:444. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2018.00444. eCollection 2018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Considering the scheduled long-term chemotherapy, bilateral middle meningeal artery (MMA) embolization was performed to prevent recurrence of subdural hemorrhage. Although pancytopenia occurred during the 7 months' follow-up period, residual chronic subdural hemorrhage was absorbed without recurrence.

Recent studies have revealed that posttranslational modifications, such as ubiquitination, regulate NOTCH1 stability, activity, and localization. However, the specific deubiquitinase that affects NOTCH1 protein stability remains unestablished. Here, we report that ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7) can stabilize NOTCH1. USP7 deubiquitinated NOTCH1 in vivo and in vitro, whereas knockdown of USP7 increased the ubiquitination of NOTCH1. USP7 interacted with NOTCH1 protein in T-ALL cells, and the MATH and UBL domains of USP7 were responsible for this interaction. Depletion of USP7 significantly suppressed the proliferation of T-ALL cells in vitro and in vivo, accompanied by downregulation of the NOTCH1 protein level. Similarly, pharmacologic inhibition of USP7 led to apoptosis of T-ALL cells. More importantly, we found that USP7 was significantly upregulated in human T-ALL cell lines and patient samples, and a USP7 inhibitor exhibited cell cytotoxicity toward primary T-ALL cells, indicating the clinical relevance of these findings. Overall, our results demonstrate that USP7 is a novel deubiquitinase that stabilizes NOTCH1. Therefore, USP7 may be a promising therapeutic target in the currently incurable T-ALL.","['Shan, Huizhuang', 'Li, Xiangyun', 'Xiao, Xinhua', 'Dai, Yuting', 'Huang, Jinyan', 'Song, Junjun', 'Liu, Meng', 'Yang, Li', 'Lei, Hu', 'Tong, Yin', 'Zhou, Li', 'Xu, Hanzhang', 'Wu, Yingli']","['Shan H', 'Li X', 'Xiao X', 'Dai Y', 'Huang J', 'Song J', 'Liu M', 'Yang L', 'Lei H', 'Tong Y', 'Zhou L', 'Xu H', 'Wu Y']","['1Hongqiao International Institute of Medicine, Shanghai Tongren Hospital/Faculty of Basic Medicine, Chemical Biology Division of Shanghai Universities E-Institutes, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of the Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025 China.', '1Hongqiao International Institute of Medicine, Shanghai Tongren Hospital/Faculty of Basic Medicine, Chemical Biology Division of Shanghai Universities E-Institutes, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of the Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025 China.', '2Department of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, No.197, Ruijin Er Road, Shanghai, China.', '2Department of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, No.197, Ruijin Er Road, Shanghai, China.', '2Department of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, No.197, Ruijin Er Road, Shanghai, China.', '3Shanghai University of Medicine & Health Sciences, No.279, Zhouzhu Road, Shanghai, China.', '1Hongqiao International Institute of Medicine, Shanghai Tongren Hospital/Faculty of Basic Medicine, Chemical Biology Division of Shanghai Universities E-Institutes, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of the Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025 China.', '1Hongqiao International Institute of Medicine, Shanghai Tongren Hospital/Faculty of Basic Medicine, Chemical Biology Division of Shanghai Universities E-Institutes, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of the Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025 China.', '1Hongqiao International Institute of Medicine, Shanghai Tongren Hospital/Faculty of Basic Medicine, Chemical Biology Division of Shanghai Universities E-Institutes, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of the Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025 China.', ""4Department of Hematology, Shanghai First People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200080 China."", '2Department of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, No.197, Ruijin Er Road, Shanghai, China.', '1Hongqiao International Institute of Medicine, Shanghai Tongren Hospital/Faculty of Basic Medicine, Chemical Biology Division of Shanghai Universities E-Institutes, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of the Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025 China.', '1Hongqiao International Institute of Medicine, Shanghai Tongren Hospital/Faculty of Basic Medicine, Chemical Biology Division of Shanghai Universities E-Institutes, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of the Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025 China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181026,England,Signal Transduct Target Ther,Signal transduction and targeted therapy,101676423,,,,PMC6202415,,,2018/10/30 06:00,2018/10/30 06:01,['2018/10/30 06:00'],"['2018/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/29 00:00 [revised]', '2018/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41392-018-0028-3 [doi]', '28 [pii]']",epublish,Signal Transduct Target Ther. 2018 Oct 26;3:29. doi: 10.1038/s41392-018-0028-3. eCollection 2018.,['ORCID: 0000-0001-7909-8757'],['The authors declare no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When myelonecrosis occurs at the time of presentation, it imposes certain diagnostic issues in sub categorization of leukemias which is necessary for therapeutic as well as prognostic purposes. Flow cytometry, though is a powerful modality, has its own limitations especially when the cells are not fresh and viable; and when the specimen is not of adequate cellularity which is usual in cases of myelonecrosis. In such situations, immunocytochemistry (ICC) or immunohistochemistry (IHC) may play a major role in lineage specification in leukemias as the necrosed marrow with the ghost cells can still retain the antigenicity for certain immunomarkers.

ICC and IHC done on the necrosed marrow contributed to the diagnosis of ALL in all the four cases and contributed to subsequent management.

Even expert morphological evaluation may however, fail to differentiate a benign-versus-malignant etiology without further testing. Automated analyser-derived quantitative data on leukocyte cell populations remain undertested for distinguishing such etiologies. Instrument manufacturers claim that if successful, they may be used to generate software flags that help under-resourced laboratories better triage hemogram specimens requiring further testing. We tested the diagnostic accuracy of volume-conductivity-scatter (VCS) indices together with complete blood count (CBC) parameters in such scenarios. We compared LH780-derived (Beckman Coulter, FL, USA) CBC + VCS parameters from patients with clonal lymphoproliferations (n = 42, including 30 chronic lymphocytic leukemia cases) versus 83 controls with absolute or relative lymphocytosis (derivation cohort). Diagnostic performances of 11 logistic regression equations derived were subsequently evaluated on two specific validation cohorts (n = 130 and n = 1465). Clonal lymphocytoses showed significantly lower hemoglobin and higher leukocyte counts but similar lymphocyte percentages (LY %) vis-a-vis controls. The most significant, albeit overlapping predictor of clonality was the absolute lymphocyte count, LY# (47.8 +/- 48.4 x 10(9)/L vs. 2.9 +/- 1.4 x 10(9)/L in clonal vs. benign cases). In eleven logistic regression equations constructed using four combinatorial approaches, only the models with LY# (highest sensitivity/specificity of 99.3%/100%) and the lymphocytic VCS parameters alone (highest sensitivity/specificity of 76.2%/90.2%) performed consistently in both validation cohorts. Lymphocytic VCS parameters were moderately successful in distinguishing benign-versus-malignant lymphocytes. Other approaches of CBC-plus-VCS parameters did not sustain their initial excellent performances in the validation cohorts, highlighting a need for careful appraisal and better standardization of automated cellular analysis technologies.","['Rastogi, Pulkit', 'Sharma, Prashant', 'Varma, Neelam', 'Sukhachev, Dmitry', 'Kaushal, Naveen', 'Bihana, Ishwar', 'Sachdeva, Man Updesh Singh', 'Naseem, Shano', 'Malhotra, Pankaj']","['Rastogi P', 'Sharma P', 'Varma N', 'Sukhachev D', 'Kaushal N', 'Bihana I', 'Sachdeva MUS', 'Naseem S', 'Malhotra P']","['1Department of Hematology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Level 5, Research Block A, Sector 12, Chandigarh, 160012 India.0000 0004 1767 2903grid.415131.3', '1Department of Hematology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Level 5, Research Block A, Sector 12, Chandigarh, 160012 India.0000 0004 1767 2903grid.415131.3', '1Department of Hematology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Level 5, Research Block A, Sector 12, Chandigarh, 160012 India.0000 0004 1767 2903grid.415131.3', 'LabTech Manpower Ltd, Saint Petersburg, Russia.', '3Department of Biophysics, Panjab University, Chandigarh, India.0000 0001 2174 5640grid.261674.0', '1Department of Hematology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Level 5, Research Block A, Sector 12, Chandigarh, 160012 India.0000 0004 1767 2903grid.415131.3', '1Department of Hematology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Level 5, Research Block A, Sector 12, Chandigarh, 160012 India.0000 0004 1767 2903grid.415131.3', '1Department of Hematology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Level 5, Research Block A, Sector 12, Chandigarh, 160012 India.0000 0004 1767 2903grid.415131.3', '4Adult Clinical Hematology Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.0000 0004 1767 2903grid.415131.3']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180120,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,,PMC6186258,['NOTNLM'],"['Automated hematology analysers', 'Leukocyte cell population data', 'Logistic regression equations', 'Lymphocytosis', 'Lymphoproliferative disorders', 'Volume-conductivity-scatter']",2018/10/30 06:00,2018/10/30 06:01,['2018/10/30 06:00'],"['2017/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-018-0921-5 [doi]', '921 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2018 Oct;34(4):623-631. doi: 10.1007/s12288-018-0921-5.

It comprises a wide spectrum of genetic lesions affecting primarily the cytokine receptor and/or kinase signalling genes. It accounts for approximately 10-15% of pediatric ALL, and is more common in patients who are high-risk according to the National Cancer Institute criteria. Presence of Ph-like mutations is an independent predictor of poor outcome. However, there is vast potential to utilize targeted therapy to improve survival in this group. The sizeable range of genetic lesions varying from translocations, fusions, point mutations and deletions make the diagnosis challenging. Hence, a practical and cost effective approach is required to enable identification in resource constrained settings. Patients with recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities such as ETV6-RUNX1, high hyperdiploidy, TCF3-PBX1, BCR-ABL1 and KMT2A (MLL) rearrangement need not be tested, as these are mutually exclusive with BCR-ABL like mutations. Detection of CRLF2 overexpression, which is the commonest abnormality, is employed as the first step. In patients lacking overexpression, testing for tyrosine kinase fusions can be performed. However, the goal should be to employ a combination of molecular diagnostic techniques such as reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real time quantitative PCR, fluorescence in situ hybridization and Sanger sequencing to detect genetic lesions that are amenable to targeted therapy.","['Totadri, Sidharth', 'Singh, Minu', 'Trehan, Amita', 'Varma, Neelam', 'Bhatia, Prateek']","['Totadri S', 'Singh M', 'Trehan A', 'Varma N', 'Bhatia P']","['1Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Advanced Pediatrics Center, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.0000 0004 1767 2903grid.415131.3', '1Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Advanced Pediatrics Center, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.0000 0004 1767 2903grid.415131.3', '1Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Advanced Pediatrics Center, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.0000 0004 1767 2903grid.415131.3', '2Department of Hematology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.0000 0004 1767 2903grid.415131.3', '1Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Advanced Pediatrics Center, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.0000 0004 1767 2903grid.415131.3']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180801,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,,PMC6186230,['NOTNLM'],"['Copy number anomalies', 'High risk ALL', 'IKAROS', 'MLPA', 'Precision medicine']",2018/10/30 06:00,2018/10/30 06:01,['2018/10/30 06:00'],"['2018/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-018-0997-y [doi]', '997 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2018 Oct;34(4):595-601. doi: 10.1007/s12288-018-0997-y.

Toxic reactions may occur when patients use high-dose MTX (HD-MTX), but the correlation between its toxicity and concentration in adults is controversial. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between MTX concentration and renal function, as well as to assess toxic reactions to MTX in Chinese adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective study enrolled 97 patients who had been diagnosed with ALL or NHL, and who were treated at the Hemopathology Department of Shanghai Changhai Hospital from January 2015 to June 2016. RESULTS Forty-one (27.5%) episodes of elimination delay were observed. We found negative correlations between creatinine clearance rate before MTX infusion and the plasma concentrations of MTX at 36 h after MTX infusion (P=0.005). The serum creatinine at 48 h and plasma concentrations of MTX at 48 h and72 h were significantly and positively correlated (both p=0.000). High blood concentration of MTX was positively associated with nephrotoxicity > grade 1 (P<0.01). Infection > grade 1 was more likely to occur if a patient had high MTX levels at 36 h,48 h, and 72 h (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS Our results show that renal function is associated with MTX concentration, and high MTX concentration can predict the occurrence of renal toxicity and infection related to MTX.","['Yang, Yunyun', 'Wang, Xuebin', 'Tian, Jing', 'Wang, Zhuo']","['Yang Y', 'Wang X', 'Tian J', 'Wang Z']","['Department of Pharmacy, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China (mainland).', 'Department of Pharmacy, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China (mainland).', 'Department of Pharmacy, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China (mainland).', 'Department of Pharmacy, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China (mainland).']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181029,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Asians', 'China', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney/*drug effects', 'Kidney Function Tests', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/metabolism', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects/analysis/blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Renal Insufficiency', 'Retrospective Studies']",PMC6216510,,,2018/10/30 06:00,2019/01/08 06:00,['2018/10/30 06:00'],"['2018/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/08 06:00 [medline]']","['912999 [pii]', '10.12659/MSM.912999 [doi]']",epublish,Med Sci Monit. 2018 Oct 29;24:7719-7726. doi: 10.12659/MSM.912999.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MS of paranasal sinus origin is extremely rare. We report an uncommon case of sinonasal MS associated with AML, who was successfully treated with hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. A 39-year-old male was admitted with complaints of left nasal obstruction and proptosis. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging identified a left ethmoidal mass involving the maxillary sinus, the orbit, and the skull base. Nasal endoscopic examination detected a whitish homogeneous mass occupying the left nasal cavity. Although accumulation of atypical lymphocytes was suspected based on initial pathological inspection, immunohistochemical analysis showed myeloperoxidase-positive myeloid cells. Together with concomitant leukocytosis (149,000/microL) composed of myeloid blast cells and excess of myeloblasts in the bone marrow, the patient was diagnosed as sinonasal MS with AML with maturation (French-American-British Classification M2). The patient was treated by chemotherapy (remission induction therapy with daunorubicin and cytarabine; salvage chemotherapy with high-dose cytarabine), radiotherapy (30 Gy in 10 fractions) and allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, and followed up for 12 months with no recurrence. Early diagnosis is critical for the best improvement of MS. MS of the paranasal sinuses may easily be misdiagnosed as malignant lymphoma or poorly differentiated carcinoma. Prompt hematological and immunohistological investigations with suspicion of MS are essential for correct diagnosis. Furthermore, we concisely review nine previously reported patients with MS and indicate the importance of hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation for good prognosis.","['Suzuki, Jun', 'Harazaki, Yoriko', 'Morita, Shinkichi', 'Kaga, Yoshiko', 'Nomura, Kazuhiro', 'Sugawara, Mitsuru', 'Katori, Yukio']","['Suzuki J', 'Harazaki Y', 'Morita S', 'Kaga Y', 'Nomura K', 'Sugawara M', 'Katori Y']","['Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Tohoku University School of Medicine.', 'Department of Otolaryngology, Tohoku Kosai Hospital.', 'Department of Hematology, Miyagi Cancer Center.', 'Department of Head and Neck Surgery, Miyagi Cancer Center.', 'Department of Clinical Lavoratory, Miyagi Cancer Center.', 'Department of Otolaryngology, Tohoku Rosai Hospital.', 'Department of Otolaryngology, Tohoku Kosai Hospital.', 'Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Tohoku University School of Medicine.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Japan,Tohoku J Exp Med,The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,0417355,,IM,"['Adult', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/diagnostic imaging/*pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Paranasal Sinuses/diagnostic imaging/*pathology', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/*complications/diagnostic imaging/*pathology', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",,['NOTNLM'],"['diagnosis', 'hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation', 'myeloid sarcoma', 'nose', 'paranasal sinus']",2018/10/30 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/10/30 06:00'],"['2018/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1620/tjem.246.141 [doi]'],ppublish,Tohoku J Exp Med. 2018 Oct;246(2):141-146. doi: 10.1620/tjem.246.141.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: The expression levels of Notch1, Notch2, Notch3, Notch4, Hes1 in bone marrow CD34(+) cells from 24 cases of untreated AML (AML group) and 9 healthy controls (control group) were determined by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) . Recombinant hD1R protein was first induced and purified. Bone marrow CD34(+) cells were co-cultured on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) supplemented with a cocktail containing 5 types of human cytokines (5GF) and soluble hD1R. The cultured cells were tested under different culture conditions including PBS group (PBS replaces HUVEC) , hD1R group, 5GF group, GSI group (hD1R plus GSI) . Proliferation and apoptosis of cultured cells were also analyzed. Real time quantitative PCR was used to test the expression levels of Hes1 and Bcl-2 in cultured cells. Results: The expression levels of Notch1 and Hes1 in primary AML patients were significantly lower, and Notch4 expression was higher compared to the control group (P<0.05) . Cell counting showed a remarkable decrease of AML cells number in the culture with hD1R compared with that in the PBS group[ (0.74+/-0.13) x10(5) vs (2.16+/-0.21) x10(5), P<0.01]. FACS analysis showed that the percentage of AML cells was (18.48+/-2.51) % in apoptosis, which was higher than that of control cells (3.19+/-0.58) % after co-culture with hD1R. AML cells in the hD1R group underwent significantly increased apoptosis compared with those in the PBS one (P<0.05) . Moreover, apoptosis of AML cells in the GSI group was lower than that in the hD1R one (P<0.05) . Apoptosis in the PBS group also decreased compared with that in the 5GF one (P<0.05) . Finally, hD1R up-regulated Hes1 expression and inhibited Bcl-2 one in the AML cells. Conclusion: hD1R effectively activated Notch signaling and down-regulated Bcl-2 mRNA in AML cells, which lead to cell apoptosis.","['Tian, D M', 'Liang, Y M', 'Zhang, Y Q']","['Tian DM', 'Liang YM', 'Zhang YQ']","[""Department of Hematology, The 309th Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing 100091, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The 309th Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing 100091, China.""]",['chi'],['81400075/National Natural Science Foundation of China'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (Receptors, Notch)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Receptors, Notch', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC7348280,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Cell proliferation', 'Leukemia, myeloid, acute', 'Notch signals', 'hD1R protein']",2018/10/30 06:00,2019/03/06 06:00,['2018/10/30 06:00'],"['2018/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2018.10.011 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2018 Oct 14;39(10):845-850. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2018.10.011.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: The clinical data of 34 AML patients with FLT3-ITD and MLL gene rearrangement was compared and analyzed for the therapeutic efficacy, prognostic factors when treated with chemotherapy, chemotherapy combined with targeted therapy or allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Results: Of the thirty-four cases with median age 41 (4-71) years old, 63.6% presented with white blood cells (WBC) greater than 30x10(9)/L, 39.4% greater than 50 x 10(9)/L respectively on admission. M(5) (35.3%) made up the highest proportion. The cytogenetic abnormality reached 61.8%, of which the complex cytogenetic abnormality accounted for 11.8%. Eleven patients (32.35%) had both FLT3-ITD and MLL gene abnormalities. In addition to FLT3 and MLL abnormalities, 23 patients (67.6%) had one or more other gene abnormalities (multiple gene abnormalities). Of the 34 cases, 29.4% patients went into complete remission (CR) after two courses of chemotherapy. 20.6% (7 patients) went into CR after 3 or more courses of chemotherapy. The rate of early relapse in the CR group was 52.9%. Patients with WBC>50x10(9)/L or multiple gene abnormalities had a lower remission rate (7.7%, 5.4%) after two courses of chemotherapy. CR rate for the patients with more than three gene abnormalities was 0. The total 2-year overall survival (OS) in the 34 patients was 28.8% (95% CI 13.5%-46.0%) and the disease-free survival (DFS) was 27.1% (95% CI 12.5%-44.0%). Of the 18 patients treated with chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy combined with targeted therapy, 17 cases died within 2 years and 1 lost follow-up after giving up treatment. For the 16 patients received allo-HSCT, the 3-year OS was 43.4% (95% CI 13.7%-70.4%) and DFS 42.7% (95% CI 13.4%-69.7%). Conclusion: AML patients with FLT3-ITD and MLL gene rearrangement often presented with M(5), accompanied by hyperleukocytosis, cytogenetic or multiple gene abnormalities.

Methods: A total of 42 patients with newly diagnosed MDS-EB and AML-MRC from May 2011 to March 2017 were included in the retrospective study. 21 cases were initially treated with G-CSF for priming, in combination with cytarabine of 10 mg/m(2) q12h for 14 days and aclarubicin of 20 mg/d for 4 days (CAG regimen) and the other 21 cases were initially treated with decitabine of 20 mg/m(2) for 5 days and lower-dose CAG regimen (cytarabine of 10 mg/m(2) q12h for 7 days, aclarubicin of 10 mg/d for 4 days, and G-CSF for priming (D-CAG regimen). After two cycles of induction chemotherapy, the patients who obtained complete remission(CR) received consolidation chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Results: Among a total of 42 patients, the median age was 52.5 years (18-65 years) and 64.3% of them were male. Baseline characteristics of patients between D-CAG group and CAG group showed no significant differences. The CR for patients in D-CAG group was 81.0% (17/21), compared to 52.4% (11/21) in CAG group after 2 cycles of therapy (chi(2)=3.857, P=0.050). The overall response rate (ORR) for patients in D-CAG group and CAG group was 85.7% (18/21) and 76.2% (15/21) respectively, without significant difference (chi(2)=1.273, P=0.259). By December 2017, the median follow-up of D-CAG group and CAG group was 13(6-32) months and 15(2-36) months respectively. Finally, 10 patients in D-CAG group and 7 patients in CAG group received HSCT respectively. Except patients receiving HSCT, the median leukemia-free survival (LFS) time for patients in D-CAG group and CAG group was 18.0 (95%CI 6.6-29.4) months and 11.0 (95%CI 0-23.9) months respectively. Probabilities of 12 months LFS for D-CAG group and CAG group were (63.6+/-14.5)% and (50.0+/-13.4)% respectively, without difference (chi(2)=0.049, P=0.824). Except patients receiving HSCT, there were 2 deaths in D-CAG group and 7 deaths in CAG group respectively. The cumulative probabilities of 12 months OS for non-HSCT patients in D-CAG group and CAG group were (90.9+/-8.7)% and (61.5+/-13.5)% respectively, without significant difference (chi(2)=1.840, P=0.175). The incidences of side effects between D-CAG group and CAG group did not show significant differences (P=0.479), and the main side effects included cytopenias, pneumonia, infections of skin and soft tissues, neutropenic patients with fever, liver dysfunction. Conclusion: The decitabine in combination with lower-dose CAG regimen improved CR for patients with MDS-EB and AML-MRC, and was a promising choice.","['Liu, J', 'Jia, J S', 'Gong, L Z', 'Lu, S Y', 'Zhu, H H', 'Huang, X J', 'Jiang, H']","['Liu J', 'Jia JS', 'Gong LZ', 'Lu SY', 'Zhu HH', 'Huang XJ', 'Jiang H']","[""Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['chi'],['Z181100001718126/Capital Characteristic Clinic Project Foundation'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)']",IM,"['Aclarubicin', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Decitabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC7342258,['NOTNLM'],"['CAG regimen', 'D-CAG regimen', 'Myelodysplastic syndromes', 'Treatment outcome']",2018/10/30 06:00,2019/03/06 06:00,['2018/10/30 06:00'],"['2018/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2018.09.006 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2018 Sep 14;39(9):734-738. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2018.09.006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They were received ALL-2005/2009 protocol following up to December 31(st) 2016. The clinical characteristics, outcomes and the prognostic analysis were evaluated between the two protocols. Results: Totally, 237 patients were involved in the study, 76 cases for ALL-2005 and 161 cases for ALL-2009 protocol. Complete remission (CR) after induction therapy was 94.5%. 64 (28.6%) patients relapsed with a median time of 14.5 months and 70 (29.5%) patients passed away during the following time. In long-term follow-up, the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and 5-year overall survival (OS) of ALL patients were (63.1+/-3.3)% and (68.4+/-3.2)%. The 7-year EFS and OS were (61.0+/-3.5)% and (67.6+/-3.3)%.The 5-year EFS of intermediate risk group in ALL-2005 and ALL-2009 protocol were (73.6+/-6.1)% and (71.7+/-4.3)% with no difference (chi(2)=0.064, P=0.801). The 5-year EFS of high risk group in two protocols were (27.6+/-9.6)% and (33.9+/-9.3)%, showing no significant difference (chi(2)=0.296, P=0.586). Five years relapsed rate of two protocols were (33.8+/-5.7)% and (32.6+/-4.1)% with no difference (chi(2)=0.055, P=0.815). The mortalities were 36.8% and 29.8% separately (chi(2)=2.869, P=0.090). Univariate analysis indicated that age, male, risk, BCR/ABL translocation/t(9;22) and resistant to induction were risk prognostic factors in long-term survival (chi(2)=4.764, 4.796, 46.410, 9.560, 25.450; P=0.029, 0.029, <0.001, 0.049, <0.001).

Conclusion: Protocol ALL-2009 enhanced the chemotherapy intensity in intermediate risk group with no benefit of survival. BCR-ABL fusion or t(9;22) translocation was still the risk factor of prognosis. TKI inhibitor used in these patients could improve survival.

The anti-C-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) antibody mogamulizumab (moga) reduces ATL cells and induces reconstitution of polyclonal T cells; however, ATL cases often remain resistant and moga sometimes causes fatal immunopathology. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-related B-cell lymphoma develops in severely immunocompromised subjects, and is particularly associated with impaired T-cell immunity. Here, we report an ATL patient who had received conventional chemotherapy plus moga, and subsequently developed EBV-related diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) of the central nervous system. Next-generation sequencing-based T-cell receptor repertoire analyses identified residual abnormal clones and revealed that reconstitution of polyclonal T cells was incomplete, even after moga treatment. Furthermore, a skin rash that developed after moga treatment was found to contain ATL clones. This case suggests that the limited therapeutic effects of moga and incomplete T-cell reconstitution are associated with severely impaired T-cell immunity and subsequent development of EBV-related DLBCL.","['Kamachi, Kazuharu', 'Shindo, Takero', 'Miyahara, Masaharu', 'Kitaura, Kazutaka', 'Akashi, Michiaki', 'Shin-I, Tadasu', 'Suzuki, Ryuji', 'Oshima, Koichi', 'Kimura, Shinya']","['Kamachi K', 'Shindo T', 'Miyahara M', 'Kitaura K', 'Akashi M', 'Shin-I T', 'Suzuki R', 'Oshima K', 'Kimura S']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Karatsu Red Cross Hospital, Karatsu, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan. takeros@kuhp.kyoto-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, 54 Kawahara-cho, Shogo-in, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan. takeros@kuhp.kyoto-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Karatsu Red Cross Hospital, Karatsu, Japan.', 'Repertoire Genesis Inc, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Karatsu Red Cross Hospital, Karatsu, Japan.', 'BITS Co.

Its aberrant expression and activity have been detected in lymphomas, leukemias, and solid tumors. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) increased expression of alternatively spliced AID variants has been documented. We used real-time RT-PCR to quantify the expression of AID and its alternatively spliced transcripts (AIDDeltaE4a, AIDDeltaE4, AIDivs3, and AIDDeltaE3E4) in 149 CLL patients and correlated this expression to prognostic markers including recurrent chromosomal aberrations, the presence of complex karyotype, mutation status of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene, and recurrent mutations. We report a previously unappreciated association between higher AID transcript levels and trisomy of chromosome 12. Functional analysis of AID splice variants revealed loss of their activity with respect to SHM, CSR, and induction of double-strand DNA breaks. In silico modeling provided insight into the molecular interactions and structural dynamics of wild-type AID and a shortened AID variant closely resembling AIDDeltaE4, confirming its loss-of-function phenotype.","['Zaprazna, Kristina', 'Reblova, Kamila', 'Svobodova, Veronika', 'Radova, Lenka', 'Bystry, Vojtech', 'Baloun, Jiri', 'Durechova, Kristina', 'Tom, Nikola', 'Loja, Tomas', 'Buresova, Martina', 'Stranska, Kamila', 'Oltova, Alexandra', 'Doubek, Michael', 'Atchison, Michael L', 'Trbusek, Martin', 'Malcikova, Jitka', 'Pospisilova, Sarka']","['Zaprazna K', 'Reblova K', 'Svobodova V', 'Radova L', 'Bystry V', 'Baloun J', 'Durechova K', 'Tom N', 'Loja T', 'Buresova M', 'Stranska K', 'Oltova A', 'Doubek M', 'Atchison ML', 'Trbusek M', 'Malcikova J', 'Pospisilova S']","['Central European Institute of Technology, Center of Molecular Medicine, Masaryk University, Kamenice 5/A35, 625 00, Brno, Czech Republic. kzaprazna@gmail.com.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Center of Molecular Medicine, Masaryk University, Kamenice 5/A35, 625 00, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Center of Molecular Medicine, Masaryk University, Kamenice 5/A35, 625 00, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Center of Molecular Medicine, Masaryk University, Kamenice 5/A35, 625 00, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Center of Molecular Medicine, Masaryk University, Kamenice 5/A35, 625 00, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Center of Molecular Medicine, Masaryk University, Kamenice 5/A35, 625 00, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine -

To study which genetic and phenotypic factors predict clinical outcomes for Japanese FA patients, we examined the FA genes, bone marrow karyotype, and aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH2) genotype; variants of which are associated with accelerated progression of BMF in FA. In 88 patients, we found morphologic MDS/AML in 33 patients, including refractory cytopenia in 16, refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) in 7, and AML in 10. The major mutated FA genes observed in this study were FANCA (n = 52) and FANCG (n = 23). The distribution of the ALDH2 variant alleles did not differ significantly between patients with mutations in FANCA and FANCG. However, patients with FANCG mutations had inferior BMF-free survival and received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) at a younger age than those with FANCA mutations. In FANCA, patients with the c.2546delC mutation (n = 24) related to poorer MDS/AML-free survival and a younger age at HSCT than those without this mutation. All patients with RAEB/AML had an abnormal karyotype and poorer prognosis after HSCT; specifically, the presence of a structurally complex karyotype with a monosomy (n = 6) was associated with dismal prognosis. In conclusion, the best practice for a clinician may be to integrate the morphological, cytogenetic, and genetic data to optimize HSCT timing in Japanese FA patients.","['Yabe, Miharu', 'Koike, Takashi', 'Ohtsubo, Keisuke', 'Imai, Eri', 'Morimoto, Tsuyoshi', 'Takakura, Hiromitsu', 'Koh, Katsuyoshi', 'Yoshida, Kenichi', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Ito, Etsuro', 'Okuno, Yusuke', 'Muramatsu, Hideki', 'Kojima, Seiji', 'Matsuo, Keitaro', 'Mori, Minako', 'Hira, Asuka', 'Takata, Minoru', 'Yabe, Hiromasa']","['Yabe M', 'Koike T', 'Ohtsubo K', 'Imai E', 'Morimoto T', 'Takakura H', 'Koh K', 'Yoshida K', 'Ogawa S', 'Ito E', 'Okuno Y', 'Muramatsu H', 'Kojima S', 'Matsuo K', 'Mori M', 'Hira A', 'Takata M', 'Yabe H']","['Department of Cell Transplantation and Regenerative Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, 143 Shimokasuya, Isehara, Kanagawa, 259-1193, Japan. miharu@is.icc.u-tokai.ac.jp.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Saitama Children's Medical Center, Saitama, Japan."", 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine, Hirosaki, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular and Clinical Epidemiology, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Laboratory of DNA Damage Signaling, Department of Late Effects Studies, Radiation Biology Center, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Laboratory of DNA Damage Signaling, Department of Late Effects Studies, Radiation Biology Center, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Laboratory of DNA Damage Signaling, Department of Late Effects Studies, Radiation Biology Center, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Cell Transplantation and Regenerative Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, 143 Shimokasuya, Isehara, Kanagawa, 259-1193, Japan.']",['eng'],"['H21-061/Research Grants for Intractable Diseases from the Japanese Ministry of', 'Health, Labor, and Welfare', 'H24-025/Research Grants for Intractable Diseases from the Japanese Ministry of', 'Health, Labor, and Welfare', 'H23-012/Research Grants for Intractable Diseases from the Japanese Ministry of', 'Health, Labor, and Welfare']",['Journal Article'],20181027,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (FANCA protein, human)', '0 (FANCG protein, human)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group A Protein)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group G Protein)', 'EC 1.2.1.3 (ALDH2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.2.1.3 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase, Mitochondrial)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aldehyde Dehydrogenase, Mitochondrial/*genetics/metabolism', 'Alleles', 'Allografts', 'Asians', '*Base Sequence', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Fanconi Anemia/enzymology/*genetics/*mortality/therapy', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group A Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group G Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', '*Genotype', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Male', '*Sequence Deletion', 'Survival Rate']",,['NOTNLM'],"['ALDH2', 'Cytogenetic abnormalities', 'FA gene', 'Fanconi anemia', 'Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation']",2018/10/29 06:00,2019/01/29 06:00,['2018/10/29 06:00'],"['2018/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/29 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-018-3517-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-018-3517-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2019 Feb;98(2):271-280. doi: 10.1007/s00277-018-3517-0.

At registration, 481 patients had ANA treatment without HC exposure, 2305 had HC without ANA exposure, and 674 had been exposed to both.

SIRs for AML were high in HC-treated patients, but AML was rare in ANA-treated patients; no cases of AML were found in patients only treated with ANA. No statistically significant difference was seen between SIRs for ANA and HC treatment for AML or skin cancer. SIRs for other cancers were similar in the HC and ANA groups and close to 1, indicating little difference in risk.

Though miR-139-5p was reported to be a potent tumor suppressor in adult AML, its underlying molecular mechanism in AML remains to be further defined. Herein, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analysis were conducted to determine the expressions of miR-139-5p and tetraspanin3 (Tspan3) in AML patients and cells. Luciferase reporter assay, qRT-PCR, and Western blot analysis were carried out to detect the interaction between miR-139-5p and Tspan3. Cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution, invasion, and migration were evaluated by cell counting kit-8, flow cytometry, transwell invasion, and migration assays, respectively. Western blot analysis was conducted to determine phosphorylated-protein kinase B (Akt) and Akt levels. We found that a significant reduction in miR-139-5p expression and a prominent increase in Tspan3 expression were observed in AML patients and cells. Tspan3 was confirmed as a direct target of miR-139-5p and was negatively modulated by miR-139-5p. Rescue experiments showed that overexpression of miR-139-5p constrained cell proliferation, invasion and migration capabilities, and induced cell cycle arrest at the S phase in AML cells, which were partially reversed by Tspan3 overexpression. In addition, we found that miR-139-5p suppressed the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway in AML cells by targeting Tspan3. In conclusion, our study concluded that miR-139-5p suppressed the leukemogenesis in AML cells by targeting Tspan3 through inactivation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, providing a better understanding of AML progression.","['Zhang, Ronghui', 'Tang, Ping', 'Wang, Fang', 'Xing, Ying', 'Jiang, Zhongxing', 'Chen, Shaoqian', 'Meng, Xiaoli', 'Liu, Linxiang', 'Cao, Weijie', 'Zhao, Huayan', 'Ma, Ping', 'Chen, Yanli', 'An, Chao', 'Sun, Ling']","['Zhang R', 'Tang P', 'Wang F', 'Xing Y', 'Jiang Z', 'Chen S', 'Meng X', 'Liu L', 'Cao W', 'Zhao H', 'Ma P', 'Chen Y', 'An C', 'Sun L']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Academy of Medical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181026,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (MIRN139 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tetraspanins)', '0 (Tspan3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Cell Proliferation', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'THP-1 Cells', 'Tetraspanins/genetics/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', '*leukemogenesis', '*miR-139-5p', '*tetraspanin3 (Tspan3)', '*the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway']",2018/10/28 06:00,2020/03/19 06:00,['2018/10/28 06:00'],"['2018/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.27728 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2019 Mar;120(3):4423-4432. doi: 10.1002/jcb.27728.

Clinical features are heterogeneous and although the overall prognosis is poor, survival can vary significantly between individuals. This reflects the need for an individualized treatment approach which incorporates accurate risk stratification. Though numerous prognostic scores exist, newer CMML-specific models incorporating molecular data should be favored. While asymptomatic, low-risk patients should be observed until their disease progresses, the majority of patients will require treatment. Due to a deficiency in treatments with disease-modifying capacity, any patient who requires treatment should be considered for enrollment in clinical trials evaluating novel therapeutic approaches. Allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) remains the only current therapy with the potential to cure the disease and should be considered in most patients with intermediate- to high-risk disease. However, substantial risks are involved and, in part, because of advanced age at diagnosis, a minority of patients are candidates. Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) have become a preferred treatment approach, and should be used in those with cytopenias. Patients presenting with proliferative features can be treated with hydroxyurea to manage their symptoms and control leukocytosis, though HMAs can be incorporated as well, particularly in patients with higher risk disease. HMAs should also be considered in patients with a high burden of disease prior to proceeding with allo-SCT. Induction chemotherapy should be reserved for younger, healthy patients who have transformed to acute myeloid leukemia to induce remission prior to transplant. Supportive care utilizing transfusion support, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, and infection prevention measures should be incorporated into the care of all patients.","['Hunter, Anthony M', 'Zhang, Ling', 'Padron, Eric']","['Hunter AM', 'Zhang L', 'Padron E']","['Malignant Hematology, H.

Although CMML can be cured with allogeneic stem cell transplantation, its prognosis is generally very poor due to the limited efficacy of chemotherapy and to the patient's age, which is usually not eligible for transplantation. Comprehensive analysis of CMML pathophysiology and the development of therapeutic agents have been limited partly due to the lack of cell lines in CMML and the limited developments of mouse models. After successfully establishing patient's derived disease-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from a patient with CMML, we utilized these CMML-iPSCs to achieve hematopoietic re-differentiation in vitro, created a humanized CMML mouse model via teratomas, and developed a drug-testing system. The clinical characteristics of CMML were recapitulated following hematopoietic re-differentiation in vitro and a humanized CMML mouse model in vivo. The drug-testing system using CMML-iPSCs identified a MEK inhibitor, a Ras inhibitor, and liposomal clodronate as potential drugs for treating CMML. Clodronate is a drug commonly used as a bisphosphonate for osteoporosis. In this study, the liposomalization of clodronate enhanced its effectiveness in these assays, suggesting that this variation of clodronate may be adopted as a repositioned drug for CMML therapy.","['Taoka, Kazuki', 'Arai, Shunya', 'Kataoka, Keisuke', 'Hosoi, Masataka', 'Miyauchi, Masashi', 'Yamazaki, Sho', 'Honda, Akira', 'Aixinjueluo, Wei', 'Kobayashi, Takashi', 'Kumano, Keiki',

We previously showed that coexpression of mutant ASXL1 and SETBP1 in hematopoietic progenitor cells induced downregulation of TGFbeta pathway genes and promoted the development of MDS/AML in a mouse model of bone marrow transplantation. However, whether the repression of TGFbeta pathway in fact contributes to leukaemogenesis remains unclear. Moreover, mechanisms for the repression of TGFbeta pathway genes in ASXL1/SETBP1-mutated MDS/AML cells have not been fully understood. In this study, we showed that expression of a constitutively active TGFbeta type I receptor (ALK5-TD) inhibited leukaemic proliferation of MDS/AML cells expressing mutant ASXL1/SETBP1. We also found aberrantly reduced acetylation of several lysine residues on histone H3 and H4 around the promoter regions of multiple TGFbeta pathway genes. The histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor vorinostat reversed histone acetylation at these promoter regions, and induced transcriptional derepression of the TGFbeta pathway genes. Furthermore, vorinostat showed robust growth-inhibitory effect in cells expressing mutant ASXL1, whereas it showed only a marginal effect in normal bone marrow cells. These data indicate that HDAC inhibitors will be promising therapeutic drugs for MDS and AML with ASXL1 and SETBP1 mutations.","['Saika, Makoto', 'Inoue, Daichi', 'Nagase, Reina', 'Sato, Naru', 'Tsuchiya, Akiho', 'Yabushita, Tomohiro', 'Kitamura, Toshio', 'Goyama, Susumu']","['Saika M', 'Inoue D', 'Nagase R', 'Sato N', 'Tsuchiya A', 'Yabushita T', 'Kitamura T', 'Goyama S']","['Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639, Japan.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639, Japan. kitamura@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639, Japan. goyama@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181026,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Asxl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Setbp1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Smad Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Histones/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Smad Proteins/metabolism', 'Survival Rate', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism', 'Vorinostat/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",PMC6203835,,,2018/10/28 06:00,2019/10/30 06:00,['2018/10/28 06:00'],"['2018/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-018-33881-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-018-33881-2 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2018 Oct 26;8(1):15873. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-33881-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, firstly, our results showed that AC7 affected intracellular cAMP level and influenced ATRA-induced differentiation of APL cells. Secondly, we revealed that miR-192 could directly target AC7 expression and knockdown of miR-192 promoted ATRA-induced APL cell differentiation by regulating AC7 expression. Furthermore, we found that AC7 expression was lower in patients with relapsed APL than that in patients with newly diagnosed APL, while miR-192 expression was relatively higher in patients with relapsed APL. Taken together, our results show that miR-192-mediated AC7 could play important roles in differentiation of APL cells, AC7 and miR-192 might be new biomarkers and therapeutic targets for patients with relapsed APL.","['He, Bing', 'Chang, Yanyan', 'Yang, Chao', 'Zhang, Zhanglin', 'Xu, Guiping', 'Feng, Xianqi', 'Zhuang, Likun']","['He B', 'Chang Y', 'Yang C', 'Zhang Z', 'Xu G', 'Feng X', 'Zhuang L']","[""Department of General Surgery, The First People's Hospital of Tianmen City, Tianmen, 431700, China."", 'Department of Haematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, 266003, China.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, 266003, China.', 'Department of Laboratorial Examination, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, 330006, Nanchang, China.', 'Transfusion Department, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, 400010, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Haematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, 266003, China.

LncRNA metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), a well known protooncogene, has be shown to be upregulated in various tumor types, including multiple myeloma. However, the biological function of MALAT1 in CML remains has yet to be explored. This study was designed to investigate the effects of MALAT1 on the physiological processes in CML and its underlying mechanisms, which will be helpful for us to have a better understanding of CML development and progression as well as improved therapeutic method. METHODS: Recombinant virus construction and infection was performed to overexpress or knockdown the expression of MALAT1. Dual luciferase reporter assay was applied to vetify the interaction between MALAT1 and miR-328. The cell viability and cell cycle were analyzed by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Quantitative real time PCR and western blotting assays were used to measure the expression of genes and proteins. RESULTS: The expression of MALAT1 was significantly increased in CML cells compared with peripheral blood cells from health donors. Silencing of MALAT1 significantly inhibited the proliferation and arrested cell cycle of CML cells by targeting miR-328. Moreover, MALAT1 knockdown enhanced imatinib sensitivity of K562cells, while silencing of miR-328 abolished this effect. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that lncRNA MALAT1/miR-328 axis promotes the proliferation and imatinib resistance of CML cells, providing new perspectives for the future study of MALAT1 as a therapeutic target for CML.","['Wen, Feng', 'Cao, Yi-Xiong', 'Luo, Ze-Yu', 'Liao, Pei', 'Lu, Zhong-Wei']","['Wen F', 'Cao YX', 'Luo ZY', 'Liao P', 'Lu ZW']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of South China, Hengyang, 421001, PR China.

The in vitro PRMT5 inhibitory testing of compound 4b14 revealed an IC50 of 2.71muM, exhibiting high selectivity over PRMT1 and PRMT4 (>70-fold selective). As expected, 4b14 exhibited potent anti-proliferative activity against a panel of leukemia and lymphoma cells, including MV4-11, Pfeiffer, SU-DHL-4 and KARPAS-422. Besides, 4b14 showed significant cell cycle arrest and apoptosis-inducing effects, as well as reduced the cellular symmetric arginine dimethylation level of SmD3 protein. Finally, affinity profiling analysis indicated that hydrophobic interactions, pi-pi stacking and cation-pi actions made the major contributions to the overall binding affinity.

As opposed to chronic myeloid leukemia, B lymphoma or multiple myeloma, AML is one of the rare malignant hemopathies the therapy of which has not significantly improved during the past 30 years despite intense research efforts. One promising approach is to determine metabolic dependencies in AML cells. Moreover, two key metabolic enzymes, isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDH1/2), are mutated in more than 15% of AML patient, reinforcing the interest in studying metabolic reprogramming, in particular in this subgroup of patients. Methods: Using a multi-omics approach combining proteomics, lipidomics, and isotopic profiling of [U-(13)C] glucose and [U-(13)C] glutamine cultures with more classical biochemical analyses, we studied the impact of the IDH1 R132H mutation in AML cells on lipid biosynthesis. Results: Global proteomic and lipidomic approaches showed a dysregulation of lipid metabolism, especially an increase of phosphatidylinositol, sphingolipids (especially few species of ceramide, sphingosine, and sphinganine), free cholesterol and monounsaturated fatty acids in IDH1 mutant cells. Isotopic profiling of fatty acids revealed that higher lipid anabolism in IDH1 mutant cells corroborated with an increase in lipogenesis fluxes. Conclusions: This integrative approach was efficient to gain insight into metabolism and dynamics of lipid species in leukemic cells. Therefore, we have determined that lipid anabolism is strongly reprogrammed in IDH1 mutant AML cells with a crucial dysregulation of fatty acid metabolism and fluxes, both being mediated by 2-HG (2-Hydroxyglutarate) production.","['Stuani, Lucille', 'Riols, Fabien', 'Millard, Pierre', 'Sabatier, Marie', 'Batut, Aurelie', 'Saland, Estelle', 'Viars, Fanny', 'Tonini, Laure', 'Zaghdoudi, Sonia', 'Linares, Laetitia K', 'Portais, Jean-Charles', 'Sarry, Jean-Emmanuel', 'Bertrand-Michel, Justine']","['Stuani L', 'Riols F', 'Millard P', 'Sabatier M', 'Batut A', 'Saland E', 'Viars F', 'Tonini L', 'Zaghdoudi S', 'Linares LK', 'Portais JC', 'Sarry JE', 'Bertrand-Michel J']","['Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, UMR1037, Inserm, Equipe Labellisee LIGUE 2018, F-31037 Toulouse, France. lucille.stuani@inserm.fr.', 'Universite de Toulouse, 31000 Toulouse, France. lucille.stuani@inserm.fr.', 'MetaToul-Lipidomic Core Facility, MetaboHUB, I2 MC, Inserm, 31100 Toulouse, France. fabien.riols@gmail.com.', 'LISBP, Universite de Toulouse, CNRS, INRA, INSA, F-31077 Toulouse, France. pierre.millard@insa-toulouse.fr.', 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, UMR1037, Inserm, Equipe Labellisee LIGUE 2018, F-31037 Toulouse, France. marie.sabatier@inserm.fr.', 'Universite de Toulouse, 31000 Toulouse, France. marie.sabatier@inserm.fr.', 'MetaToul-Lipidomic Core Facility, MetaboHUB, I2 MC, Inserm, 31100 Toulouse, France. aurelie.batut@inserm.fr.', 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, UMR1037, Inserm, Equipe Labellisee LIGUE 2018, F-31037 Toulouse, France. estelle.saland@inserm.fr.', 'Universite de Toulouse, 31000 Toulouse, France. estelle.saland@inserm.fr.', 'MetaToul-Lipidomic Core Facility, MetaboHUB, I2 MC, Inserm, 31100 Toulouse, France. viars.fanny1@gmail.com.', 'Universite de Toulouse, 31000 Toulouse, France. laure.tonini@inserm.fr.', 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, UMR1037, Inserm, Pole Technologique, F-31037 Toulouse, France. laure.tonini@inserm.fr.', 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, UMR1037, Inserm, Equipe Labellisee LIGUE 2018, F-31037 Toulouse, France. sonia.zaghdoudi@inserm.fr.', 'Universite de Toulouse, 31000 Toulouse, France. sonia.zaghdoudi@inserm.fr.', 'Institut de Recherche en Cancerologie de Montpellier, U1194 Inserm, Universite de Montpellier, Equipe Labellisee LIGUE 2017, F-34090 Montpellier, France. laetitia.linares@inserm.fr.', 'Universite de Toulouse, 31000 Toulouse, France. jean-charles.portais@insa-toulouse.fr.', 'MetaToul Core Facility, INSA, LISBP, F-31077 Toulouse, France. jean-charles.portais@insa-toulouse.fr.', 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, UMR1037, Inserm, Equipe Labellisee LIGUE 2018, F-31037 Toulouse, France. jean-emmanuel.sarry@inserm.fr.', 'Universite de Toulouse, 31000 Toulouse, France. jean-emmanuel.sarry@inserm.fr.', 'Universite de Toulouse, 31000 Toulouse, France. justine.bertrand-michel@inserm.fr.', 'MetaToul-Lipidomic Core Facility, MetaboHUB, I2 MC, Inserm, 31100 Toulouse, France. justine.bertrand-michel@inserm.fr.']",['eng'],"['MetaboHUB-ANR-11-INBS-0010/Agence Nationale de la Recherche', 'FLEXAML/Plan Cancer 2014-BioSys']",['Journal Article'],20181025,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Glutarates)', '2889-31-8 (alpha-hydroxyglutarate)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Fatty Acids/*metabolism', 'Glutarates/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/genetics/metabolism', 'Isotope Labeling/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Lipid Metabolism/genetics/*physiology', 'Mutation/genetics']",PMC6274868,['NOTNLM'],"['IDH mutation', 'isotopic profiling', 'leukemia', 'lipidomics', 'metabolic reprogramming']",2018/10/28 06:00,2019/02/05 06:00,['2018/10/28 06:00'],"['2018/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/18 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms19113325 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms19113325 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2018 Oct 25;19(11). pii: ijms19113325. doi: 10.3390/ijms19113325.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-8136-9963', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1661-2119', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9815-1517']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To advance our understanding of the related pathological mechanisms and virus-host interactions, seven previously reported miRNAs were selected for a comparative analysis of miRNA expression between infected and uninfected DF-1cells, including six miRNAs related to tumorigenesis (let-7b/7i, miR-221/222, miR-125b, miR-375 and miR-2127. The results showed that six of the seven miRNAs except gga-miR-375 were upregulated in cells infected with NX0101 (caused myeloma (ML)) and GD1109 (caused hemangioma (HE)) at 1h post infection. On day 2 post-infection, all seven miRNAs were upregulated in infected DF-1cells. On day 6 post-infection, gga-let-7b, gga-miR-125b, and gga-miR-375 were downregulated whereas gga-miR-221 and gga-miR-222 were upregulated in DF-1cells infected with the two ALV-J strains of different phenotypes. However, expression of gga-let-7i was reduced in DF-1cells infected with NX0101 and was increased in those infected with GD1109; gga-miR-2127 expression showed no significant difference between infected and uninfected cells. This study is the first to report the changes in the miRNA expression levels in DF-1cells during the course of ALV-J infection, and suggests a relationship between its pathological mechanisms and miRNAs.","['Ji, Jun', 'Xu, Xin', 'Wang, Xueyu', 'Yao, Lunguang', 'Shang, Huiqin', 'Li, Hongxin', 'Ma, Jingyun', 'Bi, Yingzuo', 'Xie, Qingmei']","['Ji J', 'Xu X', 'Wang X', 'Yao L', 'Shang H', 'Li H', 'Ma J', 'Bi Y', 'Xie Q']","['China-UK-NYNURRes Joint Laboratory of Insect Biology, Nanyang Normal University, Henan, 473061, PR China; Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of Agro-Animal Genomics and Molecular Breeding and Key Lab of Chicken Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, Ministry of Agriculture, Guangzhou, 510642, PR China.

Their wide range of functions includes cell proliferation, cell differentiation, regulation of transcription factors, inflammation, chemotaxis, and angiogenesis. S100 proteins have in several types of cancer proven to be biomarkers for disease progression and prognosis. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a highly heterogeneous and aggressive disease in which immature myeloblasts replace normal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. This review focuses on the S100 protein family members, which commonly are dysregulated in AML, and on the consequences of their dysregulation in the disorder. Like in other cancers, it appears as if S100 proteins are potential biomarkers for leukemogenesis. Furthermore, several S100 members seem to be involved in maintaining the leukemic phenotype. For these reasons, specific S100 proteins might serve as prognostic biomarkers, especially in the patient subset with intermediate/undetermined risk, and as potential targets for patient-adjusted therapy. Because the question of the most suitable candidate S100 biomarkers in AML still is under discussion, because particular AML subgroups lead to specific S100 signatures, and because downstream effects and the significance of co-expression of potential S100 binding partners in AML are not fully elucidated yet, we conclude that a panel of S100 proteins will probably be best suited for prognostic purposes.","['Brenner, Annette K', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Brenner AK', 'Bruserud O']","['Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, P.O.

The inhibition of both targets was confirmed by biochemical and cellular assays as well as X-ray crystal structures of the 20S proteasome and HDAC6 complexed with RTS-V5. Cytotoxicity assays with leukemia and multiple myeloma cell lines as well as therapy refractory primary patient-derived leukemia cells demonstrated that RTS-V5 possesses potent and selective anticancer activity.

In the past, the outcome was very poor with the majority of patients reaching end-stage renal disease or dying with little or no chances of kidney transplant (KTx) due to the high risk of relapse. The availability of C5 inhibition has opened up significant therapeutic opportunities and has improved the outcome particularly if complement dysregulation (CD) is the underlying pathogenetic mechanism. METHODS: We describe a peculiar case of a girl with aHUS complicating HSCT and her subsequent successful KTx received from the same donor thus performed without immunosuppression but anti-C5 inhibition. RESULTS: Soon after HSCT performed for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the patient developed a TMA due to CD and reached end-stage renal disease. After 2 years on dialysis, the patient received a KTx from her father who was already the HSCT donor. Given the full chimerism, no immunosuppressive agent was prescribed except a short (2 days) course of steroids and eculizumab to prevent aHUS relapse. Nine months after the KTx, the patient is well with normal renal function, no immunosuppression and continues eculizumab prevention of aHUS (1 infusion every 21 days). CONCLUSIONS: All patients with transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy should be screened for the causes of CD. C5 inhibition with eculizumab is an important therapeutic resource to manage this complication. When KTx is necessary, immunosuppression can be safely withhold in case of same donor for both grafts and documented full chimerism.","['Ardissino, Gianluigi', 'Cresseri, Donata', 'Giglio, Fabio', 'Onida, Francesco', 'Iannuzzella, Francesco', 'Tel, Francesca', 'Giussani, Antenore', 'Messa, Piergiorgio', 'Longhi, Selena', 'Vincenti, Daniele', 'Tedeschi, Silvana', 'Cugno, Massimo', 'Ciceri, Fabio']","['Ardissino G', 'Cresseri D', 'Giglio F', 'Onida F', 'Iannuzzella F', 'Tel F', 'Giussani A', 'Messa P', 'Longhi S', 'Vincenti D', 'Tedeschi S', 'Cugno M', 'Ciceri F']","[""Center for HUS Prevention, Control and Management at the Pediatric Nephrology, Dialysis and Transplantation Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", ""Center for HUS Prevention, Control and Management at the Nephrology, Dialysis and Kidney Transplantation Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, IRCCS S.

The differential diagnosis of FNP is extensive (ranging from infectious, traumatic, neurologic, to idiopathic) and often can present as a diagnostic challenge. In contrast to unilateral presentation, bilateral FNP presents as a manifestation of serious systemic conditions, including meningitis (infectious and neoplastic), brain stem encephalitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, sarcoidosis, Lyme disease, human immunodeficiency virus infection, leukemia, and vasculitis. In the evaluation of a child who presents with bilateral FNP, history plays the utmost role in the diagnosis. A history of rash consistent with erythema chronicum migrans, recent tick exposure, or travel to a Lyme disease-endemic area is highly suggestive that the facial paralysis is a result of Lyme disease. It is also important to recognize that Lyme disease is emerging as the most common infectious etiology of bilateral FNP in the pediatric population. In this case report, we describe a 16-year-old boy who presented to the emergency department with complaints of headache and bilateral FNP, an unusual presentation of Lyme disease.","['Wong, Kei', 'Sequeira, Sophia', 'Bechtel, Kirsten']","['Wong K', 'Sequeira S', 'Bechtel K']","['From the Department of Pediatrics, Section of Pediatric Emergency Medicine.', 'Department of Pediatrics.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Emergency Medicine, Section of Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Pediatr Emerg Care,Pediatric emergency care,8507560,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Connecticut', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Facial Paralysis/drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Humans', 'Lyme Disease/*complications/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male']",,,,2018/10/27 06:00,2021/06/08 06:00,['2018/10/27 06:00'],"['2018/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/08 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/PEC.0000000000001648 [doi]', '00006565-202011000-00025 [pii]']",ppublish,Pediatr Emerg Care. 2020 Nov;36(11):e651-e653. doi: 10.1097/PEC.0000000000001648.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the majority of children with relapsed disease are not expected to survive, with chemotherapy resistance acting as the principal cause of treatment failure. Interaction between leukemic cells and the bone marrow microenvironment is the primary cause of relapse. It was identified that a multiprotein membrane complex, formed by potassium voltagegated channel subfamily H member 2 (hERG1) channels, the beta1 integrin subunit and the stromal cellderived factor 12 (CXCL12) receptor, CXC chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), exerts a role in mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)mediated chemoresistance in pediatric leukemias. hERG1 blockade was able to overcome chemoresistance in vitro and in vivo. As an alternative strategy to overcome chemoresistance, the present study evaluated the effects of novel tools targeting the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis. The analysis of CXCL12 structural dynamics was used for the selection of a peptide (4117) and a small molecule (8673), which interact with a transient hot spot, identified by a dynamic drug design approach. The present findings indicated that peptide 4117 and small molecule 8673 inhibited leukemia cell proliferation and induced a proapoptotic effect, which was not reduced by the presence of MSCs. The combined treatment with 4117 and 8673 had a stronger proapoptotic effect, particularly on cells cultured on MSCs in normoxic and hypoxic conditions, and was able to overcome MSCinduced resistance to cytarabine. Overall, the targeting of CXCL12 and the ensuing inhibition of the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis may be proposed as an alternative strategy to overcome chemoresistance in leukemia.","['Pillozzi, Serena', 'Bernini, Andrea', 'Spiga, Ottavia', 'Lelli, Barbara', 'Petroni, Giulia', 'Bracci, Luisa', 'Niccolai, Neri', 'Arcangeli, Annarosa']","['Pillozzi S', 'Bernini A', 'Spiga O', 'Lelli B', 'Petroni G', 'Bracci L', 'Niccolai N', 'Arcangeli A']","['Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, I50134 Florence, Italy.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Chemistry and Pharmacy, University of Siena, I53100 Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Chemistry and Pharmacy, University of Siena, I53100 Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, University of Siena, I53100 Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, I50134 Florence, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, University of Siena, I53100 Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Chemistry and Pharmacy, University of Siena, I53100 Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, I50134 Florence, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181018,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Cell Hypoxia/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chemokine CXCL12/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Receptors, CXCR4/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Small Molecule Libraries/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,,,2018/10/27 06:00,2019/01/23 06:00,['2018/10/27 06:00'],"['2017/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/23 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/or.2018.6808 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2019 Jan;41(1):312-324. doi: 10.3892/or.2018.6808.

However, whether CZ2HF is capable of alleviating learning and memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains to be elucidated. The present study was designed to explore the effect and mechanism of CZ2HF on betaamyloid 2535 (Abeta2535)induced impairment in the learning and memory of rats. Morris water maze test was used to determine spatial learning and memory ability in Abeta2535induced AD rats and hippocampal neuronal damage and apoptosis were observed using hematoxylin and eosin staining, Nissl staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferasemediated dUTP nickend labeling (TUNEL) assays, respectively. The levels of betaamyloid 142 (Abeta142), proinflammatory factors, such as cyclooxygenase2 (COX2), tumor necrosis factoralpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin1beta (IL1beta) and apoptosisassociated genes including B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), Bcl-2associated X, apoptosis regulator (Bax), procaspase3, inhibitor of kappaB (IkappaBalpha) degradation and phosphorylatednuclear factorkappaB p65 (pNFkappaB p65) activation were analyzed using western blotting. The findings of the present study revealed that CZ2HF treatment significantly attenuated Abeta2535induced cognitive impairments in rats. Subsequently, CZ2HF treatment markedly inhibited neuronal damage and deletions. Furthermore, CZ2HF reduced TNFalpha, IL1beta, COX2 protein expression levels, Bax/Bcl2 ratio, and reduced Abeta142 and activecaspase3 levels. In addition, IkappaBalpha degradation and pNFkappaB p65 activation were reduced by CZ2HF. These findings suggested that CZ2HF treatment improved Abeta2535induced learning and memory impairment and hippocampal neuronal injury, and its underlying mechanism may be due to the inhibition of neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis. CZ2HF may be a potential agent for the treatment of AD.","['Zeng, Lingrong', 'Gao, Jianmei', 'Deng, Yuanyuan', 'Shi, Jingshan', 'Gong, Qihai']","['Zeng L', 'Gao J', 'Deng Y', 'Shi J', 'Gong Q']","['Key Laboratory of Basic Pharmacology of Ministry of Education, Department of Pharmacology, Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi, Guizhou 563000, P.R.

These pathways converge at the phosporylation of eIF2alpha. Drug-like, potent and selective chemical inhibitors (valid chemical probes) targeting major ISR kinases have been previously identified, with the exception of GCN2. We synthesized and evaluated a series of GCN2 inhibitors based on a triazolo[4,5-d]pyrimidine scaffold. Several compounds potently inhibited GCN2 in vitro and displayed good selectivity over the related kinases PERK, HRI, and IRE1. The compounds inhibited phosporylation of eIF2alpha in HEK293T cells with an IC50<150nM, validating them as chemical probes for cellular studies. These probes were screened against the National Cancer Institute NCI-60 human cancer cell line panel. Uniform growth inhibition was observed in the leukemia group of cell lines. Growth inhibition in the most sensitive cell lines coincided with high GCN2 mRNA expression levels. Oncomine analysis revealed high GCN2 expression accompanied by lower asparagine synthetase (ASNS) expression in patient-derived acute lymphoblastic leukemias with B-Cell origins (B-ALL) as well. Notably, asparaginase, which depletes amino acids and triggers GCN2 activity, is a licensed, first-line B-ALL treatment. Thus, we hypothesize that leukemias exhibiting high GCN2 expression and low ASNS expression may be susceptible to pharmacologic GCN2 inhibition.","['Lough, Lea', 'Sherman, Dan', 'Beccera-Flores, Manuel', 'Lavinda, Olga', 'Ni, Eric', 'Wang, Hong', 'Tibes, Raoul', 'Cardozo, Timothy']","['Lough L', 'Sherman D', 'Beccera-Flores M', 'Lavinda O', 'Ni E', 'Wang H', 'Tibes R', 'Cardozo T']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'Department of Laura & Isaac Perlmutter Cancer Center, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA.']",['eng'],"['DP2 OD004631/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA176502/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AR064184/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009161/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20180928,Netherlands,Comput Struct Biotechnol J,Computational and structural biotechnology journal,101585369,,,,PMC6197744,,,2018/10/27 06:00,2018/10/27 06:01,['2018/10/27 06:00'],"['2018/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/21 00:00 [revised]', '2018/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.csbj.2018.09.003 [doi]', 'S2001-0370(18)30077-1 [pii]']",epublish,Comput Struct Biotechnol J. 2018 Sep 28;16:350-360. doi: 10.1016/j.csbj.2018.09.003. eCollection 2018.,,,,,,,,,,,['Comput Struct Biotechnol J. 2020 May 05;18:1092.

The incidence of this phenomenon is unknown, and awareness of this potential alternate protein expression pattern is important in order to avoid diagnostic errors.","['Algashaamy, Khaled', 'Tan, Yaohong', 'Mackrides, Nicolas', 'Alencar, Alvaro', 'Peng, Jing-Hong', 'Rosenblatt, Joseph', 'Alderuccio, Juan P', 'Lossos, Izidore S', 'Vega, Francisco', 'Chapman, Jennifer']","['Algashaamy K', 'Tan Y', 'Mackrides N', 'Alencar A', 'Peng JH', 'Rosenblatt J', 'Alderuccio JP', 'Lossos IS', 'Vega F', 'Chapman J']","['Department of Pathology, Division of Hematopathology, University of Miami, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center and Jackson Memorial Hospital, Miami, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Division of Hematopathology, University of Miami, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center and Jackson Memorial Hospital, Miami, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Division of Hematopathology, University of Miami, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center and Jackson Memorial Hospital, Miami, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Miami, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center and Jackson Memorial Hospital, Miami, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Division of Hematopathology, University of Miami, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center and Jackson Memorial Hospital, Miami, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Miami, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center and Jackson Memorial Hospital, Miami, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Miami, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center and Jackson Memorial Hospital, Miami, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Miami, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center and Jackson Memorial Hospital, Miami, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Division of Hematopathology, University of Miami, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center and Jackson Memorial Hospital, Miami, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Miami, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center and Jackson Memorial Hospital, Miami, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Division of Hematopathology, University of Miami, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center and Jackson Memorial Hospital, Miami, Florida, USA.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20180927,United States,Case Rep Hematol,Case reports in hematology,101576456,,,,PMC6180998,,,2018/10/27 06:00,2018/10/27 06:01,['2018/10/27 06:00'],"['2018/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/27 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2018/5761953 [doi]'],epublish,Case Rep Hematol. 2018 Sep 27;2018:5761953. doi: 10.1155/2018/5761953. eCollection 2018.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-5956-452X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6214-4152']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AIM: To evaluate actual comorbidity and polymorbidity in patients with CLL and a possible relationship between the diseases and comorbidities that are considered concurrent and side effects of the administered treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study consisted of two parts. In a retrospective study, we analyzed records of patients with CLL from the Registry for Diagnostics and Treatment of Lymphoproliferative Diseases. In addition, we thoroughly evaluated and prospectively followed up 124 patients in the course of their preparation to a new stage of CLL tratement. RESULTS: Examining data from the Russian Registry for Diagnostics and Treatment of Lymphoproliferative Diseases (n=1361) showed that in Russia, the age of patients with newly diagnosed CLL has increased in the recent decade with the increase in life span, which might change the comorbidity structure. Comparing retrospective and our own data (n=124) showed that diagnoses of concurrent diseases are often recorded formally (p3 suggested a poor prognosis for patients with CLL.

We examined the impact of thrombocytopenia on low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) dosing and incidence of bleeding in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) who developed thromboembolism (TE) during therapy according to DFCI ALL protocols. PROCEDURE: Patient records from our tertiary care center were reviewed for demographics, details of diagnoses and therapy of ALL/LL and TE diagnoses, platelet counts during ACT, LMWH dosing, and bleeding episodes. RESULTS: Thirty-nine TEs were diagnosed in 33 patients [mean age 9 years (range, 2.5-18); 16 males and 31 with ALL] during the study period. A majority (85%) of patients were diagnosed with TE in the consolidation phase with mean time to TE 5.75 months from ALL/LL diagnosis. All patients received LMWH, and the median duration of ACT was 5.9 months (range, 1-11 months). Platelets were measured weekly. On 29 occasions, platelet nadir was <50 x 10(9) /L, and twice it was < 20 x 10(9) /L. One (3%) patient had major bleeding episode while on ACT. Platelet count at the time of bleeding was 222 x 10(9) /L. Ninety-two procedures [83 lumbar punctures (LPs), 9 central venous line (CVL) insertion/revision] were completed without bleeding complications. Asparaginase was held temporarily with TE diagnosis in 48% of patients; most (88%) patients completed all scheduled doses as per protocol. CONCLUSIONS: Ability to administer full-dose LMWH, expected bleeding rate, and completion of asparaginase doses while on ACT suggest full-dose ACT is feasible and safe in children with ALL/LL who develop TE during DFCI ALL consortium therapy protocols.","['Bhatt, Mihir D', 'Parmar, Neha', 'Fowler, Jo-Ann', 'Chan, Anthony K C', 'Athale, Uma H']","['Bhatt MD', 'Parmar N', 'Fowler JA', 'Chan AKC', 'Athale UH']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, McMaster Children's Hospital and McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, McMaster Children's Hospital and McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, McMaster Children's Hospital and McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, McMaster Children's Hospital and McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, McMaster Children's Hospital and McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181025,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anticoagulants/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/epidemiology', 'Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced/*complications', 'Thromboembolism/chemically induced/*drug therapy']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*anticoagulation therapy', '*low-molecular-weight heparin', '*thrombocytopenia', '*thromboembolism']",2018/10/27 06:00,2019/11/07 06:00,['2018/10/27 06:00'],"['2018/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/16 00:00 [revised]', '2018/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27483 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 Feb;66(2):e27483. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27483.

Less is known about AEs in obese ALL patients during pre-maintenance chemotherapy. We evaluated the relationship between obesity (body mass index (BMI) >/= 95th percentile) and AEs during pre-maintenance chemotherapy in pediatric patients with ALL. METHODS: One hundred fifty-five pediatric ALL patients diagnosed at a single institution between 2006 and 2012 were retrospectively evaluated for infections, treatment-requiring hypertension, insulin-requiring hyperglycemia, pancreatitis, pediatric intensive care unit admissions, sepsis, febrile neutropenia (FN) admissions, thrombosis, hepatotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity. Univariate and multivariable analyses compared proportions of obese versus nonobese patients experiencing AEs. RESULTS: AEs occurring significantly more frequently in obese patients by univariate analysis included treatment-requiring hypertension (17.5% vs 6.1%; OR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.1-10.0, P = 0.0497) and insulin-requiring hyperglycemia (25.0% vs 11.3%; OR, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.04-6.56, P = 0.04). Obese patients had greater incidence rates for recurrent admission-requiring infections (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.64; 95% CI, 1.08-2.48, P = 0.02) and recurrent FN admissions (IRR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.10-2.12, P = 0.01). Accounting for combined age and NCI risk status, obesity was a risk factor for treatment-requiring hypertension (OR, 3.90; 95% CI, 1.19-12.76, P = 0.02), insulin-requiring hyperglycemia (OR, 3.92; 95% CI, 1.39-11.05, P = 0.01), and FN admission (OR, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.27-6.73, P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: During pre-maintenance chemotherapy for ALL, obesity is a risk factor for the development of hypertension, hyperglycemia, and FN admissions. This research provides implications for augmented preventive and supportive care guidelines in obese ALL patients.","['Meenan, Chelsea K', 'Kelly, John A', 'Wang, Li', 'Ritchey, A Kim', 'Maurer, Scott H']","['Meenan CK', 'Kelly JA', 'Wang L', 'Ritchey AK', 'Maurer SH']","['University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.']",['eng'],"['UL1 TR000005/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1-TR-000005/NH/NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20181026,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Obesity/*complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",PMC6301108,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*adverse events', '*obesity', '*pediatric']",2018/10/27 06:00,2019/11/07 06:00,['2018/10/27 06:00'],"['2017/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/07 00:00 [revised]', '2018/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27515 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 Feb;66(2):e27515. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27515.

We investigated their expression levels in 55 patients, 45 diagnosed with ALL and 10 as a control group. We found that miRNA-155a and miRNA-181a were significantly upregulated in the ALL group with both being linked to high levels of minimal residual disease and poor prognosis. miRNA-155a cutoff value was significant in discriminating between high- and low-risk ALL patients as well as between ALL patients and healthy controls, miRNA-181a cutoff value, however, was not significant. Both markers levels were significantly downregulated after therapy. We conclude that miR-155 is correlated with poor prognosis in ALL, whereas we couldn't link miRNA-181a to the prognosis in ALL.

The goal of the current project is to identify any significant miRNAs in T-ALL metastasis. We observed miR-146b-5p to be downregulated in T-ALL patients and cell lines, and bioinformatics analysis implicated miR-146b-5p in the hematopoietic system. miR-146b-5p inhibited the migration and invasion in T-ALL cells. Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) was predicted to be a target of miR-146b-5p; this was confirmed by luciferase assays. Interestingly, T-ALL patients and cell lines secreted IL-17A and expressed the IL-17A receptor (IL-17RA). IL-17A/IL-17RA interactions promoted strong T-ALL cell migration and invasion responses. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis indicated that matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP9), was a potential downstream effector of IL-17A activation, and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) signaling was also implicated in this process. Moreover, IL-17A activation promoted T-ALL cell metastasis to the liver in IL17A (-/-) mouse models. These results indicate that reduced miR-146b-5p expression in T-ALL may lead to the upregulation of IL-17A, which then promotes T-ALL cell migration and invasion by upregulating MMP9 via NF-kappaB signaling.","['Tu, Zhenbo', 'Xiong, Jie', 'Xiao, Ruijing', 'Shao, Liang', 'Yang, Xiangyong', 'Zhou, Lu', 'Yuan, Wen', 'Wang, Meng', 'Yin, Qian', 'Wu, Yingjie', 'Pan, Shan', 'Leng, Jun', 'Jiang, Daozi', 'He, Chunjiang', 'Zhang, Qiuping']","['Tu Z', 'Xiong J', 'Xiao R', 'Shao L', 'Yang X', 'Zhou L', 'Yuan W', 'Wang M', 'Yin Q', 'Wu Y', 'Pan S', 'Leng J', 'Jiang D', 'He C', 'Zhang Q']","['Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Bioengineering, Hubei University of Technology Engineering and Technology College, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Taihe Hospital, Shiyan, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Hubei Provincial Key Laboratory of Developmentally Originated Disease, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181025,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (IL17A protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-17)', '0 (MIRN146 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics/physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics/physiology', 'Computational Biology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-17/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'MicroRNAs', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)', '*interleukin-17A (IL-17A)', '*miR-146b-5p', '*migration and invasion', '*nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB)']",2018/10/27 06:00,2020/07/21 06:00,['2018/10/27 06:00'],"['2018/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.27882 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2019 Apr;120(4):5936-5948. doi: 10.1002/jcb.27882.

METHODS: The apoptosis effects of 1 and 2 in NALM-6 cells were investigated by TUNEL staining, annexin V, mitochondria membrane potential and caspase 3/7 activity. We carried out a protein array to explore the signalling molecules involved in apoptosis comprehensively. KEY FINDINGS: Acrofolione A (1) suppressed the growth of NALM-6, K562 and HPB-ALL cells (IC50 16.7 +/- 1.9, 17.9 +/- 0.3 and 10.1 +/- 0.2 mum, respectively) more effectively than acrofolione B (2). Both compounds time-dependently increased the number of NALM-6 cells with abnormal nuclei, and increased the number of annexin V-positive cells and decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential of NALM-6 cells. Acrofolione A (1) markedly elevated caspase 3/7 activity and increased the number of TUNEL-positive cells. Cells treated with either compound showed enhanced expression of cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase 3 and 7, and reduced survivin protein levels. CONCLUSIONS: Acrofolione A (1) and B (2) may be useful in the treatment of various types of leukaemia.","['Matsui, Takuya', 'Ito, Chihiro', 'Kato, Ayumi', 'Wu, Tian-Shung', 'Itoigawa, Masataka']","['Matsui T', 'Ito C', 'Kato A', 'Wu TS', 'Itoigawa M']","['Department of Physiology, Aichi Medical University, Nagakute, Aichi, Japan.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Meijo University, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Meijo University, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Meijo University, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Chemistry, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.', 'School of Sports and Health Science, Tokai Gakuen University, Miyoshi, Aichi, Japan.']",['eng'],['JP17K08353/JSPS KAKENHI'],['Journal Article'],20181025,England,J Pharm Pharmacol,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,0376363,"['0 (Acetophenones)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'RK493WHV10 (acetophenone)']",IM,"['Acetophenones/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 7/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Rutaceae/*chemistry']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acronychia pedunculata', 'NALM-6', 'acrofolione A', 'acrofolione B', 'apoptosis']",2018/10/27 06:00,2019/03/21 06:00,['2018/10/27 06:00'],"['2018/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jphp.13035 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pharm Pharmacol. 2019 Mar;71(3):348-361. doi: 10.1111/jphp.13035.

Rates of transplant have been limited by concern related to non-relapse mortality, as older patients have historically been considered medically unfit for the transplantation process. Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been shown to provide similar efficacy to myeloablative methods, with decreased non-relapse mortality in the elderly and improved efficacy over non-transplant approaches with cytotoxic chemotherapy alone. Targeted non-cytotoxic and modified cytotoxic agents have emerged to further improve transplant outcomes for older AML patients. Validated comorbidity indices are useful tools to assess an individual's fitness for undergoing HSCT rather than chronological age alone. We believe HSCT is the primary curative treatment approach for many older AML patients, taking into account risk and comorbidities, particularly given the tendency of leukemia in this population to harbor an unfavorable disease profile. We use RIC and advocate for the addition of targeted agents if applicable. With continuing data in support of transplant for older AML patients, we anticipate that transplant rates in this population will continue to rise.","['Levin-Epstein, Rebecca', 'Oliai, Caspian', 'Schiller, Gary']","['Levin-Epstein R', 'Oliai C', 'Schiller G']","['UCLA Department of Radiation Oncology, 200 Medical Plaza, Suite B265, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, USA. rlevinepstein@mednet.ucla.edu.', 'UCLA Department of Hematology Oncology, 200 Medical Plaza, Suite 120, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, USA.', 'UCLA Department of Hematology Oncology, 200 Medical Plaza, Suite 120, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20181025,United States,Curr Treat Options Oncol,Current treatment options in oncology,100900946,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Cells/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*surgery', 'Middle Aged', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*methods', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*Allogeneic transplant', '*Elderly AML', '*Reduced-intensity conditioning', '*Stem cell transplant']",2018/10/27 06:00,2019/10/28 06:00,['2018/10/27 06:00'],"['2018/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11864-018-0577-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s11864-018-0577-2 [pii]']",epublish,Curr Treat Options Oncol. 2018 Oct 25;19(12):63. doi: 10.1007/s11864-018-0577-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rituximab added to standard chemotherapy has been proven to increase response rate and eventually survival among previously untreated CLL patients. CILI was an open-label, non-randomized, single arm, multicentric, observational study aimed to collect real-life effectiveness data for rituximab used according to the current label in combination with standard chemotherapy in previously untreated CLL patients. Overall response rates (ORR) in the entire study population as well as in various subgroups were estimated. Adverse events were recorded during the entire course of the study. A total number of 150 patients were enrolled by 15 Hungarian study sites. Out of these, 82 patients received 6 cycles of rituximab containing treatment. Overall response rates of 88.24% (CI95%: 81.6-93.12%) and 94.59% (CI95%: 86.73-98.51%) were recorded in the intent-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) populations, respectively. In both study populations, somewhat higher ORR was observed in patients aged >/=65 years. Subgroups defined according to either chromosomal aberrations (presence of 11q and 17p deletions) showed apparently high ORRs, though these rates were most probably biased by low patient numbers. 144 adverse events were reported during the study, of which 15 AEs were considered to be related to the administration of rituximab.

Ibrutinib resistance has become a major unmet clinical need, and the development of therapeutics to overcome ibrutinib resistance will greatly improve the poor outcomes of ibrutinib-exposed MCL patients. CUDC-907 inhibits both PI3K and HDAC functionality to exert synergistic or additive effects. Therefore, the activity of CUDC-907 was examined in MCL cell lines and patient primary cells, including ibrutinib-resistant MCL cells. The efficacy of CUDC-907 was further examined in an ibrutinib-resistant MCL patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse model. The molecular mechanisms by which CUDC-907 dually inhibits PI3K and histone deacetylation were assessed using reverse protein array, immunoblotting, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with sequencing. We showed evidence that CUDC-907 treatment increased histone acetylation in MCL cells. We found that CUDC-907 caused decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis in MCL in vitro and in vivo MCL models. In addition, CUDC-907 was effective in inducing lethality in ibrutinib-resistant MCL cells. Lastly, CUDC-907 treatment increased histone acetylation in MCL cells. Overall, these studies suggest that CUDC-907 may be a promising therapeutic option for relapsed or resistant MCL.","['Guo, Hui', 'Zeng, Dongfeng', 'Zhang, Hui', 'Bell, Taylor', 'Yao, Jun', 'Liu, Yang', 'Huang, Shengjian', 'Li, Carrie J', 'Lorence, Elizabeth', 'Zhou, Shouhao', 'Gong, Tiejun', 'Jiang, Changying', 'Ahmed, Makhdum', 'Yao, Yixin', 'Nomie, Krystle J', 'Zhang, Liang', 'Wang, Michael']","['Guo H', 'Zeng D', 'Zhang H', 'Bell T', 'Yao J', 'Liu Y', 'Huang S', 'Li CJ', 'Lorence E', 'Zhou S', 'Gong T', 'Jiang C', 'Ahmed M', 'Yao Y', 'Nomie KJ', 'Zhang L', 'Wang M']","['Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, The Third Military Medical University, 430000, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Molecular & Cellular Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Institute of Hematology & Oncology, The First Hospital of Harbin, 150010, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. miwang@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. miwang@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | NIH | National', 'Cancer Institute (NCI)/International', 'R21 CA202104/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | NIH | National', 'Cancer Institute (NCI)/International']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181025,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (CUDC-907)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Histones/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Morpholines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Piperidines', 'Pyrazoles/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,,2018/10/27 06:00,2019/05/10 06:00,['2018/10/27 06:00'],"['2018/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/30 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/10 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-018-0550-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-018-0550-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2019 Mar;38(11):1802-1814. doi: 10.1038/s41388-018-0550-3.

The role of the bone marrow microenvironment (BMM) in protecting AML cells from chemotherapeutics and causing consequent relapse is increasingly recognised. However the role that the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins play as effectors of BMM-mediated drug resistance are less understood. Here we show that bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSC) provide resistance to AML cells against BH3-mimetics, cytarabine and daunorubicin, but this is not mediated by Bcl-2 and/or Bcl-XL as previously thought. Instead, BMSCs induced Mcl-1 expression over Bcl-2 and/or Bcl-XL in AML cells and inhibition of Mcl-1 with a small-molecule inhibitor, A1210477, or repressing its expression with the CDC7/CDK9 dual-inhibitor, PHA-767491 restored sensitivity to BH3-mimetics. Furthermore, combined inhibition of Bcl-2/Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 could revert BMSC-mediated resistance against cytarabine + daunorubicin. Importantly, the CD34(+)/CD38(-) leukemic stem cell-encompassing population was equally sensitive to the combination of PHA-767491 and ABT-737. These results indicate that Bcl-2/Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 act in a redundant fashion as effectors of BMM-mediated AML drug resistance and highlight the potential of Mcl-1-repression to revert BMM-mediated drug resistance in the leukemic stem cell population, thus, prevent disease relapse and ultimately improve patient survival.","[""O' Reilly, Eimear"", 'Dhami, Sukhraj Pal S', 'Baev, Denis V', 'Ortutay, Csaba', 'Halpin-McCormick, Anna', 'Morrell, Ruth', 'Santocanale, Corrado', 'Samali, Afshin', 'Quinn, John', ""O'Dwyer, Michael E"", 'Szegezdi, Eva']","[""O' Reilly E"", 'Dhami SPS', 'Baev DV', 'Ortutay C', 'Halpin-McCormick A', 'Morrell R', 'Santocanale C', 'Samali A', 'Quinn J', ""O'Dwyer ME"", 'Szegezdi E']","['Apoptosis Research Centre, School of Natural Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.', 'Apoptosis Research Centre, School of Natural Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.', 'Apoptosis Research Centre, School of Natural Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.', 'Apoptosis Research Centre, School of Medicine, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.', 'HiDucator Ltd, Kangasala, Finland.', 'Apoptosis Research Centre, School of Natural Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.', 'Apoptosis Research Centre, School of Natural Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.', 'Centre for Chromosome Biology, School of Natural Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.', 'Apoptosis Research Centre, School of Natural Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.', 'Hematology, Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.', 'Apoptosis Research Centre, School of Natural Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.', 'Apoptosis Research Centre, School of Medicine, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.', 'HiDucator Ltd, Kangasala, Finland.', 'Apoptosis Research Centre, School of Natural Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland. eva.szegezdi@nuigalway.ie.']",['eng'],"['12/TIDA/B2388/Science Foundation Ireland (SFI)/International', 'BCNI,14/ICS/B3042/Science Foundation Ireland (SFI)/International', 'BCNI,14/ICS/B3042/Irish Cancer Society/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181025,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (PHA 767491)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Piperidones)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (CDC7 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK9 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Piperidones/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Tumor Microenvironment/drug effects', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",PMC6202320,,,2018/10/27 06:00,2019/10/19 06:00,['2018/10/27 06:00'],"['2018/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-018-33982-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-018-33982-y [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2018 Oct 25;8(1):15752. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-33982-y.,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1337-5656', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8610-8375', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5708-3535']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proteins that regulate cell survival through the stages of differentiation, however, are still poorly understood. Here, we examined the roles of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL, in promoting survival as cells progress through the stages of neurogenesis in the mouse embryonic central nervous system. We used Nestin-mediated, nervous system-specific conditional deletion of mcl-1, bcl-x or both to identify their distinct and overlapping roles. Individual conditional deletion of mcl-1 (MKO) and bcl-x (BKO) suggested sequential roles in promoting cell survival during developmental neurogenesis. In the MKO embryo, apoptosis begins at embryonic day 10 (E10) in the proliferating NPC population throughout the entire developing nervous system. In the BKO embryo, apoptosis begins later at E11 within the postmitotic neuron populations. In the double (mcl-1 and bcl-x) conditional knockout (DKO), cell death extended throughout both proliferating and non-proliferating cell populations resulting in embryonic lethality at E12, earlier than in either the MKO or BKO. Apoptotic cell death of the entire central nervous system in the DKO demonstrates that both genes are necessary for cell survival during developmental neurogenesis. To determine whether Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL have overlapping anti-apoptotic roles during neurogenesis, we examined the impact of gene dosage. Loss of a single bcl-x allele in the MKO embryo exasperated apoptotic cell death within the NPC population revealing a novel anti-apoptotic role for Bcl-xL in proliferating NPCs. Cells were rescued from apoptosis in both the MKO and BKO embryos by breeding with the Bax null mouse line indicating that Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL have a common pro-apoptotic target during developmental neurogenesis. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL are the two essential anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins required for the survival of the developing mammalian nervous system.","['Fogarty, Lauren C', 'Flemmer, Robert T', 'Geizer, Brittany A', 'Licursi, Maria', 'Karunanithy, Ahila', 'Opferman, Joseph T', 'Hirasawa, Kensuke', 'Vanderluit, Jacqueline L']","['Fogarty LC', 'Flemmer RT', 'Geizer BA', 'Licursi M', 'Karunanithy A', 'Opferman JT', 'Hirasawa K', 'Vanderluit JL']","[""Division of BioMedical Sciences, Memorial University, 300 Prince Philip Drive, St. John's, NF, A1B 3V6, Canada."", ""Division of BioMedical Sciences, Memorial University, 300 Prince Philip Drive, St. John's, NF, A1B 3V6, Canada."", ""Division of BioMedical Sciences, Memorial University, 300 Prince Philip Drive, St. John's, NF, A1B 3V6, Canada."", ""Division of BioMedical Sciences, Memorial University, 300 Prince Philip Drive, St. John's, NF, A1B 3V6, Canada."", ""Division of BioMedical Sciences, Memorial University, 300 Prince Philip Drive, St. John's, NF, A1B 3V6, Canada."", ""Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA."", ""Division of BioMedical Sciences, Memorial University, 300 Prince Philip Drive, St. John's, NF, A1B 3V6, Canada."", ""Division of BioMedical Sciences, Memorial University, 300 Prince Philip Drive, St. John's, NF, A1B 3V6, Canada. j.vanderluit@mun.ca.""]",['eng'],['245727/CIHR/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181025,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival', 'Central Nervous System/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Neurons/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/*metabolism']",PMC6748126,,,2018/10/27 06:00,2020/10/02 06:00,['2018/10/27 06:00'],"['2018/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/09/12 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41418-018-0225-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41418-018-0225-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2019 Aug;26(8):1501-1515. doi: 10.1038/s41418-018-0225-1.

We examined CD123 expression levels in a large cohort of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma and assessed the in vitro impact of IMGN632, a conjugate of CD123-binding antibody with a novel DNA-alkylating payload. CD123 expression on leukemic blasts was surveyed using multicolor/multiparameter flow cytometry. The in vitro effect of IMGN632 was evaluated on B acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma cell lines and primary B acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma blasts. The study cohort (n=213) included 183 patients with B acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma and 30 with T acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. CD123 expression was more prevalent in B acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma than in T acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (164/183, 89.6% versus 13/30, 43.3%; P<0.0001), and within B acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma CD123 expression was more prevalent in Philadelphia chromosome-positive patients than in Philadelphia chromosome-negative patients (96.6% versus 86.3%; P=0.033). In T acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, 12/13 (92.3%) patients with CD123-positive blasts had either early T precursor (ETP) or early non-ETP immunophenotype. IMGN632 was highly cytotoxic to B acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma cell lines, with half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) between 0.6 and 20 pM. In five of eight patients' samples, low picomolar concentrations of IMGN632 eliminated more than 90% of the B acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma blast population, sparing normal lymphocytes. In conclusion, CD123 expression is prevalent across acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma subtypes, and the CD123-targeted antibody-drug conjugate IMGN632 demonstrates promising selective activity in preclinical models of B acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma.","['Angelova, Evgeniya', 'Audette, Charlene', 'Kovtun, Yelena', 'Daver, Naval', 'Wang, Sa A', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Konoplev, Sergej N', 'Khogeer, Haitham', 'Jorgensen, Jeffrey L', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Zweidler-McKay, Patrick A', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Jabbour, Elias J', 'Khoury, Joseph D']","['Angelova E', 'Audette C', 'Kovtun Y', 'Daver N', 'Wang SA', 'Pierce S', 'Konoplev SN', 'Khogeer H', 'Jorgensen JL', 'Konopleva M', 'Zweidler-McKay PA', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Jabbour EJ', 'Khoury JD']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'ImmunoGen, Inc., Waltham, MA.', 'ImmunoGen, Inc., Waltham, MA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'ImmunoGen, Inc., Waltham, MA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX jkhoury@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20181025,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (IL3RA protein, human)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/*pharmacology', 'Infant', '*Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', '*Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', '*Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology']",PMC6442980,,,2018/10/27 06:00,2020/05/07 06:00,['2018/10/27 06:00'],"['2018/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/07 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.205252 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.205252 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2019 Apr;104(4):749-755. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.205252.

The leukemia-free survival rates at 2 years of recipients of grafts from a haploidentical donor, an unrelated 10/10-matched donor and an unrelated 9/10-mismatched donor were 22.8%, 28% and 22.2%, respectively (P=NS). In multivariate analysis, there were no significant differences in leukemia-free survival, overall survival, relapse incidence, non-relapse mortality, or graft-versus-host-disease-free relapse-free survival between the three groups. Two predictive factors were associated with a higher relapse incidence: transplantation during first or second relapse compared to primary refractory acute myeloid leukemia and poor cytogenetics. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation may rescue about 25% of acute myeloid leukemia patients with active disease. Importantly, the outcomes of transplants from haploidentical donors were comparable to those from 10/10-matched and 9/10-mismatched unrelated donors. Therefore, a haploidentical donor is a valid option for acute myeloid leukemia patients with active disease.","['Brissot, Eolia', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Stelljes, Matthias', 'Brecht, Arne', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Tischer, Johanna', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Afanasyev, Boris', 'Finke, Jurgen', 'Elmaagacli, Ahmet', 'Einsele, Herman', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Brissot E', 'Labopin M', 'Ehninger G', 'Stelljes M', 'Brecht A', 'Ganser A', 'Tischer J', 'Kroger N', 'Afanasyev B', 'Finke J', 'Elmaagacli A', 'Einsele H', 'Mohty M', 'Nagler A']","[""Service d'Hematologie Clinique et de Therapie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint Antoine, APHP, Paris, France eolia.brissot@aphp.fr."", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique et de Therapie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint Antoine, APHP, Paris, France."", 'Acute Leukemia Working Party office, Hopital Saint Antoine, APHP, Paris, France.', 'Universitaetsklinikum Dresden, Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Germany.', 'University of Munster, Department of Medicine A / Hematology and Oncology, Germany.', 'Deutsche Klinik fur Diagnostik, KMT Zentrum, Wiesbaden, Germany.', 'Hannover Medical School, Department of Haematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Germany.', 'Klinikum Grosshadern, Med.

Here, we report how nucleic acid polymerases replicate a 2',5'-branched DNA (bDNA) molecule. We constructed long-chained bDNA templates containing a branch guanosine and T7 promoters at both arms by splinted ligation. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis was used to investigate whether a branchpoint blocks DNA synthesis from the two arms in the same manner. We find that the blocking effect of a branchpoint is arm-specific. DNA synthesis from the 2'-arm is more than 20,000-fold decreased, whereas from the 3'-arm only 15-fold. Our sequence analysis of full-length nucleic acid generated by Taq DNA polymerase, Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, and T7 RNA polymerase from the 2'-arm of bDNA shows that the branched guanine has a dual coding potential and can base-pair with cytosine and guanine. We find that branchpoint templating is influenced by the type of the surrounding nucleic acid and is probably modulated by polymerase and RNase H active sites. We show that the branchpoint bypass by the polymerases from the 3'-arm of bDNA is predominantly error-free, indicating that bDNA is not as highly mutagenic as 2',5'-branched RNA.","['Doring, Jessica', 'Hurek, Thomas']","['Doring J', 'Hurek T']","['Department of Microbe-Plant Interactions, CBIB (Center for Biomolecular Interactions Bremen), University of Bremen, D-28334 Bremen, Germany.', 'Department of Microbe-Plant Interactions, CBIB (Center for Biomolecular Interactions Bremen), University of Bremen, D-28334 Bremen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181025,United States,RNA,"RNA (New York, N.Y.)",9509184,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Taq Polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.6 (DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Branched DNA Signal Amplification Assay', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Codon', 'DNA/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/enzymology', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Ribonuclease H/metabolism', 'Taq Polymerase/metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/metabolism']",PMC6298571,['NOTNLM'],"[""*2',5'-branched DNA"", '*arm-specific branchpoint blocking', '*dual coding potential', '*error-free branchpoint bypass', '*templating branchpoint']",2018/10/27 06:00,2019/04/10 06:00,['2018/10/27 06:00'],"['2018/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['rna.068486.118 [pii]', '10.1261/rna.068486.118 [doi]']",ppublish,RNA. 2019 Jan;25(1):105-120. doi: 10.1261/rna.068486.118.

B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) overexpression is implicated in survival of AML cells and treatment resistance. We report safety and efficacy of venetoclax with decitabine or azacitidine from a large, multicenter, phase 1b dose-escalation and expansion study. Patients (N = 145) were at least 65 years old with treatment-naive AML and were ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. During dose escalation, oral venetoclax was administered at 400, 800, or 1200 mg daily in combination with either decitabine (20 mg/m(2), days 1-5, intravenously [IV]) or azacitidine (75 mg/m(2), days 1-7, IV or subcutaneously). In the expansion, 400 or 800 mg venetoclax with either hypomethylating agent (HMA) was given. Median age was 74 years, with poor-risk cytogenetics in 49% of patients. Common adverse events (>30%) included nausea, diarrhea, constipation, febrile neutropenia, fatigue, hypokalemia, decreased appetite, and decreased white blood cell count. No tumor lysis syndrome was observed. With a median time on study of 8.9 months, 67% of patients (all doses) achieved complete remission (CR) + CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi), with a CR + CRi rate of 73% in the venetoclax 400 mg + HMA cohort. Patients with poor-risk cytogenetics and those at least 75 years old had CR + CRi rates of 60% and 65%, respectively.

However, current manual interpretation suffers from drawbacks of time consuming and interpreter idiosyncrasy. Artificial intelligence (AI), with the expertise in assisting repetitive or complex analysis, represents a potential solution for these drawbacks. METHODS: From 2009 to 2016, 5333 MFC data from 1742 AML or MDS patients were collected. The 287 MFC data at post-induction were selected as the outcome set for clinical outcome validation. The rest were 4:1 randomized into the training set (n=4039) and the validation set (n=1007). AI algorithm learned a multi-dimensional MFC phenotype from the training set and input it to support vector machine (SVM) classifier after Gaussian mixture model (GMM) modeling, and the performance was evaluated in The validation set. FINDINGS: Promising accuracies (84.6% to 92.4%) and AUCs (0.921-0.950) were achieved by the developed algorithms. Interestingly, the algorithm from even one testing tube achieved similar performance. The clinical significance was validated in the outcome set, and normal MFC interpreted by the AI predicted better progression-free survival (10.9 vs 4.9months, p<0.0001) and overall survival (13.6 vs 6.5months, p<0.0001) for AML. INTERPRETATION: Through large-scaled clinical validation, we showed that AI algorithms can produce efficient and clinically-relevant MFC analysis. This approach also possesses a great advantage of the ability to integrate other clinical tests.

The overproduction of immature myeloblasts (white blood cells) is the characteristic feature of AML, thus flooding the bone marrow and reducing its capacity to produce normal blood cells. USFDA on August 1, 2017, approved a drug named Enasidenib formerly known as AG-221 which is being marketed under the name Idhifa to treat R/R AML with IDH2 mutation. The present review depicts the broad profile of enasidenib including various aspects of chemistry, preclinical, clinical studies, pharmacokinetics, mode of action and toxicity studies. METHODS: Various reports and research articles have been referred to summarize different aspects related to chemistry and pharmacokinetics of enasidenib. Clinical data was collected from various recently published clinical reports including clinical trial outcomes. RESULT: The various findings of enasidenib revealed that it has been designed to allosterically inhibit mutated IDH2 to treat R/R AML patients. It has also presented good safety and efficacy profile along with 9.3 months overall survival rates of patients in which disease has relapsed. The drug is still under study either in combination or solely to treat hematological malignancies. Molecular modeling studies revealed that enasidenib binds to its target through hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding inside the binding pocket. Enasidenib is found to be associated with certain adverse effects like elevated bilirubin level, diarrhea, differentiation syndrome, decreased potassium and calcium levels, etc. Conclusion: Enasidenib or AG-221was introduced by FDA as an anticancer agent which was developed as a first in class, a selective allosteric inhibitor of the tumor target i.e. IDH2 for Relapsed or Refractory AML. Phase 1/2 clinical trial of Enasidenib resulted in the overall survival rate of 40.3% with CR of 19.3%. Phase III trial on the Enasidenib is still under process along with another trial to test its potency against other cell lines. Edasidenib is associated with certain adverse effects, which can be reduced by investigators by designing its newer derivatives on the basis of SAR studies. Hence, it may come in the light as a potent lead entity for anticancer treatment in the coming years.","['Dogra, Raghav', 'Bhatia, Rohit', 'Shankar, Ravi', 'Bansal, Parveen', 'Rawal, Ravindra K']","['Dogra R', 'Bhatia R', 'Shankar R', 'Bansal P', 'Rawal RK']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry & Analysis, Indo-Soviet Friendship College of Pharmacy, Ferozepur G.T.

In the present study, we synthesized a novel platinum complex containing a piplartine derivative cis-[PtCl(PIP-OH)(PPh3)2]PF6 (where, PIP-OH = piplartine demethylated derivative; and PPh3 = triphenylphosphine) with enhanced cytotoxicity in different cancer cells, and investigated its apoptotic action in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. The structure of PIP-OH ligand was characterized by X-ray crystallographic analysis and the resulting platinum complex was characterized by infrared, molar conductance measurements, elemental analysis and NMR experiments. We found that the complex is more potent than piplartine in a panel of cancer cell lines. Apoptotic cell morphology, increased internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, without cell membrane permeability, loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, increased phosphatidylserine externalization and caspase-3 activation were observed in complex-treated HL-60 cells. Treatment with the complex also caused a marked increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the pretreatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine, an antioxidant, reduced the complex-induced apoptosis, indicating activation of ROS-mediated apoptosis pathway. Important, pretreatment with a p38 MAPK inhibitor (PD 169316) and MEK inhibitor (U-0126), known to inhibit ERK1/2 activation, also prevented the complex-induced apoptosis. The complex did not induce DNA intercalation in cell-free DNA assays. In conclusion, the complex exhibits more potent cytotoxicity than piplartine in a panel of different cancer cells and triggers ROS/ERK/p38-mediated apoptosis in HL-60 cells.","['Oliveira, Maiara de S', 'Barbosa, Marilia I F', 'de Souza, Thiago Belarmino', 'Moreira, Diogo R M', 'Martins, Felipe Terra', 'Villarreal, Wilmer', 'Machado, Rafael P', 'Doriguetto, Antonio Carlos', 'Soares, Milena B P', 'Bezerra, Daniel P']","['Oliveira MS', 'Barbosa MIF', 'de Souza TB', 'Moreira DRM', 'Martins FT', 'Villarreal W', 'Machado RP', 'Doriguetto AC', 'Soares MBP', 'Bezerra DP']","['Goncalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (IGM-FIOCRUZ/BA), Rua Waldemar Falcao, 121, Candeal, 40296-710 Salvador, Bahia, Brazil.', 'Institute of Chemistry, Federal University of Alfenas, Alfenas 37133-840, Minas Gerais, Brazil.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Federal University of Ouro Preto, Ouro Preto 35400-000, Minas Gerais, Brazil.', 'Goncalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (IGM-FIOCRUZ/BA), Rua Waldemar Falcao, 121, Candeal, 40296-710 Salvador, Bahia, Brazil.', 'Institute of Chemistry, Federal University of Goias, Goiania 740011970, Goias, Brazil.', 'Department of Chemistry, Federal University of Sao Carlos, Sao Carlos 13565-905, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Institute of Chemistry, Federal University of Alfenas, Alfenas 37133-840, Minas Gerais, Brazil.', 'Institute of Chemistry, Federal University of Alfenas, Alfenas 37133-840, Minas Gerais, Brazil.', 'Goncalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (IGM-FIOCRUZ/BA), Rua Waldemar Falcao, 121, Candeal, 40296-710 Salvador, Bahia, Brazil; Center of Biotechnology and Cell Therapy, Hospital Sao Rafael, Salvador, Bahia 41253-190, Brazil.', 'Goncalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (IGM-FIOCRUZ/BA), Rua Waldemar Falcao, 121, Candeal, 40296-710 Salvador, Bahia, Brazil.

Recent findings have outlined a putative role for MSCs in hematological malignancy development. So far, conflicting results have been collected concerning MSC abnormalities in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). In particular, a considerable amount of evidence has been accumulated strongly supporting a permissive role of MSCs in malignancy evolution to MDS, while a potentially causative or promoting function performed by MSCs in AML has not yet been fully clarified. Here, we compared MSCs isolated from healthy, MDS, and AML subjects to investigate MSC alterations and to emphasize putative common and/or diverse features. METHODS: We isolated and expanded MSCs from AML patients (AML-MSCs) and MDS patients (MDS-MSCs), and we analyzed and compared their phenotypic and functional properties with respect to each other and versus healthy donor-derived MSCs (HD-MSCs). RESULTS: We found that stable MSC cultures could be easily established from HD and MDS mononuclear BM-derived cells, while a substantial fraction (25%) of AML patients failed to yield MSCs. Nevertheless, isolated MDS-MSCs and AML-MSCs, as well as HD-MSCs, contained the basic features of MSCs. Indeed, they displayed similar surface marker expression and efficient capacity to differentiate versus osteogenic and adipogenic lineage in vitro. We also proved that MDS-MSCs and AML-MSCs, analyzed by fluorescence in-situ hybridization, did not harbor leukemic cell cytogenetic abnormalities. Moreover, MDS-MSCs and AML-MSCs were similar in terms of ability to sustain AML cell viability and immune-regulatory capacity. However, we were also able to detect some differences between AML-MSCs and MDS-MSCs. Indeed, we found that the frequency of rescued MSCs was lower in the AML group than in the HD and MDS groups, suggesting that a reduced number of MSC precursors could inhabit AML BM. Instead, MDS-MSCs showed the lowest proliferative capacity, reflecting some intrinsic and particular defect. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results elucidated that MDS-MSCs and AML-MSCs did not show macroscopic and/or tumor-related defects, but both displayed functional features potentially contributing to favor a leukemia-protective milieu.","['Corradi, Giulia', 'Baldazzi, Carmen', 'Ocadlikova, Darina', 'Marconi, Giovanni', 'Parisi, Sarah', 'Testoni, Nicoletta', 'Finelli, Carlo', 'Cavo, Michele', 'Curti, Antonio', 'Ciciarello, Marilena']","['Corradi G', 'Baldazzi C', 'Ocadlikova D', 'Marconi G', 'Parisi S', 'Testoni N', 'Finelli C', 'Cavo M', 'Curti A', 'Ciciarello M']","['Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Institute of Hematology ""L. & A.

Consequently, the possible impact of SNPs on BLV LTR function are poorly elucidated. Thus, a detailed and representative study of full-length LTR sequences obtained from sixty-four BLV isolates from different geographical regions of Poland, Moldova, Croatia, Ukraine and Russia were analyzed for their genetic variability. METHODS: Overlap extension PCR, sequencing and Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction of LTR sequences were performed. These analyses were followed by detailed sequence comparison, estimation of genetic heterogeneity and identification of transcription factor binding site (TFBS) modifications. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis of curated LTR sequences and those available in the GenBank database reflected the acknowledged env gene classification of BLV into 10 genotypes, and further clustered analysed sequences into three genotypes - G4, G7 and G8. Additional molecular studies revealed the presence of 97 point mutations distributed at 89 positions throughout all 64 LTR sequences. The highest rate of variability was noted in U3 and U5 subregions. However, the variability in regulatory sequences (VR) was assessed as lower than the variability within non-regulatory sequences (VNR) for both, U3 and U5 subregions. In contrast, VR value for R subregion, as well as for the total LTR, was higher than the VNR suggesting the existence of positive selection. Twelve unique SNPs for these LTR sequences localized in regulatory and non-regulatory elements were identified. The presence of different types of substitutions lead to the abrogation of present or to the creation of additional TFBS. CONCLUSION: This study represents the largest study of LTR genetic variability of BLV field isolates from Eastern part of Europe. Phylogenetic analysis of LTRs supports the clustering BLV variants based on their geographic origin. The SNP screening showed variations modifying LTR regulatory sequences, as well as altering TFBS. These features warrant further exploration as they could be related to proviral load and distinctive regulation of BLV transcription and replication.","['Pluta, Aneta', 'Rola-Luszczak, Marzena', 'Douville, Renee N', 'Kuzmak, Jacek']","['Pluta A', 'Rola-Luszczak M', 'Douville RN', 'Kuzmak J']","['Department of Biochemistry, National Veterinary Research Institute, Pulawy, Poland. aneta.pluta@piwet.pulawy.pl.', 'Department of Biochemistry, National Veterinary Research Institute, Pulawy, Poland.', 'Department of Biology, The University of Winnipeg, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry, National Veterinary Research Institute, Pulawy, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181025,England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Croatia', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/blood/diagnosis/*virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/virology', 'Moldova', 'Phylogeny', 'Poland', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'RNA, Viral/blood/*genetics', 'Regulatory Elements, Transcriptional', 'Russia', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Serology', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/*genetics', 'Ukraine']",PMC6202831,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bovine leukemia virus', '*Long-terminal repeat (LTR)', '*Transcription factors', '*Virus variability']",2018/10/26 06:00,2018/12/18 06:00,['2018/10/26 06:00'],"['2018/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12985-018-1062-z [doi]', '10.1186/s12985-018-1062-z [pii]']",epublish,Virol J. 2018 Oct 25;15(1):165. doi: 10.1186/s12985-018-1062-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To the authors' knowledge, data regarding patients treated on contemporary protocols without cranial irradiation are limited. METHODS: Changes in z scores for body mass index (BMI), height, and weight from the time of diagnosis to 5 years off therapy were evaluated using multivariable analysis in 372 children with ALL who were aged 2 to 18 years at the time of diagnosis and were enrolled on the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital Total XV protocol from 2000 through 2007. RESULTS: The percentage of overweight/obese patients increased from 25.5% at the time of diagnosis to approximately 50% during the off-therapy period. Median BMI z scores increased significantly during glucocorticoid therapy (induction: 0.56; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.29-0.64 [P<.001]; and reinduction II: 0.22; 95% CI, 0.13-0.49 [P=.001]) and during the first year after therapy (0.18; 95% CI, 0.08-0.46 [P=.006]). Among patients who were of healthy weight/underweight at the time of diagnosis, those aged 2 to <10 years at diagnosis had a significantly higher risk of becoming overweight/obese during or after therapy compared with those aged >/=10 years (P=.001). Height z scores declined during treatment and improved after therapy. Being aged 2 to <10 years at the time of diagnosis, being of low-risk status, having a white blood cell count < 50x10(9) /L at the time of diagnosis, and having negative central nervous system disease were associated with significantly better improvements in z scores for height during the off-therapy period compared with being aged >/=10 years, being of standard-risk/high-risk status, having a white blood cell count >/= 50x10(9) /L, and having positive central nervous system disease, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study demonstrate that obesity is prevalent, and height growth, especially in patients with identified risk factors, appears compromised. Multidisciplinary intervention should begin during induction therapy and continue during the off-therapy period.","['Browne, Emily K', 'Zhou, Yinmei', 'Chemaitilly, Wassim', 'Panetta, John C', 'Ness, Kirsten K', 'Kaste, Sue C', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'Relling, Mary V', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Inaba, Hiroto']","['Browne EK', 'Zhou Y', 'Chemaitilly W', 'Panetta JC', 'Ness KK', 'Kaste SC', 'Cheng C', 'Relling MV', 'Pui CH', 'Inaba H']","[""Department of Pediatric Medicine, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Pediatric Medicine, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Diagnostic Imaging, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Department of Radiology, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee.', ""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee.', ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee.', ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee.']",['eng'],"['P50 GM115279/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ALSAC/International', 'P50 GM115279/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181025,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Body Height/*drug effects', '*Body Mass Index', 'Body Weight/*drug effects', 'Child', 'Child Development/drug effects', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Overweight/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Pediatric Obesity/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",PMC6263845,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', '*body mass index (BMI)', '*children', '*height', '*weight.']",2018/10/26 06:00,2019/09/19 06:00,['2018/10/26 06:00'],"['2018/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/28 00:00 [revised]', '2018/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.31736 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2018 Nov 1;124(21):4248-4259. doi: 10.1002/cncr.31736.

Mitochondria play a key role during the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells by regulating the passage from a glycolytic to oxidative metabolism. The former is associated with cell proliferation and the latter with cell differentiation. Oxidative metabolism, which occurs inside mitochondria, is sustained by the respiratory chain, where complex IV is copper-dependent. We have hypothesized that a copper deficiency induces a mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming, favoring cell expansion over cell differentiation in erythropoiesis. Erythroid progression analysis of the bone marrow of mice fed with a copper deficient diet and of the in vitro erythropoiesis of human CD34+ cells treated with a bathocuproine - a copper chelator - showed a major expansion of progenitor cells and a decreased differentiation. Under copper deficiency, mitochondria switched to a higher membrane potential, lower oxygen consumption rate and lower ROS levels as compared with control cells. In addition, mitochondrial biomass was increased and an up-regulation of the mitochondrial fusion protein mitofusin 2 was observed. Most copper-deficient phenotypes were mimicked by the pharmacological inhibition of complex IV with azide. We concluded that copper deficiency induced a mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming, making hematopoietic stem cells favor progenitor cell expansion over cell differentiation.","['Jensen, Erik L', 'Gonzalez-Ibanez, Alvaro M', 'Mendoza, Pierina', 'Ruiz, Lina M', 'Riedel, Claudia A', 'Simon, Felipe', 'Schuringa, Jan J', 'Elorza, Alvaro A']","['Jensen EL', 'Gonzalez-Ibanez AM', 'Mendoza P', 'Ruiz LM', 'Riedel CA', 'Simon F', 'Schuringa JJ', 'Elorza AA']","['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Faculty of Life Sciences, Universidad Andres Bello, 8370146, Santiago, Chile. alvaro.elorza@unab.cl.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Metallomics,Metallomics : integrated biometal science,101478346,"['0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Copper/metabolism', 'Erythropoiesis/genetics/physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/metabolism']",,,,2018/10/26 06:00,2020/05/06 06:00,['2018/10/26 06:00'],"['2018/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/06 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/c8mt00224j [doi]'],ppublish,Metallomics. 2019 Feb 20;11(2):282-290. doi: 10.1039/c8mt00224j.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this setting, the use of bispecific T-cell-engager antibodies (BiTEs), such as blinatumomab, which harness the cytotoxic activity of T cells against CD19-positive lymphoblasts, has emerged as a most promising and impactful strategy. Areas covered: This review discusses the main structural and functional features of BiTEs, as well as the current status of their clinical application in childhood ALL. Moreover, future prospects to increase the efficacy of BiTEs are addressed. Expert commentary: The promising results obtained in patients with advanced BCP-ALL pave the way for further improvement in the context of less resistant/advanced disease. Future research is rapidly progressing on several aspects, including the use of blinatumomab in first-line protocols, identification of factors predicting response, use of combinatorial approaches and bioengineering of new molecules with dual specificity or increased potency, stability and half-life. The results of these studies, expected to be available in the next future, will provide further advancement in the development of effective, impactful, targeted immunotherapy for treatment of childhood BCP-ALL, with the concrete potential to revolutionize the clinical practice.","['Algeri, Mattia', 'Del Bufalo, Francesca', 'Galaverna, Federica', 'Locatelli, Franco']","['Algeri M', 'Del Bufalo F', 'Galaverna F', 'Locatelli F']","['a Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology , IRCCS, Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu , Rome , Italy.', 'a Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology , IRCCS, Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu , Rome , Italy.', 'a Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology , IRCCS, Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu , Rome , Italy.', 'a Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology , IRCCS, Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu , Rome , Italy.', 'b Department of Pediatrics , University of Pavia , Pavia , Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20181108,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4FR53SIF3A (blinatumomab)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD19/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*bispecific T-cell engagers', '*blinatumomab', '*immunotherapy', '*minimal residual disease', '*refractory', '*relapsed']",2018/10/26 06:00,2019/09/19 06:00,['2018/10/26 06:00'],"['2018/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2018.1540928 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2018 Dec;11(12):945-956. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2018.1540928.

Once it is suspected, ATRA should be started. Appreciation of APL details is critical, but an experienced hematopathologist may not be available. We developed an algorithm, based on the parameters generated by automated blood cell counter ADVIA 2120i Siemens that can aid the diagnosis of APL. METHODS: All parameters in the algorithm were selected on the bases of the pathophysiology of the APL and the analyzer's technology. We used c1 cutoff: PLT < 150 x 10(3) ; % Mono<10; % LUC<4; % hyperchromic cells > 2; %saturated cells >/= 1; % blasts > 4. Satisfying at least five of six cutoffs, we obtained an ""APL criteria"". It was tested on 247.209 raw-data from routine and emergency samples and on 124 raw-data from APL. We performed a multiparametric analyses and obtained definitive cutoffs (c2). It was validated on a new group of 51.002 raw-data from routine and emergency. Finally, it was tested on AML and ALL, MDS, MPN, oncologic samples, and hemolytic and megaloblastic anemia. RESULTS: The algorithm provided a high sensitivity (86.30%) and high specificity (99.83%) in APL with high or normal number of WBC and satisfactory results in APL with cytopenia (80%). The specificity was very high also in groups of hematological and nonhematological diseases. It can be used as an ""APL criteria"" to alert pathologists of the possible presence of APL. It together with instrumental and classical morphology may allow to reduce the time of diagnosis with further reduction in early death.","['Rocco, Vincenzo', 'Castelli, Christian', 'Fumi, Maurizio', 'Mancini, Francesca', 'Pancione, Ylenia', 'Prisciandaro, Michele', 'Sale, Silvia', 'Tanca, Donatella', 'Vagnoni, Davide']","['Rocco V', 'Castelli C', 'Fumi M', 'Mancini F', 'Pancione Y', 'Prisciandaro M', 'Sale S', 'Tanca D', 'Vagnoni D']","['Clinical Patology Laboratory, A.O.R.N.

However, only few studies exist on young adulthood (YA) cancer survivors' mental health outcomes. In our study, we examined first time antidepressant (AD) medication purchases of childhood and YA cancer patients compared to siblings. The first time AD medication purchases of 7,093 cancer patients aged 0-34 years at diagnosis and a sibling cohort (N = 26,882) were retrieved from the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela) since 1.1.1993. Cancer patients diagnosed between 1.1.1994 and 31.12.2004 were identified from the Finnish Cancer Registry and sibling controls via the Population Registry Centre. Statistical analyses were performed via the Cox regression model, and the hazard ratios (HR) were adjusted for age and gender. Increased hazard ratios for AD purchases were found in the younger (0-19 years at cancer diagnosis) [HR 5.2, 95%CI (3.7-7.2)] and older (age 20-34 years at cancer diagnosis) [HR 4.5, 95%CI (3.9-5.2)] cancer patient groups compared to siblings. The gender effect was similar in patients and controls, showing that females have higher risk for AD purchases than males. Males in the younger patient group had highest HR (5.6) for AD purchases compared to siblings. Patients with sarcoma or CNS tumor in the younger age group and leukemia or CNS malignancy in the older age group had the highest risk for AD medication purchases. The frequency and risk for AD purchases has been increasing during recent decades in both cancer patient age groups compared to siblings.

The Blast Phase is diagnosed when blasts are >/=20% of the peripheral blood white cell count or of bone marrow nucleated cells or when there is an extramedullary blast proliferation. Megakaryocytic blast crisis as the presenting manifestation of CML is extremely rare and only 7 reported cases were found in the literature. Out of 34 cases of CML-Blast Phase between April 2015 and June 2016, 3 cases showed megakaryocytic differentiation. 2 of these presented in Blast phase as the first manifestation of CML and the third case was a known case of CML-Chronic phase. Flow cytometric immunophenotyping was performed on peripheral blood/bone marrow using 6- color flow cytometer Navios. On CD45 vs SSC two distinct populations of blasts were seen in two cases and single population in the third case. All the 3 cases were positive for CD61, cCD41, cCD61 confirming the megakaryocytic lineage. The clinical features, morphologic and cytogenetic findings help in the identification and distinction of megakaryocytic blast phase of CML from Acute Megakayoblastic Leukemia. The diagnosis of such rare presentation of CML is essential for determining the choice of treatment. Therefore including a megakaryocytic marker in the primary flow cytometry panel is important so that these cases are not under-diagnosed as Acute myeloid leukemia because of expression of CD13 and CD33 only.","['Khemka, Rashi', 'Gupta, Monica', 'Jena, Nehar Kanta']","['Khemka R', 'Gupta M', 'Jena NK']","['Department of Oncopathology, Delhi State Cancer Institute, Dilshad Garden, Delhi, 110095, India.', 'Department of Oncopathology, Delhi State Cancer Institute, Dilshad Garden, Delhi, 110095, India. drmonica123@gmail.com.', 'Department of Clinical Oncology, Delhi State Cancer Institute, Dilshad Garden, Delhi, 110095, India.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20181025,Switzerland,Pathol Oncol Res,Pathology oncology research : POR,9706087,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blast Crisis/metabolism/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Splenomegaly/metabolism/*pathology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Flowcytometric immunophenotyping', 'Megakaryocytic blast crisis']",2018/10/26 06:00,2019/12/31 06:00,['2018/10/26 06:00'],"['2018/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/31 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12253-018-0484-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s12253-018-0484-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Pathol Oncol Res. 2019 Jul;25(3):1253-1258. doi: 10.1007/s12253-018-0484-7.

In this study, we isolated total RNA from bone marrow mononuclear cells collected from 101 de novo AML patients and 27 healthy donors. After reverse transcription, quantitative real-time PCR was performed to detect BCL3 expression level. BCL3 mRNA level was significantly down-regulated in BMMCs of AML patients compared with healthy controls (P = 0.0015). BCL3 was showed a higher level in AML patients with poor-risk karyotypes than that of in patients with favorable/intermediate-risk karyotypes (P = 0.014). ROC analysis demonstrated that BCL3 could effectively differentiate AML patients from normal controls. Among the French-American-British (FAB) subtypes, the frequency of low BCL3 expression in M2 subtypes is significantly higher than that of in the other subtypes M1/M4/M5/M6/M7 (P = 0.006), and mildly lower in myelomonocytic/monocytic subtypes M4/M5 (P = 0.064) than those in M1/M2/M6/M7 subtypes. Chromosome analysis revealed that BCL3(low) patients had a remarkably higher frequency of t (8;21) abnormality (P = 0.0047) and lower frequency of normal karyotype (P = 0.0059) than BCL3(high) patients. BCL3(high) patients showed a significantly higher frequency of FLT3-ITD mutation (P = 0.028) and lower frequency of C-Kit mutation (P = 0.0232) than BCL3(low) patients. Although there were no significant differences in complete remission and overall survival between BCL3(low) and BCL3(high) groups, patients with high BCL3 expression markedly shorter overall survival (OS, P = 0.049), relapse-free survival (RFS, P = 0.027) and disease-free survival (DFS, P = 0.042) in M2 AML than low BCL3 expression patients. Additionally, in AMLs of M2 subtype, high BCL3 expression patients had markedly lower complete remission (CR) rate (P = 0.0317) after the second induction treatment than patients with BCL3 low expression. Thus, these findings indicated that BCL3 appeared as a promising molecular biomarker of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia with unfavorable prognosis.","['Niu, Yuna', 'Yang, Xue', 'Chen, Yifei', 'Zhang, Linbo', 'Jin, Xinyue', 'Tang, Youjing', 'Li, Li', 'Yu, Lu', 'Guo, Yilin', 'Wang, Hui']","['Niu Y', 'Yang X', 'Chen Y', 'Zhang L', 'Jin X', 'Tang Y', 'Li L', 'Yu L', 'Guo Y', 'Wang H']","[""Henan Collaborative Innovation Center of Molecular Diagnosis and Laboratory Medicine, School of Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, Henan, 453003, People's Republic of China."", ""Henan Key Laboratory of Immunology and Targeted Therapy, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, Henan, 453003, People's Republic of China."", ""Henan Collaborative Innovation Center of Molecular Diagnosis and Laboratory Medicine, School of Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, Henan, 453003, People's Republic of China."", ""Henan Key Laboratory of Immunology and Targeted Therapy, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, Henan, 453003, People's Republic of China."", ""Henan Collaborative Innovation Center of Molecular Diagnosis and Laboratory Medicine, School of Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, Henan, 453003, People's Republic of China."", ""Henan Key Laboratory of Immunology and Targeted Therapy, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, Henan, 453003, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, the Third Affiliated Hospital Of Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, Henan, 453003, People's Republic of China."", ""Henan Collaborative Innovation Center of Molecular Diagnosis and Laboratory Medicine, School of Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, Henan, 453003, People's Republic of China."", ""Henan Key Laboratory of Immunology and Targeted Therapy, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, Henan, 453003, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinxiang Medical University, Weihui, Henan, 453003, People's Republic of China."", ""Henan Collaborative Innovation Center of Molecular Diagnosis and Laboratory Medicine, School of Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, Henan, 453003, People's Republic of China."", ""Henan Key Laboratory of Immunology and Targeted Therapy, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, Henan, 453003, People's Republic of China."", ""Henan Collaborative Innovation Center of Molecular Diagnosis and Laboratory Medicine, School of Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, Henan, 453003, People's Republic of China."", ""Henan Key Laboratory of Immunology and Targeted Therapy, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, Henan, 453003, People's Republic of China."", ""Henan Collaborative Innovation Center of Molecular Diagnosis and Laboratory Medicine, School of Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, Henan, 453003, People's Republic of China."", ""Henan Key Laboratory of Immunology and Targeted Therapy, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, Henan, 453003, People's Republic of China."", ""Henan Collaborative Innovation Center of Molecular Diagnosis and Laboratory Medicine, School of Laboratory Medicine, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, Henan, 453003, People's Republic of China. huiwang65@yeah.net."", ""Henan Key Laboratory of Immunology and Targeted Therapy, Xinxiang Medical University, Xinxiang, Henan, 453003, People's Republic of China. huiwang65@yeah.net.""]",['eng'],"['81701554/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81471559/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '162300410213/Natural Science Foundation of Henan Province']",['Journal Article'],20181025,Switzerland,Pathol Oncol Res,Pathology oncology research : POR,9706087,"['0 (B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein)', '0 (BCL3 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis']",PMC6449485,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'BCL3', 'Expression', 'Prognosis']",2018/10/26 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2018/10/26 06:00'],"['2018/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12253-018-0476-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s12253-018-0476-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Pathol Oncol Res. 2019 Apr;25(2):541-548. doi: 10.1007/s12253-018-0476-7.

The product, discovered at the National Cancer Institute, is an optimised version of immunotoxin CAT-3888. Moxetumomab pasudotox is composed of the Fv fragment of an anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody fused to a 38 kDa fragment of Pseudomonas exotoxin A, PE38. The Fv portion of moxetumomab pasudotox binds to CD22, a cell surface receptor expressed on a variety of malignant B-cells, thereby delivering the toxin moiety PE38 directly to tumour cells. Once internalised, PE38 catalyses the ADP ribosylation of the diphthamide residue in elongation factor-2 (EF-2), resulting in the rapid fall in levels of the anti-apoptotic protein myeloid cell leukaemia 1 (Mcl-1), leading to apoptotic cell death. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of moxetumomab pasudotox leading to this first approval for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory hairy cell leukaemia who received at least two prior systemic therapies, including treatment with a purine nucleoside analogue. Development of moxetumomab pasudotox for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and precursor cell lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma was discontinued.","['Dhillon, Sohita']",['Dhillon S'],"['Springer, Private Bag 65901, Mairangi Bay, Auckland, 0754, New Zealand. dru@adis.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (CD22 protein, human)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', '2NDX4B6N8F (immunotoxin HA22)']",,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological', '*Bacterial Toxins/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', '*Exotoxins/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Immunotoxins/administration & dosage/adverse effects/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/antagonists & inhibitors']",PMC6323103,,,2018/10/26 06:00,2019/07/31 06:00,['2018/10/26 06:00'],"['2018/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40265-018-1000-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s40265-018-1000-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Drugs. 2018 Nov;78(16):1763-1767. doi: 10.1007/s40265-018-1000-9.,,,,,,,,,,,['Drugs. 2019 Jan;79(1):105.

Here we investigated its prevalence in pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALL), where SFs are not mutated. By comparing these samples to normal pro-B cells, we found thousands of aberrant local splice variations (LSVs) per sample, with 279 LSVs in 241 genes present in every comparison. These genes were enriched in RNA processing pathways and encoded approximately 100 SFs, e.g. hnRNPA1. HNRNPA1 3'UTR was most pervasively mis-spliced, yielding the transcript subject to nonsense-mediated decay. To mimic this event, we knocked it down in B-lymphoblastoid cells and identified 213 hnRNPA1-regulated exon usage events comprising the hnRNPA1 splicing signature in pediatric leukemia. Some of its elements were LSVs in DICER1 and NT5C2, known cancer drivers. We searched for LSVs in other leukemia and lymphoma drivers and discovered 81 LSVs in 41 additional genes. Seventy-seven LSVs out of 81 were confirmed using two large independent B-ALL RNA-seq datasets, and the twenty most common B-ALL drivers, including NT5C2, showed higher prevalence of aberrant splicing than of somatic mutations. Thus, post-transcriptional deregulation of SF can drive widespread changes in B-ALL splicing and likely contributes to disease pathogenesis.","['Black, Kathryn L', 'Naqvi, Ammar S', 'Asnani, Mukta',

In maintenance therapy, drug doses of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and methotrexate (MTX) are adjusted to achieve sustained antileukemic activity without excessive myelosuppression.

However, conventional centrifugation and immunofluorescence-based separation methods are inaccurate and inconvenient due to the overlapping cell size and density or complex marking processes. Herein, we report a new label-free technology for precise leukocyte subpopulation separation by synergy of acoustic and optical technologies. Standing surface acoustic wave (SSAW) solved the problem of gentle and precise focusing of cells in optical systems. In addition, SSAW was used for the separation of granulocytes, which have evident size distinction from other components. In case of lymphocytes and monocytes, which have overlap in size/density, optical force could distinguish them accurately based on the RI difference, with the convenience of acoustic pre-focusing. In this experiment, separation of three types of leukocyte subtypes with considerable throughput and purity was conducted, through which we obtained 99% pure lymphocytes, 98% pure monocytes, and 95% pure granulocytes. Experimental results prove that the device has robust ability in separating leukocyte phenotypes and have the advantages of being non-invasive, label-free and precise. In the future, this convenient hybrid method will be a potential powerful tool for auxiliary clinical diagnosis and analysis.","['Hu, X J', 'Liu, H L', 'Jin, Y X', 'Liang, L', 'Zhu, D M', 'Zhu, X Q', 'Guo, S S', 'Zhou, F L', 'Yang, Y']","['Hu XJ', 'Liu HL', 'Jin YX', 'Liang L', 'Zhu DM', 'Zhu XQ', 'Guo SS', 'Zhou FL', 'Yang Y']","['Key Laboratory of Artificial Micro and Nano Structures of Ministry of Education, School of Physics & Technology, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China. yangyiys@whu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Lab Chip,Lab on a chip,101128948,,IM,"['Acoustics/*instrumentation', 'Cell Separation/*instrumentation', 'Humans', '*Lab-On-A-Chip Devices', 'Leukocytes/*cytology', '*Optical Devices']",,,,2018/10/26 06:00,2019/01/22 06:00,['2018/10/26 06:00'],"['2018/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/22 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/c8lc00911b [doi]'],ppublish,Lab Chip. 2018 Nov 6;18(22):3405-3412. doi: 10.1039/c8lc00911b.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A Case Report.,261,10.3389/fped.2018.00261 [doi],"A 73-days old infant of 34 weeks' gestation was hospitalized with a co-infection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and Bordetella pertussis (BP). She required invasive ventilation for 9 days in the context of malignant pertussis with persistent hypoxemia and hypercapnia secondary to a leukemoid reaction. Despite an increase of white blood cell (WBC) count up to 70 G/L and ensuing pulmonary hypertension, no hemodynamic compromise occurred. Without clear indication for leukapheresis nor exchange transfusion, an off-label treatment with hydroxyurea was given for 5 days with gradual decrease of WBC count, without any complication and hospital discharge on day 29. To our knowledge, no effective therapy for malignant pertussis has been described in the literature and complications are frequent with leukoreduction procedures. We discuss an alternative to invasive procedures in young infants to fulfill the need to decrease rapidly leukocyte counts in a leukemoid reaction associated with Bordetella pertussis infection. To our knowledge, hydroxyurea has never been used in malignant pertussis but is a well-known medication for oncologic and hematologic diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia or sickle cell anemia. Its effects in this setting are not well understood but the positive outcome in our patient supports the need for further studies.","['Maitre, Guillaume', 'Schaffner, Damien', 'Natterer, Julia', 'Longchamp, David', 'Ferry, Thomas', 'Diezi, Manuel', 'Di Bernardo, Stefano', 'Perez, Marie-Helene', 'Amiet, Vivianne']","['Maitre G', 'Schaffner D', 'Natterer J', 'Longchamp D', 'Ferry T', 'Diezi M', 'Di Bernardo S', 'Perez MH', 'Amiet V']","['Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Pediatric Onco-Hematology Unit, Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Pediatric Cardiology Unit, Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20180926,Switzerland,Front Pediatr,Frontiers in pediatrics,101615492,,,,PMC6190881,['NOTNLM'],"['bordetella pertussis', 'hydroxyurea', 'hyperleukocytosis', 'leukemoid reaction', 'white blood cell count']",2018/10/26 06:00,2018/10/26 06:01,['2018/10/26 06:00'],"['2018/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/26 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fped.2018.00261 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pediatr. 2018 Sep 26;6:261. doi: 10.3389/fped.2018.00261. eCollection 2018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two CPP microcrystals, namely monoclinic and triclinic CPP dihydrates (m- and t-CPPD), have been identified in human tissues in different proportions according to clinical features. m-CPP tetrahydrate beta (m-CPPTbeta) and amorphous CPP (a-CPP) phases are considered as m- and t-CPPD crystal precursors in vitro. Objectives: We aimed to decipher the inflammatory properties of the three crystalline phases and one amorphous CPP phase and the intracellular pathways involved. Methods: The four synthesized CPP phases and monosodium urate crystals (MSU, as a control) were used in vitro to stimulate the human monocytic leukemia THP-1 cell line or bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) isolated from WT or NLRP3 KO mice. The gene expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines was evaluated by quantitative PCR; IL-1beta, IL-6 and IL-8 production by ELISA; and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation by immunoblot analysis. NF-kappaB activation was determined in THP-1 cells containing a reporter plasmid. In vivo, the inflammatory potential of CPP phases was assessed with the murine air pouch model via cell analysis and production of IL-1beta and CXCL1 in the exudate. The role of NF-kappaB was determined by a pharmacological approach, both in vivo and in vitro. Results: In vitro, IL-1beta production induced by m- and t-CPPD and m-CPPTbeta crystals was NLRP3 inflammasome dependent. m-CPPD crystals were the most inflammatory by inducing a faster and higher production and gene expression of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-8 than t-CPPD, m-CPPTbeta and MSU crystals. The a-CPP phase did not show an inflammatory property. Accordingly, m-CPPD crystals led to stronger activation of NF-kappaB, p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) MAPKs. Inhibition of NF-kappaB completely abrogated IL-1beta and IL-8 synthesis and secretion induced by all CPP crystals. Also, inhibition of JNK and ERK1/2 MAPKs decreased both IL-1beta secretion and NF-kappaB activation induced by CPP crystals. In vivo, IL-1beta and CXCL1 production and neutrophil infiltration induced by m-CPPD crystals were greatly decreased by NF-kappaB inhibitor treatment. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the inflammatory potential of different CPP crystals relies on their ability to activate the MAPK-dependent NF-kappaB pathway. Studies are ongoing to investigate the underlying mechanisms.","['Campillo-Gimenez, Laure', 'Renaudin, Felix', 'Jalabert, Maud', 'Gras, Pierre', 'Gosset, Marjolaine', 'Rey, Christian', 'Sarda, Stephanie', 'Collet, Corinne', 'Cohen-Solal, Martine', 'Combes, Christele', 'Liote, Frederic', 'Ea, Hang-Korng']","['Campillo-Gimenez L', 'Renaudin F', 'Jalabert M', 'Gras P', 'Gosset M', 'Rey C', 'Sarda S', 'Collet C', 'Cohen-Solal M', 'Combes C', 'Liote F', 'Ea HK']","['INSERM, UMR-S 1132, Universite Paris Diderot (UFR Medecine), Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'INSERM, UMR-S 1132, Universite Paris Diderot (UFR Medecine), Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'INSERM, UMR-S 1132, Universite Paris Diderot (UFR Medecine), Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'CIRIMAT, Universite de Toulouse, CNRS, INPT-ENSIACET, Toulouse, France.', 'EA2496 Orofacial Pathologies, Imaging and Biotherapies, Dental School Faculty, Universite Paris Descartes PRES Sorbonne Paris Cite, Montrouge, France.', 'CIRIMAT, Universite de Toulouse, CNRS, INPT-ENSIACET, Toulouse, France.', 'CIRIMAT, Universite de Toulouse, CNRS, Universite Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', 'INSERM, UMR-S 1132, Universite Paris Diderot (UFR Medecine), Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Service de Biochimie, AP-HP, Hopital Lariboisiere, Paris, France.', 'INSERM, UMR-S 1132, Universite Paris Diderot (UFR Medecine), Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Service de Rhumatologie, AP-HP, Hopital Lariboisiere, Paris, France.', 'CIRIMAT, Universite de Toulouse, CNRS, INPT-ENSIACET, Toulouse, France.', 'INSERM, UMR-S 1132, Universite Paris Diderot (UFR Medecine), Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Service de Biochimie, AP-HP, Hopital Lariboisiere, Paris, France.', 'INSERM, UMR-S 1132, Universite Paris Diderot (UFR Medecine), Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Service de Rhumatologie, AP-HP, Hopital Lariboisiere, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181009,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', 'X69NU20D19 (Calcium Pyrophosphate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium Pyrophosphate/chemistry/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Crystallization', 'Cytokines/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Inflammation Mediators/chemistry/immunology/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*immunology', 'Macrophages/immunology/metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'NF-kappa B/*immunology/metabolism', 'THP-1 Cells']",PMC6189479,['NOTNLM'],"['*CPP crystals', '*IL-1beta', '*MAP kinase signaling', '*NF-kappaB pathway', '*NLRP3 inflammasome', '*macrophages', '*microcrystal-induced arthritis']",2018/10/26 06:00,2019/10/01 06:00,['2018/10/26 06:00'],"['2018/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2018.02248 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2018 Oct 9;9:2248. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.02248. eCollection 2018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SS is defined as adenopathy, erythroderma with high numbers of atypical T cells. This offers an opportunity for new interventions and perhaps antibody-based therapeutic by virtue of its high expression of the TNFR2 oncogene on the tumor cells and on T-regulatory cells (Tregs). Potent human-directed TNFR2 antagonistic antibodies have been created that preferentially target the TNFR2 oncogene and tumor-infiltrating TNFR2(+) Tregs. Here we test the therapeutic potential of TNFR2 antagonists on freshly isolated lymphocytes from patients with Stage IVA SS and from healthy controls. SS patients were on a variety of end-stage multi-drug therapies. Baseline burden Treg/T effector (Teff) ratios and the responsiveness of tumor and infiltrating Tregs to TNFR2 antibody killing was studied. We show dose-escalating concentrations of a dominant TNFR2 antagonistic antibody killed TNFR2(+) SS tumor cells and thus restored CD26(-) subpopulations of lymphocyte cell numbers to normal. The abundant TNFR2(+) Tregs of SS subjects are also killed with TNFR2 antagonism. Beneficial and rapid expansion of Teff was observed. The combination of Treg inhibition and Teff expansion brought the high Treg/Teff ratio to normal. Our findings suggest a marked responsiveness of SS tumor cells and Tregs, to targeting with TNFR2 antagonistic antibodies. These results show TNFR2 antibodies are potent and efficacious in vitro.","['Torrey, H', 'Khodadoust, M', 'Tran, L', 'Baum, D', 'Defusco, A', 'Kim, Y H', 'Faustman, D L']","['Torrey H', 'Khodadoust M', 'Tran L', 'Baum D', 'Defusco A', 'Kim YH', 'Faustman DL']","['Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Building 149, 13th Street, Rm 3602, 02129, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Stanford University School of Medicine/Cancer Institute, 94305, Palo Alto, CA, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Building 149, 13th Street, Rm 3602, 02129, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Building 149, 13th Street, Rm 3602, 02129, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Building 149, 13th Street, Rm 3602, 02129, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Stanford University School of Medicine/Cancer Institute, 94305, Palo Alto, CA, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Building 149, 13th Street, Rm 3602, 02129, Boston, MA, USA.

Single beam acoustic (SBA) tweezers are a promising technology for the quantification of the mechanical phenotype of cells. Our previous study showed that SBA tweezers can be used to quantify the deformability of adherent breast cancer cell lines. The physical properties of patient-derived (primary) pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells involved in chemotherapeutic resistance have not been widely investigated. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of analyzing primary pre-B ALL cells from four cases using SBA tweezers. ALL cells showed increased deformability with increasing acoustic pressure of the SBA tweezers. Moreover, ALL cells that are resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs were more deformable than were untreated ALL cells. We demonstrated that SBA tweezers can quantify the deformability of nonadherent leukemia cells and discriminate this mechanical phenotype in chemotherapy-resistant leukemia cells in a contact- and label-free manner.","['Liu, Hsiao-Chuan', 'Gang, Eun Ji', 'Kim, Hye Na', 'Lim, Hae Gyun', 'Jung, Hayong', 'Chen, Ruimin', 'Abdel-Azim, Hisham', 'Shung, K Kirk', 'Kim, Yong-Mi']","['Liu HC', 'Gang EJ', 'Kim HN', 'Lim HG', 'Jung H', 'Chen R', 'Abdel-Azim H', 'Shung KK', 'Kim YM']","['Department of Biomedical Engineering and NIH Ultrasonic Transducer Resource Center, University of Southern California, 1042 Downey Way, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, USA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology, Oncology, Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, University of Southern California, 4650 Sunset Blvd, Los Angeles, CA, 90027, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology, Oncology, Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, University of Southern California, 4650 Sunset Blvd, Los Angeles, CA, 90027, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology, Oncology, Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, University of Southern California, 4650 Sunset Blvd, Los Angeles, CA, 90027, USA."", 'Department of Creative IT Engineering and Future IT Innovation Laboratory, Pohang University of Science and Technology, 77 Cheongam-ro, Nam-gu, Pohang, Gyeongbuk, 37673, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering and NIH Ultrasonic Transducer Resource Center, University of Southern California, 1042 Downey Way, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering and NIH Ultrasonic Transducer Resource Center, University of Southern California, 1042 Downey Way, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, USA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology, Oncology, Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, University of Southern California, 4650 Sunset Blvd, Los Angeles, CA, 90027, USA."", 'Department of Biomedical Engineering and NIH Ultrasonic Transducer Resource Center, University of Southern California, 1042 Downey Way, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, USA. kkshung@usc.edu.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology, Oncology, Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, University of Southern California, 4650 Sunset Blvd, Los Angeles, CA, 90027, USA. ymkim@chla.usc.edu.""]",['eng'],['R01 CA172896/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20181024,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,,IM,"['Acoustics', '*Biomechanical Phenomena', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Shape', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Elasticity', 'Humans', '*Optical Tweezers', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Single-Cell Analysis']",PMC6200731,,,2018/10/26 06:00,2019/11/19 06:00,['2018/10/26 06:00'],"['2018/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-018-34024-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-018-34024-3 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2018 Oct 24;8(1):15708. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-34024-3.,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5410-8821', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4182-7130', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5338-359X']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies reveal the Sox17 gene as a downstream target of the Pgr-Gata2-dependent transcription network that directs genomic actions in the uterine endometrium receptive for embryo implantation. Here, we report that ablating Sox17 in the uterine epithelium impairs leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and Indian hedgehog homolog (IHH) signaling, leading to failure of embryo implantation. In vivo deletion of the SOX17-binding region 19 kb upstream of the Ihh locus by CRISPR-Cas technology reduces Ihh expression specifically in the uterus and alters proper endometrial epithelial-stromal interactions, thereby impairing pregnancy. This SOX17-binding interval is also bound by GATA2, FOXA2, and PGR. This cluster of transcription factor binding is common in 737 uterine genes and may represent a key regulatory element essential for uterine epithelial gene expression.","['Wang, Xiaoqiu', 'Li, Xilong', 'Wang, Tianyuan', 'Wu, San-Pin', 'Jeong, Jae-Wook', 'Kim, Tae Hoon', 'Young, Steven L', 'Lessey, Bruce A', 'Lanz, Rainer B', 'Lydon, John P', 'DeMayo, Francesco J']","['Wang X', 'Li X', 'Wang T', 'Wu SP', 'Jeong JW', 'Kim TH', 'Young SL', 'Lessey BA', 'Lanz RB', 'Lydon JP', 'DeMayo FJ']","['Reproductive and Development Biology Laboratory, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA.', 'Department of Animal Science, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Feed Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Integrative Bioinformatics Support Group, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA.', 'Reproductive and Development Biology Laboratory, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Reproductive Biology, Michigan State University, Grand Rapids, MI, USA.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Reproductive Biology, Michigan State University, Grand Rapids, MI, USA.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'Deptartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of South Carolina School of Medicine, Greenville, SC, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Reproductive and Development Biology Laboratory, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA. francesco.demayo@nih.gov.']",['eng'],"['R01 HD042311/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD067721/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HD-042311/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | NIH | Eunice Kennedy', 'Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', '(NICHD)/International', 'Z1AES103311-01/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | NIH | National', 'Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)/International']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20181024,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (Foxa2 protein, mouse)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata2 protein, mouse)', '0 (HMGB Proteins)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (SOXF Transcription Factors)', '0 (Sox17 protein, mouse)', '135845-92-0 (Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 3-beta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems/genetics/physiology', 'Endometrium/metabolism', 'Female', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'HMGB Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Hedgehog Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 3-beta/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'SOXF Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptome/genetics', 'Uterus/*metabolism']",PMC6200785,,,2018/10/26 06:00,2019/01/03 06:00,['2018/10/26 06:00'],"['2018/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-018-06652-w [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-018-06652-w [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2018 Oct 24;9(1):4421. doi: 10.1038/s41467-018-06652-w.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9660-528X'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The relapsed AML still remains a therapeutic challenge. AIM: To report the AML treatment results of the Bulgarian pediatric oncohematological centers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the treatment results of children and adolescents (age from 0 to 20 years) with primary AML. Unified AML BFM- backbone type treatment protocol is used. RESULTS: This study included 97 newly diagnosed patients (44 girls and 53 boys) with AML in Bulgaria between 2003 and 2016. The median age at diagnosis was 10.2 years. The most frequent FAB-morphologic subtype was M2 followed by M4. First complete remission (CR1) was achieved in 83 patients (85.6%). The 13-year EFS was 49%, while the overall survival (OS) was 54.6%. Twenty seven (27.8%) patients relapsed, with only 5 of them being still alive towards the end of the study period. CONCLUSION: The EFS and OS for the children with AML in Bulgaria are comparable with those reported by other European groups. The prognosis of relapsed AML remains still unfavorable for the past 13 years.","['Burnusuzov, Hasan A', 'Yordanova, Maya N', 'Avramova, Boryana E', 'Yurukova, Nadezhda N', 'Bachvarov, Konstantin N', 'Muchinova, Albena B', 'Vlahova, Irena H', 'Stoyanova, Angelina A', 'Mumdzhiev, Ivan N', 'Ivanova, Liliya R', 'Spasov, Neofit Y', 'Peteva, Elina Ts', 'Belcheva, Milena I', 'Hristozova, Hristina', 'Spasova, Mariya I', 'Kaleva, Valeriya I', 'Bobev, Dragan', 'Konstantinov, Dobrin N']","['Burnusuzov HA', 'Yordanova MN', 'Avramova BE', 'Yurukova NN', 'Bachvarov KN', 'Muchinova AB', 'Vlahova IH', 'Stoyanova AA', 'Mumdzhiev IN', 'Ivanova LR', 'Spasov NY', 'Peteva ET', 'Belcheva MI', 'Hristozova H', 'Spasova MI', 'Kaleva VI', 'Bobev D', 'Konstantinov DN']","['Department of Pediatrics and Medical Genetics, Medical University of Plovdiv, Plovdiv, Bulgaria.', ""Clinic of Children's Oncohematology and Transplantation, Queen Johanna University Hospital - ISUL, Sofia, Bulgaria."", ""Clinic of Children's Oncohematology and Transplantation, Queen Johanna University Hospital - ISUL, Sofia, Bulgaria."", ""Clinic of Children's Oncohematology and Transplantation, Queen Johanna University Hospital - ISUL, Sofia, Bulgaria."", ""Clinic of Children's Oncohematology and Transplantation, Queen Johanna University Hospital - ISUL, Sofia, Bulgaria."", ""Clinic of Children's Oncohematology and Transplantation, Queen Johanna University Hospital - ISUL, Sofia, Bulgaria."", ""Clinic of Children's Oncohematology and Transplantation, Queen Johanna University Hospital - ISUL, Sofia, Bulgaria."", 'Department of Pediatrics and Medical Genetics, Medical University of Plovdiv, Plovdiv, Bulgaria.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Medical Genetics, Medical University of Plovdiv, Plovdiv, Bulgaria.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Medical Genetics, Medical University of Plovdiv, Plovdiv, Bulgaria.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Medical Genetics, Medical University of Plovdiv, Plovdiv, Bulgaria.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Medical Genetics, Medical University, Varna, Bulgaria.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Medical Genetics, Medical University, Varna, Bulgaria.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Medical Genetics, Medical University, Varna, Bulgaria.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Medical Genetics, Medical University of Plovdiv, Plovdiv, Bulgaria.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Medical Genetics, Medical University, Varna, Bulgaria.', ""Clinic of Children's Oncohematology and Transplantation, Queen Johanna University Hospital - ISUL, Sofia, Bulgaria."", ""Clinic of Children's Oncohematology and Transplantation, Queen Johanna University Hospital - ISUL, Sofia, Bulgaria.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Bulgaria,Folia Med (Plovdiv),Folia medica,2984761R,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'PVDA protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/therapeutic use', 'Bulgaria/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'children', 'relapse']",2018/10/26 06:00,2019/11/05 06:00,['2018/10/26 06:00'],"['2017/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1515/folmed-2017-0090 [doi]', '/j/folmed.2017.60.issue-2/folmed-2017-0090/folmed-2017-0090.xml [pii]']",ppublish,Folia Med (Plovdiv). 2018 Jun 1;60(2):234-240. doi: 10.1515/folmed-2017-0090.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Isoform-selective IDH inhibitors suppress 2HG production and induce clinical responses in patients with IDH1- and IDH2-mutant malignancies. Despite the promising activity of IDH inhibitors, the mechanisms that mediate resistance to IDH inhibition are poorly understood. Here, we describe four clinical cases that identify mutant IDH isoform switching, either from mutant IDH1 to mutant IDH2 or vice versa, as a mechanism of acquired clinical resistance to IDH inhibition in solid and liquid tumors. SIGNIFICANCE: IDH-mutant cancers can develop resistance to isoform-selective IDH inhibition by ""isoform switching"" from mutant IDH1 to mutant IDH2 or vice versa, thereby restoring 2HG production by the tumor. These findings underscore a role for continued 2HG production in tumor progression and suggest therapeutic strategies to prevent or overcome resistance.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue

MLV glycoGag not only enhances MLV replication and disease progression but also increases human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infectivity as Nef does. Recently, SERINC5 (Ser5) was identified as the target for Nef, and the glycoGag Nef-like activity has been attributed to the Ser5 antagonism. Here, we investigated how glycoGag antagonizes Ser5 using MLV glycoMA and murine Ser5 proteins. We confirm previous observations that glycoMA relocalizes Ser5 from plasma membrane to perinuclear punctated compartments and the important role of its Y36XXL39 motif in this process. We find that glycoMA decreases Ser5 expression at steady-state levels and identify two other glycoGag crucial residues, P31 and R63, for the Ser5 downregulation. The glycoMA and Ser5 interaction is detected in live cells using a bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay. Ser5 is internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis and relocalized to Rab5(+) early, Rab7(+) late, and Rab11(+) recycling endosomes by glycoMA. Although glycoMA is not polyubiquitinated, the Ser5 downregulation requires Ser5 polyubiquitination via the K48- and K63-linkage, resulting in Ser5 destruction in lysosomes. Although P31, Y36, L39, and R63 are not required for glycoMA interaction with Ser5, they are required for Ser5 relocalization to lysosomes for destruction. In addition, although murine Ser1, Ser2, and Ser3 exhibit very poor antiviral activity, they are also targeted by glycoMA for lysosomal destruction. We conclude that glycoGag has a broad activity to downregulate SERINC proteins via the cellular endosome/lysosome pathway, which promotes viral replication.IMPORTANCE MLV glycoGag not only enhances MLV replication but also increases HIV-1 infectivity similarly as Nef. Recent studies have discovered that both glycoGag and Nef antagonize a novel host restriction factor Ser5 and promote viral replication. Compared to Nef, the glycoGag antagonism of Ser5 is still poorly understood. MLV glycoGag is a transmembrane version of the structural Gag protein with an extra 88-amino-acid leader region that determines its activity. We now show that glycoGag interacts with Ser5 in live cells and internalizes Ser5 via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Ser5 is polyubiquitinated and relocalized to endosomes and lysosomes for massive destruction. In addition to the previously identified tyrosine-based sorting signal, we find two more important residues for Ser5 relocalization and downregulation. We also find that the Ser5 sensitivity to glycoGag is conserved in the SERINC family. Together, our findings highlight the important role of endosome/lysosome pathway in the enhancement of viral replication by viral proteins.","['Li, Sunan', 'Ahmad, Iqbal', 'Shi, Jing', 'Wang, Bin', 'Yu, Changqing', 'Zhang, Lixin', 'Zheng, Yong-Hui']","['Li S', 'Ahmad I', 'Shi J', 'Wang B', 'Yu C', 'Zhang L', 'Zheng YH']","['Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, CAAS-Michigan State University Joint Laboratory of Innate Immunity, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, China.', 'Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, CAAS-Michigan State University Joint Laboratory of Innate Immunity, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, China.', 'Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, CAAS-Michigan State University Joint Laboratory of Innate Immunity, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, China.', 'Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, CAAS-Michigan State University Joint Laboratory of Innate Immunity, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, China.', 'Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, CAAS-Michigan State University Joint Laboratory of Innate Immunity, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, China.', 'Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, CAAS-Michigan State University Joint Laboratory of Innate Immunity, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, China.', 'Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, CAAS-Michigan State University Joint Laboratory of Innate Immunity, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, China zhengyo@msu.edu.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 AI120189/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI145504/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI122863/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI138707/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190104,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Adaptor Protein Complex 2)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Serinc5 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Adaptor Protein Complex 2/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Endocytosis', 'Gene Products, gag/*metabolism', 'Glycosylation', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Signal Transduction', 'Ubiquitination']",PMC6321930,['NOTNLM'],"['*HIV', '*MLV', '*Nef', '*SERINC5', '*glycoGag', '*restriction factor']",2018/10/26 06:00,2019/10/23 06:00,['2018/10/26 06:00'],"['2018/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/23 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01651-18 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01651-18 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2019 Jan 4;93(2). pii: JVI.01651-18. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01651-18.

To identify functional drivers of melanoma, we searched for cross-species conserved mutations utilizing a mouse melanoma model driven by loss of PTEN and CDKN2A, and identified mutations in Kras, Erbb3, and Ptpn11. PTPN11 encodes the SHP2 protein tyrosine phosphatase that activates the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway. Although PTPN11 is an oncogene in leukemia, lung, and breast cancers, its roles in melanoma are not clear. In this study, we found that PTPN11 is frequently activated in human melanoma specimens and cell lines and is required for full RAS/RAF/MAPK signaling activation in BRAF wild-type (either NRAS mutant or wild-type) melanoma cells. PTPN11 played oncogenic roles in melanoma by driving anchorage-independent colony formation and tumor growth. In Pten- and Cdkn2a-null mice, tet-inducible and melanocyte-specific PTPN11(E76K) expression significantly enhanced melanoma tumorigenesis. Melanoma cells derived from this mouse model showed doxycycline-dependent tumor growth in nude mice. Silencing PTPN11(E76K) expression by doxycycline withdrawal caused regression of established tumors by induction of apoptosis and senescence, and suppression of proliferation. Moreover, the PTPN11 inhibitor (SHP099) also caused regression of NRAS(Q61K) -mutant melanoma. Using a quantitative tyrosine phosphoproteomics approach, we identified GSK3alpha/beta as one of the key substrates that were differentially tyrosine-phosphorylated in these experiments modulating PTPN11. This study demonstrates that PTPN11 plays oncogenic roles in melanoma and regulates RAS and GSK3beta signaling pathways. IMPLICATIONS: This study identifies PTPN11 as an oncogenic driver and a novel and actionable therapeutic target for BRAF wild-type melanoma.","['Hill, Kristen S', 'Roberts, Evan R', 'Wang, Xue', 'Marin, Ellen', 'Park, Taeeun D', 'Son, Sorany', 'Ren, Yuan', 'Fang, Bin', 'Yoder, Sean', 'Kim, Sungjune', 'Wan, Lixin', 'Sarnaik, Amod A', 'Koomen, John M', 'Messina, Jane L', 'Teer, Jamie K', 'Kim, Youngchul', 'Wu, Jie', 'Chalfant, Charles E', 'Kim, Minjung']","['Hill KS', 'Roberts ER', 'Wang X', 'Marin E', 'Park TD', 'Son S', 'Ren Y', 'Fang B', 'Yoder S', 'Kim S', 'Wan L', 'Sarnaik AA', 'Koomen JM', 'Messina JL', 'Teer JK', 'Kim Y', 'Wu J', 'Chalfant CE', 'Kim M']","['Department of Molecular Oncology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.', 'Department of Proteomics, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.', 'Molecular Genomics Core, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.', 'Department of Immunology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.', 'Department of Radiology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.', 'Department of Cutaneous Oncology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.', 'Department of Proteomics, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.', 'Department of Cutaneous Oncology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.', 'Department of Pathology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.', 'Peggy and Charles Stephenson Cancer Center, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida.', 'Department of Research Service, James A.

There is a need to understand how driver mutations influence clonal evolution of leukemia. The E26-transformation-specific (ETS) transcription factors PU.1 and Spi-B (encoded by Spi1 and Spib) execute a critical role in B-cell development and serve as complementary tumor suppressors. Here, we used a mouse model to conditionally delete Spi1 and Spib genes in developing B cells. These mice developed B-ALL with a median time to euthanasia of 18 weeks. We performed RNA and whole-exome sequencing (WES) on leukemias isolated from Mb1-CreDeltaPB mice and identified single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in Jak1, Jak3, and Ikzf3 genes, resulting in amino acid sequence changes. Jak3 mutations resulted in amino acid substitutions located in the pseudo-kinase (R653H, V670A) and in the kinase (T844M) domains. Introduction of Jak3 T844M into Spi1/Spib-deficient precursor B cells was sufficient to promote proliferation in response to low IL-7 concentrations in culture, and to promote proliferation and leukemia-like disease in transplanted mice. We conclude that mutations in Janus kinases represent secondary drivers of leukemogenesis that cooperate with Spi1/Spib deletion. This mouse model represents a useful tool to study clonal evolution in B-ALL.","['Batista, Carolina R', 'Lim, Michelle', 'Laramee, Anne-Sophie', 'Abu-Sardanah, Faisal', 'Xu, Li S', 'Hossain, Rajon', 'Bell, Gillian I', 'Hess, David A', 'DeKoter, Rodney P']","['Batista CR', 'Lim M', 'Laramee AS', 'Abu-Sardanah F', 'Xu LS', 'Hossain R', 'Bell GI', 'Hess DA', 'DeKoter RP']","['Department of Microbiology & Immunology and.', 'Centre for Human Immunology, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, Western University, London, ON, Canada.', ""Division of Genetics and Development, Children's Health Research Institute, Lawson Research Institute, London, ON, Canada; and."", 'Department of Microbiology & Immunology and.', 'Centre for Human Immunology, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, Western University, London, ON, Canada.', ""Division of Genetics and Development, Children's Health Research Institute, Lawson Research Institute, London, ON, Canada; and."", 'Department of Microbiology & Immunology and.', 'Centre for Human Immunology, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, Western University, London, ON, Canada.', ""Division of Genetics and Development, Children's Health Research Institute, Lawson Research Institute, London, ON, Canada; and."", 'Department of Microbiology & Immunology and.', 'Centre for Human Immunology, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, Western University, London, ON, Canada.', ""Division of Genetics and Development, Children's Health Research Institute, Lawson Research Institute, London, ON, Canada; and."", 'Department of Microbiology & Immunology and.', 'Centre for Human Immunology, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, Western University, London, ON, Canada.', ""Division of Genetics and Development, Children's Health Research Institute, Lawson Research Institute, London, ON, Canada; and."", 'Department of Microbiology & Immunology and.', 'Centre for Human Immunology, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, Western University, London, ON, Canada.', ""Division of Genetics and Development, Children's Health Research Institute, Lawson Research Institute, London, ON, Canada; and."", ""Division of Genetics and Development, Children's Health Research Institute, Lawson Research Institute, London, ON, Canada; and."", 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Molecular Medicine Research Laboratories, Krembil Centre for Stem Cell Biology, Robarts Research Institute, London, ON, Canada.', ""Division of Genetics and Development, Children's Health Research Institute, Lawson Research Institute, London, ON, Canada; and."", 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Molecular Medicine Research Laboratories, Krembil Centre for Stem Cell Biology, Robarts Research Institute, London, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Microbiology & Immunology and.', 'Centre for Human Immunology, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, Western University, London, ON, Canada.', ""Division of Genetics and Development, Children's Health Research Institute, Lawson Research Institute, London, ON, Canada; and.""]",['eng'],"['MOP-10651 /CIHR/Canada', 'MOP-137414/CIHR/Canada']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Ikzf3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-7)', '0 (Spi-B protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism/transplantation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor', 'Interleukin-7/pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 1/chemistry/*genetics', 'Janus Kinase 3/chemistry/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/*genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-7/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Trans-Activators/chemistry/*genetics']",PMC6234372,,,2018/10/26 06:00,2019/09/20 06:00,['2018/10/26 06:00'],"['2018/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/20 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2018019950 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2018019950 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2018 Nov 13;2(21):2798-2810. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018019950.,,,['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the combination of SSZ with other physical modalities remains unexplored. Here, the effects of SSZ on cold atmospheric helium plasma (He-CAP), which produces approximately 24 x higher concentration of hydroxyl radicals (. OH) compared to X-irradiation (IR) in aqueous solution, and on IR-induced apoptosis in human leukemia Molt-4 cells were studied to elucidate the mechanism of apoptosis enhancement. Both the Annexin V-FITC/PI and DNA fragmentation assay revealed that pre-treatment of cells with SSZ significantly enhanced He-CAP and IR-induced apoptosis. Similar enhancement was observed during the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, intracellular Ca(2+) ions, and mitochondria- and endoplasmic reticulum-related proteins. The concentration of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was much higher in He-CAP treated cells than in X-irradiated cells. On the other hand, strong enhancement of Fas expression and caspase-8 and -3 activities were only observed in X-irradiated cells. It might be possible that the higher concentration of intracellular and extracellular ROS suppressed caspase activities and Fas expression in He-CAP-treated cells. Notably, pretreating the cells with an antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) dramatically decreased apoptosis in cells treated by He-CAP, but not by IR. These results suggest that IR-induced apoptosis is due to specific and effective ROS distribution since intracellular ROS formation is marginal and the high production of ROS inside and outside of cells plays unique roles in He-CAP induced apoptosis. We conclude that our data provides efficacy and mechanistic insights for SSZ, which might be helpful for establishing SSZ as a future sensitizer in He-CAP or IR therapy for cancer.","['Moniruzzaman, Rohan', 'Rehman, Mati Ur', 'Zhao, Qing-Li', 'Jawaid, Paras', 'Mitsuhashi, Yohei', 'Imaue, Shuichi', 'Fujiwara, Kumiko', 'Ogawa, Ryohei', 'Tomihara, Kei', 'Saitoh, Jun-Ichi', 'Noguchi, Kyo', 'Kondo, Takashi', 'Noguchi, Makoto']","['Moniruzzaman R', 'Rehman MU', 'Zhao QL', 'Jawaid P', 'Mitsuhashi Y', 'Imaue S', 'Fujiwara K', 'Ogawa R', 'Tomihara K', 'Saitoh JI', 'Noguchi K', 'Kondo T', 'Noguchi M']","['Department of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery, Graduate School of Medicine & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan; Department of Radiology, Graduate School of Medicine & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'Department of Radiology, Graduate School of Medicine & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'Department of Radiology, Graduate School of Medicine & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'Department of Radiology, Graduate School of Medicine & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'Department of Radiology, Graduate School of Medicine & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'Department of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery, Graduate School of Medicine & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'Department of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery, Graduate School of Medicine & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'Department of Radiology, Graduate School of Medicine & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'Department of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery, Graduate School of Medicine & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'Department of Radiology, Graduate School of Medicine & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'Department of Radiology, Graduate School of Medicine & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.', 'Department of Radiology, Graduate School of Medicine & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama 930-0194, Japan.

Despite tremendous progress regarding the transcriptional hierarchy underlying transdifferentiation, the enablers of the concomitant epigenome resetting remain to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the role of KMT2A and KMT2B, two histone H3 lysine 4 methylases with cardinal roles in development, through individual and combined inactivation. We found that Kmt2b, whose human homolog's mutations cause dystonia, is selectively required for iN conversion through suppression of the alternative myocyte program and induction of neuronal maturation genes. The identification of KMT2B-vulnerable targets allowed us, in turn, to expose, in a cohort of 225 patients, 45 unique variants in 39 KMT2B targets, which represent promising candidates to dissect the molecular bases of dystonia.","['Barbagiovanni, Giulia', 'Germain, Pierre-Luc', 'Zech, Michael', 'Atashpaz, Sina', 'Lo Riso, Pietro', ""D'Antonio-Chronowska, Agnieszka"", 'Tenderini, Erika', 'Caiazzo, Massimiliano', 'Boesch, Sylvia', 'Jech, Robert', 'Haslinger, Bernhard', 'Broccoli, Vania', 'Stewart, Adrian Francis', 'Winkelmann, Juliane', 'Testa, Giuseppe']","['Barbagiovanni G', 'Germain PL', 'Zech M', 'Atashpaz S', 'Lo Riso P', ""D'Antonio-Chronowska A"", 'Tenderini E', 'Caiazzo M', 'Boesch S', 'Jech R', 'Haslinger B', 'Broccoli V', 'Stewart AF', 'Winkelmann J', 'Testa G']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, IEO, European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, 20139 Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, IEO, European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, 20139 Milan, Italy.', 'Institut fur Neurogenomik, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, 85764 Munich, Germany; Klinik und Poliklinik fur Neurologie, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, 81675 Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, IEO, European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, 20139 Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, IEO, European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, 20139 Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, IEO, European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, 20139 Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, IEO, European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, 20139 Milan, Italy.', 'San Raffaele Scientific Institute, 20132 Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Neurology, Medical University Innsbruck, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Neurology and Center of Clinical Neuroscience, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and General Faculty Hospital, 12821 Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Klinik und Poliklinik fur Neurologie, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, 81675 Munich, Germany.', 'San Raffaele Scientific Institute, 20132 Milan, Italy; National Research Council (CNR), Institute of Neuroscience, 20129 Milan, Italy.', 'Genomics, Biotechnology Center, Center for Molecular and Cellular Bioengineering, Technische Universitat Dresden, 01069 Dresden, Germany.', 'Institut fur Neurogenomik, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, 85764 Munich, Germany; Lehrstuhl fur Neurogenetik und Institut fur Humangenetik, Technische Universitat Munchen, 81675 Munich, Germany; Munich Cluster for Systems Neurology, SyNergy, 81829 Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, IEO, European Institute of Oncology IRCCS, 20139 Milan, Italy; Department of Oncology and Hemato-Oncology, University of Milan, 20122 Milan, Italy.

PARP-1 (poly[ADP-ribose] polymerase 1) is a nuclear enzyme, which plays a critical role in vascular diseases. We hypothesized that PARP-1 inhibition might have protective effects on AAA. In vivo, Ang II (angiotensin II) was continuously infused by a micropump for 28 days to induce AAA in mice. In vitro, aortic endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells were stimulated by Ang II for 24 hours. Ang II infusion increased PARP-1 expression and activity and successfully induced AAA formation partly with a hemorrhage in ApoE(-/-) mice. Genetic deletion of PARP-1 markedly reduced the AAA incidence, abdominal aortic diameter, macrophage infiltration, ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) and VCAM-1 (vascular adhesion molecule 1) expression, and MMP (matrix metalloproteinase) expression, as well as MMP activity; but increased smooth muscle cells content and collagens expression in AAA. PARP-1 inhibition by PJ-34 also exerted a protective effect on AAA in mice. In aortic endothelial cells, Ang II-induced oxidative stress and DNA damage, resulting in increased PARP-1 expression and activity. Compared with the control, Ang II increased TNF-alpha (tumor necrosis factor alpha) and IL-6 (interleukin-6) secretions, ICAM-1 expression and THP-1 (human acute monocytic leukemia cell line) cells adhesion, while PARP-1 inhibition by siRNA reduced the inflammatory response probably through inhibition of the phosphorylation of ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), NF-kappaB (nuclear factor-kappaB), and Akt signaling pathways. In smooth muscle cells, Ang II promoted cell migration, proliferation, and apoptosis, reduced collagens expression, but increased MMPs expression, while PARP-1 deletion alleviated these effects partly by reducing NF-kappaB-targeted MMP-9 expression. PARP-1 inhibition might be a feasible strategy for the treatment of AAA.","['Liang, Er-Shun', 'Bai, Wen-Wu', 'Wang, Hao', 'Zhang, Jian-Ning', 'Zhang, Fan', 'Ma, Yang', 'Jiang, Fan', 'Yin, Mei', 'Zhang, Ming-Xiang', 'Chen, Xiao-Mei', 'Qin, Wei-Dong']","['Liang ES', 'Bai WW', 'Wang H', 'Zhang JN', 'Zhang F', 'Ma Y', 'Jiang F', 'Yin M', 'Zhang MX', 'Chen XM', 'Qin WD']","['From the The Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Remodeling and Function Research, Chinese Ministry of Education and Chinese Ministry of Public Health, Department of Cardiology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China (E.-s.L., F.J., M.-x.Z.).', 'Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China (W.-w.B.).', 'Department of Critical Care Medicine, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China (H.W., J.-n.Z., F.Z., Y.M., X.-m.C., W.-d.Q.).', 'Department of Critical Care Medicine, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China (H.W., J.-n.Z., F.Z., Y.M., X.-m.C., W.-d.Q.).', 'Department of Critical Care Medicine, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China (H.W., J.-n.Z., F.Z., Y.M., X.-m.C., W.-d.Q.).', 'Department of Critical Care Medicine, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China (H.W., J.-n.Z., F.Z., Y.M., X.-m.C., W.-d.Q.).', 'From the The Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Remodeling and Function Research, Chinese Ministry of Education and Chinese Ministry of Public Health, Department of Cardiology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China (E.-s.L., F.J., M.-x.Z.).', 'The State and Shandong Province Joint Key Laboratory of Translational Cardiovascular Medicine, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China (F.J.).', 'Department of Physiology and Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China (F.J.).', 'Department of Geriatrics, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China (M.Y.).', 'From the The Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Remodeling and Function Research, Chinese Ministry of Education and Chinese Ministry of Public Health, Department of Cardiology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China (E.-s.L., F.J., M.-x.Z.).', 'Department of Critical Care Medicine, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China (H.W., J.-n.Z., F.Z., Y.M., X.-m.C., W.-d.Q.).', 'Department of Critical Care Medicine, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China (H.W., J.-n.Z., F.Z., Y.M., X.-m.C., W.-d.Q.).']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Hypertension,"Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)",7906255,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '11128-99-7 (Angiotensin II)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)']",IM,"['Angiotensin II', 'Animals', 'Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal/chemically induced/metabolism/*prevention & control', 'Blood Pressure/drug effects/*physiology', 'Collagen/metabolism', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Endothelial Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myocytes, Smooth Muscle/drug effects/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*angiotensin II', '*aortic aneurysm', '*endothelial cells', '*matrix metalloproteinases', '*oxidative stress']",2018/10/26 06:00,2019/05/14 06:00,['2018/10/26 06:00'],"['2018/10/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.118.11184 [doi]'],ppublish,Hypertension. 2018 Nov;72(5):1189-1199. doi: 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.118.11184.,,,,,,['Hypertension. 2018 Nov;72(5):1087-1089.

However, the molecular mechanisms of its effects in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) remain elusive. We show that CLL cells are sensitive to CUDC-907, even under conditions similar to the protective microenvironment of proliferation centres. CUDC-907 inhibited PI3K/AKT and HDAC activity, as expected, but also suppressed RAF/MEK/ERK and STAT3 signalling and reduced the expression of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins BCL-2, BCL-xL, and MCL-1. Moreover, CUDC-907 downregulated cytokines BAFF and APRIL and their receptors BAFFR, TACI, and BCMA, thus blocking BAFF-induced NF-kappaB signalling. T cell chemokines CCL3/4/17/22 and phosphorylation of CXCR4 were also reduced by CUDC-907. These data indicated that CUDC-907 abrogates different protective signals and suggested that it might sensitize CLL cells to other drugs. Indeed, combinations of low concentrations of CUDC-907 with inhibitors of BCL2, BTK, or the NF-kappaB pathway showed a potent synergistic effect. Our data indicate that, apart from its known functions, CUDC-907 blocks multiple pro-survival pathways to overcome microenvironment protection in CLL cells.

PCNSL recurs within the central nervous system (CNS) in most relapsed cases, whereas extra-CNS relapse is experienced in rare cases. The present study aimed at identifying the presence of common precursor cells (CPC) for primary intra- and relapsed extra-CNS tumors, and further assessing the initiating events in bone marrow (BM). Targeted deep sequencing was carried out for five paired primary intra- and relapsed extra-CNS tumors of PCNSL. Two to five mutations were shared by each pair of intra- and extra-CNS tumors. In particular, MYD88 mutations, L265P in three and P258L in one, were shared by four pairs. Unique somatic mutations were observed in all five intra-CNS tumors and in four out of five extra-CNS tumors. Remarkably, IgH clones in the intra- and the extra-CNS tumors in two pairs were distinct from each other, whereas one pair of tumors shared identical monoclonal IgH rearrangement. In a cohort of 23 PCNSL patients, L265P MYD88 mutations were examined in tumor-free BM mononuclear cells (MNC) in which the PCNSL tumors had L265P MYD88 mutations. L265P MYD88 mutations were detected by a droplet digital PCR method in nine out of 23 bone marrow mononuclear cells. These results suggest that intra- and extra-tumors are derived from CPC with MYD88 mutations in most PCNSL, arising either before or after IgH rearrangement. The initiating MYD88 mutations may occur during B-cell differentiation in BM.","['Hattori, Keiichiro', 'Sakata-Yanagimoto, Mamiko', 'Kusakabe, Manabu', 'Nanmoku, Toru', 'Suehara, Yasuhito', 'Matsuoka, Ryota', 'Noguchi, Masayuki', 'Yokoyama, Yasuhisa', 'Kato, Takayasu', 'Kurita, Naoki', 'Nishikii, Hidekazu', 'Obara, Naoshi', 'Takano, Shingo', 'Ishikawa, Eiichi', 'Matsumura, Akira', 'Muratani, Masafumi', 'Hasegawa, Yuichi', 'Chiba, Shigeru']","['Hattori K', 'Sakata-Yanagimoto M', 'Kusakabe M', 'Nanmoku T', 'Suehara Y', 'Matsuoka R', 'Noguchi M', 'Yokoyama Y', 'Kato T', 'Kurita N', 'Nishikii H', 'Obara N', 'Takano S', 'Ishikawa E', 'Matsumura A', 'Muratani M', 'Hasegawa Y', 'Chiba S']","['Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, University of Tsukuba Hospital, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Department of Genome Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.']",['eng'],"['16H02660/Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, and Science of Japan', '18H02134/Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, and Science of Japan', 'Kobayashi Foundation for Cancer Research', 'Leukemia Research Fund', 'Takeda Science Foundation for Cancer Research']",['Journal Article'],20181118,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88/genetics/metabolism', '*Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology']",PMC6317941,['NOTNLM'],"['IgH rearrangement', 'L265P MYD88', 'bone marrow', 'common precursor cell', 'primary central nervous system lymphoma']",2018/10/26 06:00,2019/01/15 06:00,['2018/10/25 06:00'],"['2018/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/12 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/15 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.13848 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2019 Jan;110(1):401-407. doi: 10.1111/cas.13848.

Leukemic transformation (LT) from a pre-existing MPN carries a dismal prognosis. Here, we review recent genetic, biological, and clinical data regarding LT. RECENT FINDINGS: In the last decade, DNA sequencing has revolutionized our understanding of the genomic landscape of LT. Mutations in TP53, ASXL1, EZH2, IDH1/2, and SRSF2 are significantly associated with increased risk of LT of MPNs. Preclinical modeling of these mutations is underway and has yielded important biological insights, some of which have therapeutic implications. Recent progress has led to the identification of recurrent genomic alterations in patients with LT. This has allowed mechanistic and therapeutic insight into the process of LT. In turn, this may lead to more mechanism-based therapeutic strategies that may improve patient outcomes.","['Li, Bing', 'Mascarenhas, John O', 'Rampal, Raajit K']","['Li B', 'Mascarenhas JO', 'Rampal RK']","['Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Ave, Box 443, New York, NY, 10022, USA.', 'MDS and MPN Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Ave, Box 443, New York, NY, 10022, USA.

Due to its importance, a clinical practice guideline for fertility preservation in childhood and AYA cancer patients was published by the Japan Society of Clinical Oncology (JSCO) in 2017. Although the precise mechanisms remain unclear, several studies reported that the cancer itself, not the cancer treatment, adversely affected semen quality. It is reported that that poor pretreatment semen quality is commonly seen in various cancer types including testicular cancer, leukemia, brain tumor, and sarcoma. Fortunately, however, even men with poor sperm quality can be candidates for sperm cryopreservation due to recent advances in assisted reproductive technology (ART) and sperm banking techniques. Therefore, the JSCO guideline and others recommend that sperm cryopreservation should be considered as early as possible when patients are planning to undergo treatment that may render them infertile. The previous studies showed that testicular cancer and hematological tumors are the two leading types of cancer among patients who requested sperm cryopreservation. This is followed by bone and soft-tissue tumors and central nervous system tumors and others.

Both cytokines share common gamma-chain receptors and downstream signaling pathways. T-LGLL is characterized by clonal expansion of cytotoxic T cells and is associated with abnormal JAK/STAT signaling. ATL is an aggressive CD4+ T-cell neoplasm associated with HTLV-1. T-LGLL and ATL share dependence on IL-2 and IL-15 for survival and both diseases lack effective therapies. BNZ-1 is a pegylated peptide designed to specifically bind the gammac receptor to selectively block IL-2, IL-15, and IL-9 signaling. We hypothesized that treatment with BNZ-1 would reduce cytokine-mediated proliferation and viability. Our results demonstrated that in vitro treatment of a T-LGLL cell line and ex vivo treatment of T-LGLL patient cells with BNZ-1 inhibited cytokine-mediated viability. Furthermore, BNZ-1 blocked downstream signaling and increased apoptosis. These results were mirrored in an ATL cell line and in ex vivo ATL patient cells. Lastly, BNZ-1 drastically reduced leukemic burden in an IL-15-driven human ATL mouse xenograft model. Thus, BNZ-1 shows great promise as a novel therapy for T-LGLL, ATL, and other IL-2 or IL-15 driven hematopoietic malignancies.","['Wang, T Tiffany', 'Yang, Jun', 'Zhang, Yong', 'Zhang, Meili', 'Dubois, Sigrid', 'Conlon, Kevin C', 'Tagaya, Yutaka', 'Hamele, Cait E', 'Dighe, Shubha', 'Olson, Thomas L', 'Feith, David J', 'Azimi, Nazli', 'Waldmann, Thomas A', 'Loughran, Thomas P Jr']","['Wang TT', 'Yang J', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhang M', 'Dubois S', 'Conlon KC', 'Tagaya Y', 'Hamele CE', 'Dighe S', 'Olson TL', 'Feith DJ', 'Azimi N', 'Waldmann TA', 'Loughran TP Jr']","['University of Virginia Cancer Center and Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology & Oncology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, 22908, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center and Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology & Oncology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, 22908, USA.', 'Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA.', 'Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA.', 'Laboratory Animal Science Program, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., Frederick, MD, 21702, USA.', 'Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA.', 'Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA.', 'BIONIZ Therapeutics, Irvine, CA, 92618, USA.', 'Cell Biology Laboratory, Division of Basic Science, Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, 21201, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center and Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology & Oncology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, 22908, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center and Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology & Oncology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, 22908, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center and Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology & Oncology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, 22908, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center and Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology & Oncology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, 22908, USA.', 'BIONIZ Therapeutics, Irvine, CA, 92618, USA.', 'Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA. tawald@mail.nih.gov.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center and Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology & Oncology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, 22908, USA.

Inactivation of PP2A is due to the cooperative action of the phosphorylation of Y307 of its catalytic subunit by the aberrant cytosolic pool of the Src Family Kinase Lyn and the interaction with its protein inhibitor SET, which is overexpressed in CLL. In this study, we developed a library of compounds, the most potent being the one named CC11, which restores PP2A activity by disrupting the PP2A/SET complex, thereby triggering the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. This process involves the recruitment of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins Bad and Bim to mitochondria, the former upon direct dephosphorylation and the latter being newly expressed upon dephosphorylation and activation of its transcription factor FoxO3a. These findings highlight that PP2A antagonizes the prosurvival pathways controlled by Akt, which phosphorylates and thereby suppresses a variety of pro-apoptotic factors and tumour suppressors including Bad and FoxO3a. Furthermore, the PP2A-mediated pro-apoptotic effect of CC11 is synergistically potentiated by the abrogation of Lyn's activity. Our results show that CC11 represents a promising lead compound for a new therapeutic rationale aimed at abrogating the aberrant oncogenic signals in CLL.","['Pagano, Mario Angelo', 'Tibaldi, Elena', 'Molino, Pierfrancesco', 'Frezzato, Federica', 'Trimarco, Valentina', 'Facco, Monica', 'Zagotto, Giuseppe', 'Ribaudo, Giovanni', 'Leanza, Luigi', 'Peruzzo, Roberta', 'Szabo, Ildiko', 'Visentin, Andrea', 'Frasson, Martina', 'Semenzato, Gianpietro', 'Trentin, Livio', 'Brunati, Anna Maria']","['Pagano MA', 'Tibaldi E', 'Molino P', 'Frezzato F', 'Trimarco V', 'Facco M', 'Zagotto G', 'Ribaudo G', 'Leanza L', 'Peruzzo R', 'Szabo I', 'Visentin A', 'Frasson M', 'Semenzato G', 'Trentin L', 'Brunati AM']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy. elena.tibaldi@unipd.it.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Centro di Eccellenza per la Ricerca Biomedica Avanzata, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Centro di Eccellenza per la Ricerca Biomedica Avanzata, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Centro di Eccellenza per la Ricerca Biomedica Avanzata, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Biology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Biology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Biology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'CNR Institute of Neuroscience, Padova, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Centro di Eccellenza per la Ricerca Biomedica Avanzata, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Centro di Eccellenza per la Ricerca Biomedica Avanzata, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy. livio.trentin@unipd.it.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Centro di Eccellenza per la Ricerca Biomedica Avanzata, Padua, Italy. livio.trentin@unipd.it.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181023,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (FOXO3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O3)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)']",,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytochromes c/genetics/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Forkhead Box Protein O3/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/*metabolism', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein/*metabolism']",,,,2018/10/26 06:00,2019/08/14 06:00,['2018/10/25 06:00'],"['2017/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/09/03 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0288-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0288-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 May;33(5):1148-1160. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0288-5.

This report is of a case of granulocytic sarcoma of the gallbladder and describes the approach to diagnosis and treatment. CASE REPORT A 74-year-old Hispanic woman from Ecuador presented to the emergency department with a five-day history of fever, jaundice, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. The right upper quadrant ultrasound showed a thickened gallbladder wall with cholelithiasis, a positive sonographic Murphy sign, and marked dilatation of the common bile duct, which was up to 17 mm in diameter. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) showed purulence and a stone in the common bile duct, which was removed. She underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy which identified gangrenous cholecystitis. Despite cholecystectomy and treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, she remained febrile with a leukocytosis of up to 80,000 cells/microL. Histopathology of the gallbladder showed infiltrating myeloblasts within the mucosa, submucosa, and muscularis consistent with a granulocytic sarcoma associated with gangrenous cholecystitis due to cholelithiasis. Immunohistochemistry, using a panel of antibodies to CD33, CD68, HLA-DR, and lysozyme, supported the diagnosis of granulocytic sarcoma or extramedullary acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AML M5). CONCLUSIONS A rare case of an extramedullary hematologic malignancy, granulocytic sarcoma of the gallbladder is presented, which highlights the importance of timely diagnosis and treatment, due to the high mortality rate associated with granulocytic sarcoma, or extramedullary AML.","['Holzwanger, Erik A', 'Alam, Zainab', 'Hsu, Emily', 'Hsu, Andrew', 'Mangano, Mark', 'Kathman, Deirdre L']","['Holzwanger EA', 'Alam Z', 'Hsu E', 'Hsu A', 'Mangano M', 'Kathman DL']","['Department of Internal Medicine, UMass Memorial Medical Center, Worcester, MA, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, UMass Memorial Medical Center, Worcester, MA, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, UMass Memorial Medical Center, Worcester, MA, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, UMass Memorial Medical Center, Worcester, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Milford Regional Medical Center, Milford, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pulmonary Critical Care Medicine, Milford Regional Medical Center, Milford, MA, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20181024,United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,,IM,"['Aged', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Gallbladder Neoplasms/*diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*diagnosis', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/*diagnosis']",PMC6213823,,,2018/10/26 06:00,2019/02/13 06:00,['2018/10/25 06:00'],"['2018/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/13 06:00 [medline]']","['911390 [pii]', '10.12659/AJCR.911390 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2018 Oct 24;19:1262-1266. doi: 10.12659/AJCR.911390.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Attempts to use atRA in breast cancer without a stratification strategy have resulted in limited overall effectiveness. To identify biomarkers for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) with atRA, we characterized the effects of atRA on the tumor growth of 13 TNBC cell lines. This resulted in a range of effects that was not predictable based on previously hypothesized predictors of response, such as the levels of atRA nuclear shuttling proteins fatty acid binding protein 5 (FABP5) and cellular retinoic acid binding protein 2 (CRABP2). Transcriptional profiling revealed that atRA induced distinct gene expression changes in the sensitive versus resistant cell lines that were mostly independent of the presence of retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) or peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs). Given the importance of DNA methylation in regulating gene expression, we hypothesized that differential DNA methylation could predict the response of TNBCs to atRA. We identified over 1400 sites that were differentially methylated between atRA resistant and sensitive cell lines. These CpG sites predicted the response of four TNBC patient-derived xenografts to atRA, and we utilized these xenografts to refine the profile and identified that as many as 17% of TNBC patients could benefit from atRA treatment. These data illustrate that differential methylation of specific CpGs may be useful biomarkers for predicting the response of patient tumors to atRA treatment.","['Coyle, Krysta Mila', 'Dean, Cheryl A', 'Thomas, Margaret Lois', 'Vidovic, Dejan', 'Giacomantonio, Carman A', 'Helyer, Lucy', 'Marcato, Paola']","['Coyle KM', 'Dean CA', 'Thomas ML', 'Vidovic D', 'Giacomantonio CA', 'Helyer L', 'Marcato P']","['Departments of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada. krysta.coyle@dal.ca.', 'Departments of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada. deanc@dal.ca.', 'Departments of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada. meg.thomas@dal.ca.', 'Departments of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada. dejan.vidovic@dal.ca.', 'Departments of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada. carman.giacomantonio@dal.ca.', 'Departments of Surgery, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada. carman.giacomantonio@dal.ca.', 'Departments of Surgery, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada. lhelyer@dal.ca.', 'Departments of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada. paola.marcato@dal.ca.', 'Departments of Microbiology & Immunology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada. paola.marcato@dal.ca.']",['eng'],"['MOP-130304/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada', 'no number/Breast Cancer Society of Canada', 'no number/Beatrice Hunter Cancer Research Institute', 'no number/QEII Foundation']",['Journal Article'],20181024,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC6266978,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA methylation', 'biomarkers', 'retinoic acid', 'triple-negative breast cancer']",2018/10/26 06:00,2018/10/26 06:01,['2018/10/25 06:00'],"['2018/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/18 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/26 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers10110397 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers10110397 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2018 Oct 24;10(11). pii: cancers10110397. doi: 10.3390/cancers10110397.,['ORCID: 0000-0001-8619-283X'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigated the oncogenic potential of Fgr using Rat-2 fibroblasts that do not express the kinase. Expression of either wild-type or regulatory tail-mutant constructs of Fgr promoted cellular transformation (inferred from colony formation in soft agar), which was accompanied by phosphorylation of the Fgr activation loop, suggesting that the kinase domain of Fgr functions independently of regulation by its noncatalytic SH3-SH2 region. Unlike other family members, recombinant Fgr was not activated by SH3-SH2 domain ligands. However, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry data suggested that the regulatory SH3 and SH2 domains packed against the back of the kinase domain in a Src-like manner. Sequence alignment showed that the activation loop of Fgr was distinct from that of all other Src family members, with proline rather than alanine at the +2 position relative to the activation loop tyrosine. Substitution of the activation loop of Fgr with the sequence from Src partially inhibited kinase activity and suppressed colony formation. Last, Fgr expression enhanced the sensitivity of human myeloid progenitor cells to the cytokine GM-CSF. Because its kinase domain is not sensitive to SH3-SH2-mediated control, simple overexpression of Fgr without mutation may contribute to oncogenic transformation in AML and other blood cancers.","['Shen, Kexin', 'Moroco, Jamie A', 'Patel, Ravi K', 'Shi, Haibin', 'Engen, John R', 'Dorman, Heather R', 'Smithgall, Thomas E']","['Shen K', 'Moroco JA', 'Patel RK', 'Shi H', 'Engen JR', 'Dorman HR', 'Smithgall TE']","['Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15219, USA.', 'Tsinghua University School of Medicine, Beijing 100084, China.', 'Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Northeastern University, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15219, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15219, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Northeastern University, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15219, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15219, USA. tsmithga@pitt.edu.']",['eng'],['F32 GM113356/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181023,United States,Sci Signal,Science signaling,101465400,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (proto-oncogene proteins c-fgr)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Peptides/chemistry', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'src Homology Domains', 'src-Family Kinases/*metabolism']",,,,2018/10/26 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2018/10/25 06:00'],"['2018/10/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['11/553/eaat5916 [pii]', '10.1126/scisignal.aat5916 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Signal. 2018 Oct 23;11(553). pii: 11/553/eaat5916. doi: 10.1126/scisignal.aat5916.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-9382-4436', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8250-5923', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8082-8654', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6918-9476', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1160-7065', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5238-3806']",,"['Copyright (c) 2018 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American', 'Association for the Advancement of Science.

To guide precision cancer treatment, we performed extensive biological characterization of the activity of PTC299 and demonstrated that inhibition of VEGF production and cell proliferation by PTC299 is linked to a decrease in uridine nucleotides by targeting dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), a rate-limiting enzyme for de novo pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis. Unlike previously reported DHODH inhibitors that were identified using in vitro enzyme assays, PTC299 is a more potent inhibitor of DHODH in isolated mitochondria suggesting that mitochondrial membrane lipid engagement in the DHODH conformation in situ is required for its optimal activity. PTC299 has broad and potent activity against hematologic cancer cells in preclinical models, reflecting a reduced pyrimidine nucleotide salvage pathway in leukemia cells. Archived serum samples from patients treated with PTC299 demonstrated increased levels of dihydroorotate, the substrate of DHODH, indicating target engagement in patients. PTC299 has advantages over previously reported DHODH inhibitors, including greater potency, good oral bioavailability, and lack of off-target kinase inhibition and myelosuppression, and thus may be useful for the targeted treatment of hematologic malignancies.","['Cao, Liangxian', 'Weetall, Marla', 'Trotta, Christopher', 'Cintron, Katherine', 'Ma, Jiyuan', 'Kim, Min Jung', 'Furia, Bansri', 'Romfo, Charles', 'Graci, Jason D', 'Li, Wencheng', 'Du, Joshua', 'Sheedy, Josephine', 'Hedrick, Jean', 'Risher, Nicole', 'Yeh, Shirley', 'Qi, Hongyan', 'Arasu, Tamil', 'Hwang, Seongwoo', 'Lennox, William', 'Kong, Ronald', 'Petruska, Janet', 'Moon, Young-Choon', 'Babiak, John', 'Davis, Thomas W', 'Jacobson, Allan', 'Almstead, Neil G', 'Branstrom, Art', 'Colacino, Joseph M', 'Peltz, Stuart W']","['Cao L', 'Weetall M', 'Trotta C', 'Cintron K', 'Ma J', 'Kim MJ', 'Furia B', 'Romfo C', 'Graci JD', 'Li W', 'Du J', 'Sheedy J', 'Hedrick J', 'Risher N', 'Yeh S', 'Qi H', 'Arasu T', 'Hwang S', 'Lennox W', 'Kong R', 'Petruska J', 'Moon YC', 'Babiak J', 'Davis TW', 'Jacobson A', 'Almstead NG', 'Branstrom A', 'Colacino JM', 'Peltz SW']","['PTC Therapeutics, Inc., South Plainfield, New Jersey. lcao@ptcbio.com.', 'PTC Therapeutics, Inc., South Plainfield, New Jersey.', 'PTC Therapeutics, Inc., South Plainfield, New Jersey.', 'PTC Therapeutics, Inc., South Plainfield, New Jersey.', 'PTC Therapeutics, Inc., South Plainfield, New Jersey.', 'PTC Therapeutics, Inc., South Plainfield, New Jersey.', 'PTC Therapeutics, Inc., South Plainfield, New Jersey.', 'PTC Therapeutics, Inc., South Plainfield, New Jersey.', 'PTC Therapeutics, Inc., South Plainfield, New Jersey.', 'PTC Therapeutics, Inc., South Plainfield, New Jersey.', 'PTC Therapeutics, Inc., South Plainfield, New Jersey.', 'PTC Therapeutics, Inc., South Plainfield, New Jersey.', 'PTC Therapeutics, Inc., South Plainfield, New Jersey.', 'PTC Therapeutics, Inc., South Plainfield, New Jersey.', 'PTC Therapeutics, Inc., South Plainfield, New Jersey.', 'PTC Therapeutics, Inc., South Plainfield, New Jersey.', 'PTC Therapeutics, Inc., South Plainfield, New Jersey.', 'PTC Therapeutics, Inc., South Plainfield, New Jersey.', 'PTC Therapeutics, Inc., South Plainfield, New Jersey.', 'PTC Therapeutics, Inc., South Plainfield, New Jersey.', 'PTC Therapeutics, Inc., South Plainfield, New Jersey.', 'PTC Therapeutics, Inc., South Plainfield, New Jersey.', 'PTC Therapeutics, Inc., South Plainfield, New Jersey.', 'PTC Therapeutics, Inc., South Plainfield, New Jersey.', 'Department of Microbiology and Physiological Systems, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts.', 'PTC Therapeutics, Inc., South Plainfield, New Jersey.', 'PTC Therapeutics, Inc., South Plainfield, New Jersey.', 'PTC Therapeutics, Inc., South Plainfield, New Jersey.', 'PTC Therapeutics, Inc., South Plainfield, New Jersey.']",['eng'],"['R35 GM122468/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 GM027757/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R43 CA108330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R44 CA108330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20181023,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Dihydroorotate Dehydrogenase)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '9R6QDF1UO7 (6-(4-fluorophenyl)-2,3-dihydro-5-(4-pyridinyl)imidazo(2,1-b)thiazole)', 'EC 1.3.- (Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dihydroorotate Dehydrogenase', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/blood/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Mice', 'Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors/*antagonists & inhibitors/blood', 'Thiazoles/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC6318026,,,2018/10/26 06:00,2019/11/26 06:00,['2018/10/25 06:00'],"['2018/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/22 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/26 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['1535-7163.MCT-18-0863 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-18-0863 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2019 Jan;18(1):3-16. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-18-0863.

This view has recently been challenged by the demonstration that CXXC domain of TET3 has relaxed sequence specificity and binds with the highest affinity to symmetric DNA duplex containing 5caCpG. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the MLL1-CXXC and TET3-CXXC sequence specificity and tolerance to cytosine modifications (5-methyl, 5-hydroxymethyl, 5-formyl, 5-carboxyl) in CpG and non-CpG context. For the first time, we take into consideration possible interference from cytosine bases elsewhere in the sequence. We show that despite similar overall structure, MLL1-CXXC has greater sequence and modification specificity than TET3-CXXC. MLL1-CXXC is specific only for CpG and does not tolerate any cytosine modifications. In contrast, TET3-CXXC does not require the CpG context of cytosine bases. Methyl-, formyl- and carboxyl-modifications are tolerated by TET3-CXXC, but only preceding G. Based on our and other data we propose a parsimonious model of MLL1-CXXC and TET3-CXXC DNA binding. This model explains why the binding of modified DNA duplexes by TET3-CXXC requires in some cases a register shift and is therefore context-dependent.","['Stroynowska-Czerwinska, Anna', 'Piasecka, Anna', 'Bochtler, Matthias']","['Stroynowska-Czerwinska A', 'Piasecka A', 'Bochtler M']","['International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology in Warsaw (IIMCB), Trojdena 4, 02-109 Warsaw, Poland.', 'International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology in Warsaw (IIMCB), Trojdena 4, 02-109 Warsaw, Poland.', 'International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology in Warsaw (IIMCB), Trojdena 4, 02-109 Warsaw, Poland; Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics PAS (IBB), Pawinskiego 5a, 02-106 Warsaw, Poland.

Distinct from DP thymocytes, phosphorylation and sumoylation of Bcl11b in DN cells were not oppositely regulated in response to activation of MAP kinase, even though hyper-phosphorylation of Bcl11b coincided with near complete desumoylation. Additionally, prolonged stimulation of the MAP kinase pathway in DN cells, unlike DP thymocytes, did not alter Bcl11b levels of sumoylation or ubiquitinylation, or stability. On the other hand, activation of Wnt-Gsk3-dependent signaling in DN cells resulted in composite dephosphorylation and sumoylation of Bcl11b. Moreover, stimulation of MAP kinase and (or) Wnt signaling pathways differentially affects gene expression of some Bcl11b target and maturation-associated genes. Defining the signaling pathways and regulation of sequence-specific transcription factors by PTMs at various stages of thymopoiesis may improve our understanding of leukemogenesis.","['Selman, Wisam Hussein', 'Esfandiari, Elahe', 'Filtz, Theresa M']","['Selman WH', 'Esfandiari E', 'Filtz TM']","['a Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon, USA.', 'b College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Al-Qadisiyah, Al Diwaniyah, Iraq.', 'a Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon, USA.', 'a Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181023,Canada,Biochem Cell Biol,Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire,8606068,"['0 (Bcl11b protein, mouse)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mice', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Thymocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Wnt Signaling Pathway']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*T-cell receptor (TCR)', '*Wnt', '*modification post-traductionnelle', '*post-translational modification (PTM)', '*recepteur des cellules T (TCR)', '*sumoylation', '*beta-catenin', '*beta-catenine']",2018/10/24 06:00,2019/04/18 06:00,['2018/10/24 06:00'],"['2018/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/18 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1139/bcb-2018-0132 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem Cell Biol. 2019 Apr;97(2):201-213. doi: 10.1139/bcb-2018-0132.

Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) spreads out in children's bodies rapidly and takes the life within a few weeks. To diagnose ALL, the hematologists perform blood and bone marrow examination. Manual blood testing techniques that have been used since long time are often slow and come out with the less accurate diagnosis. This work improves the diagnosis of ALL with a computer-aided system, which yields accurate result by using image processing and deep learning techniques. This research proposed a method for the classification of ALL into its subtypes and reactive bone marrow (normal) in stained bone marrow images. A robust segmentation and deep learning techniques with the convolutional neural network are used to train the model on the bone marrow images to achieve accurate classification results. Experimental results thus obtained and compared with the results of other classifiers Naive Bayesian, KNN, and SVM. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method achieved 97.78% accuracy. The obtained results exhibit that the proposed approach could be used as a tool to diagnose Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and its sub-types that will definitely assist pathologists.","['Rehman, Amjad', 'Abbas, Naveed', 'Saba, Tanzila', 'Rahman, Syed Ijaz Ur', 'Mehmood, Zahid', 'Kolivand, Hoshang']","['Rehman A', 'Abbas N', 'Saba T', 'Rahman SIU', 'Mehmood Z', 'Kolivand H']","['College of Computer and Information Systems, Al Yamamah University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Computer Science, Islamia College University Peshawar, Pakistan.', 'College of Computer and Information Sciences, Prince Sultan University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Computer Science, Islamia College University Peshawar, Pakistan.', 'Department of Software Engineering, University of Engineering and Technology Taxila, Pakistan.', 'Department of Computer Science, Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['[RG-CCIS-2017-06-02]/Prince Sultan University Riyadh KSA', 'RG-CCIS-2017-06-02/Machine Learning Research Group']",['Journal Article'],20181023,United States,Microsc Res Tech,Microscopy research and technique,9203012,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*pathology', '*Deep Learning', 'Hematologic Tests/*methods', 'Humans', 'Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/methods', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/methods', 'Neural Networks, Computer', 'Pattern Recognition, Automated/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*diagnosis/pathology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'bone marrow', 'deep learning', 'segmentation and classification']",2018/10/24 06:00,2019/01/29 06:00,['2018/10/24 06:00'],"['2018/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/25 00:00 [revised]', '2018/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/29 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jemt.23139 [doi]'],ppublish,Microsc Res Tech. 2018 Nov;81(11):1310-1317. doi: 10.1002/jemt.23139.

A further step in spectral pathology.,5711-5717,10.1039/c8an01634h [doi],"Over the last few years, great effort has been placed on developing Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy as a tool to help in the histopathological diagnosis of cancer. The ever increasing workload in pathology departments is calling for a technique that could identify the presence of cancer cells in cytology and tissue samples in an objective, fast and automated way. However, pathologists use glass slides which absorb infrared (IR) radiation thus removing important mid-IR spectral data in the fingerprint region (proteins, DNA, RNA; 1800 cm-1 to 900 cm-1). To this purpose, we hypothesised whether using thinner glass slides, i.e., glass coverslips, would allow us to obtain spectral data not only from the lipid region (3100 cm-1 to 2700 cm-1) but also from the fingerprint region. To this purpose, we studied peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), a leukaemia cell line (K562) and a lung cancer cell line (CALU-1). Cells were placed on DAKO coverslips and their FTIR spectra obtained at MIRAS beamline, Alba synchrotron light source (Barcelona, Catalonia). The data presented here not only shows for the first time that it is possible to obtain spectral data from most of the amide I region (1800 cm-1 to 1570 cm-1) of cells placed on glass coverslips but more important, principal component analysis was able to separate between the three types of cells for both the lipid and the amide I regions. The methodology here described is a further step in the application of FTIR microspectroscopy in histopathology departments.","['Rutter, A V', 'Crees, J', 'Wright, H', 'van Pittius, D G', 'Yousef, I', 'Sule-Suso, J']","['Rutter AV', 'Crees J', 'Wright H', 'van Pittius DG', 'Yousef I', 'Sule-Suso J']","['Keele University, Guy Hilton Research Centre, Thornburrow Drive, Stoke on Trent ST4 7QB, UK. josep.sulesuso@uhnm.nhs.uk.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Analyst,The Analyst,0372652,,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Glass/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared/*instrumentation']",,,,2018/10/24 06:00,2019/01/08 06:00,['2018/10/24 06:00'],"['2018/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/08 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/c8an01634h [doi]'],ppublish,Analyst. 2018 Nov 19;143(23):5711-5717. doi: 10.1039/c8an01634h.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to affecting differentiation during development and in the adult, BTG proteins play an important role in maintaining homeostasis under conditions of cellular stress. Genomic profiling of B-cell leukemia and lymphoma has put BTG1 and BTG2 in the spotlight, since both genes are frequently deleted or mutated in these malignancies, pointing towards a role as tumor suppressors. Moreover, in solid tumors, reduced expression of BTG1 or BTG2 is often correlated with malignant cell behavior and poor treatment outcome. Recent studies have uncovered novel roles for BTG1 and BTG2 in genotoxic and integrated stress responses, as well as during hematopoiesis. This review summarizes what is currently known about the roles of BTG1 and BTG2 in these and other cellular processes. In addition, we will highlight the molecular mechanisms and biological consequences of BTG1 and BTG2 deregulation during cancer progression and elaborate on the potential clinical implications of these findings.","['Yuniati, Laurensia', 'Scheijen, Blanca', 'van der Meer, Laurens T', 'van Leeuwen, Frank N']","['Yuniati L', 'Scheijen B', 'van der Meer LT', 'van Leeuwen FN']","['Laboratory of Pediatric Oncology, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Science, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Hubrecht Institute-KNAW, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Laboratory of Pediatric Oncology, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Science, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Laboratory of Pediatric Oncology, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Science, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Laboratory of Pediatric Oncology, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Science, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20181023,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '141490-22-4 (BTG2 protein, human)', '146835-72-5 (BTG1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC6587536,['NOTNLM'],"['*B-cell malignancies', '*BTG1', '*BTG2', '*antiproliferation', '*tumor suppressor']",2018/10/24 06:00,2020/03/31 06:00,['2018/10/24 06:00'],"['2017/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/31 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.27407 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2019 May;234(5):5379-5389. doi: 10.1002/jcp.27407.

TDM of oncology treatments with standard analytical methods, such as liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is, however, complex and demanding. This paper proposes a new method for quantitation of imatinib in human plasma, based on surface enhanced raman spectroscopy (SERS) and multivariate calibration using partial least-squares regression (PLSR). The best PLSR model was obtained with three latent variables in the range from 123 to 5000 ng/mL of imatinib, providing a standard error of prediction (SEP) of 510 ng/mL. The method was validated in accordance with international guidelines, through the estimate of figures of merit, such as precision, accuracy, systematic error, analytical sensitivity, limits of detection, and quantitation. Moreover, the feasibility and clinical utility of this approach have also been verified using real plasma samples taken from deidentified patients. The results were in good agreement with a clinically validated LC-MS/MS method. The new SERS method presented in this preliminary work showed simplicity, short analysis time, good sensitivity, and could be considered a promising platform for TDM of imatinib treatment in a point-of-care setting.","['Fornasaro, Stefano', 'Bonifacio, Alois', 'Marangon, Elena', 'Buzzo, Mauro', 'Toffoli, Giuseppe', 'Rindzevicius, Tomas', 'Schmidt, Michael Stenbaek', 'Sergo, Valter']","['Fornasaro S', 'Bonifacio A', 'Marangon E', 'Buzzo M', 'Toffoli G', 'Rindzevicius T', 'Schmidt MS', 'Sergo V']","['Department of Engineering and Architecture , University of Trieste , Via Valerio 6A , 34127 Trieste , Italy.', 'Department of Engineering and Architecture , University of Trieste , Via Valerio 6A , 34127 Trieste , Italy.', 'Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology Division , CRO Aviano-National Cancer Institute , Aviano , Italy.', 'Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology Division , CRO Aviano-National Cancer Institute , Aviano , Italy.', 'Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology Division , CRO Aviano-National Cancer Institute , Aviano , Italy.', 'Department of Micro- and Nanotechnology, DNRF and Villum Fonden Center for Intelligent Drug Delivery and Sensing Using Microcontainers and Nanomechanics , IDUN , Orsteds Plads , 2800 Kongens Lyngby , Denmark.', 'Department of Micro- and Nanotechnology, DNRF and Villum Fonden Center for Intelligent Drug Delivery and Sensing Using Microcontainers and Nanomechanics , IDUN , Orsteds Plads , 2800 Kongens Lyngby , Denmark.', 'Department of Engineering and Architecture , University of Trieste , Via Valerio 6A , 34127 Trieste , Italy.', 'Faculty of Health Sciences , University of Macau , Macau SAR , China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181012,United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*blood', 'Calibration', 'Drug Monitoring/methods', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*blood', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Limit of Detection', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Spectrum Analysis, Raman/*methods']",,,,2018/10/24 06:00,2019/04/30 06:00,['2018/10/24 06:00'],"['2018/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/30 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.analchem.8b02901 [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2018 Nov 6;90(21):12670-12677. doi: 10.1021/acs.analchem.8b02901.

This study proposed to determine the spectral differences between whole blood and plasma samples of healthy and leukemic subjects based on Raman spectroscopy (RS), correlating these differences with their resulting biochemical alterations and performing discriminant analysis of the samples (n = 38 whole blood and n = 40 plasma samples). Raman spectra were obtained using a dispersive Raman spectrometer (830-nm wavelength, 280-mW laser power, 30-s exposure time) with a Raman probe. The exploratory analysis based on principal component analysis (PCA) of the blood and plasma sample's spectra showed loading vectors with peaks related to amino acids, proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and carotenoids, being the spectral differences related to amino acids and proteins for whole blood samples, and mainly carotenoids for plasma samples. Discriminant models based on partial least squares (PLS) and PCA were developed and classified the spectra as healthy or leukemic, with sensitivity of 91.9% (PLS) and 83.9% (PCA), specificity of 100% (both PLS and PCA), and overall accuracy of 96.5% (PLS) and 93.0% (PCA) for the whole blood spectra. In plasma, the sensitivity was 95.7% (PLS) and 11.6% (PCA), specificity of 98% (PLS) and 100% (PCA), and overall accuracy of 97.1% (PLS) and 64.1% (PCA).

We describe the utility and limitations of a method of mechanically disaggregating BM trephine biopsies for FC. METHOD: Trephine biopsies mechanically disaggregated for FC between 2010 and 2016 were reviewed. We recorded cell yield, pathological findings, and turnaround time. Where available, results of trephine FC were compared with aspirate FC. RESULTS: Eighty BM trephine samples were processed, representing 4.3% of BM biopsies. Mechanical disaggregation yielded cellular samples in 98% of cases (median yield 3 x 10(6) nucleated cells). The most frequent diagnoses were B cell lymphoproliferative disorders (n = 26) and acute leukemia (n = 18). Trephine FC correlated with histochemistry findings in 94% of cases, but two Hodgkin lymphoma infiltrates were missed by FC, and trephine FC underestimated B cell infiltrate burden compared to immunohistochemistry (IHC). Fluorescence intensity of CD34 and CD45 on disease populations was similar in processed trephine and contemporaneous aspirate samples. Trephine FC results were available 2 days earlier than stained IHC slides. CONCLUSION: Mechanical disaggregation of BM trephine samples provided a cellular suspension suitable for diagnostic FC in most cases. Limitations were similar to aspirate FC: disease burden was underestimated and some infiltrates were missed. Trephine FC results were available earlier than trephine IHC. We conclude that trephine FC is a useful technique to complement trephine IHC in the event of a failed aspirate, providing rapid diagnostic immunophenotyping.

RECENT FINDINGS: TCF4 is a master regulator that drives donwstream transcriptional programs in BPDCN. In turn, TCF4 activity is dependent on the bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) protein BRD4 whose inhibition provides a promising therapeutic vulnerability. Notably, TCF4 expression is a highly sensitive marker for BPDCN and augments diagnostic specificity alongside CD4, CD56, CD123, and TCL1. The gene expression profile of BPDCN is characterized by aberrant NF-kappaB pathway activation, while its genomic landscape is dominated by structural chromosomal alterations involving ETV6, MYC, and NR3C1, as well as mutations in epigenetic regulators particularly TET2. Advances in elucidating the biological characteristics of BPDCN are resulting in a more refined diagnostic approach and are opening novel therapeutic avenues for patients with this disease.","['Khoury, Joseph D']",['Khoury JD'],"['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, MS-072, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. jkhoury@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,,IM,"['Dendritic Cells/*pathology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Humans']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute leukemia', '*Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm', '*CD123', '*Flow cytometry', '*Plasmacytoid dendritic cells', '*TCF4']",2018/10/24 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2018/10/24 06:00'],"['2018/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-018-0489-z [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-018-0489-z [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2018 Dec;13(6):477-483. doi: 10.1007/s11899-018-0489-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Disruption in miRNAs level is involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. The miR-155 has a role in primary differentiation of myeloid progenitor. Meanwhile, there is little knowledge about the effects of sulforaphane against leukemia. The present study tried to evaluate pathologic effect of miR-155 in patients in various subgroups of AML, and then pioneered in assessing miR-155 levels by the effect of sulforaphane in different AML cell lines. The miR-155 level was significantly higher in patients with AML compared to the controls. Interestingly, the increase in miR-155 was converged with raising the subtype of AML (from M1 to M5). The miR-155 levels increased by 1.2 times in patients with M1, but this increase reached 2.5 times in the patients in the M5 subgroup. Sulforaphane reduced the number of live cells and increased the mortality rate of AML cells particularly by induction of apoptosis. However, the anti-proliferative effect of this agent was more dominant and could dose-dependently lessen miR-155 levels in myeloid leukemia cells. More or less, about 80% reduction in miR-155 expression was almost observed after 48 h treatment with 60 microM sulforaphane in all four studied cell lines. The obtained results indicated that miR-155 might function as an oncomir in AML and can potentially be considered as a prognosis biomarker for AML. The anti-cancer effects of sulforaphane can be correlated with reduction of miR-155 levels. These findings suggested that sulforaphane could induce more differentiation in myeloid progenitor cells through controlling the miR-155, thereby mitigating the progress of AML.","['Koolivand, Mohsen', 'Ansari, Maryam', 'Piroozian, Fatemeh', 'Moein, Soheila', 'MalekZadeh, Kianoosh']","['Koolivand M', 'Ansari M', 'Piroozian F', 'Moein S', 'MalekZadeh K']","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences, Bandar Abbas, Hormozgan, Iran.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences, Bandar Abbas, Hormozgan, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Genetic, Faculty of Medicine, Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences, Bandar Abbas, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences, Bandar Abbas, Hormozgan, Iran. soheila_9@yahoo.com.', 'Hormozgan Institute of Health, Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences, Bandar Abbas, Iran. soheila_9@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Medical Genetic, Faculty of Medicine, Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences, Bandar Abbas, Iran. keyanoosh@gmail.com.', 'Hormozgan Institute of Health, Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences, Bandar Abbas, Iran. keyanoosh@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['HUMS/95/0026/Research Vice Chancellor of Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences'],['Journal Article'],20181022,Netherlands,Mol Biol Rep,Molecular biology reports,0403234,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Isothiocyanates)', '0 (MIRN155 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Sulfoxides)', 'GA49J4310U (sulforaphane)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Isothiocyanates/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*drug effects/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sulfoxides']",,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Sulforaphane', 'miR-155']",2018/10/24 06:00,2019/04/11 06:00,['2018/10/24 06:00'],"['2018/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/11 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11033-018-4416-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s11033-018-4416-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Biol Rep. 2018 Dec;45(6):2491-2499. doi: 10.1007/s11033-018-4416-0.

As a result, a fully functional BcR IG is expressed on the surface of any given naive B cell. After antigen encounter, somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class-switch recombination (CSR) act on the rearranged IG genes within the context of affinity maturation, leading to the expression of a BcR IG with unique immunogenetic and functional characteristics. Since B-cell neoplasms arise from the transformation of a single B cell, this renders IG gene rearrangements ideal clonal markers as they will be identical in all neoplastic cells of each individual clone. Furthermore, the rearranged IG sequence can also serve as a cell development/maturation marker, given that its configuration is tightly linked to specific B-cell developmental stages. Finally, in certain instances, as in the case of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the clonotypic IG sequence and, more specifically, the load of somatic hypermutations within the rearranged IG heavy variable (IGHV) gene, holds prognostic and potentially predictive value. However, in order to take full advantage of the information provided from the analysis of the clonotypic IG gene rearrangement sequences, robust methods and tools need to be applied. Here, we provide details regarding the methodologies necessary to ensure reliable IG sequence analysis based on the recognized expertise of the European Research initiative on CLL (ERIC). All methodological and analytical steps are described below, starting from the isolation of blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), moving to the identification of the clonotypic IG rearrangement and ending with the accurate interpretation of the SHM status.","['Agathangelidis, Andreas', 'Rosenquist, Richard', 'Davi, Frederic', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Belessi, Chrysoula', 'Hadzidimitriou, Anastasia', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas']","['Agathangelidis A', 'Rosenquist R', 'Davi F', 'Ghia P', 'Belessi C', 'Hadzidimitriou A', 'Stamatopoulos K']","['Institute of Applied Biosciences, Center for Research and Technology, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France.', 'IRCCS Istituto Scientifico San Raffaele, Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.', 'Nikea G.

Protein dysregulation in form of overexpression of GAB2, a protein involved in formation of the CML-pathognomonic BCR/ABL-translocation complex, results in an enhanced disease phenotype in a Bcr/Abl-positive mouse model and disease acceleration is associated with a change of the subcellular localization of GAB2 in human blasts in CML-bone marrow biopsies. Furthermore, analyses of a mouse model show that a protein dysregulation caused by a distinct translocation (Tel-Syk) leads to the formation of a specific and morphologically very characteristic phenotype in the bone marrow of diseased mice. Moreover, results were presented which show that in certain subgroups of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms the protein NFE2, which is initially known only as a translocating factor, is apparently regulated by altering its subcellular localization. The difference in the subcellular localization of NFE2 in erythroid bone marrow cells is so clear between Essential Thrombocythemia and Primary Myelofibrosis that quantitative NFE2 immunohistochemistry can be used as an ancillary tool to diagnostically discriminate these two entities in an early stage.","['Aumann, K']",['Aumann K'],"['Institut fur Klinische Pathologie, Universitatsklinikum Freiburg, Medizinische Fakultat, Albert-Ludwigs-Universitat Freiburg, Breisacher Strasse 115a, 79106, Freiburg, Deutschland. konrad.aumann@uniklinik-freiburg.de.']",['ger'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,Pathologe,Der Pathologe,8006541,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (GAB2 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-Syk fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Mice', '*Myeloproliferative Disorders', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL fusion proteins', 'Bone marrow', 'Carcinogenesis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Myeloproliferative disorders']",2018/10/24 06:00,2019/08/14 06:00,['2018/10/24 06:00'],"['2018/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00292-018-0520-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s00292-018-0520-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Pathologe. 2018 Dec;39(Suppl 2):199-207. doi: 10.1007/s00292-018-0520-0.,,,,Protein-Dysregulationen in humanen und murinen myeloproliferativen Neoplasien.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to estimate secondary cancer risks for different treatment techniques, taking into account organs throughout the body. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Organ doses were evaluated for a tangential three-dimensional conformal (3D-CRT) and a multi-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) plan using a validated, Monte Carlo-based treatment planning system. Effects of wedges and of forward versus inverse planning were systematically investigated on the basis of phantom measurements. Organ-specific cancer risks were estimated using risk coefficients derived from radiotherapy patients or from the atomic bomb survivors. RESULTS: In the 3D-CRT plan, mean organ doses could be kept below 1Gy for more remote organs than the lung, heart, and contralateral breast, and decreased to a few cGy for organs in the lower torso. Multi-field IMRT led to considerably higher mean doses in organs at risk, the difference being higher than 50% for many organs. Likewise, the peripheral radiation burden was increased by external wedges. No difference was observed for forward versus inverse planning. Despite the lower doses, the total estimated secondary cancer risk in more remote organs was comparable to that in the lung or the contralateral breast. For multi-field IMRT it was 75% higher than for 3D-CRT without external wedges. CONCLUSION: Remote organs are important for assessment of radiation-induced cancer risk. Remote doses can be reduced effectively by application of a tangential field configuration and a linear accelerator set-up with low head scatter radiation.","['Simonetto, C', 'Rennau, H', 'Remmele, J', 'Sebb, S', 'Kundrat, P', 'Eidemuller, M', 'Wolf, U', 'Hildebrandt, G']","['Simonetto C', 'Rennau H', 'Remmele J', 'Sebb S', 'Kundrat P', 'Eidemuller M', 'Wolf U', 'Hildebrandt G']","['Institute of Radiation Protection, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen Deutsches Forschungszentrum fur Gesundheit und Umwelt (GmbH), Ingolstadter Landstrasse 1, 85764, Neuherberg, Germany. cristoforo.simonetto@helmholtz-muenchen.de.', 'Klinik und Poliklinik fur Strahlentherapie, MVZ der Universitatsmedizin Rostock am Standort Sudstadt gGmbH, Universitatsmedizin Rostock, Sudring 75, 18059, Rostock, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Strahlentherapie, Universitat Leipzig, Stephanstrasse 9a, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Klinik und Poliklinik fur Strahlentherapie, MVZ der Universitatsmedizin Rostock am Standort Sudstadt gGmbH, Universitatsmedizin Rostock, Sudring 75, 18059, Rostock, Germany.', 'Institute of Radiation Protection, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen Deutsches Forschungszentrum fur Gesundheit und Umwelt (GmbH), Ingolstadter Landstrasse 1, 85764, Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Radiation Protection, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen Deutsches Forschungszentrum fur Gesundheit und Umwelt (GmbH), Ingolstadter Landstrasse 1, 85764, Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Strahlentherapie, Universitat Leipzig, Stephanstrasse 9a, 04103, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Klinik und Poliklinik fur Strahlentherapie, MVZ der Universitatsmedizin Rostock am Standort Sudstadt gGmbH, Universitatsmedizin Rostock, Sudring 75, 18059, Rostock, Germany.']",['eng'],['02NUK026/Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung'],['Journal Article'],20181022,Germany,Strahlenther Onkol,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

ALV infection can result in the development of immunological tolerance and persistent viremia. Since effective vaccines against ALV are not yet available, its current prevention primarily depends on detection and eradication to establish exogenous ALV-free poultry flocks. In this study, a rapid and simple colloidal gold test strip method, specific for the group-specific antigen, p27 protein, was developed and systematically evaluated for the detection of ALV from different samples. The detection limit of this assay was as low as 6.25 ng/ml for p27 protein and 80 TCID50/ml for different subgroups of ALV. Besides, the test strip showed high specificity in the detection of different subgroups of ALV, including ALV-A, ALV-B, ALV-J, and ALV-K, with no cross-reaction with other avian pathogens. Furthermore, we artificially infected specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens with ALV-J, collected cloacal swabs, and examined viral shedding using both test strips and ELISA. Results from the test strip were highly consistent with that from ELISA. In addition, 1104 virus isolates from anti-coagulant blood samples, 645 albumen samples, and 4312 meconium samples were tested, and the test strip results agreed with those of ELISA kit up to 97.1%. All the results indicated that the colloidal gold test strip could serve as a simple, rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic method for eradication of ALV in poultry farms.","['Yu, Mengmeng', 'Bao,

Systemic steroids remain the gold standard for the initial management of GvHD. However, up to 60% of patients will not sufficiently respond to steroids. Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP), a cell-based immunotherapy, has shown good clinical results in such steroid-refractory/resistant GvHD patients. Given its immunomodulatory, but not global immunosuppressive and steroid-sparing capacity, ECP constitutes an attractive option. In the case of GvHD, the balance of immune cells is destroyed: effector cells are not any longer efficiently controlled by regulatory cells. ECP therapy may restore this balance. However, the precise mechanism and the impact of ECP on anti-viral/anti-leukemic function remain unclear. In this study, 839 ECP treatments were performed on patients with acute GvHD (aGvHD) and chronic GvHD (cGvHD). A comprehensive analysis of effector and regulatory cells in patients under ECP therapy included multi-parametric flow cytometry and tetramer staining, Luminex(TM)-based cytokine, interferon-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot, and chromium-51 release assays. Gene profiling of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) was performed by microarray analysis. Immunologically, modulations of effector and regulatory cells as well as proinflammatory cytokines were observed under ECP treatment: (1) GvHD-relevant cell subsets like CD62L(+) NK cells and newly defined CD19(hi)CD20(hi) B cells were modulated, but (2) quantity and quality of anti-viral/anti-leukemic effector cells were preserved. (3) The development of MDSCs was promoted and switched from an inactivated subset (CD33(-)CD11b(+)) to an activated subset (CD33(+)CD11b(+)). (4) The frequency of Foxp3(+)CD4(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) and CD24(+)CD38(hi) regulatory B cells was considerably increased in aGvHD patients, and Foxp3(+)CD8(+) Tregs in cGvHD patients. (5) Proinflammatory cytokines like IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha were significantly reduced. In summary, ECP constitutes an effective immunomodulatory therapy for patients with steroid-refractory/resistant GvHD without impairment of anti-viral/leukemia effects.","['Wang, Lei', 'Ni, Ming', 'Huckelhoven-Krauss, Angela', 'Sellner, Leopold', 'Hoffmann, Jean-Marc', 'Neuber, Brigitte', 'Luft, Thomas', 'Hegenbart, Ute', 'Schonland, Stefan', 'Kleist, Christian', 'Sill, Martin', 'Chen, Bao-An', 'Wuchter, Patrick', 'Eckstein, Volker', 'Kruger, William', 'Hilgendorf, Inken', 'Yerushalmi, Ronit', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Ho, Anthony D', 'Dreger, Peter', 'Schmitt, Michael', 'Schmitt, Anita']","['Wang L', 'Ni M', 'Huckelhoven-Krauss A', 'Sellner L', 'Hoffmann JM', 'Neuber B', 'Luft T', 'Hegenbart U', 'Schonland S', 'Kleist C', 'Sill M', 'Chen BA', 'Wuchter P', 'Eckstein V', 'Kruger W', 'Hilgendorf I', 'Yerushalmi R', 'Nagler A', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Ho AD', 'Dreger P', 'Schmitt M', 'Schmitt A']","['Department of Internal Medicine V, University Clinic Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Clinic Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Clinic Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Clinic Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Clinic Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Clinic Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Clinic Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Clinic Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Clinic Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Clinic Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division Biostatistics, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Clinic Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Red Cross Blood Service, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Institute of Transfusion Medicine and Immunology Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Clinic Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine C, Haematology, Oncology, Stem Cell Transplantation, Palliative Care, University Clinic Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, University Clinic Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.', 'Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Clinic Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Clinic Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Clinic Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Clinic Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Clinic Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181008,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Steroids)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cytokines/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance/immunology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia/immunology/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Photopheresis/*methods', 'Steroids/administration & dosage/immunology', 'Transcriptome/immunology', 'Young Adult']",PMC6186805,['NOTNLM'],"['*ECP', '*GvHD', '*anti-leukemic effect', '*anti-viral effect', '*effector cells', '*immunomodulation', '*proinflammatory cytokines', '*regulatory cells']",2018/10/24 06:00,2019/10/01 06:00,['2018/10/24 06:00'],"['2018/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2018.02207 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2018 Oct 8;9:2207. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.02207. eCollection 2018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the case of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) lytic gene products, K8 (K-bZIP), ORF59, and ORF75 have been shown to colocalize with PML, but its importance in KSHV lytic replication is still unclear. In this study, we analyzed the functional influence of PML on KSHV latency and lytic replication in KSHV-infected primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cell lines. Stable PML-knockout (BC3-PML(KO)) and PML-overexpressing BC3 cells (BC3(PML)) were successfully generated and the latency and reactivation status were analyzed. The results demonstrated that neither KSHV latency nor the episome copy number was affected in BC3-PML(KO) cells. In the reactivation phase, the expression dynamics of KSHV immediate-early or early lytic proteins such as RTA, K9 (vIRF1), K5, K3, ORF59, and K8 (K-bZIP) were comparable between wild-type, control BC3, and BC3-PML(KO) cells. Interestingly, KSHV lytic replication, virion production, and expression of late genes were downregulated in BC3-PML(KO) cells and upregulated in BC3(PML) cells, compared to those in control or wild-type BC3 cells. Moreover, exogenous PML increased the size of the PML dots and recruited additional K8 (K-bZIP) to PML-NBs as dots. Therefore, PML would function as a positive regulator for KSHV lytic DNA replication by recruiting KSHV replication factors such as 8 (K-bZIP) or ORF59 to the PML-NBs.","['Hossain, Md Golzar', 'Ohsaki, Eriko', 'Honda, Tomoyuki', 'Ueda, Keiji']","['Hossain MG', 'Ohsaki E', 'Honda T', 'Ueda K']","['Division of Virology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Division of Virology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Division of Virology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Division of Virology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181008,Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,,,,PMC6186782,['NOTNLM'],"[""Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)"", 'ND10', 'PEL cells', 'latency', 'lytic replication', 'promyelocytic leukema protein (PML)']",2018/10/24 06:00,2018/10/24 06:01,['2018/10/24 06:00'],"['2018/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/24 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2018.02324 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2018 Oct 8;9:2324. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2018.02324. eCollection 2018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Materials and methods: This study retrospectively reviewed 165 courses of HD-MTX administered to children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), or osteosarcoma. Demographic data of patients were collected. Adverse complications related to HD-MTX and 72-hour plasma methotrexate level were analyzed between patients receiving intravenous hydration >/=3,000 mL/m(2)/day and those receiving hydration <3,000 mL/m(2)/day. Results: Among 56 HD-MTX (1.5 g/m(2)) courses in ALL, delayed methotrexate clearance was only found in one course administered with hydration <3,000 mL/m(2)/day. However, no correlation was observed between adverse complications and methotrexate levels. Of 34 HD-MTX (1.5-3 g/m(2)) courses in NHL, no significant correlation was observed between methotrexate levels and intravenous hydration. However, increased adverse complications were found in the course with delayed methotrexate clearance. Interestingly, among 75 HD-MTX (10-12 g/m(2)) courses in osteosarcoma, normal methotrexate clearance was successfully achieved in all courses administered with hydration >/=3,000 mL/m(2)/day compared with those administered with hydration <3,000 mL/m(2)/day (P=0.007). Furthermore, the courses administered with hydration <3,000 mL/m(2)/day and had delayed methotrexate clearance were more likely to develop adverse complications. Conclusion: Intravenous hydration of >/=3,000 mL/m(2)/day during HD-MTX administration is essentially required in osteosarcoma and can be considered as optional in ALL with HD-MTX <1.5 g/m(2), especially in developing countries with limited monitoring of plasma methotrexate level.","['Traivaree, Chanchai', 'Likasitthananon, Napakjira', 'Monsereenusorn, Chalinee', 'Rujkijyanont, Piya']","['Traivaree C', 'Likasitthananon N', 'Monsereenusorn C', 'Rujkijyanont P']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Phramongkutklao Hospital and College of Medicine, Bangkok, Thailand, piya_rujk@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Lat Krabang Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Phramongkutklao Hospital and College of Medicine, Bangkok, Thailand, piya_rujk@yahoo.com.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Phramongkutklao Hospital and College of Medicine, Bangkok, Thailand, piya_rujk@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181010,New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,,,,PMC6188117,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'children', 'high-dose methotrexate', 'hydration', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'osteosarcoma']",2018/10/24 06:00,2018/10/24 06:01,['2018/10/24 06:00'],"['2018/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S172117 [doi]', 'cmar-10-4471 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2018 Oct 10;10:4471-4478. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S172117. eCollection 2018.,,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NUDT21 links alternative polyadenylation with regulation of glioblastoma and osteosarcoma progression and is found to be related to drug resistance in childhood acute leukemia. However, the effect of NUDT21 on leukemia cells and the underlying mechanism are unknown. Methods: We knocked down NUDT21 in K562 cells and applied qRT-PCR and western blotting to quantitate the mRNA and protein expression. Cell proliferating and apoptosis were investigated subsequently by flow cytometry, BrdU, Caspase3/7. RNA microarray and intracellular signaling array were used to determine the important cell signaling pathways. Results: We clarified that the mRNA expression levels of NUDT21 are higher in primary chronic myelocytic leukemia patients and K562 leukemic cells compared with healthy controls and PBMCs. Downregulation of NUDT21 expression in K562 cells inhibits proliferation and promotes apoptosis. Screening by mRNA chip and intracellular signaling array, we found that MAPK/ERK pathway represented the main molecular mechanism underlying the effects of NUDT21 knockdown in K562 cells. Conclusion: NUDT21 played an important role in promoting proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis in leukemia K562 cells. The underlying mechanisms involved the modulation of PTEN and a set of downstream molecules including ERK1/2. Impact statement: The present work shows that the expression of NUDT21 was upregulated in chronic myelocytic leukemia and K562 cells. Silencing NUDT21 inhibited the proliferation and promoted the apoptosis of K562 cells. Subsequent experiments confirmed that NUDT21 promoted K562 proliferation through regulating the expression of p-ERK. Our findings may provide insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the effects of NUDT21 on leukemia cells and a novel strategy for the treatment of leukemia.","['Zhang, Lan', 'Zhang, Weihua']","['Zhang L', 'Zhang W']","['Department of Haematology, First Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, China, suoai707c@163.com.', 'Department of Haematology, First Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, China, suoai707c@163.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181008,New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,,,,PMC6183658,['NOTNLM'],"['K562 cell line', 'MAPK/ERK', 'NUDT21', 'cell apoptosis', 'cell proliferation', 'leukemia']",2018/10/24 06:00,2018/10/24 06:01,['2018/10/24 06:00'],"['2018/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S173496 [doi]', 'cmar-10-4311 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2018 Oct 8;10:4311-4323. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S173496. eCollection 2018.,,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current treatments include high doses of cytarabine or fludarabine in combination with cytarabine and G-CSF (FLAG), but provide mixed results. Low-dose decitabine, a hypomethylating drug, in combination with aclarubicin and cytarabine (DAC) has shown safety and efficacy in the treatment of AML; however, clinical data are limited for the treatment of RR-AML. Methods: In this study, we retrospectively compared the response and safety of DAC vs FLAG for RR-AML patients. Results: For the 35 patients with RR-AML enrolled in this study, the overall response rates reached 100% and 55.6% in the DAC group and FLAG group, respectively (P=0.002). Complete response rates after DAC and FLAG treatment were 64.7% and 33.3%, respectively (P=0.002). Median overall survival (95% CI) of the DAC treatment group was significantly higher than for the FLAG group (median not achieved vs 16.8 months, P=0.021). Conclusion: DAC treatment was also more effective in those patients with poor prognosis, suggesting that DAC resulted in a better outcome for RR-AML treatment. In conclusion, in our study, DAC therapy provided more safety and effectiveness and lower toxicity in the treatment of RR-AML compared to FLAG therapy.","['Li, Limin', 'Zhang, Xiaoqian', 'Yu, Hongjuan', 'Zhang, Mingwen', 'Xu, Mengyuan', 'Liu, Jie', 'Fu, Yueyue', 'Meng, Hongbin', 'Lyu, Chengfang', 'Li, Xiaoxia', 'Zhou, Jin']","['Li L', 'Zhang X', 'Yu H', 'Zhang M', 'Xu M', 'Liu J', 'Fu Y', 'Meng H', 'Lyu C', 'Li X', 'Zhou J']","[""Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Oncology of Heilongjiang Province, Hematology and Oncology Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, People's Republic of China, jinzhou_2016@126.com; 303975480@qq.com."", ""Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Oncology of Heilongjiang Province, Hematology and Oncology Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, People's Republic of China, jinzhou_2016@126.com; 303975480@qq.com."", ""Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Oncology of Heilongjiang Province, Hematology and Oncology Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, People's Republic of China, jinzhou_2016@126.com; 303975480@qq.com."", ""Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Oncology of Heilongjiang Province, Hematology and Oncology Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, People's Republic of China, jinzhou_2016@126.com; 303975480@qq.com."", ""Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Oncology of Heilongjiang Province, Hematology and Oncology Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, People's Republic of China, jinzhou_2016@126.com; 303975480@qq.com."", ""Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Oncology of Heilongjiang Province, Hematology and Oncology Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, People's Republic of China, jinzhou_2016@126.com; 303975480@qq.com."", ""Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Oncology of Heilongjiang Province, Hematology and Oncology Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, People's Republic of China, jinzhou_2016@126.com; 303975480@qq.com."", ""Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Oncology of Heilongjiang Province, Hematology and Oncology Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, People's Republic of China, jinzhou_2016@126.com; 303975480@qq.com."", ""Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Oncology of Heilongjiang Province, Hematology and Oncology Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, People's Republic of China, jinzhou_2016@126.com; 303975480@qq.com."", ""Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Oncology of Heilongjiang Province, Hematology and Oncology Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, People's Republic of China, jinzhou_2016@126.com; 303975480@qq.com."", ""Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Oncology of Heilongjiang Province, Hematology and Oncology Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, People's Republic of China, jinzhou_2016@126.com; 303975480@qq.com.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181012,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,PMC6190628,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'chemotherapy', 'decitabine', 'refractory diseases', 'relapsed diseases']",2018/10/24 06:00,2018/10/24 06:01,['2018/10/24 06:00'],"['2018/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S161919 [doi]', 'ott-11-6863 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2018 Oct 12;11:6863-6870. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S161919. eCollection 2018.,,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It also determined whether upregulating or downregulating the AsnS mRNA level induces or reverses asparaginase-resistant phenotype. Results: Interestingly, considerable differences were observed in the sensitivity to asparaginase of the five ENKTL cell lines. The AsnS expression levels were positively correlated with the IC50 values. In addition, the asparaginase resistance was induced or reversed by upregulating or downregulating the AsnS mRNA level in vivo and in vitro. Functional analyses indicated that AsnS did not affect the proliferation and apoptosis of ENKTL cells in the absence of asparaginase.

However, the expression and clinical implication of DOK family in AML has rarely been investigated. A total of 155 AML patients with DOK family (DOK1-7) expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas database were enrolled in the study. In patients who only received chemotherapy, those with high expressions of DOK4 or DOK5 had significantly shorter EFS and OS than patients with low expressions (all P < 0.001), whereas high DOK7 expressers had longer EFS and OS than the low expressers (all P < 0.05). In patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), however, all DOK members had no impact on EFS and OS. Multivariate analysis confirmed that high DOK5 expression was an independent risk factor for EFS and OS in untransplanted patients (all P < 0.05). Our study suggests that in AML, high expressions of DOK4 and DOK5 are adverse prognostic factors, high DOK7 expression is a good prognostic factor, but their effects can be overcome by allo-HSCT.","['Zhang, Lin', 'Li, Ran', 'Hu, Kai', 'Dai, Yifeng', 'Pang, Yifan', 'Jiao, Yang', 'Liu, Yan', 'Cui, Longzhen', 'Shi, Jinlong', 'Cheng, Zhiheng', 'Fu, Lin']","['Zhang L', 'Li R', 'Hu K', 'Dai Y', 'Pang Y', 'Jiao Y', 'Liu Y', 'Cui L', 'Shi J', 'Cheng Z', 'Fu L']","['Department of Human Resources, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, 475000, Kaifeng, China.', 'Department of Surgery, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, 475000, Kaifeng, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, 100191, Beijing, China.', 'Laboratory of Environmental Medicine and Developmental Toxicology, Shantou University Medical College, 515041, Shantou, China.', 'Immunoendocrinology, Division of Medical Biology, Department of Pathology and Medical Biology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medicine, William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, MI, 48073, USA.', 'Life Sciences Institute and Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, Zhejiang University, 310058, Hangzhou, China.', 'Translational Medicine Center, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, 475000, Kaifeng, China.', 'Translational Medicine Center, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, 475000, Kaifeng, China.', 'Translational Medicine Center, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, 475000, Kaifeng, China.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Chinese PLA General Hospital, 100853, Beijing, China.', 'Laboratory of Environmental Medicine and Developmental Toxicology, Shantou University Medical College, 515041, Shantou, China. chengzh217@126.com.', 'Translational Medicine Center, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, 475000, Kaifeng, China. chengzh217@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, 100191, Beijing, China. fulin022@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, 475000, Kaifeng, China. fulin022@126.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181022,England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*genetics', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Multigene Family', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis']",,,,2018/10/24 06:00,2020/07/07 06:00,['2018/10/24 06:00'],"['2018/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/09/20 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/07 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41417-018-0052-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41417-018-0052-z [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2019 Sep;26(9-10):305-312. doi: 10.1038/s41417-018-0052-z.

In the present study, we evaluated a possible combinatorial effect of prodrug activator genes delivered by two different RRVs derived from amphotropic murine leukemia virus (AMLV) and gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) on human hepatocellular carcinoma Hep3B cells. Both RRVs showed efficient replicative spread in culture and can overcame superinfection resistance each other. Notably, the replication and spread of each RRV in culture remained unaffected by pretransduction with the counterpart RRV. We further transduced cells with RRVs which individually possessed the prodrug activator genes yeast cytosine deaminase (CD) and herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) alone or in combination, and evaluated the cytotoxic effects of RRV-mediated gene therapy with CD and TK in the presence of the respective prodrugs, 5-fluorocytosine and ganciclovir. All combinations of the two prodrug activator genes produced synergistic cytocidal effects, but the combined effects of the different genes were significantly greater than those of the same genes when delivered by two different vectors. The present findings indicate the potential utility of dual-vector gene therapy using two different RRVs carrying different prodrug activator genes.","['Kubo, Shuji', 'Takagi-Kimura, Misato', 'Tagawa, Masatoshi', 'Kasahara, Noriyuki']","['Kubo S', 'Takagi-Kimura M', 'Tagawa M', 'Kasahara N']","['Unit of Molecular and Genetic Therapeutics, Laboratory of Medical Innovation, Institute for Advanced Medical Sciences, Hyogo College of Medicine, Nishinomiya, Japan. s-kubo@hyo-med.ac.jp.', 'Unit of Molecular and Genetic Therapeutics, Laboratory of Medical Innovation, Institute for Advanced Medical Sciences, Hyogo College of Medicine, Nishinomiya, Japan.', 'Division of Pathology and Cell Therapy, Chiba Cancer Center Research Institute, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Cell Biology and Pathology, University of Miami, Miami, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181022,England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,['0 (Prodrugs)'],IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Prodrugs/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Retroviridae/*genetics']",PMC6760537,,,2018/10/24 06:00,2020/06/13 06:00,['2018/10/24 06:00'],"['2018/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/09/24 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/13 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41417-018-0051-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41417-018-0051-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2019 May;26(5-6):128-135. doi: 10.1038/s41417-018-0051-0.

Here, we studied the function of novel germline variants in CSF3R at amino acid N610. These N610 substitutions were potently oncogenic and activated the receptor independently of its ligand GCSF. These mutations activated the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and conferred sensitivity to JAK inhibitors. Mass spectrometry revealed that the N610 residue is part of a consensus N-linked glycosylation motif in the receptor, usually linked to complex glycans. N610 was also the primary site of sialylation of the receptor. Membrane-proximal N-linked glycosylation was critical for maintaining the ligand dependence of the receptor. Mutation of the N610 site prevented membrane-proximal N-glycosylation of CSF3R, which then drove ligand-independent cellular expansion. Kinase inhibitors blocked growth of cells with an N610 mutation. This study expands the repertoire of oncogenic mutations in CSF3R that are therapeutically targetable and provides insight into the function of glycans in receptor regulation. SIGNIFICANCE: This study reveals the critical importance of membrane-proximal N-linked glycosylation of CSF3R for the maintenance of ligand dependency in leukemia.","['Spiciarich, David R', 'Oh, Stephen T', 'Foley, Amy', 'Hughes, Seamus B', 'Mauro, Michael J', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar', 'Press, Richard D', 'Viner, Rosa', 'Thompson, Sarah L', 'Chen, Qiushi', 'Azadi, Parastoo', 'Bertozzi, Carolyn R', 'Maxson, Julia E']","['Spiciarich DR', 'Oh ST', 'Foley A', 'Hughes SB', 'Mauro MJ', 'Abdel-Wahab O', 'Press RD', 'Viner R', 'Thompson SL', 'Chen Q', 'Azadi P', 'Bertozzi CR', 'Maxson JE']","['Department of Chemistry, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California.', 'Department of Chemistry Stanford University, Stanford, California.', 'Division of Hematology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Division of Hematology & Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pathology & Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, California.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, The University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia.', 'Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, The University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia.', 'Department of Chemistry Stanford University, Stanford, California.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, Maryland.', 'Division of Hematology & Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon. maxsonj@ohsu.edu.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA200423/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA224019/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P41 GM103490/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 OD018530/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA207702/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 CA190605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA207701/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 OD020062/OD/NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20181022,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (CSF3R protein, human)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', '*Carcinogenesis', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Germ-Line Mutation', 'Glycosylation', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Leukemia, Neutrophilic, Chronic/genetics', 'Ligands', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Proteomics', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'STAT Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization']",PMC6295230,,,2018/10/24 06:00,2019/10/08 06:00,['2018/10/24 06:00'],"['2018/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/12 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/08 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['0008-5472.CAN-18-1638 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-18-1638 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2018 Dec 15;78(24):6762-6770. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-18-1638.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients diagnosed with AML with no cardiac history, having LV ejection fraction (LVEF) >50%, were evaluated at baseline and 6 months after starting four cycles of chemotherapy. We measured LV function, global longitudinal strain and subclinical atherosclerosis markers: intima-media thickness (IMT), arterial stiffness aortic pulse wave velocity (PWVAo) and ankle-brachial index (ABI). RESULTS: LVEF had decreased at 6 months after treatment initialization (p<0.001), the same changes being observed for LV fraction shortening (p<0.001), mitral annular plane systolic excursion and S' wave (p<0.001 and p<0.05). Bilateral IMT and PWVAo significantly increased, 12 out of 30 patients (40%) had LVEF </=50% after 6 months of chemotherapy, five of them receiving daunorubicin at more than 500 mg/m(2)/injection. CONCLUSION: LV function is impaired after 6 months of chemotherapy, with early changes of subclinical atherosclerosis becoming evident.","['Militaru, Anda', 'Avram, Adina', 'Cimpean, Anca Maria', 'Iurciuc, Mircea', 'Matusz, Petru', 'Lighezan, Daniel', 'Militaru, Marius']","['Militaru A', 'Avram A', 'Cimpean AM', 'Iurciuc M', 'Matusz P', 'Lighezan D', 'Militaru M']","['Medical Semiology I, Department of Internal Medicine I, Victor Babes University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Timisoara, Romania.', 'Medical Semiology I, Department of Internal Medicine I, Victor Babes University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Timisoara, Romania.', 'Department of Microscopic Morphology/Histology, Angiogenesis Research Center, Victor Babes University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Timisoara, Romania ancacimpean1972@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Cardiology, Preventive Medicine and Cardiovascular Rehabilitation, Victor Babes University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Timisoara, Romania.', 'Department of Anatomy and Embryology, Victor Babes University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Timisoara, Romania.', 'Medical Semiology I, Department of Internal Medicine I, Victor Babes University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Timisoara, Romania.', 'Neurology, Department of Neuroscience - Municipal Emergency Hospital, Victor Babes University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Timisoara, Romania.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aorta/drug effects/*physiopathology', 'Atherosclerosis/chemically induced/diagnostic imaging/*physiopathology', 'Carotid Intima-Media Thickness', 'Echocardiography, Doppler', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pulse Wave Analysis', 'Vascular Stiffness/*drug effects', 'Ventricular Function, Left/drug effects']",PMC6365756,['NOTNLM'],"['Chemotherapy', 'LV function', 'arterial stiffness', 'cardiotoxicity', 'myocardial dysfunction', 'subclinical atherosclerosis']",2018/10/24 06:00,2019/01/24 06:00,['2018/10/24 06:00'],"['2018/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/29 00:00 [revised]', '2018/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/24 06:00 [medline]']","['32/6/1599 [pii]', '10.21873/invivo.11420 [doi]']",ppublish,In Vivo. 2018 Nov-Dec;32(6):1599-1607. doi: 10.21873/invivo.11420.,,,"['Copyright(c) 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, HLA-haploidentical HSCT after alphabeta T-cell/B-cell depletion (alphabetahaplo-HSCT) was shown to be effective in single-center studies. Here, we report the first multicenter retrospective analysis of 127 matched UD (MUD), 118 mismatched UD (MMUD), and 98 alphabetahaplo-HSCT recipients, transplanted between 2010 and 2015, in 13 Italian centers. All these AL children were transplanted in morphological remission after a myeloablative conditioning regimen. Graft failure occurred in 2% each of UD-HSCT and alphabetahaplo-HSCT groups. In MUD vs MMUD-HSCT recipients, the cumulative incidence of grade II to IV and grade III to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 35% vs 44% and 6% vs 18%, respectively, compared with 16% and 0% in alphabetahaplo-HSCT recipients (P < .001). Children treated with alphabetahaplo-HSCT also had a significantly lower incidence of overall and extensive chronic GVHD (P < .01). Eight (6%) MUD, 32 (28%) MMUD, and 9 (9%) alphabetahaplo-HSCT patients died of transplant-related complications. With a median follow-up of 3.3 years, the 5-year probability of leukemia-free survival in the 3 groups was 67%, 55%, and 62%, respectively. In the 3 groups, chronic GVHD-free/relapse-free (GRFS) probability of survival was 61%, 34%, and 58%, respectively (P < .001). When compared with patients given MMUD-HSCT, alphabetahaplo-HSCT recipients had a lower cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality and a better GRFS (P < .001). These data indicate that alphabetahaplo-HSCT is a suitable therapeutic option for children with AL in need of transplantation, especially when an allele-matched UD is not available.","['Bertaina, Alice', 'Zecca, Marco', 'Buldini, Barbara', 'Sacchi, Nicoletta', 'Algeri, Mattia', 'Saglio, Francesco', 'Perotti, Cesare', 'Gallina, Anna Maria', 'Bertaina, Valentina', 'Lanino, Edoardo', 'Prete, Arcangelo', 'Barberi, Walter', 'Tumino, Manuela', 'Favre, Claudio', 'Cesaro, Simone', 'Del Bufalo, Francesca', 'Ripaldi, Mimmo', 'Boghen, Stella', 'Casazza, Gabriella', 'Rabusin, Marco', 'Balduzzi, Adriana', 'Fagioli, Franca', 'Pagliara, Daria', 'Locatelli, Franco']","['Bertaina A', 'Zecca M', 'Buldini B', 'Sacchi N', 'Algeri M', 'Saglio F', 'Perotti C', 'Gallina AM', 'Bertaina V', 'Lanino E', 'Prete A', 'Barberi W', 'Tumino M', 'Favre C', 'Cesaro S', 'Del Bufalo F', 'Ripaldi M', 'Boghen S', 'Casazza G', 'Rabusin M', 'Balduzzi A', 'Fagioli F', 'Pagliara D', 'Locatelli F']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology and Cell and Gene Therapy, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS), Ospedale Bambino Gesu, Rome, Italy.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.', ""Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Unit, Department of Women's and Children's Health, Azienda Ospedaliera-University of Padova, Padova, Italy."", 'Struttura Complessa Laboratorio di Istocompatibilita/Italian Registry of Bone Marrow Donors, Ente Ospedaliero Ospedali Galliera, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology and Cell and Gene Therapy, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS), Ospedale Bambino Gesu, Rome, Italy.', ""Pediatric Onco-Hematology, Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Division, Regina Margherita Children's Hospital, Torino, Italy."", 'Immunohaematology and Transfusion Service, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico S.

Recent data indicate that NDRG2 expression is up-regulated by TP53. Moreover, proposed mechanisms of NDRG2 inactivation include epigenetic silencing of the NDRG2 promoter and down-regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs). However, few studies have ever been done on the role of NDRG2 and the NDRG2-regulating miRNAs interference in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). METHODS: NDRG2 and microRNAs mRNA levels in CLL subjects were assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to determine NDRG2-related miRNAs. Low expression of mature exogenous miRNAs in CLL cells was established by transient transfection. NDRG2 protein levels in CLL cells were detected by western blot. In addition, flow cytometry was conducted to examine the apoptosis of CLL cells. RESULTS: Lower expression of NDRG2 was found in the B-cells from 102 CLL patients compared the 40 normal subjects (P < 0.001). Patients with advanced Binet stage (P = 0.001), high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (P = 0.036), un-mutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region gene (IGHV) (P = 0.004) and those with p53 aberrations (P < 0.001) had a markedly lower levels of NDRG2 mRNA. This decrease was associated with briefer time-to-treatment (P = 0.001) and poorer survival (P < 0.001). High expression of miR-28-5p and miR-650 was associated with Binet B/C stage (P = 0.044) and IGHV un-mutated (P = 0.011), as well as Binet B/C stage (P = 0.013) and p53 aberrations (P = 0.037), respectively. Inhibition of miR-28-5p or miR-650 could induce more apoptosis in CLL cells with germline TP53. CONCLUSIONS: NDRG2 mRNA levels might be a useful prognostic variable for patients of CLL and up-regulating NDRG2 transcription may be a therapy approach in CLL without p53 aberrations.","['Yang,

Deletion of 5q (del(5q)) is the most frequent aberration in complex karyotypes. This prompted us to analyze clonal evolution in MDS patients with del(5q). There were 1684 patients with low and intermediate-risk MDS and del(5q) with or without one additional cytogenetic abnormality, who were investigated cytogenetically in our department, involving standard karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and multicolor FISH. We identified 134 patients (8%) with aspects of clonal evolution. There are two main routes of cytogenetic clonal evolution: a stepwise accumulation of cytogenetic events over time and a catastrophic event, which we defined as the occurrence of two or more aberrations present at the same time, leading to a sudden development of highly complex clones. Of the 134 patients, 61% underwent a stepwise accumulation of events whereas 39% displayed a catastrophic event. Patients with isolated del(5q) showed significantly more often a stepwise accumulation of events rather than a catastrophic event. The most frequent aberrations in the group of stepwise accumulation were trisomy 8 and trisomy 21 which were significantly more frequent in this group compared to the catastrophic event group. In the group with catastrophic events, del(7q)/-7 and del(17p)/-17 were the most common aberrations. A loss of 17p, containing the tumor suppressor gene TP53, was found significantly more frequent in this group compared to the group of stepwise accumulation. This leads to the assumption that the loss of TP53 is the driving force in patients with del(5q) who undergo a sudden catastrophic event and evolve into complex karyotypes.","['Feurstein, Simone', 'Thomay, Kathrin', 'Hofmann, Winfried', 'Buesche, Guntram', 'Kreipe, Hans', 'Thol, Felicitas', 'Heuser, Michael', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Gohring, Gudrun']","['Feurstein S', 'Thomay K', 'Hofmann W', 'Buesche G', 'Kreipe H', 'Thol F', 'Heuser M', 'Ganser A', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Gohring G']","['Department of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str.1, 30625 Hannover, Germany. feurstein@uchicago.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology/Oncology, The University of Chicago, 900 E 57th street, Chicago, IL 60637, USA. feurstein@uchicago.edu.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str.1, 30625 Hannover, Germany.

Vpu interacts with the Skp, Cullin, F-Box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase through interactions with the F-Box protein betaTrCP (1 and/or 2). This interaction is dependent on phosphorylation of S(52,56) in Vpu. Mutation of S(52,56), or inhibition of the SCF, abolishes most Vpu activity against CD4 and partly reduces activity against BST-2/tetherin. Recently, Vpu has also been reported to interact with the clathrin adapter proteins AP-1 and AP-2, and these interactions were also found to be required for BST-2/tetherin antagonism in an S(52,56) -dependent manner. In assays where HIV-1 is pseudotyped with gibbon ape leukemia virus (GaLV Env), Vpu has also been found to prevent GaLV Env from being incorporated into viral particles, but the mechanism for this antagonism is not fully understood. To clarify the role of the betaTrCPs in Vpu function we used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate a clonal cell line lacking both betaTrCP-1 and -2. Vpu activity against CD4 and GaLV Env was abolished in this cell line, and activity against BST-2/tetherin reduced significantly. Mutation of the S(52,56) residues no longer affected Vpu activity against BST-2/tetherin in this cell line. These data suggest that the primary role of the S(52,56) residues in antagonism of CD4, GaLV Env, and BST-2/tetherin is to recruit the SCF/betaTrCP ubiquitin ligase.","['Song, Yul Eum', 'Cyburt, Daniel', 'Lucas, Tiffany M', 'Gregory, Devon A', 'Lyddon, Terri D', 'Johnson, Marc C']","['Song YE', 'Cyburt D', 'Lucas TM', 'Gregory DA', 'Lyddon TD', 'Johnson MC']","['Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, University of Missouri, School of Medicine and the Christopher S.

METHODS: One hundred and twenty one elderly patients with de novo AML were consecutively recruited in this prospective cohort study, bone marrow samples from all patients were collected and CD45 expression were measured with flow cytometry. Complete remission (CR), event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. The median follow-up duration was 15.0 (range 2.0-36.0) months. RESULTS: CD45 high expression (CD45high) was associated with higher risk stratification in elderly AML patients (P= 0.021). The percentage of CD45high cases in CR patients was 16.4%, which was lower compared to non-CR patients (35.2%, P= 0.017), while no difference in percentage of CD45high cases was found between allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) patients and non-allo-HSCT patients (16.7% vs. 25.7%, P= 0.492). As to survival profiles, median EFS in CD45high patients was 6.0 (95% CI: 2.9-9.1) months, which was shorter than that in CD45 low expression (CD45low) patients (10.0 (95% CI: 7.2-12.8) months) (P= 0.002), and OS in CD45high patients was 16.0 (95% CI: 13.4-18.6) months, which was worse compared to CD45low patients (22.0 (95% CI: 17.0-27.0) months) (P= 0.010). In subgroup analysis, no difference of EFS and OS was found between CD45high patients and CD45low patients in favorable, intermediate or adverse risk subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: CD45 correlates with adverse risk stratification, decreased treatment response and unfavorable survival profiles in elderly AML patients.","['Guo, Liyin', 'Chen, Li', 'Wang, Hongxiang']","['Guo L', 'Chen L', 'Wang H']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Cancer Biomark,Cancer biomarkers : section A of Disease markers,101256509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPRC protein, human)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/*genetics', 'Male', 'Progression-Free Survival', 'Risk Factors']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'CD45', 'elderly', 'prognosis']",2018/10/24 06:00,2019/03/28 06:00,['2018/10/24 06:00'],"['2018/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/28 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['CBM181602 [pii]', '10.3233/CBM-181602 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biomark. 2018;23(3):455-463. doi: 10.3233/CBM-181602.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Seventy three R/R AML patients who received cladribine combined with cytarabine and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (CLAG) or fludarabine combined with cytarabine and G-CSF (FLAG) based chemotherapy and 37 non-malignant controls were recruited. LncRNA TUG1 expression was detected in bone marrow sample obtained before treatment. Complete response (CR), partial response (PR), overall response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. RESULTS: LncRNA TUG1 expression was upregulated in R/R AML patients compared to controls. It was also elevated in R/R AML patients with age 60 years (vs. age < 60 years, P= 0.030) and in patients with secondary AML (vs. primary AML, P= 0.035). R/R AML patients with lncRNA TUG1 high expression achieved numerically lower CR (P= 0.053), decreased ORR (P= 0.028) and shorter OS (P< 0.001) than patients with lncRNA TUG1 low expression. Univariate logistic regression and COX's regression disclosed that lncRNA TUG1 high expression correlated with declined ORR, numerically decreased CR, and reduced OS. Furthermore, multivariate analyses verified that lncRNA TUG1 high expression was an independent predictive factor for decreased ORR and worse OS. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, lncRNA TUG1 expression was elevated in R/R AML patients, and it might serve as a potential biomarker for poor prognosis in R/R AML patients treated with CLAG or FLAG based chemotherapy.","['Luo, Wenfeng', 'Yu, Huilan', 'Zou, Xingli', 'Ni, Xun', 'Wei, Jin']","['Luo W', 'Yu H', 'Zou X', 'Ni X', 'Wei J']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Cancer Biomark,Cancer biomarkers : section A of Disease markers,101256509,"['0 (Purines)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (TUG1 long noncoding RNA, human)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'W60KTZ3IZY (purine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Prognosis', 'Purines/*administration & dosage', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics', 'Remission Induction', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",,['NOTNLM'],"['CLAG', 'FLAG', 'LncRNA TUG1', 'prognosis', 'refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML)']",2018/10/24 06:00,2019/04/02 06:00,['2018/10/24 06:00'],"['2018/10/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/02 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['CBM181405 [pii]', '10.3233/CBM-181405 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biomark. 2018;23(4):485-494. doi: 10.3233/CBM-181405.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, a contemporary, comprehensive apprehension on patient-, disease-, and treatment-specific characteristics of elderly AML patients at the population level can inform treatment choices and facilitate increased patient accrual in upcoming RCTs. OBJECTIVES: In this population-based study, we investigated patient- and disease-specific characteristics in elderly AML patients, and their association with treatment and survival. METHODS: We retrospectively obtained data on all over 65-year-old AML patients diagnosed between 2010-2013 in the referral area of two university hospitals in the Netherlands. Multivariable analyses were performed to assess factors associated with treatment choice and overall survival. RESULTS: Of all 356 patients, 77% received non-intensive therapy (NIT), and 15% and 8% received ICT within and outside a RCT, respectively. Cytogenetic (74%) and molecular (93%) analyses were not performed in most NIT recipients. Age and comorbidity were independently associated with NIT, whereas only comorbidity was associated with decreased trial participation. The adjusted risk of mortality among ICT recipients was not influenced by trial participation status. CONCLUSION: The application of ICT and accrual to RCTs remains staggeringly low in an elderly AML population. Since survival of ICT-treated patients was not affected by trial participation status, exclusion criteria might be relaxed in upcoming RCTs. Furthermore, appropriate management strategies can be accomplished by comprehensive comorbidity assessment and augmented genetic prognostication.","['Kalin, Burak', 'Pijnappel, Esther N', 'van Gelder, Michel', 'Visser, Otto', 'van de Loosdrecht, Arjan A', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'Cornelissen, Jan J', 'Dinmohamed, Avinash G', 'Jongen-Lavrencic, Mojca']","['Kalin B', 'Pijnappel EN', 'van Gelder M', 'Visser O', 'van de Loosdrecht AA', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Cornelissen JJ', 'Dinmohamed AG', 'Jongen-Lavrencic M']","['Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Department of Hematology, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Maastricht University Medical Center, Maastricht, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Maastricht University Medical Center, Maastricht, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Registration, Netherlands Comprehensive Cancer Organisation (IKNL), Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Department of Hematology, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Department of Hematology, Rotterdam, the Netherlands; Department of Research, Netherlands Comprehensive Cancer Organisation (IKNL), Utrecht, the Netherlands; Department of Public Health, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.

However, standard techniques involve separate measurements of target and reference DNAs, require standard curves, and are susceptible to PCR inhibition. An optimized duplex droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) should provide absolute quantification without the need for standard curves. The combination of high sensitivity and low background is particularly important for reliable monitoring of minimal residual disease. In this report, we describe primer probe set testing and step by step optimization of a duplex ddPCR for BCR-ABL/ABL. The optimization of ddPCR parameters increased ABL and BCR-ABL fluorescence signals by two- and fivefold, respectively, and enhanced the resolution between positive and negative drops. The optimized procedure generates a background false-positive rate of 5% of samples and reliably detects BCR-ABL/ABL down to 1/100,000 (CV <10%), with a single BCR-ABL copy being detected in 54% of reactions performed in duplicate from a molecular remission (MR) 5 sample (limit of detection = 1). Assay of duplicates resulted in a detection rate of 100% and 92% for MR4 and MR4.5, respectively. Detection of MR4.5 was increased to 100% by analyzing quadruplicates. Selection of an optimal primer and probe combination and stepwise optimization of the ddPCR conditions has yielded a robust low-background duplex ddPCR procedure for BCR-ABL/ABL.","['Maier, Jacqueline', 'Lange, Thoralf', 'Cross, Michael', 'Wildenberger, Kathrin', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Franke, Georg-Nikolaus']","['Maier J', 'Lange T', 'Cross M', 'Wildenberger K', 'Niederwieser D', 'Franke GN']","['Department of Haematology and Oncology, Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany.

The anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 is necessary for sustaining hematopoietic stem cells (HPS) (Akashi et al., 2003; Akashi, Traver, Miyamoto, & Weissman, 2000). The anti-apoptotic factors Mcl-1, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL were also found to be over-expressed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Kaufmann et al., 2016) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) (Findley, Gu, Yeager, & Zhou, 1997), suggesting that dis-regulated apoptotic processes could be a factor in the instigation of leukemia and/or its relapse. Molecules targeting these proteins were used as single agents to treat leukemia. However, by using a set of recently developed specific molecule inhibitors targeting anti-apoptotic proteins, distinct roles are being discovered for these anti-apoptotic proteins during hematopoietic and tumor development. Furthermore, using these inhibitors in proper combinations can effectively induce apoptosis in various solid tumors, even though each agent on its own cannot induce apoptosis in them. These new findings suggest that inhibiting anti-apoptotic elements can induce apoptosis without external stimuli in most cells, but it comes with a risk that some combinations could also trigger apoptosis in healthy cells. One way to address the safety issue is by limiting exposure to all the agents to only cancer cells, thus making the combination safe and effective. In this article, we review this rapidly developing idea in cancer research.","['Yamaguchi, Ryuji', 'Lartigue, Lydia', 'Perkins, Guy']","['Yamaguchi R', 'Lartigue L', 'Perkins G']","['Anesthesiology, Kansai Medical University, Hirakata 573-1010, Japan.

Rapidly growing cells depend on sufficient concentrations of nucleotides to sustain proliferation. One enzyme essential for the de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidine-based nucleotides is dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), a known therapeutic target for multiple diseases. Brequinar, leflunomide, and teriflunomide, all of which are potent DHODH inhibitors, have been clinically evaluated but failed to receive FDA approval for the treatment of cancer. Inhibition of DHODH depletes intracellular pyrimidine nucleotide pools and results in cell cycle arrest in S-phase, sensitization to current chemotherapies, and differentiation in neural crest cells and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Furthermore, DHODH is a synthetic lethal susceptibility in several oncogenic backgrounds. Therefore, DHODH-targeted therapy has potential value as part of a combination therapy for the treatment of cancer. In this review, we focus on the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway as a target for cancer therapy, and in particular, DHODH. In the first part, we provide a comprehensive overview of this pathway and its regulation in cancer. We further describe the relevance of DHODH as a target for cancer therapy using bioinformatic analyses. We then explore the preclinical and clinical results of pharmacological strategies to target the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, with an emphasis on DHODH. Finally, we discuss potential strategies to harness DHODH as a target for the treatment of cancer.","['Madak, Joseph T', 'Bankhead, Armand 3rd', 'Cuthbertson, Christine R', 'Showalter, Hollis D', 'Neamati, Nouri']","['Madak JT', 'Bankhead A 3rd', 'Cuthbertson CR', 'Showalter HD', 'Neamati N']","['Department of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Michigan College of Pharmacy, Rogel Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA; Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Michigan College of Pharmacy, Rogel Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Michigan College of Pharmacy, Rogel Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.

It is metabolized by three cytosolic enzymes. One of them, thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT), is responsible for catalysing the methylation reaction of mercaptopurine to 6-methylmercaptopurine, thus inactivating the drug. Individuals with TPMT loss-of-function alleles (*2, *3A, *3B or *3C) can be extremely sensitive to the effect of mercaptopurine, since it can be accumulated, therefore producing haematological toxicity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of TPMT polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics of mercaptopurine. For that purpose, we used collected pharmacokinetic data from 48 healthy volunteers (all males) who received a single oral dose of mercaptopurine 50 mg in two bioequivalence studies. The volunteers were subsequently genotyped for TPMT *2, *3A, *3B and *3C alleles by real-time PCR. There were four carriers (8.3%) of TPMT*2 and TPMT*3A alleles. Mercaptopurine elimination was affected by TPMT loss-of-function polymorphisms, since heterozygous subjects show 18% higher half-life compared to wild-type individuals. This fact is consistent with the expected since the presence of loss-of-function alleles decreases TPMT enzymatic activity and, thus, affects mercaptopurine elimination. Moreover, mercaptopurine pharmacokinetic parameters were different among races, since Latins showed higher plasma concentrations and lower clearance compared to Caucasians. This fact might be due to a different distribution of polymorphisms in genes, other than TPMT, that also influence the pharmacokinetics of mercaptopurine.","['Saiz-Rodriguez, Miriam', 'Ochoa, Dolores', 'Belmonte, Carmen', 'Roman, Manuel', 'Martinez-Ingelmo, Cristina', 'Ortega-Ruiz, Lucia', 'Sarmiento-Iglesias, Carmen', 'Herrador, Coral', 'Abad-Santos, Francisco']","['Saiz-Rodriguez M', 'Ochoa D', 'Belmonte C', 'Roman M', 'Martinez-Ingelmo C', 'Ortega-Ruiz L', 'Sarmiento-Iglesias C', 'Herrador C', 'Abad-Santos F']","['Clinical Pharmacology Department, Instituto Teofilo Hernando, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria La Princesa (IP), Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (UAM), Hospital Universitario de La Princesa, Madrid, Spain.', 'Clinical Pharmacology Department, Instituto Teofilo Hernando, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria La Princesa (IP), Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (UAM), Hospital Universitario de La Princesa, Madrid, Spain.', 'UICEC Hospital Universitario de La Princesa, Plataforma SCReN (Spanish Clinical Research Network), Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria La Princesa (IP), Madrid, Spain.', 'Clinical Pharmacology Department, Instituto Teofilo Hernando, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria La Princesa (IP), Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (UAM), Hospital Universitario de La Princesa, Madrid, Spain.', 'UICEC Hospital Universitario de La Princesa, Plataforma SCReN (Spanish Clinical Research Network), Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria La Princesa (IP), Madrid, Spain.', 'Clinical Pharmacology Department, Instituto Teofilo Hernando, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria La Princesa (IP), Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (UAM), Hospital Universitario de La Princesa, Madrid, Spain.', 'UICEC Hospital Universitario de La Princesa, Plataforma SCReN (Spanish Clinical Research Network), Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria La Princesa (IP), Madrid, Spain.', 'Clinical Pharmacology Department, Instituto Teofilo Hernando, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria La Princesa (IP), Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (UAM), Hospital Universitario de La Princesa, Madrid, Spain.', 'Clinical Pharmacology Department, Instituto Teofilo Hernando, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria La Princesa (IP), Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (UAM), Hospital Universitario de La Princesa, Madrid, Spain.', 'Clinical Pharmacology Department, Instituto Teofilo Hernando, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria La Princesa (IP), Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (UAM), Hospital Universitario de La Princesa, Madrid, Spain.', 'Clinical Pharmacology Department, Instituto Teofilo Hernando, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria La Princesa (IP), Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (UAM), Hospital Universitario de La Princesa, Madrid, Spain.', 'Clinical Pharmacology Department, Instituto Teofilo Hernando, Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria La Princesa (IP), Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (UAM), Hospital Universitario de La Princesa, Madrid, Spain.', 'UICEC Hospital Universitario de La Princesa, Plataforma SCReN (Spanish Clinical Research Network), Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria La Princesa (IP), Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Enfermedades Hepaticas y Digestivas (CIBERehd), Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20181115,England,Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol,Basic & clinical pharmacology & toxicology,101208422,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Alleles', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Racial Groups', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Whites', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['genotype', 'mercaptopurine', 'pharmacokinetics', 'polymorphisms', 'thiopurine methyltransferase']",2018/10/23 06:00,2019/06/30 06:00,['2018/10/23 06:00'],"['2018/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/30 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bcpt.13153 [doi]'],ppublish,Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol. 2019 Apr;124(4):449-455. doi: 10.1111/bcpt.13153.

Most novel targeted therapies are indeed directed at proteins and protein functions, and cell signaling aberrations may therefore serve as biomarkers to indicate personalized treatment options. As opposed to DNA and RNA analyses, changes in protein activity can more efficiently evaluate the mechanisms underlying drug sensitivity and resistance. Phospho flow cytometry is a powerful technique that measures protein phosphorylation events at the cellular level, an important feature that distinguishes this method from other antibody-based approaches. The method allows for simultaneous analysis of multiple signaling proteins. In combination with fluorescent cell barcoding, larger medium- to high-throughput data-sets can be acquired by standard cytometer hardware in short time. Phospho flow cytometry has applications both in studies of basic biology and in clinical research, including signaling analysis, biomarker discovery and assessment of pharmacodynamics. Here, a detailed experimental protocol is provided for phospho flow analysis of purified peripheral blood mononuclear cells, using chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells as an example.","['Skanland, Sigrid S']",['Skanland SS'],"['Centre for Molecular Medicine Norway (NCMM), Nordic EMBL Partnership, University of Oslo; K.

RESULTS: We observed a previously unreported VNTR allele, AB7C, in a TPMT*3A heterozygous individual. VNTRs with two (AB2C) and three or more (ABnC, n >/= 3) B motifs were statistically significant in complete linkage disequilibrium (D' = 1, r(2) = 1, p < 0.0001) with the TPMT*3C and TPMT*3A alleles, respectively.

Over the past 20 years, more than 8000 papers have described their increasingly complex role and regulation in cancer. Presently, it is recognized that hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are regulated by oxygen-dependent and oxygen-independent mechanisms in cancer development; the list of their targets has increased to include more than 500 genes involved in most hallmarks of cancer. Areas covered: Most literature describes the function of HIF factors in solid tumors; however, in the past 10 years, evidence has steadily accumulated to indicate that HIFs are implicated in hematological malignancies. This review summarizes our current understanding of the function and regulation of HIF factors in hematopoiesis and leukemia. Moreover, we provide an update on pharmacological inhibitors of this pathway that have shown promising therapeutic effects in clinical trials or leukemia pre-clinical models. Expert opinion: The inhibition of the function of HIF factors may provide an interesting approach for treating leukemia. We posit that before moving into the clinic, we should (i) fully characterize the outcome of HIF inhibition in specific leukemia contexts (ii) test the possibility of combining HIF-targeting strategies with cytotoxic compounds and (iii) consider patient selection to increase therapeutic efficacy.","['Magliulo, Daniela', 'Bernardi, Rosa']","['Magliulo D', 'Bernardi R']","['a Vita-Salute San Raffaele University , Milan , Italy.', 'b Preclinical Models of Cancer Laboratory, Division of Experimental Oncology , San Raffaele Scientific Institute , Milan , Italy.', 'b Preclinical Models of Cancer Laboratory, Division of Experimental Oncology , San Raffaele Scientific Institute , Milan , Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20181027,England,Expert Opin Ther Targets,Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,101127833,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'Patient Selection']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*HIF', '*HIF inhibitors', '*hematopoiesis', '*hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)', '*hypoxia', '*leukemia', '*leukemia stem cells (LSCs)']",2018/10/23 06:00,2019/04/04 06:00,['2018/10/23 06:00'],"['2018/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14728222.2018.1538357 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Ther Targets. 2018 Nov;22(11):917-928. doi: 10.1080/14728222.2018.1538357.

METHODS: Six focus group discussions were conducted addressing two different cancer trajectories: primary malignant brain tumour and acute leukaemia. For each of the two cancer trajectories, separate FGIs were carried out with patients, relatives and clinical specialists to identify important concerns, challenges and uncertainties. The FGIs were video/audio-recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed within and across FGI groups to construct research topics. Finally, the literature was reviewed for existing evidence concerning the identified research topic(s) to strengthen the suggested research agendas. RESULTS: New research agendas related to high-grade glioma brain tumour and acute leukaemia with corresponding research questions were formulated within the topics of supportive care/palliation, education/information, rehabilitation, complementary and alternative therapy and organization of health care. CONCLUSION: User involvement in identifying research agendas has the potential to improve quality of care for patients and caregivers across the cancer trajectory, while minimizing the gap in research between the healthcare user and healthcare provider.","['Piil, Karin', 'Jarden, Mary', 'Pii, Kathrine Hoffmann']","['Piil K', 'Jarden M', 'Pii KH']","['Department of Oncology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'University Hospitals Center for Health Research (UCSF) and Center for Integrated Rehabilitation of Cancer Patients (CIRE), Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'University Hospitals Center for Health Research (UCSF) and Center for Integrated Rehabilitation of Cancer Patients (CIRE), Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Public Health, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Copenhagen University College, Institute of Nursing and Nutrition, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],['R113-A7069-14-S34/Danish Cancer Society'],['Journal Article'],20181021,England,Eur J Cancer Care (Engl),European journal of cancer care,9301979,,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Brain Neoplasms/rehabilitation/*therapy', 'Caregivers', '*Complementary Therapies', '*Delivery of Health Care', 'Female', 'Focus Groups', 'Glioma/rehabilitation/*therapy', 'Health Personnel', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/rehabilitation/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Palliative Care', '*Patient Education as Topic', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of Life', '*Research']",,['NOTNLM'],"['brain tumours', 'leukaemia', 'patient education', 'patient involvement', 'quality of life', 'research agenda']",2018/10/23 06:00,2019/05/15 06:00,['2018/10/23 06:00'],"['2018/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/28 00:00 [revised]', '2018/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/15 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ecc.12935 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Cancer Care (Engl). 2019 Jan;28(1):e12935. doi: 10.1111/ecc.12935.

Despite stopping immunosuppression, treatment with EBV-specific cytotoxic T cells, systemic rituximab, HD-MTX, and intrathecal chemotherapy, progression was observed. With a combination of HD-MTX and cytarabine, only a partial response could be achieved. Having all conventional modalities not only failed but resulted in significant toxicity, a salvage monotherapy with biweekly nivolumab has been instituted. The starting dose was 1.1 mg/kg, later escalated to 2.2 mg/kg. After 8 months of nivolumab therapy, PET-CT showed complete metabolic remission. Subsequently, the patient has been switched to a maintenance dosage of 1.1 mg/kg. No cytopenias, graft failure, GvHD, or any other alloimmune complications were seen during nivolumab therapy.

This peptide natural product contains an S-[(Z)-2-aminovinyl]-d-cysteine (AviCys) moiety in the C-terminus. Formation of AviCys moiety requires an oxidative decarboxylation of the C-terminal Cys of the precursor peptide CypA, and this process is catalyzed by a flavin-containing protein CypD. In this work, we tested CypD substrate specificity with a series of synthetic oligopeptides. We show that most of the N-terminal sequence of CypA is not required for CypD activity, and the C-terminal three residues serve as the minimal structural element for enzyme recognition. We also show that CypD tolerates various substrates with modified C-termini, allowing for the generation of four novel cypemycin variants with modified AviCys moiety by site direct mutagenesis of the precursor peptide CypA. Our study demonstrates the relaxed substrate specificity of CypD and lays a foundation for future bioengineering of AviCys-containing natural products.","['Ding, Wei', 'Mo, Tianlu', 'Mandalapu, Dhanaraju', 'Zhang, Qi']","['Ding W', 'Mo T', 'Mandalapu D', 'Zhang Q']","['Department of Chemistry, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200433, China.', 'Department of Chemistry, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200433, China.', 'Department of Chemistry, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200433, China.', 'Department of Chemistry, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200433, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180915,China,Synth Syst Biotechnol,Synthetic and systems biotechnology,101694371,,,,PMC6190514,,,2018/10/23 06:00,2018/10/23 06:01,['2018/10/23 06:00'],"['2018/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/09 00:00 [revised]', '2018/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.synbio.2018.09.002 [doi]', 'S2405-805X(18)30039-5 [pii]']",epublish,Synth Syst Biotechnol. 2018 Sep 15;3(3):159-162. doi: 10.1016/j.synbio.2018.09.002. eCollection 2018 Sep.,,,,,,,,,,,['Synth Syst Biotechnol. 2020 Oct 12;5(4):328.

Recently, the introduction of genome-wide approaches, including massive parallel sequencing methods (whole-genome, -exome, and -transcriptome sequencing), enabled extensive genomic studies which, together with gene expression profiling, largely expanded our understanding of leukemia pathogenesis and its heterogeneity. Novel BCP-ALL subtypes have been described. Exact identification of recurrent genetic alterations and their combinations facilitates more precise risk stratification of patients.

We examined the effects of ligand-induced NOTCH activation on the expression of NOTCHmodifying glycosyltransferases in two AML cell lines, THP-1 and TMD7. The cells were stimulated with recombinant NOTCH ligands JAGGED1 and DELTA1, and subjected to immunoblot analysis to evaluate the expression levels of glycosyltransferases. Ligand stimulation promoted the expression of POFUT1, LFNG, MFNG, RFNG, GXYLT1, GXYLT2, and XXYLT1 in THP-1 cells, and that of RFNG and GXYLT1 in TMD7 cells. We found that NOTCH activation promoted the expression of several glycosyltransferases in AML cells. This suggests that NOTCH activation modulates its sensitivity to NOTCH ligands by increased glycosylation of NOTCH receptors in AML cells. Further investigation is needed to elucidate its biological significance.","['Wang, Shichun', 'Itoh, Mai', 'Shiratori, Erika', 'Ohtaka, Mika', 'Tohda, Shuji']","['Wang S', 'Itoh M', 'Shiratori E', 'Ohtaka M', 'Tohda S']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180924,Italy,Hematol Rep,Hematology reports,101556723,,,,PMC6176398,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'NOTCH', 'glycosyltransferase']",2018/10/23 06:00,2018/10/23 06:01,['2018/10/23 06:00'],"['2018/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/13 00:00 [revised]', '2018/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4081/hr.2018.7576 [doi]'],epublish,Hematol Rep. 2018 Sep 24;10(3):7576. doi: 10.4081/hr.2018.7576. eCollection 2018 Sep 5.,,['Conflict of interests: the authors declare no conflict of interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, the importance of CBA was recognized by the 2018 guidelines of the International Workshop on CLL, which proposed the introduction of CBA in clinical trials to validate the value of karyotype aberrations. Indeed, a number of observational studies showed that cytogenetic aberrations and, particularly, the CK may have a negative independent impact on objective outcome measures (i.e. time to first treatment, progression free survival, time to chemorefractoriness and overall survival) both in patients treated with chemoimmunotherapy and, possibly, in patients receiving novel mechanism-based treatment.

The functional relationships of the PLCgamma2S707Y mutation to other PLCG2 mutations causing (i) Btk inhibitor resistance of CLL cells and (ii) the APLAID-related human disease PLCgamma2-associated antibody deficiency and immune dysregulation, PLAID, revealing different clinical characteristics including cold-induced urticaria, respectively, are currently incompletely understood. Here, we show that PLCgamma2S707 point mutants displayed much higher activities at 37 degrees C than the CLL Btk inhibitor resistance mutants R665W and L845F and the two PLAID mutants, PLCgamma2Delta19 and PLCgamma2Delta20-22. Combinations of CLL Btk inhibitor resistance mutations synergized to enhance PLCgamma2 activity, with distinct functional consequences for different temporal orders of the individual mutations. Enhanced activity of PLCgamma2S707Y was not observed in a cell-free system, suggesting that PLCgamma2 activation in intact cells is dependent on regulatory rather than mutant-enzyme-inherent influences. Unlike the two PLAID mutants, PLCgamma2S707Y was insensitive to activation by cooling and retained marked hyperresponsiveness to activated Rac upon cooling. In contrast to the PLAID mutants, which are insensitive to activation by endogenously expressed EGF receptors, the S707Y mutation markedly enhanced the stimulatory effect of EGF, explaining some of the pathophysiological discrepancies between immune cells of PLAID and APLAID patients in response to receptor-tyrosine-kinase activation.","['Walliser, Claudia', 'Wist, Martin', 'Hermkes, Elisabeth', 'Zhou, Yuan', 'Schade, Anja', 'Haas, Jennifer', 'Deinzer, Julia', 'Desire, Laurent', 'Li, Shawn S C', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Milner, Joshua D', 'Gierschik, Peter']","['Walliser C', 'Wist M', 'Hermkes E', 'Zhou Y', 'Schade A', 'Haas J', 'Deinzer J', 'Desire L', 'Li SSC', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Milner JD', 'Gierschik P']","['Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm 89070, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm 89070, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm 89070, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm 89070, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm 89070, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm 89070, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm 89070, Germany.', 'Diaxonhit, Paris 75013, France.', 'Department of Biochemistry and The Siebens-Drake Medical Research Institute, Schulich School of Medicine, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario N6A 5C1, Canada.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm 89070, Germany.', 'Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm 89070, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180928,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,PMC6188132,['NOTNLM'],"['B cell signaling', ""Bruton's tyrosine kinase"", 'autoinflammation', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'inositol phosphates']",2018/10/23 06:00,2018/10/23 06:01,['2018/10/23 06:00'],"['2018/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.26173 [doi]', '26173 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2018 Sep 28;9(76):34357-34378. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.26173. eCollection 2018 Sep 28.,,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare that they have no conflicts of', 'interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quizartinib, gilteritinib, and midostaurin are inhibitors against FLT3-ITD that have good efficacy for FLT3-ITD-positive AML patients. Long-term administration leads to drug resistance through acquired tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations in FLT3-ITD, such as N676K, F691L, D835V, and Y842C. Here, our screen to detect inhibitors capable of overcoming resistance to FLT3 inhibitors identified heat shock protein (HSP) 90 inhibitors as potential candidates. Although Ba/F3 cells expressing FLT3-ITD with TKD mutations (Ba/F3-ITD+N676K, Ba/F3-ITD+F691L, Ba/F3-ITD+D835V, and Ba/F3-ITD+Y842C) showed various resistance patterns to FLT3 inhibitors compared with Ba/F3-ITD cells that express FLT3-ITD lacking TKD mutations, they were more sensitive to HSP90 inhibitors than Ba/F3 cells. Notably, the Ba/F3-ITD+D835V cells were the most sensitive to HSP90 inhibitors. Treatment with HSP90 inhibitors downregulated FLT3 and its downstream signaling and induced G1 arrest followed by apoptosis in Ba/F3-ITD+N676K, Ba/F3-ITD+F691L, Ba/F3-ITD+Y842C, and especially Ba/F3-ITD+D835V cells at lower concentrations compared with Ba/F3-ITD cells. The downregulation of FLT3-ITD+D835V was caused by rapid proteolysis in autophagy. Similar results were also observed in the quizartinib-resistant MV4-11 cells, QR1 and QR2, which were established by culturing cells in the presence of quizartinib and harbored FLT3-ITD+D835H and FLT3-ITD+D835V, respectively, in a single allele. Interestingly, the efficacies of HSP90 inhibitors in QR cells are reversely correlated with that of quizartib, but not to gilteritinib and midostaurin. Collectively, HSP90 inhibitors are good candidates to overcome drug resistance in AML with various FLT3-ITD TKD mutations.","['Katayama, Kazuhiro', 'Noguchi, Kohji', 'Sugimoto, Yoshikazu']","['Katayama K', 'Noguchi K', 'Sugimoto Y']","['Division of Chemotherapy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Chemotherapy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Chemotherapy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180928,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,PMC6188142,['NOTNLM'],"['FLT3', 'HSP90 inhibitor', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'drug resistance', 'quizartinib']",2018/10/23 06:00,2018/10/23 06:01,['2018/10/23 06:00'],"['2018/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.26045 [doi]', '26045 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2018 Sep 28;9(76):34240-34258. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.26045. eCollection 2018 Sep 28.,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST We have no potential conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML is generally regarded as a stem cell disease characterized by an accumulation of undifferentiated and functionally heterogeneous populations of cells, The aim of the present study was to identify leukemia stem cells in patients with AML and their correlations with treatment outcomes namely remission status, disease free survival, and overall survival. Results: The mean percentages of CD34(+)CD38(-) and CD34(+)CD38(low/-)CD123(+) LSCs were 2.2+/- 0.4and 22.3+/- 2.6, respectively. The percentages of CD34(+)cells, CD34(+)CD38(-) and CD34(+)CD38(low/-)CD123(+) LSCs were significantly lower in AML patients with complete remission than those without complete response (P<0.001, P<0.004, P<0.001 respectively). The mean OS of all study patients was 20.03+/-1.2 months while the median OS was 21 months (95% CI=18.32-21.48). The mean DFS was 16.96+/-1.02 months and the median was 18 months (95% CI=8.9-11.4). DFS and OS were significantly higher among those who achieved CR than those without CR. In addition, there were significant negative effects of WBCs, CD34(+)cells, CD34(+)CD38(-) and CD34(+)CD38(-)CD123(+)LSCs on DFS and OS. Patients and methods: We investigated 30 patients with newly diagnosed AML; all patients underwent complete history taking, and thorough physical and clinical examination, complete blood count. Peripheral smears and bone marrow aspirates were also examined. Cytochemistry and immunophenotyping of leukemic cells were performed routinely in bone marrow using monoclonal antibodies. Flow cytometry was used to analyze leukemia stem cells and their expression of CD123. Conclusion: Our study elucidated that CD34+CD38-LSCs, with or without CD123+LSCs phenotype was present in a significant proportion of AML patients and it could be responsible for resistance to traditional treatments, and high percentage of MRD that was translated into significantly high number of non CR, poor DFS, and OS.","['Zahran, Asmaa M', 'Aly, Sanaa Shaker', 'Rayan, Amal', 'El-Badawy, Omnia', 'Fattah, Maged Abdel', 'Ali, Arwa Mohammed', 'ElBadre, Hala M', 'Hetta, Helal F']","['Zahran AM', 'Aly SS', 'Rayan A', 'El-Badawy O', 'Fattah MA', 'Ali AM', 'ElBadre HM', 'Hetta HF']","['Clinical Pathology Department, South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.', 'Clinical and Chemical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, South Valley University, Qena, Egypt.', 'Clinical Oncology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.', 'Medical Microbiology and Immunology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.', 'Medical Oncology Department, South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.', 'Medical Oncology Department, South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.', 'Medical Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.', 'Medical Microbiology and Immunology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180925,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,PMC6183348,['NOTNLM'],"['CD34+CD38-CD123+LSCs', 'CD34+CD38-LSCs', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'disease free survival', 'overall survival']",2018/10/23 06:00,2018/10/23 06:01,['2018/10/23 06:00'],"['2018/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.26118 [doi]', '26118 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2018 Sep 25;9(75):34056-34065. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.26118. eCollection 2018 Sep 25.,,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declared that they had no potential conflicts', 'of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its enrichment pattern is conserved in mammalian transcriptomes, and the level of m6A is tightly regulated by methyltransferases (writers), demethylases (erasers) and binding proteins (readers). Furthermore, accumulating evidence suggests that the aberrant regulation of m6A turnover is associated with multiple types of cancer including acute myeloid leukemia, breast cancer, glioblastoma, lung cancer and liver cancer.

The expression of miR-574-3p in peripheral blood obtained from patients with CML was examined. Subsequently, miR-574-3p was overexpressed and suppressed in CML K562 cells to further investigate the effects of miR-574-3p on cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Furthermore, a luciferase reporter assay was performed to investigate whether interleukin-6 (IL-6) was a target of miR-574-3p. In addition, the regulatory association between miR-574-3p and the IL-6/Janus kinase (JNK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) signaling pathway was explored. The expression of miR-574-3p in the peripheral blood obtained from patients with CML was significantly lower compared with that in healthy controls. Overexpression of miR-574-3p significantly inhibited the proliferation and induced the apoptosis of K562 cells, whereas suppression of miR-574-3p exhibited opposite effects. In addition, IL-6 was identified to be a direct target of miR-574-3p. Overexpression of IL-6 significantly promoted the proliferation and inhibited the apoptosis of K562 cells. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-574-3p inhibited the activation of the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway, which was rescued by overexpression of IL-6. The results of the current study indicate that miR-574-3p overexpression may serve an important role in inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis of K562 cells via suppression of IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway activation. miR-574-3p may serve as a potential therapeutic target for CML.","['Yang, Haoying', 'Zhang, Jun', 'Li, Jiuping', 'Zhao, Furong', 'Shen, Yao', 'Xing, Xuemei']","['Yang H', 'Zhang J', 'Li J', 'Zhao F', 'Shen Y', 'Xing X']","[""Department of Blood Transfusion, San Er Ling Yi Hospital Affiliated to School of Medicine, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Hanzhong, Shanxi 723000, P.R.

Material and Methods: Data were obtained from the Cancer Registry of Serbia, Institute of Public Health of Serbia. Standardized incidence and mortality rates per 100,000 inhabitants were calculated by direct standardization method using World Standard Population. Analysis of raw data indicated single-digit numbers per year and per 5-year age cohorts. Therefore, we merged years of diagnosis to three-year intervals, creating so-called ""moving averages"". We also merged study population to 10-year age cohorts. Results: Both incidence and mortality rates increased with age, i.e., the lowest rates were observed in the youngest age groups and the highest rates were observed in oldest age groups. In all age groups, except the youngest (15(-)24 years), AML incidence was statistically significantly higher in men compared with women. Average age-adjusted incidence was 2.73/100,000 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.28(-)3.71). Average age-adjusted mortality was 1.81/100,000 (95% CI 1.30(-)2.26). Overall, there were no significant changes in incidence trend. Age-adjusted incidence rates had increasing tendency among men aged 65(-)74 years (B = 0.80, standard error (SE) = 0.11; p = 0.005) and in total population aged 65(-)74 years (B = 0.41, SE = 0.09; p = 0.023). Increasing tendency in incidence of AML among women was observed in age group >75 years (B = 0.63, SE = 0.14; p = 0.019). No changes of mortality trend were observed. Conclusion: There was no significant change in trends of AML from 1999 to 2013 in the population of Belgrade.","['Maksimovic, Natasa', 'Zaric, Milica', 'Gazibara, Tatjana', 'Trajkovic, Goran', 'Maric, Gorica', 'Miljus, Dragan', 'Suvajdzic Vukovic, Nada', 'Tomin, Dragica', 'Virijevic, Marijana', 'Kisic Tepavcevic, Darija', 'Pekmezovic, Tatjana']","['Maksimovic N', 'Zaric M', 'Gazibara T', 'Trajkovic G', 'Maric G', 'Miljus D', 'Suvajdzic Vukovic N', 'Tomin D', 'Virijevic M', 'Kisic Tepavcevic D', 'Pekmezovic T']","['Institute of Epidemiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia. natamax07@yahoo.com.', 'Institute of Epidemiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia. milicamzaric@yahoo.com.', 'Institute of Epidemiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia. gazibara@drenik.net.', 'Institute of Medical Statistics and Informatics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia. gtrajkovic@gmail.com.', 'Institute of Epidemiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia. goricamaric87@gmail.com.', 'Institute of Public Health of Serbia ""Dr Milan Jovanovic Batut"", Dr Subotica 5, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia. dragan_miljus@batut.org.rs.', 'Clinic for Hematology, Clinical Center of Serbia, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia.

Genome-wide evaluation for copy number abnormalities (CNAs) is at present performed by karyotype analysis which has low resolution and is unobtainable in a subset of cases. Furthermore, examination for possible CN-LOH in leukemia cells is at present not routinely performed in the clinical setting. Chromosomal microarray (CMA) analysis is a widely available assay for CNAs and CN-LOH in diagnostic laboratories, but there are currently no guidelines how to best incorporate this technology into clinical testing algorithms for neoplastic diseases including AML. The Cancer Genomics Consortium Working Group for Myeloid Neoplasms performed an extensive review of peer-reviewed publications focused on CMA analysis in AML. Here we summarize evidence regarding clinical utility of CMA analysis in AML extracted from published data, and provide recommendations for optimal utilization of CMA testing in the diagnostic workup.

DESCRIPTION OF CASES: The first patient had progressive Lyell syndrome with spontaneous corneal perforation. The second had a severe graft vs. host reaction with a persistent Seidel-positive descemetocele. Despite repeated penetrating keratoplasties, amniotic membrane (AM) transplantations, and buccal mucosal (BM) grafts, they both experienced recurrent corneal perforation. The only solution thus appeared to be Boston Type I KP surgery. One month postoperatively, the first patient had to receive a temporalis aponeurosis (TA) graft, due to thinning of the recipient graft. Six months postoperatively, his visual acuity (VA) was 1/10 without correction, and the corneal status had been stabilized. The second patient underwent KP and TA graft concurrently. Six months after surgery, VA was 2/10 uncorrected, and the local inflammation had been stabilized. OBSERVATION: Boston type I keratoprostheses constitute an alternative in cases of severe bilateral corneal blindness with perforation refractory to conventional treatment and surgery, with satisfactory visual results. DISCUSSION: Patients with preoperative severe ocular surface disease are at greater risk of postoperative keratolysis. For our patients with a higher risk, TA graft prevented corneal melt. TA seems to be more effective than AM or BM in preventing corneal thinning or melt. CONCLUSION: We would recommend performing a TA graft in combination with Boston KP surgery concurrently as first line treatment in eyes with severe ocular surface inflammation.","['Moyal, L', 'Adam, R', 'Boumendil, J', 'Meney, J', 'Rodallec, T', 'Akesbi, J', 'Nordmann, J-P']","['Moyal L', 'Adam R', 'Boumendil J', 'Meney J', 'Rodallec T', 'Akesbi J', 'Nordmann JP']","[""Service d'ophtalmologie II, centre hospitalier national des Quinze-Vingts, 28, rue de Charenton, 75012 Paris, France.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ERK5 inhibitor, XMD8-92, on proliferation and apoptosis in AML cell lines. Findings showed that XMD8-92 inhibited the activation of ERK5 by G-CSF and decreased the expression of c-Myc and Cyclin D1. The treatment of XMD8-92 reduced the phosphorylation of ERK5 leading to a distinct inhibition of cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in Kasumi-1 and HL-60 cells. Taken together, our study suggests that the inhibition of ERK5 by XMD8-92 can trigger apoptosis and inhibit proliferation in AMLs. Therefore, the inhibition of ERK5 may be an effective adjuvant in AML chemotherapy.","['Kang, Changhee', 'Kim, Jong Soo', 'Kim, C-Yoon', 'Kim, Eun-Young', 'Chung, Hyung-Min']","['Kang C', 'Kim JS', 'Kim CY', 'Kim EY', 'Chung HM']","['Department of Stem Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Stem Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Stem Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Stem Cell Research Center, Jeju National University, Jeju, Korea.', 'Mirae Cell Bio Co.

A decision analytic model was used to explore the effectiveness and cost burden of MSI-H/dMMR mCRC treatment. METHODS: The treatment of hypothetical patients with MSI-H/dMMR mCRC was simulated in 2 treatment scenarios: a third-line treatment and an exploratory first-line treatment. The treatments compared were nivolumab, ipilimumab and nivolumab, trifluridine and tipiracil (third-line treatment), and mFOLFOX6 and cetuximab (first-line treatment). Disease progression, drug toxicity, and survival rates were based on the CheckMate 142, study of TAS-102 in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer refractory to standard chemotherapies (RECOURSE), and Cancer and Leukemia Group B/Southwest Oncology Group 80405 trials. The analyzed outcomes included survival (life-years), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: Ipilimumab with nivolumab was the most effective strategy (10.69 life-years and 9.25 QALYs for the third line; 10.69 life-years and 9.44 QALYs for the first line) in comparison with nivolumab (8.21 life-years and 6.76 QALYs for the third line; 8.21 life-years and 7.00 QALYs for the first line), trifluridine and tipiracil (0.74 life-years and 0.07 QALYs), and mFOLFOX6 and cetuximab (2.72 life-years and 1.63 QALYs). However, neither checkpoint inhibitor therapy was cost-effective in comparison with trifluridine and tipiracil (nivolumab ICER, $153,000; ipilimumab and nivolumab ICER, $162,700) or mFOLFOX6 and cetuximab (nivolumab ICER, $150,700; ipilimumab and nivolumab ICER, $158,700). CONCLUSIONS: This modeling analysis found that both single and dual checkpoint blockade could be significantly more effective for MSI-H/dMMR mCRC than chemotherapy, but they were not cost-effective, largely because of drug costs. Decreases in drug pricing and/or the duration of maintenance nivolumab could make ipilimumab and nivolumab cost-effective. Prospective clinical trials should be performed to explore the optimal duration of maintenance nivolumab.","['Chu, Jacqueline N', 'Choi, Jin', 'Ostvar, Sassan', 'Torchia, James A', 'Reynolds, Kerry Lynn', 'Tramontano, Angela', 'Gainor, Justin F', 'Chung, Daniel C', 'Clark, Jeffrey W', 'Hur, Chin']","['Chu JN', 'Choi J', 'Ostvar S', 'Torchia JA', 'Reynolds KL', 'Tramontano A', 'Gainor JF', 'Chung DC', 'Clark JW', 'Hur C']","['Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Institute for Technology Assessment, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Institute for Technology Assessment, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Institute for Technology Assessment, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Division of Gastroenterology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Institute for Technology Assessment, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Division of Gastroenterology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, New York.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181021,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (Ipilimumab)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '31YO63LBSN (Nivolumab)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'Folfox protocol']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/economics/therapeutic use', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/economics/genetics/pathology', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'DNA Mismatch Repair', 'Drug Costs', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/economics/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Ipilimumab/administration & dosage/economics', 'Leucovorin/economics/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Middle Aged', 'Nivolumab/administration & dosage/economics', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/economics/therapeutic use', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*colorectal neoplasms', '*cost-benefit analysis', '*immunotherapy', '*ipilimumab', '*nivolumab']",2018/10/22 06:00,2019/10/28 06:00,['2018/10/22 06:00'],"['2018/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/18 00:00 [revised]', '2018/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/28 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.31795 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2019 Jan 15;125(2):278-289. doi: 10.1002/cncr.31795.

There are challenges in the estimation of population-based survival using registry data because treatments and prognosis vary greatly by subtype. The objective of the current study was to determine leukemia survival estimates in the United States from 1995 to 2009 according to subtype, sex, geographical area, and race. METHODS: Five-year net survival was estimated using data for 370,994 patients from 43 registries in 37 states and in 6 metropolitan areas, covering approximately 81% of the adult (15-99 years) US population. Leukemia was categorized according to principal subtype (chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and acute lymphocytic leukemia), and subcategorized in accordance with the HAEMACARE protocol. We analyzed age-standardized 5-year net survival by calendar period (1995-1999, 2000-2004, and 2005-2009), leukemia subtype, sex, race, and US state. RESULTS: The age-standardized 5-year net survival estimates increased from 45.0% for patients diagnosed during 1995-1999 to 49.0% for those diagnosed during 2000-2004 and 52.0% for those diagnosed during 2005-2009. For patients diagnosed during 2005-2009, 5-year survival was 18.2% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 17.8%-18.6%) for acute myeloid leukemia, 44.0% (95% CI, 43.2%-44.8%) for acute lymphocytic leukemia, and 77.3% (95% CI, 76.9%-77.7%) for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. For nearly all leukemia subtypes, survival declined in successive age groups above 45 to 54 years. Men were found to have slightly lower survival than women; however, this discrepancy was noted to have fallen in successive calendar periods. Net survival was substantially higher in white than black patients in all calendar periods. There were large differences in survival noted between states and metropolitan areas. CONCLUSIONS: Survival from leukemia in US adults improved during 1995-2009. Some geographical differences in survival may be related to access to care. We found disparities in survival by sex and between black and white patients.","['Bailey, Chris', 'Richardson, Lisa C', 'Allemani, Claudia', 'Bonaventure, Audrey', 'Harewood, Rhea', 'Moore, Angela R', 'Stewart, Sherri L', 'Weir, Hannah K', 'Coleman, Michel P']","['Bailey C', 'Richardson LC', 'Allemani C', 'Bonaventure A', 'Harewood R', 'Moore AR', 'Stewart SL', 'Weir HK', 'Coleman MP']","['Cancer Survival Group, Department of Non-Communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Cancer Survival Group, Department of Non-Communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Survival Group, Department of Non-Communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Survival Group, Department of Non-Communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Cancer Survival Group, Department of Non-Communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['CC999999/Intramural CDC HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20181021,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*classification/diagnosis/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mortality/trends', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data', 'SEER Program', 'Survival Analysis', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC6392057,['NOTNLM'],"['*Epidemiology', '*National Program of Cancer Registries', '*Surveillance', '*United States', '*and End Results (SEER)', '*cancer', '*cancer registries', '*leukemia', '*population-based survival']",2018/10/22 06:00,2019/09/24 06:00,['2018/10/22 06:00'],"['2018/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/15 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/24 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.31674 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2018 Oct 1;124(19):3856-3867. doi: 10.1002/cncr.31674.

The authors evaluated changes in patterns of real-world testing and treatment over time by comparing 2 population-based cohorts. METHODS: The National Cancer Institute-sponsored Patterns of Care study was conducted among patients with CLL who were sampled from 14 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program registries. Demographics, testing, and treatment data were abstracted from medical records within 24 months of diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 1008 patients diagnosed in 2008 and 1367 patients diagnosed in 2014 were included. There was a significant increase in fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing, immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene (IgVH ) mutation analyses, and lymph node biopsies between 2008 and 2014. FISH testing was performed in the majority of, but not all, treated patients (53% in 2008, which increased to 62% in 2014). Some differences in the receipt of FISH testing by age and insurance status were observed over time (older patients and Medicare patients without private insurance were less likely to be tested in 2014). There were contrasting testing patterns noted by practice type and year, with nonteaching hospitals more likely to perform bone marrow biopsies in 2008, and teaching hospitals more likely to perform FISH and IgVH testing in 2014. There also were differences in treatments over time, with the use of bendamustine and rituximab being more common in 2014, at the expense of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab. CONCLUSIONS: There have been rapidly changing practices in the testing and treatment patterns of patients with CLL within the last decade.","['Seymour, Erlene K', 'Ruterbusch, Julie J', 'Beebe-Dimmer, Jennifer L', 'Schiffer, Charles A']","['Seymour EK', 'Ruterbusch JJ', 'Beebe-Dimmer JL', 'Schiffer CA']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Oncology, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Oncology, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Oncology, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Oncology, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan.']",['eng'],"['HHSN261201300011C/RC/CCR NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261201300011I/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA022453/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20181021,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bendamustine Hydrochloride/therapeutic use', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/statistics & numerical data', 'Diagnostic Techniques and Procedures/classification/*trends', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/statistics & numerical data', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Rituximab/therapeutic use', 'SEER Program', 'Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy/statistics & numerical data']",PMC6309467,['NOTNLM'],"['*Epidemiology', '*Surveillance', '*and End Results (SEER)', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)', '*patterns of care', '*testing', '*treatments']",2018/10/22 06:00,2019/10/12 06:00,['2018/10/22 06:00'],"['2018/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/24 00:00 [revised]', '2018/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.31738 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2019 Jan 1;125(1):135-143. doi: 10.1002/cncr.31738.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present 4 cases in which DECT was used to detect various malignant bone lesions and was successfully used to direct percutaneous DECT-guided bone biopsies. RESULTS: Two of the lesions were solid tumor metastases (breast and prostate carcinoma), whereas two others were hematological malignancies (leukemia and lymphoma). This technique enabled us to confidently and accurately direct the biopsy needle into the target lesion. CONCLUSION: The authors demonstrate that the DECT VNCa bone marrow algorithm may be helpful in identifying isodense bone lesions of various histologies and may be used to guide percutaneous bone biopsies. This technique may help to maximize diagnostic yield, minimize the number of passes into the region of concern, and prevent patients from undergoing repeat biopsy.","['Burke, Michael C', 'Garg, Ankur', 'Youngner, Jonathan M', 'Deshmukh, Swati D', 'Omar, Imran M']","['Burke MC', 'Garg A', 'Youngner JM', 'Deshmukh SD', 'Omar IM']","['Department of Radiology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, 676 North Saint Clair Street, Suite 800, Chicago, IL, 60611, USA. michael.c.burke.85@gmail.com.', 'Department of Radiology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, 676 North Saint Clair Street, Suite 800, Chicago, IL, 60611, USA.', 'Department of Radiology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, 676 North Saint Clair Street, Suite 800, Chicago, IL, 60611, USA.', 'Department of Radiology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, 676 North Saint Clair Street, Suite 800, Chicago, IL, 60611, USA.', 'Department of Radiology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, 676 North Saint Clair Street, Suite 800, Chicago, IL, 60611, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20181020,Germany,Skeletal Radiol,Skeletal radiology,7701953,['0 (Contrast Media)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Algorithms', 'Bone Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging/*secondary', 'Contrast Media', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Image-Guided Biopsy', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography', 'Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*methods']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Bone biopsy', 'Dual-energy CT', 'Isodense bone lesion']",2018/10/22 06:00,2019/02/26 06:00,['2018/10/22 06:00'],"['2018/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/09/24 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/26 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00256-018-3087-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s00256-018-3087-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Skeletal Radiol. 2019 Apr;48(4):605-613. doi: 10.1007/s00256-018-3087-1.

However, when present, distant disease carries a particularly poor prognosis. Evidence guiding optimal treatment of such patients is lacking. We assessed PRRT outcomes in patients with somatostatin receptor (SSTR) positive metastatic rectal NEN from two referral centres. METHODS: Patients treated with PRRT were retrospectively reviewed. Morphologic (RECIST 1.1), SSTR imaging responses and toxicity were assessed 3 months post-PRRT. Kaplan-Meier estimate was used to determine progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) from start of PRRT. RESULTS: Twenty-seven consecutive patients (M = 20, age 31-81 years) were reviewed. The majority (70%) had ENETs grade 2 disease (19 patients), three had Grade 3, one Grade 1, and four not documented. Overall, 63% (10/16 patients with available FDG PET/CT) had FDG avid disease. Twenty-six patients were treated for disease progression. Most had (177)Lu-DOTA-octreotate with median cumulative activity of 30 GBq, median four cycles. 14 patients had radiosensitising chemotherapy (5FU or capecitabine). At 3 months post-PRRT, CT disease control rate (DCR) was 96%: partial response was observed in 70% (19/27) and stable disease in 26%. All but one had partial SSTR imaging response. The median PFS was 29 months. Ten patients died, with median overall survival 81 months with a median follow-up of 67 months. Seventeen patients had further treatments after initial PRRT (10 had further cycles of PRRT). Three patients had grade 3 lymphopenia, without significant renal toxicity, MDS or leukaemia. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate high efficacy and morphologic responses with minimal toxicity and very encouraging survival from PRRT in patients with metastatic rectal NEN despite the adverse prognostic features of this cohort. Further prospective PRRT trials are warranted in this subgroup.","['Kong, Grace', 'Grozinsky-Glasberg, Simona', 'Hofman, Michael S', 'Akhurst, Tim', 'Meirovitz, Amichay', 'Maimon, Ofra', 'Krausz, Yodphat', 'Godefroy, Jeremy', 'Michael, Michael', 'Gross, David J', 'Hicks, Rodney J']","['Kong G', 'Grozinsky-Glasberg S', 'Hofman MS', 'Akhurst T', 'Meirovitz A', 'Maimon O', 'Krausz Y', 'Godefroy J', 'Michael M', 'Gross DJ', 'Hicks RJ']","['Centre for Cancer Imaging, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, 305 Grattan Street, Melbourne, VIC, 3000, Australia.

FUBP1 is a master regulator of transcription, translation, and RNA splicing. FUBP1 has been identified as a potent pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic factor by modulation of complex networks. FUBP1 is also described either as an oncoprotein or a tumor suppressor. Especially, FUBP1 overexpression is observed in a growing number of cancer and leads to a deregulation of targets that includes the fine-tuned MYC oncogene. Moreover, recent loss-of-function analyses of FUBP1 establish its essential functions in hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and survival. Therefore, FUBP1 appears as an emerging suspect in hematologic disorders in addition to solid tumors. The scope of the present review is to describe the advances in our understanding of the molecular basis of FUBP1 functions in normal cells and carcinogenesis.

We aimed to compare overall survival (OS) between children with newly diagnosed acute leukemia who received AM alone as the first-line treatment and those treated with conventional chemotherapy (CCT). METHODS: Two-to-one nearest-neighbor propensity score-matching using sex, initial white blood cell count, phenotype of leukemia, and period of diagnosis was performed on 184 patients who received CCT and 92 who received AM alone after being diagnosed with leukemia. A multivariable Cox proportional-hazards regression model was then applied to assess the effect of treatment on OS after adjusting for potential confounders. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) are provided. RESULTS: After adjusting for initial white cell count and subtype of leukemia, children treated with AM alone had worse OS (HR 5.14, 95% CI 3.75-7.04) than those given CCT. The 5-year OS rate for newly diagnosed acute leukemia treated with AM medicine alone was 0%. CONCLUSION: AM without CCT is associated with poorer survival when compared with CCT.","['Chotsampancharoen, Thirachit', 'Sripornsawan, Pornpun', 'Duangchu, Sarapee', 'Wongchanchailert, Malai', 'McNeil, Edward']","['Chotsampancharoen T', 'Sripornsawan P', 'Duangchu S', 'Wongchanchailert M', 'McNeil E']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University, Hat Yai, Thailandcthirachit@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University, Hat Yai, Thailand.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University, Hat Yai, Thailand.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University, Hat Yai, Thailand.', 'Epidemiology Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University, Hat Yai, Thailand.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181019,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Alternative medicine', '*Childhood leukemia', '*Survival outcomes']",2018/10/22 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2018/10/22 06:00'],"['2018/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['000493417 [pii]', '10.1159/000493417 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2018;140(4):203-208. doi: 10.1159/000493417.

In 2012, a protocol combining bortezomib, dexamethasone, asparaginase, doxorubicin, and vincristine administered to children with RR-ALL was published with encouraging results. Over the past 5 years, we have implemented this protocol in the adult RR-ALL population (> 18 years) and addressed its feasibility in terms of remission rate and toxicity. Here, we present the results of our experience in 9 patients, all of whom received multiple previous chemotherapy protocols, two of them relapsing after an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. All of the five B-ALL patients, and two of the four T-ALL achieved complete remission. Of the seven patients achieving complete remission, two patients were referred for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, two patients were subsequently given blinatumomab, and one patient subsequently received donor lymphocyte infusion followed by blinatumomab. Thus, five out of nine patients treated (55%) were able to proceed to best available therapy in a complete remission. We observed minimal adverse effects, mainly hematological toxicity. We conclude that the bortezomib-based protocol should be evaluated as an effective and well-tolerated treatment option for adult patients either unfit for or failing standard salvage chemotherapy, as a bridge to immunotherapy or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.","['Nachmias, Boaz', 'Shaulov, Adir', 'Gatt, Moshe E', 'Shapira, Michael', 'Gural, Alexander']","['Nachmias B', 'Shaulov A', 'Gatt ME', 'Shapira M', 'Gural A']","['Leukemia Service, Department of Hematology, Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem, IsraelNachmiasB@gmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Assuta Medical Center, Ramat-Gan, Israel.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Hematology, Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181019,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '4FR53SIF3A (blinatumomab)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Bortezomib/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Febrile Neutropenia/etiology', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology/therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Bortezomib', '*Relapsed/refractory']",2018/10/22 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2018/10/22 06:00'],"['2018/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['000493252 [pii]', '10.1159/000493252 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2018;140(4):209-214. doi: 10.1159/000493252.

METHODS: We evaluated the outcomes of two well-established strategies used for GVHD prevention: in vivo T cell depletion using antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and ex vivo T cell depletion using a CD34-selected (CD34+) graft. A total of 525 adult patients (363 ATG, 162 CD34+) with intermediate or high-risk cytogenetics acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first complete remission (CR1) were included. Patients underwent myeloablative allo-HCT using matched related or unrelated donors. RESULTS: Two-year overall survival estimate was 69.9% (95% CI, 58.5-69.4) in the ATG group and 67.6% (95% CI, 60.3-74.9) in the CD34+ group (p = 0.31). The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD and chronic GVHD was higher in the ATG cohort [HR 2.0 (95% CI 1.1-3.7), p = 0.02; HR 15.1 (95% CI 5.3-42.2), p < 0.0001]. Parameters associated with a lower GVHD-free relapse-free survival (GRFS) were ATG [HR 1.6 (95% CI 1.1-2.2), p = 0.006], adverse cytogenetic [HR 1.7 (95% CI 1.3-2.2), p = 0.0004], and the use of an unrelated donor [HR 1.4 (95% CI 1.0-1.9), p = 0.02]. There were no statistical differences between ATG and CD34+ in terms of relapse [HR 1.52 (95% CI 0.96-2.42), p = 0.07], non-relapse mortality [HR 0.96 (95% CI 0.54-1.74), p = 0.90], overall survival [HR 1.43 (95% CI 0.97-2.11), p = 0.07], and leukemia-free survival [HR 1.25 (95% CI 0.88-1.78), p = 0.21]. Significantly, more deaths related to infection occurred in the CD34+ group (16/52 vs. 19/112, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that both ex vivo CD34-selected and in vivo ATG T cell depletion are associated with a rather high OS and should be compared in a prospective randomized trial.","['Malard, Florent', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Cho, Christina', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Papadopoulos, Esperanza B', 'Passweg, Jakob', ""O'Reilly, Richard"", 'Forcade, Edouard', 'Maloy, Molly', 'Volin, Liisa', 'Castro-Malaspina, Hugo', 'Hicheri, Yosr', 'Jakubowski, Ann A', 'Orvain, Corentin', 'Giralt, Sergio', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Perales, Miguel-Angel']","['Malard F', 'Labopin M', 'Cho C', 'Blaise D', 'Papadopoulos EB', 'Passweg J', ""O'Reilly R"", 'Forcade E', 'Maloy M', 'Volin L', 'Castro-Malaspina H', 'Hicheri Y', 'Jakubowski AA', 'Orvain C', 'Giralt S', 'Mohty M', 'Nagler A', 'Perales MA']","[""Service d'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire, AP-HP, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, F-75012, France. malardf@yahoo.fr."", 'INSERM, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine (CRSA), Sorbonne Universite, F-75012, Paris, France. malardf@yahoo.fr.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire, AP-HP, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, F-75012, France."", 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplantation Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Programme de Transplantation & Therapie Cellulaire, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplantation Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'University Hospital, Hematology, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'CHU Bordeaux, Hopital Haut-leveque, Pessac, France.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplantation Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, HUCH Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplantation Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', ""Departement d'Hematologie Clinique, CHU Lapeyronie, Montpellier, France."", 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplantation Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Service des Maladies du Sang, CHRU, Angers, France.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplantation Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire, AP-HP, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, F-75012, France."", 'INSERM, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine (CRSA), Sorbonne Universite, F-75012, Paris, France.', 'EBMT Paris Study Office/CEREST-TC, Paris, France.', 'Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplantation Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA. peralesm@mskcc.org.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA. peralesm@mskcc.org.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplantation Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, Box 298, New York, NY, 10065, USA. peralesm@mskcc.org.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA023766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20181020,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*methods', 'Young Adult']",PMC6195954,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation', '*Antithymocyte globulin', '*CD34-selected graft', '*T cell depletion']",2018/10/22 06:00,2020/01/10 06:00,['2018/10/22 06:00'],"['2018/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-018-0668-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-018-0668-3 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2018 Oct 20;11(1):127. doi: 10.1186/s13045-018-0668-3.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-3474-0002'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the study was to investigate the properties and potential cytotoxicity of 7 different phospholipid-based dispersions intended for parenteral administration: emulsions, liposomes and WLDs. Each formulation contained egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) in the concentration range of 0.6-5.0%, and to some formulations other surfactants, such as polysorbate 80 (P80), Solutol HS 15 (HS) and cholesterol (Ch) were added. Particles in all dispersions were homogenous (PDI<0.26) and submicron in size (Z-average in the range of approx. 100-260nm). The cytotoxicity of all tested formulations was evaluated by means of 3 independent methods: a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, a real-time xCELLigence (RTCA) system, and a flow cytometry analysis, using two cell lines: human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) and human promyelocytic leukaemia (HL-60). The results indicated that regardless of the test method and cell line type, the cytotoxicity of all formulations was low, especially when dispersions diluted to concentrations of =10% were tested. A more pronounced cytotoxic effect was noticed only for the following formulations: E-P80 (emulsion containing P80), WLD (unbuffered aqueous lecithin dispersion) and L-Ch (liposomes containing Ch), tested as less diluted (concentration 10% or 25%). IC50 values measured for these dispersions (on HL-60 cells) amounted to: 10.4+/-0.5% (v/v), 14.4+/-0.2% (v/v) and 24.2+/-0.6% (v/v), respectively.

ZIP8 functionality has been recently reported to regulate cell proliferation, migration and cytoskeleton arrangement, exhibiting an essential role for normal physiology. In this study, we report a ZIP8 role in chemotherapy response. We show ZIP8 regulates cell sensitivity to the anti-cancer drug cisplatin. Overexpression of ZIP8 in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells induces cisplatin sensitivity, while knockout of ZIP8 in leukemia HAP1 cells leads to cisplatin resistance. In ZIP8 altered cells and transgenic mice, we show cisplatin is not a direct ZIP8 substrate. Further studies demonstrate that ZIP8 regulates anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. ZIP8 overexpression decreases Bcl-2 levels in cultured cells, mice lung and liver tissue while loss of ZIP8 elevates Bcl-2 expression in HAP1 cells and liver tissue. We also observe that ZIP8 overexpression modulates cisplatin-induced cell apoptosis, manifested by the increased protein level of cleaved Caspase-3. Since Bcl-2 elevation was previously discovered to induce cisplatin drug resistance, our results suggest ZIP8 may modulate cisplatin drug responses as well as apoptosis through Bcl-2. We therefore conclude ZIP8 is a new molecule to be involved in cisplatin drug responses and is predicted as a genetic factor to be considered in cisplatin therapy.","['Geng, Xiangrong', 'Liu, Liu', 'Tsai, Kan-Jen', 'Liu, Zijuan']","['Geng X', 'Liu L', 'Tsai KJ', 'Liu Z']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Oakland University, Rochester, MI 48309, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Oakland University, Rochester, MI 48309, USA.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory and Biotechnology, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Oakland University, Rochester, MI 48309, USA.

Besides the only FDA-approved CXCR4 antagonist Plerixafor (AMD3100), multiple other classes of CXCR4-targeting molecules are under (pre-)clinical development. Nanobodies (Nb), small single variable domains of heavy-chain only antibodies from Camelids, have appeared to be ideal antibody-fragments for targeting a broad range of epitopes and cavities within GPCRs such as CXCR4. Compared to conventional antibodies, monovalent nanobodies show fast blood clearance and no effector functions. In order to further increase their binding affinities and to restore antibody-mediated effector functions, we have constructed three different bivalent nanobody Fc-fusion molecules (Nb-Fc), targeting distinct epitopes on CXCR4, via fusion of Nbs to a Fc domain of a human IgG1 antibody. Most Nb-Fc constructs show increased binding affinity and enhanced potency in CXCL12 displacement, inhibition of CXCL12-induced signaling and CXCR4-mediated HIV entry, when compared to their monovalent Nb counterparts. Moreover, Nb-Fc induced ADCC- and CDC-mediated cell-death of CXCR4-overexpressing CCRF-CEM leukemia cells and did not affect cells expressing low levels or no CXCR4.

The HNSCC FaDu cell ectopic expression of Twist, a key transcriptional factor of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which triggers EMT and results in the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype, was used as the cell model. Our results demonstrated that treatment with newly synthesized 2-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-5-methylnaphthyridin-4-one (CSC-3436), a flavonoid derivative, elicited changes in its cell morphology, upregulated E-cadherin messenger RNA and protein expression, downregulated N-cadherin, vimentin, and CD133 (a marker associated with tumor-initiating cells) in FaDu-pCDH-Twist cells. Moreover, CSC-3436 exposure reduced B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (Bmi1) expression regulated by Twist and further suppressed the direct co-regulation of E-cadherin by Twist and Bmi1. Interestingly, CSC-3436 reduced EMT, cancer stemness, and migration/invasion abilities through the inhibition of the Twist/Bmi1-Akt/beta-catenin pathway. Most importantly, our findings provided new evidence that CSC-3436 played a crucial role in therapeutic targeting to Bmi1 and its molecular pathway in HNSCC, and it will be valuable in prognostic prediction and treatment.","['Lai, Ying-Ju', 'Yu, Wan-Nien', 'Kuo, Sheng-Chu', 'Ho, Chi-Tang', 'Hung, Chao-Ming', 'Way, Tzong-Der', 'Chen, Chiung-Tong']","['Lai YJ', 'Yu WN', 'Kuo SC', 'Ho CT', 'Hung CM', 'Way TD', 'Chen CT']","['Institute of Bioinformatics and Structural Biology, College of Life Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Research, National Health Research Institutes, Miaoli, Taiwan.', 'Division of Head & Neck Oncology, Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head & Neck Surgery, Changhua Christian Hospital, Changhua, Taiwan.', 'School of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Food Science, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey.', 'Department of General Surgery, E-Da Hospital, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'School of Medicine, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biological Science and Technology, College of Biopharmaceutical and Food Sciences, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Health and Nutrition Biotechnology, College of Health Science, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biochemistry, College of Life Science, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Bioinformatics and Structural Biology, College of Life Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Research, National Health Research Institutes, Miaoli, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biological Science and Technology, College of Biopharmaceutical and Food Sciences, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181020,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (CDH1 protein, human)', '0 (CSC-3436)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Naphthyridines)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (TWIST1 protein, human)', '0 (Twist-Related Protein 1)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cadherins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Naphthyridines/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/secondary', 'Twist-Related Protein 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*2-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-5-methylnaphthyridin-4-one (CSC-3436)', '*B cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (Bmi1)', '*epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)', '*head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)', '*twist']",2018/10/21 06:00,2020/04/21 06:00,['2018/10/21 06:00'],"['2018/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.27589 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2019 Jun;234(6):9118-9129. doi: 10.1002/jcp.27589.

Endogenous protein inhibitors of PP2A, SET and CIP2A, were up-regulated in various human cancers, so it is vital to review the essential mechanisms of tumor promotion by the okadaic acid class compounds, together with cancer progression by SET and CIP2A in humans. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The first part of this review introduces the okadaic acid class compounds and the mechanism of tumor promotion: (1) inhibition of PP1 and PP2A activities of the okadaic acid class compounds; (2) some topics of tumor promotion; (3) TNF-alpha gene expression as a central mediator in tumor promotion; (4) exposure to the okadaic acid class of tumor promoters in relation to human cancer. The second part emphasizes the overexpression of SET and CIP2A in cancer progression, and the anticancer activity of SET antagonists as follows: (5) isolation and characterization of SET; (6) isolation and characterization of CIP2A; (7) progression of leukemia with SET; (8) progression of breast cancer with SET and CIP2A; (9) progression of lung cancer with SET; (10) anti-carcinogenic effects of SET antagonists OP449 and FTY720; and also (11) TNF-alpha-inducing protein of Helicobacter pylori, which is a clinical example of the okadaic acid pathway. CONCLUSIONS: The overexpression of endogenous protein inhibitors of PP2A, SET and CIP2A, is tightly linked to the progression of various human cancers, as well as Alzheimer's disease.","['Fujiki, Hirota', 'Sueoka, Eisaburo', 'Watanabe, Tatsuro', 'Suganuma, Masami']","['Fujiki H', 'Sueoka E', 'Watanabe T', 'Suganuma M']","['Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Nabeshima, Saga, 849-8501, Japan. uv4h-fjk@asahi-net.or.jp.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Nabeshima, Saga, 849-8501, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Nabeshima, Saga, 849-8501, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Saitama University, Saitama, 338-8570, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20181020,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CIP2A protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Chaperones)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (SET protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoantigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Disease Progression', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/adverse effects/chemistry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Helicobacter Infections/complications/microbiology', 'Helicobacter pylori/metabolism', 'Histone Chaperones/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Membrane Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*etiology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Okadaic Acid/*adverse effects/chemistry', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/metabolism']",PMC6244643,['NOTNLM'],"['CIP2A', 'Okadaic acid', 'PP1', 'PP2A', 'SET', 'TNF-alpha', 'Tipalpha']",2018/10/21 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/10/21 06:00'],"['2018/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00432-018-2765-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s00432-018-2765-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2018 Dec;144(12):2339-2349. doi: 10.1007/s00432-018-2765-7.

We performed a Phase II single-arm study evaluating the use of aprepitant on days 1-5, in combination with a 5-HT antagonist on days 1-3, in AML patients undergoing induction chemotherapy with daunorubicin on days 1-3 plus cytarabine, given as a continuous infusion, on days 1-7. This was compared to a retrospective cohort of AML patients that received the same chemotherapy regimen with a 5-HT antagonist but without aprepitant. The cumulative incidence of vomiting/retching by the end of day 5 was significantly lower in the aprepitant vs. the control group (26.3 vs. 52.8%, p = 0.013). The cumulative incidence of nausea by the end of day 5 was 61% in the aprepitant group vs. 75% in the control group. The total use of supplemental anti-emetics on days 2-5 was also significantly lower in the aprepitant group (p = 0.01). In contrast, the cumulative incidence of vomiting/retching by the end of day 8, the incidence of vomiting/retching on days 6-8, and the use of anti-emetics on days 6-8, were not significantly different between the two groups. The results suggest that the use of aprepitant may be associated with a lower rate of emesis during aprepitant dosing days, but not afterward.

Notably, the t(12;21) translocation leading to an ETV6-AML1 fusion gene is the most common genetic alteration found in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Moreover, most of these patients also lack ETV6 expression, suggesting a tumor suppressor function. To gain insights on ETV6 DNA-binding specificity and genome wide transcriptional regulation capacities, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments coupled to deep sequencing in a t(12;21)-positive pre-B leukemic cell line. This strategy led to the identification of ETV6-bound regions that were further associated to gene expression. ETV6 binding is mostly cell type-specific as only few regions are shared with other blood cell subtypes. Peaks localization and motif enrichment analyses revealed that this unique binding profile could be associated with the ETV6-AML1 fusion protein specific to the t(12;21) background. This study underscores the complexity of ETV6 binding and uncovers ETV6 transcriptional network in pre-B leukemia cells bearing the recurrent t(12;21) translocation.","['Neveu, Benjamin', 'Caron, Maxime', 'Lagace, Karine', 'Richer, Chantal', 'Sinnett, Daniel']","['Neveu B', 'Caron M', 'Lagace K', 'Richer C', 'Sinnett D']","['Sainte-Justine UHC Research Center, Montreal, Qc, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Qc, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine UHC Research Center, Montreal, Qc, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine UHC Research Center, Montreal, Qc, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Qc, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine UHC Research Center, Montreal, Qc, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine UHC Research Center, Montreal, Qc, Canada. daniel.sinnett@umontreal.ca.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Qc, Canada. daniel.sinnett@umontreal.ca.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Qc, Canada. daniel.sinnett@umontreal.ca.']",['eng'],"['106658/Gouvernement du Canada | Canadian Institutes of Health Research (Instituts', 'de Recherche en Sant&amp;#x00E9; du Canada)/International']",['Journal Article'],20181019,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Binding Sites/*genetics', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Genome, Human', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', '*Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism']",PMC6195514,,,2018/10/21 06:00,2019/10/28 06:00,['2018/10/21 06:00'],"['2018/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-018-33947-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-018-33947-1 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2018 Oct 19;8(1):15526. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-33947-1.,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3733-5723', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3625-6676']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SAMHD1 has also been implicated in DNA damage repair that may impact DNA damage-inducing therapies such as anthracyclines, during induction therapy. To determine whether SAMHD1 limits ara-C efficacy during induction or consolidation therapy, SAMHD1 protein levels were assessed in two patient cohorts of de novo AML from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (USA) and the National University Hospital (Singapore), respectively, using immunohistochemistry and tissue microarrays. SAMHD1 was expressed at a variable level by AML blasts but not in a broad range of normal hematopoietic cells in reactive bone marrows. A sizeable patient subset with low SAMHD1 expression (<25% of positive blasts) was identified, which was significantly associated with longer event-free (EFS) and overall (OS) survival in patients receiving high-dose cytarabine (HDAC) during consolidation. Therefore, evaluation of SAMHD1 expression level in AML blasts at diagnosis, may stratify patient groups for future clinical trials combining HDAC with novel SAMHD1 inhibitors as consolidation therapy.","['Rassidakis, George Z', 'Herold, Nikolas', 'Myrberg, Ida Hed', 'Tsesmetzis, Nikolaos', 'Rudd, Sean G', 'Henter, Jan-Inge', 'Schaller, Torsten', 'Ng, Siok-Bian', 'Chng, Wee Joo', 'Yan, Benedict', 'Ng, Chin Hin', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Xagoraris, Ioanna', 'Khoury, Joseph D']","['Rassidakis GZ', 'Herold N', 'Myrberg IH', 'Tsesmetzis N', 'Rudd SG', 'Henter JI', 'Schaller T', 'Ng SB', 'Chng WJ', 'Yan B', 'Ng CH', 'Ravandi F', 'Andreeff M', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Xagoraris I', 'Khoury JD']","['Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. georgios.rassidakis@ki.se.', ""Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. nikolas.herold@ki.se."", ""Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."", ""Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."", 'Science for Life Laboratory, Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', ""Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."", 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Virology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'National University Cancer Institute of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'National University Cancer Institute of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Pathology, National University Hospital and Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'National University Cancer Institute of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181019,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 3.1.5.- (SAM Domain and HD Domain-Containing Protein 1)', 'EC 3.1.5.- (SAMHD1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'SAM Domain and HD Domain-Containing Protein 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",PMC6195559,,,2018/10/21 06:00,2019/05/02 06:00,['2018/10/21 06:00'],"['2018/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/19 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41408-018-0134-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41408-018-0134-z [pii]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2018 Oct 19;8(11):98. doi: 10.1038/s41408-018-0134-z.,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4368-3855', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2621-3584']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Over the course of a year, this study followed two patients with terminal diagnoses, their treating physicians, and Segyu Rinpoche as the patients underwent treatment at the Juniper Clinic. The patients entering the study had exhausted all known medical options. One patient suffered from chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL] and the other from bronchiolitis obliterans [BOS] brought about by graft versus host disease following a bone marrow transplant for leukemia. Their treating physicians are prominent members of two different teaching/research hospitals. This was an IRB approved study conducted in conformity with HIPAA standards. SETTING: The patients participated in treatments with Segyu Rinpoche twice a month at his clinic and engaged in daily meditation as instructed by Rinpoche. The study followed both patients through in-depth, face-to-face interviews, wellness surveys, weekly journal entries, and medical records. The study also followed the physicians and Segyu Rinpoche through face-to-face interviews. RESULTS: Both patients and physicians identified significant shifts in patient wellbeing, including less pain, greater happiness and more ease. In addition, both physicians and patients reported a reduced need for medication. Some aspects of the design were more or less successful in tracking patient experience (i.e., health and wellness survey vs. personal journals). The success of the pilot indicates that more qualitative case studies are needed. CONCLUSIONS: Patients and physicians identified a significant increase in overall patient wellbeing. Hence, on an anecdotal level, the study demonstrated the usefulness of subtle energy healing as practiced by Segyu Rinpoche and the Juniper Clinic. The success of the pilot indicates the potential value of full qualitative studies for this modality.","['Pascale, Celine-Marie', 'Schaeff, Catherine M']","['Pascale CM', 'Schaeff CM']","['Watkins Bldg, RM 105, Dept. of Sociology, American University, 4400 Massachusetts Ave, NW, Washington, DC 20016-8072, United States.

Reported overall survival (OS) rates vary between high-income developed countries and those with fewer resources. The OS of rAML in high-income developing countries (HIDCs) has not been reported. PATIENTS AND MATERIALS: A multicenter study was performed in an HIDC. The outcome of patients with relapsed non-M3/non-Down syndrome AML was evaluated. Three-year OS was computed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and predictors of OS were analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: A total of 88 patients with non-M3/non-Down syndrome AML diagnosed between January 2005 and December 2012 with a first relapse were identified. Their 3-year OS was 22.6% +/- 5.4%. Patients with inv(16) and t(8;21) had an OS of 75.0% +/- 21.7% and 36.0% +/- 16.1%, respectively. Worse outcomes were associated with ""other intermediate"" and 11q23 rearrangement AML (OS of 9.4% +/- 8.7% and 10.7% +/- 9.6%, respectively). Patients experiencing time to relapse (TTR) less than 1 year had shorter OS than those with a longer TTR (14.6% +/- 5.4% vs. 41.1% +/- 11.5%; P = .006). The outcome of patients after stem cell transplantation (SCT) in second complete remission (CR2) was superior compared with no SCT (50.9% +/- 11.2% vs. 7.7% +/- 4.6%; P = .001). TTR, risk group, CR2, and SCT in CR2 were the most significant predictors for survival. CONCLUSIONS: rAML remains a clinical challenge. Genetic variability in outcomes was observed. A majority of patients with inv(16) were successfully salvaged post-relapse, whereas patients with 11q23 rearrangement had a poor prognosis. Only one-third of those with t(8;21) rAML survived. Better access to SCT in HIDCs is needed.","['Jastaniah, Wasil', 'Bayoumy, Mohamed', 'Alsultan, Abdulrahman', 'Al Daama, Saad', 'Ballourah, Walid', 'Al-Anzi, Faisal', 'Al Shareef, Omar', 'Al Sudairy, Reem', 'Abrar, Mohammed Burhan', 'Al Ghemlas, Ibrahim']","['Jastaniah W', 'Bayoumy M', 'Alsultan A', 'Al Daama S', 'Ballourah W', 'Al-Anzi F', 'Al Shareef O', 'Al Sudairy R', 'Abrar MB', 'Al Ghemlas I']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Umm AlQura University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia; Princess Noorah Oncology Center, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University and King Abdulaziz Medical City, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

CASES: We report on two pediatric cases of patients successfully treated by eculizumab for severe HSCT-TMA, occurring in two girls (8.4 and 3.6 years). The first patient developed TMA with hematologic abnormalities and renal/pulmonary lesions after allogeneic HSCT for Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia; she received eculizumab 7 months after HSCT, with a dramatic improvement of renal function. The second patient developed severe TMA (cardiac tamponade, renal failure requiring dialysis, gastritis) after autologous HSCT for metastatic neuroblastoma. She received eculizumab for 7 months, with a dramatic improvement of renal function. No side effects were observed. CONCLUSION: The use of eculizumab as first-line therapy in pediatric patients with severe HSCT-TMA with multisystemic lesions appears promising. Larger international studies are required to confirm its benefit and safety for this specific indication.","['Genere, L', 'Bacchetta, J', 'Bertrand, Y', 'Javouhey, E', 'Cheikh, N', 'Sellier-Leclerc, A-L']","['Genere L', 'Bacchetta J', 'Bertrand Y', 'Javouhey E', 'Cheikh N', 'Sellier-Leclerc AL']","['Centre de reference des maladies renales rares, hopital Femme-Mere-Enfant, Hospices Civils de Lyon, 59, boulevard Pinel 69677 Bron cedex, France.', 'Centre de reference des maladies renales rares, hopital Femme-Mere-Enfant, Hospices Civils de Lyon, 59, boulevard Pinel 69677 Bron cedex, France; Faculte de medecine Lyon Est, universite Lyon 1, 69008 Lyon, France.', ""Faculte de medecine Lyon Est, universite Lyon 1, 69008 Lyon, France; Institut d'hematologie et oncologie pediatriques, 69008 Lyon, France."", 'Faculte de medecine Lyon Est, universite Lyon 1, 69008 Lyon, France; Service de reanimation pediatrique, hopital Femme-Mere-Enfant, Hospices Civils de Lyon, 69677 Bron, France.', ""Service d'hematologie et oncologie pediatrique, 25000 Besancon, France."", 'Centre de reference des maladies renales rares, hopital Femme-Mere-Enfant, Hospices Civils de Lyon, 59, boulevard Pinel 69677 Bron cedex, France.

Only a few studies have reported the impact of different antibacterial prophylaxis treatments on digestive tract flora and infection-related mortality. PROCEDURES: We performed a retrospective analysis of two different digestive tract decontamination modalities (selective or total digestive decontamination) in a large single-center series of 323 children during the induction treatment of acute leukemia between January 1995 and December 2014. We examined the impact of antibiotic prophylaxis and food regimen (sterile or selected) on the digestive tract flora during the period of antibacterial prophylaxis, on the frequency of bacteremia, and on antibiotic sensitivity. RESULTS: Only one Gram-negative (Klebsiella pneumonia) translocation occurred in the SDD group. No infection-related death occurred. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) bacteria were observed in seven of 170 (4%) patients in the SDD group. The faecal-flora total suppression and faecal-flora Gram-negative bacilli suppression was 67 and 77%, respectively, in the TDD group with sterile food, 0 and 58%, respectively, in the SDD group with sterile food, and 6 and 63%, respectively, in the SDD group with selective food. CONCLUSIONS: This study gives a rationale not to use antibacterial prophylaxis systematically in children who receive induction treatment for acute leukemia; additionally, antibiotics should only be used in case of stool contamination by highly pathogenic bacteria with a high potential of translocation.","['Chastagner, P', 'Michel, D', 'Contet, A', 'Lozniewski, A', 'Hadou, T', 'Schmitt, C', 'Phulpin, A', 'Fouyssac, F', 'Mansuy, L']","['Chastagner P', 'Michel D', 'Contet A', 'Lozniewski A', 'Hadou T', 'Schmitt C', 'Phulpin A', 'Fouyssac F', 'Mansuy L']","['Pediatric oncology department, Nancy university hospital, 54511 Vandoeuvre, France.

Moreover, it has been shown to act as an anti-inflammatory compound in animal models of ischemic perfusion, post-operative inflammation, periodontal disease, arthritis and obesity. Glycine acts by binding to a glycine-gated chloride channel, which has been demonstrated on neurons and immune cells, including macrophages, polymorphonuclear neutrophils and lymphocytes. The present study aims to evaluate the effect of glycine on allergy development in a cow's milk allergy model. To this end, C3H/HeOuJ female mice were supplemented with glycine by oral gavage (50 or 100 mg/mouse) 4 hours prior to sensitization with cow's milk whey protein, using cholera toxin as adjuvant. Acute allergic skin responses and anaphylaxis were assessed after intradermal allergen challenge in the ears. Mouse mast cell protease-1 (mMCP-1) and whey specific IgE levels were detected in blood collected 30 minutes after an oral allergen challenge. Jejunum was dissected and evaluated for the presence of mMCP-1-positive cells by immunohistochemistry. Intake of glycine significantly inhibited allergy development in a concentration dependent manner as indicated by a reduction in; acute allergic skin response, anaphylaxis, serum mMCP-1 and serum levels of whey specific IgE. In addition, in-vitro experiments using rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL), showed that free glycine inhibited cytokine release but not cellular degranulation. These findings support the hypothesis that the onset of cow's milk allergy is prevented by the oral intake of the amino acid glycine. An adequate intake of glycine might be important in the improvement of tolerance against whey allergy or protection against (whey-induced) allergy development.","['van Bergenhenegouwen, Jeroen', 'Braber, Saskia', 'Loonstra, Reinilde', 'Buurman, Nicole', 'Rutten, Lieke', 'Knipping, Karen', 'Savelkoul, Paul J', 'Harthoorn, Lucien F', 'Jahnsen, Frode L', 'Garssen, Johan', 'Hartog, Anita']","['van Bergenhenegouwen J', 'Braber S', 'Loonstra R', 'Buurman N', 'Rutten L', 'Knipping K', 'Savelkoul PJ', 'Harthoorn LF', 'Jahnsen FL', 'Garssen J', 'Hartog A']","['Nutricia Research, Uppsalalaan 12, 3584, CT, Utrecht, The Netherlands; Division of Pharmacology, Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Science, Utrecht University, 3584, CG, Utrecht, The Netherlands.

A phase I clinical trial (NCT01702064) investigated the tolerability and safety of treating chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia patients with ruxolitinib in combination with the BCR-ABL TKI nilotinib and explored initial efficacy evidence. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Eleven patients already treated with single-agent nilotinib (300-400 mg twice daily) commenced combination therapy, and molecular responses were evaluated after 6 months. Three ruxolitinib dose cohorts were studied: 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg twice daily. RESULTS: One patient experienced a grade 3/4 adverse event (hypophosphatemia) and 36% of patients experienced grade 1/2 anemia. Of 10 patients who were evaluable for responses, 40% had undetectable BCR-ABL transcripts, as measured by quantitative RT-PCR after 6 months. Plasma inhibitory assay results revealed a decrease in phospho-STAT3 levels after treatment with ruxolitinib. The recommended phase 2 dose of ruxolitinib was 15 mg BID. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this combination was safe and well-tolerated, and the molecular responses were encouraging, thereby warranting further investigation in a phase 2 trial.","['Sweet, Kendra', 'Hazlehurst, Lori', 'Sahakian, Eva', 'Powers, John', 'Nodzon, Lisa', 'Kayali, Fadi', 'Hyland, Kelly', 'Nelson, Ashley', 'Pinilla-Ibarz, Javier']","['Sweet K', 'Hazlehurst L', 'Sahakian E', 'Powers J', 'Nodzon L', 'Kayali F', 'Hyland K', 'Nelson A', 'Pinilla-Ibarz J']","['H.

Eukaryotic initiation factor 3a (eIF3a) plays a critical role in affecting tumor cell proliferation and differentiation. However, whether eIF3a is implicated in chronic myeloid leukemia cells differentiation remains unclear. Our results demonstrated that eIF3a could be suppressed by ATPR in K562 cells. The results also confirmed that ATPR could arrest cell cycle in G0/G1 phase and induced differentiation. Moreover, over-expression of eIF3a promoted not only protein expression of c-myc and cyclin D1, but also prevented the expression of p-Raf-1, p-ERK and the myeloid differentiation markers CD11b and CD14 and had an influence on inducing the morphologic mature. However, silencing eIF3a expression by small interfering RNA could have an adverse effect on K562 cells.

Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) decorated graphitic carbon nitride (AuNPs/g-C3N4) as photoelectrochemical species and primary antibody (Ab1) against ALV-J were immobilized onto ITO electrode in turn. An ALP-CdTe-Ab2 bio-conjugant was fabricated by assembling second antibody (Ab2) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) to CdTe quantum dots (QDs) surface. The PEC immunosensor was fabricated by successively anchoring the target ALV-J and ALP-CdTe-Ab2 bio-conjugants onto electrode surface via the immune recognition. By virtue of the matched energy levels between CdTe QDs and AuNPs/g-C3N4, ALP-CdTe-Ab2 bio-conjugants could serve as the PEC active probes for photocurrent enhancement. Moreover, the photocurrent response could be further enhanced attributed to the ALP catalytic chemistry to in situ produce ascorbic acid for electron donating, achieving an effective dual signal-on mode for PEC assay. On the basis of the ALV-J titers-dependent photocurrent increment, the fabricated PEC immunosensor showed high sensitivity, specificity and stability for ALV-J assay in a wide linear range with a low detection limit of 85 TCID50/mL. This PEC immunosensor with the dual signal-on strategy may open up a promising platform for more target analytes in novel immune analysis and clinical diagnostics.","['Sun, Bing', 'Dong, Jing', 'Cui, Lin', 'Feng, Tiantian', 'Zhu, Jiujuan', 'Liu, Xuanhe', 'Ai, Shiyun']","['Sun B', 'Dong J', 'Cui L', 'Feng T', 'Zhu J', 'Liu X', 'Ai S']","['School of Science, China University of Geosciences (Beijing), Beijing 100183, China.

However, excessive arsenic exposure can disturb myocardial cell metabolism, which results in the inhibition of growth and development of chickens. Since disordered mitochondria influences cardiac physiology and pathology, a better understanding of the mechanisms modulating cardiomyocyte mitochondria process is critical for identifying the potent detoxication targets under arsenic exposure in chickens. Male Hy-line chickens (1-day-old) were fed either a basal diet or an arsenic trioxide (As2O3)-supplemented diet containing 7.5, 15, and 30 mg/kg As2O3 for 90 d. The concentrations of ions ([Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, As, Mn, Fe, Zn] and [Cr, Ni, Cu, Ba]) significantly increased and decreased in the heart of chicken under As2O3 exposure, respectively. Moreover, we observed that As2O3 decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations and increased total cholesterol concentrations in the serum. We also observed arterial wall degeneration, biochemical character of mitochondria undergoing either fission or fusion, typical apoptotic cells, typical DNA fragments and TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling positive nuclei under As2O3 exposure in the heart. Further quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated that B cell lymphoma/leukemia 2 (Bcl2) were significantly decreased and dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), Optic atrophy 1 (Opa1), mitochondrial fission factor 1 (Mfn1), Mfn2, p53, caspase-8, Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax), caspase-3, caspase-9 and cytochrome C were significantly increased in all As2O3 group. In conclusion, As2O3 can disturb the trace elements homeostasis, which might favor the development of mitochondrial damage. Moreover, we suspected that As2O3-increased mitochondrial dynamics might trigger the apoptosis to limit cell metabolism. These features might identify the role of the mitochondrial dynamics under arsenic-induced cardiovascular disease in the chickens.","['Li, Siwen', 'Zhao, Hongjing', 'Wang, Yu', 'Shao, Yizhi', 'Liu, Juanjuan', 'Xing, Mingwei']","['Li S', 'Zhao H', 'Wang Y', 'Shao Y', 'Liu J', 'Xing M']","['Department of Physiology, College of Wildlife Resources, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, PR China.', 'Department of Physiology, College of Wildlife Resources, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, PR China.', 'Department of Physiology, College of Wildlife Resources, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, PR China.', 'Department of Physiology, College of Wildlife Resources, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, PR China.', 'Department of Physiology, College of Wildlife Resources, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, PR China.', 'Department of Physiology, College of Wildlife Resources, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin 150040, Heilongjiang, PR China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Poult Sci,Poultry science,0401150,"['0 (Trace Elements)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic/*toxicity', 'Arsenic Trioxide/*toxicity', 'Cardiotoxicity/etiology/*metabolism', 'Chickens/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Random Allocation', 'Trace Elements/deficiency/*metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['arsenic', 'chicken', 'heart', 'mitochondrial dynamics', 'trace elements']",2018/10/20 06:00,2019/03/07 06:00,['2018/10/20 06:00'],"['2018/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/07 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0032-5791(19)30545-0 [pii]', '10.3382/ps/pey469 [doi]']",ppublish,Poult Sci. 2019 Feb 1;98(2):734-744. doi: 10.3382/ps/pey469.,,,['(c) 2018 Poultry Science Association Inc.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MAC induces caspase/poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-mediated apoptosis in leukemia cells. However, the effects of MAC on autophagy in cancer cells and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we show that MAC induces autophagy in lung cancer cells. MAC significantly induced the expression of autophagy marker proteins including LC3-II, Beclin1, and ATG7. MAC promoted AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and inhibited the phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its downstream signalling proteins P70S6K and 4EBP1. The AMPK activator AICAR upregulated LC3-II expression through the AMPK/mTOR pathway similar to the effects of MAC. MAC-induced LC3-II protein expression was slightly reduced in AMPK siRNA transfected cells. MAC upregulated hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and BNIP3, which are HIF-1alpha-dependent autophagic proteins. Treatment with CoCl2 , which mimics hypoxia, induced autophagy similar to the effect of MAC. The HIF-1alpha inhibitor YC-1 and HIF-1alpha siRNA inhibited the MAC-induced upregulation of LC3-II and BNIP3. These results suggest that MAC induces autophagy via the AMPK/mTOR signalling pathway and by upregulating HIF-1alpha and BNIP3 protein expression in lung cancer cells.","['Seok, Ji-Young', 'Jeong, Yun-Jeong', 'Hwang, Soon-Kyung', 'Kim, Cheorl-Ho', 'Magae, Junji', 'Chang, Young-Chae']","['Seok JY', 'Jeong YJ', 'Hwang SK', 'Kim CH', 'Magae J', 'Chang YC']","['Research Institute of Biomedical Engineering and Department of Medicine, Catholic University of Daegu School of Medicine, Daegu, Korea.', 'Research Institute of Biomedical Engineering and Department of Medicine, Catholic University of Daegu School of Medicine, Daegu, Korea.', 'Research Institute of Biomedical Engineering and Department of Medicine, Catholic University of Daegu School of Medicine, Daegu, Korea.', 'Department of Biological Science, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Kyunggi, Korea.', 'Magae Bioscience Institute, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Research Institute of Biomedical Engineering and Department of Medicine, Catholic University of Daegu School of Medicine, Daegu, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181019,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (BNIP3 protein, human)', '0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (MAP1LC3B protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Terpenes)', '38561-40-9 (4-O-methylascochlorin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Ascomycota/chemistry', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Cell Hypoxia/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/*genetics', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/genetics', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics', 'Terpenes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects']",PMC6237564,['NOTNLM'],"['* AMPK', '*4-O-methylascochlorin', '*BNIP3', '*HIF-1alpha', '*autophagy']",2018/10/20 06:00,2019/11/02 06:00,['2018/10/20 06:00'],"['2017/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/02 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jcmm.13933 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2018 Dec;22(12):6345-6356. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.13933.

The As2O3-mediated degradation of PML-RARA (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor-alpha) oncoprotein via the proteasome pathway appears to be critical for such distinguished sensitivity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study was to evaluate the influence by chloroquine (CQ), an inhibitor to the release of lysosomal enzymes, on the sensitivity of APL cells to As2O3. APL-derived NB4 cell line was treated with As2O3 or/and CQ in vitro. Then, the cell viability, the induction of apoptosis, and autophagy were examined with MTT assay, with TUNEL staining or with enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP)-light Chain 3 (LC3) reporter. The apoptosis- or autophagy-associated proteins were quantified with Western blotting assay. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that the As2O3 treatment promoted either apoptosis or autophagy in APL NB4 cells and upregulated both apoptosis- and autophagy-associated proteins. However, additional CQ treatment deteriorated the As2O3-induced NB4 cell apoptosis, whereas aggravated the As2O3-induced accumulation of acidic vesicular organelles (AVOs) and blocked the lysosomal degradation in NB4 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Chloroquine aggravates the arsenic trioxide-induced apoptosis of APL NB4 cells via inhibiting lysosomal degradation in vitro. It implies that chloroquine might be adjuvant to sensitize APL cells to arsenic trioxide.","['Liu, D-M', 'Zhang, X-D', 'Yang, L']","['Liu DM', 'Zhang XD', 'Yang L']","['Department of Hematology, Laiyang Central Hospital, Yantai, Shandong Province, China. yangling84vid@163.com.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (MAP1LC3A protein, human)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '886U3H6UFF (Chloroquine)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Arsenic Trioxide/*pharmacology', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chloroquine/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Lysosomes/*drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism']",,,,2018/10/20 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2018/10/20 06:00'],"['2018/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.26355/eurrev_201810_16054 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2018 Oct;22(19):6412-6421. doi: 10.26355/eurrev_201810_16054.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The acute and rapidly progressive evolution causes unfavourable outcome in 22%-59% of patients and its treatment represents a clinical challenge, especially in immunocompromised patients. Current data in paediatric oncological patients are limited. OBJECTIVES: The infection Working Group of the Italian Association of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (AIEOP) analysed the episodes of invasive mucormycosis occurred between 2009 and 2016. PATIENTS: Fifteen cases of proven mucormycosis (male/female 8/7; median age 14.1 years, range 7.7-18.6) were reported after chemotherapy for acute leukaemia and lymphoma (12) and allogeneic stem cell transplantation (3). The aetiology was Rhizopus oryzae 4, Lichtheimia corymbifera 3 and Mucor spp. 8. RESULTS: Paranasal sinus was the primary site of infection in 14/15 patients combined with orbital involvement (9), central nervous system (8), lung (4), thyroid gland and kidney (1). All patients received liposomal Amphotericin B (L-AmB) (3-10 mg/kg), with surgical debridement in 14/15 cases.

We aimed to better understand the dynamics of a rare disease Twitter hashtag community. RECENT FINDINGS: Twitter has served as a platform for academic discussion, a method for knowledge dissemination directly from medical meetings, and a venue for patient caregiver and support groups. One example of a rare cancer that has seen an increase in available information via Twitter is blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm, or BPDCN. This field has recently experienced a new wave of interest from various healthcare stakeholders in light of key new scientific breakthroughs and novel clinical trials now starting to be available. In order to bring all relevant healthcare stakeholders together, the investigators of this article created a disease-specific Twitter community: #BPDCN = ""blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm on social media"" which has led to higher levels of engagement and discussion in the field. This article focuses on our analysis of advanced Twitter user-metrics in the second year of #BPDCN and discusses future directions for this rare cancer online disease community.","['Pemmaraju, Naveen', 'Utengen, Audun', 'Gupta, Vikas', 'Thompson, Michael A', 'Lane, Andrew A']","['Pemmaraju N', 'Utengen A', 'Gupta V', 'Thompson MA', 'Lane AA']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Unit 428, PO BOX 301402, Houston, TX, 77230-1402, USA. npemmaraju@mdanderson.org.', 'Symplur LLC, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'The Elizabeth and Tony Comper MPN Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Center, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Advocate Aurora Health, Aurora Research Institute, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,,IM,"['Dendritic Cells/*pathology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/pathology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Social Media/*instrumentation', 'Time Factors']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*BPDCN', '*Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm', '*Disease-specific hashtag', '*Rare cancer', '*Rare disease', '*Social media', '*Twitter']",2018/10/20 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2018/10/20 06:00'],"['2018/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-018-0490-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-018-0490-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2018 Dec;13(6):581-587. doi: 10.1007/s11899-018-0490-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, international consortium on CLL proposed an international prognostic index (CLL-IPI) integrating clinical, molecular, and genetic parameters. The present study was designed to evaluate the reproducibility of CLL-IPI in Indian CLL cohort. The prognostic ability of CLL-IPI in terms of overall survival (OS) and time to first treatment (TTFT) was investigated in treatment-naive CLL patients and also compared with other existing prognostic scores. For assigning scores, clinical and laboratory details were obtained from medical records, and IGHV gene mutation status, beta2-microglobulin levels, and copy number variations were determined using c-DNA, ELISA, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), respectively. The scores were generated as per the weighted grades assigned to each variable involved in score categorization. The predictive value of prognostic models was assessed and compared using Harrell's C-index and Akaike's information criterion (AIC). Stratification of patients according to CLL-IPI yielded significant differences in terms of OS and TTFT (p < 0.001). Comparative assessment of scores for OS suggested better performance of CLL-IPI (C = 0.64, AIC = 740) followed by Barcelona-Brno (C = 0.61, AIC = 754) and MDACC score (C = 0.59, AIC = 759). Comparison of predictive value of prognostic scores for TTFT illustrated better performance of CLL-IPI (C = 0.72, AIC = 726) followed by Barcelona-Brno (C = 0.68, AIC = 743), modified GCLLSG (C = 0.66, AIC = 744), and O-CLL1 index (C = 0.55, AIC = 773). The results suggest better performance of CLL-IPI in terms of both OS and TTFT as compared to other available scores in our cohort.","['Rani, Lata', 'Gogia, Ajay', 'Singh, Vishwajeet', 'Kumar, Lalit', 'Sharma, Atul', 'Kaur, Gurvinder', 'Gupta, Ritu']","['Rani L', 'Gogia A', 'Singh V', 'Kumar L', 'Sharma A', 'Kaur G', 'Gupta R']","['Laboratory Oncology Unit, Dr. B.R.A.IRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dr. B.R.A.IRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Biostatistics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dr. B.R.A.IRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dr. B.R.A.IRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Laboratory Oncology Unit, Dr. B.R.A.IRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Laboratory Oncology Unit, Dr. B.R.A.IRCH, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India. drritugupta@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['BT/PR11106/GBD/27/145/2008/Department of Biotechnology , Ministry of Science and', 'Technology', 'BT/PR15438/MED/30/606/2011/Department of Biotechnology , Ministry of Science and', 'Technology', 'BT/PR8680/AGR/36/754/2013/Department of Biotechnology , Ministry of Science and', 'Technology', '8-60/A060/ 2011/RS/All-India Institute of Medical Sciences']","['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20181018,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains', 'India/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*mortality/therapy', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Survival Rate', 'beta 2-Microglobulin']",,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL-IPI', 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia in India', 'Prognostic index', 'Time to first treatment']",2018/10/20 06:00,2019/01/29 06:00,['2018/10/20 06:00'],"['2018/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/29 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-018-3525-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-018-3525-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2019 Feb;98(2):437-443. doi: 10.1007/s00277-018-3525-0.

This milieu is generated via the enhanced secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and by the loss of anti-inflammatory molecules such as IL-4 and IL-13. While the actions of proinflammatory cytokines have been well-studied in beta cells, the effects of their anti-inflammatory counterparts have received relatively little attention and we have addressed this. METHODS: Clonal beta cells, isolated human islets and pancreas sections from control individuals and those with type 1 diabetes were employed. Gene expression was measured using targeted gene arrays and by quantitative RT-PCR. Protein expression was monitored in cell extracts by western blotting and in tissue sections by immunocytochemistry. Target proteins were knocked down selectively with interference RNA. RESULTS: Cytoprotection achieved with IL-4 and IL-13 is mediated by the early activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) in beta cells, leading to the upregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins, including myeloid leukaemia-1 (MCL-1) and B cell lymphoma-extra large (BCLXL). We also report the induction of signal regulatory protein-alpha (SIRPalpha), and find that knockdown of SIRPalpha is associated with reduced beta cell viability. These anti-apoptotic proteins and their attendant cytoprotective effects are lost following siRNA-mediated knockdown of STAT6 in beta cells. Importantly, analysis of human pancreas sections revealed that STAT6 is markedly depleted in the beta cells of individuals with type 1 diabetes, implying the loss of cytoprotective responses.

We conducted a prospective pilot study primarily for older patients undergoing matched unrelated donor (MUD) SCT using a reduced-intensity (RIC) melphalan-based conditioning and post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy)-based GVHD prophylaxis with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. Twenty-two patients (median age 64, IQR 58, 66) underwent RIC MUD SCT for high-risk hematological malignancies including AML/MDS (73%), CML/MPD (18%), and other (10%). Two (9%) patients had early death; the rest (100%) engrafted. After a median follow-up of 17 months, 11 patients were alive and disease-free with an estimated 2-year progression-free (PFS) and overall (OS) survival of 48%. The cumulative incidences of grades 2-4 and 3-4 acute GVHD (aGVHD) at day + 100 and 2-years were 32 and 4%, and 59 and 24%, respectively. No cases of chronic GVHD (cGVHD) were noted. However, late acute GVHD was observed in 6 (27%) patients. In conclusion, RIC MUD SCT with melphalan-based conditioning and PTCy-based GVHD-based prophylaxis for older patients appears effective in controlling relapse. While cGVHD was not seen and early aGVHD appears controllable, a significant proportion developed late aGVHD responsible for higher NRM seen in these patients.","['Shah, Mithun Vinod', 'Saliba, Rima M', 'Rondon, Gabriela', 'Chen, Julianne', 'Soebbing, Doris', 'Rus, Ioana', 'Alousi, Amin', 'Oran, Betul', 'Kebriaei, Partow', 'Qazilbash, Muzaffar', 'Parmar, Simrit', 'Hosing, Chitra', 'Khouri, Issa F', 'Popat, Uday R', 'Champlin, Richard E', 'Ciurea, Stefan O']","['Shah MV', 'Saliba RM', 'Rondon G', 'Chen J', 'Soebbing D', 'Rus I', 'Alousi A', 'Oran B', 'Kebriaei P', 'Qazilbash M', 'Parmar S', 'Hosing C', 'Khouri IF', 'Popat UR', 'Champlin RE', 'Ciurea SO']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. sciurea@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20181018,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'HU9DX48N0T (Mycophenolic Acid)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",IM,"['Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*drug therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycophenolic Acid/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prospective Studies', 'Tacrolimus/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Unrelated Donors']",PMC7232773,,,2018/10/20 06:00,2020/04/28 06:00,['2018/10/20 06:00'],"['2018/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/28 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-018-0367-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-018-0367-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2019 Apr;54(4):601-606. doi: 10.1038/s41409-018-0367-2.

Transcription factors either bind directly to their target DNA or are tethered to it by other proteins. The transcription factor Sp2 serves as a paradigm for indirect genomic binding. It does not require its DNA-binding domain for genomic DNA binding and occupies target promoters independently of whether they contain a cognate DNA-binding motif. Hence, Sp2 is strikingly different from its closely related paralogs Sp1 and Sp3, but how Sp2 recognizes its targets is unknown. Here, we sought to gain more detailed insights into the genomic targeting mechanism of Sp2. ChIP-exo sequencing in mouse embryonic fibroblasts revealed genomic binding of Sp2 to a composite motif where a recognition sequence for TALE homeoproteins and a recognition sequence for the trimeric histone-fold domain protein nuclear transcription factor Y (Nf-y) are separated by 11 bp. We identified a complex consisting of the TALE homeobox protein Prep1, its partner PBX homeobox 1 (Pbx1), and Nf-y as the major partners in Sp2-promoter interactions. We found that the Pbx1:Prep1 complex together with Nf-y recruits Sp2 to co-occupied regulatory elements. In turn, Sp2 potentiates binding of Pbx1:Prep1 and Nf-y. We also found that the Sp-box, a short sequence motif close to the Sp2 N terminus, is crucial for Sp2's cofactor function. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which the DNA binding-independent activity of Sp2 potentiates genomic loading of Pbx1:Prep1 and Nf-y to composite motifs present in many promoters of highly expressed genes.","['Volkel, Sara', 'Stielow, Bastian', 'Finkernagel, Florian', 'Berger, Dana', 'Stiewe, Thorsten', 'Nist, Andrea', 'Suske, Guntram']","['Volkel S', 'Stielow B', 'Finkernagel F', 'Berger D', 'Stiewe T', 'Nist A', 'Suske G']","['From the Institute of Molecular Biology and Tumor Research (IMT) and.', 'From the Institute of Molecular Biology and Tumor Research (IMT) and.', 'From the Institute of Molecular Biology and Tumor Research (IMT) and.', 'From the Institute of Molecular Biology and Tumor Research (IMT) and.', 'the Genomics Core Facility, Center for Tumor Biology and Immunology (ZTI), Philipps-University of Marburg, 35043 Marburg, Germany.', 'the Genomics Core Facility, Center for Tumor Biology and Immunology (ZTI), Philipps-University of Marburg, 35043 Marburg, Germany.', 'From the Institute of Molecular Biology and Tumor Research (IMT) and Suske@imt.uni-marburg.de.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181018,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (CCAAT-Binding Factor)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Pknox1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '148710-93-4 (Sp2 Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CCAAT-Binding Factor/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', '*Genomics', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nucleotide Motifs', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Transport', 'Sp2 Transcription Factor/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Zinc Fingers']",PMC6302174,['NOTNLM'],"['*Pbx1', '*Prep1', '*TALE homeoproteins', '*chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChiP)', '*gene regulation', '*nuclear factor y (Nf-y)', '*specificity protein 1 (Sp1)', '*transcription factor', '*transcription factor Sp2', '*transcription target gene']",2018/10/20 06:00,2019/04/10 06:00,['2018/10/20 06:00'],"['2018/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/17 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)34150-8 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.RA118.005341 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2018 Dec 14;293(50):19250-19262. doi: 10.1074/jbc.RA118.005341.

For many years, leukemia was believed to be caused by a series of genetic hits to hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, which transform them to preleukemic, and eventually to leukemic, cells. Recent discoveries suggest that genetic alterations in bone marrow niche cells, particularly in osteogenic cells, may also cause myeloid leukemia in mouse models. The osteogenic niche, which consists of osteoprogenitors, preosteoblasts, mature osteoblasts, osteocytes and osteoclasts, has been shown to play a critical role in the maintenance and expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells as well as in their oncogenic transformation into leukemia stem/initiating cells. We have recently shown that acute myeloid leukemia cells induce osteogenic differentiation in mesenchymal stromal cells to gain a growth advantage. In this review, we discuss the role of the osteogenic niche in the maintenance of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, as well as in their transformation into leukemia cells.

The presence of GATA2 and CSF3R mutations that are specifically associated with this subgroup but not mutated in all samples suggests a genetic heterogeneity of biCEBPA-mutated AML. We characterized the mutational landscape of CEBPA-mutated cytogenetically normal AML by targeted amplicon resequencing. We analyzed 48 biallelically mutated CEBPA (biCEBPA), 32 monoallelically mutated CEBPA (moCEBPA), and 287 wild-type CEBPA (wtCEBPA) patient samples from German AML Cooperative Group studies or registry. Targeted sequencing of 42 genes revealed that moCEBPA patients had significantly more additional mutations and additional mutated genes than biCEBPA patients. Within the group of biCEBPA patients, we identified 2 genetic subgroups defined by the presence or absence of mutations in chromatin/DNA modifiers (C), cohesin complex (C), and splicing (S) genes: biCEBPA (CCSpos) (25/48 [52%]) and biCEBPA (CCSneg) (23/48 [48%]). Equivalent subgroups were identified in 51 biCEBPA patients from the Cancer Genome Project. Patients in the biCEBPA (CCSpos) group were significantly older and had poorer overall survival and lower complete remission rates following intensive chemotherapy regimens compared with patients in the biCEBPA (CCSneg) group. Patients with available remission samples from the biCEBPA (CCSpos) group cleared the biCEBPA mutations, but most had persisting CCS mutations in complete remission, suggesting the presence of a preleukemic clone. In conclusion, CCS mutations define a distinct biological subgroup of biCEBPA AML that might refine prognostic classification of AML.

Although STAT3 mutations are frequently detected in patients with T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGLL), which is often complicated by PRCA and which is also reported to be associated with acquired aplastic anemia (AA) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), whether STAT3-mutated T cells are involved in the pathophysiology of PRCA and other types of bone marrow failure remains unknown. We performed STAT3 mutation analyses of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells from PRCA patients (n = 42), AA (n = 54), AA-paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (AA-PNH; n = 7), and MDS (n = 21) using an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction and amplicon sequencing. STAT3 mutations were not detected in any of the 82 patients with AA/PNH/MDS but were detected in 43% of the 42 PRCA patients. In all 7 STAT3-mutation-positive patients who were studied, the STAT3 mutations were restricted to sorted CD8(+) T cells. The prevalence of STAT3 mutation in idiopathic, thymoma-associated, autoimmune disorder-associated, and T-LGLL-associated PRCA was 33% (5 of 15), 29% (2 of 7), 20% (1 of 5), and 77% (10 of 13), respectively. The STAT3-mutation-positive patients were younger (median age, 63 vs 73 years; P= .026) and less responsive to cyclosporine (46% [6 of 13] vs 100% [8 of 8]; P= .0092) in comparison with STAT3-mutation-negative patients.

The Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway is involved in many aspects of biological functions of AML cells, including the regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine products, myeloid differentiation, and survival of AML cells. Thus, targeting TLR4 of AML patients for therapeutic purposes should be carefully addressed. In this regard, we investigated the possible role of TLR4 as a regulatory factor against fludarabine (FA) cytotoxicity activity. Here, we identified the differential expression of TLR4 and CD14 receptors in AML cell lines and examined their relationship to FA sensitivity. We found that the stimulation of TLR4 with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in a TLR4-expressing cell line, THP-1, increased cell viability under FA treatment condition and showed that TLR4 stimulation overcame FA sensitivity through the activation of NF-kappaB, which subsequently upregulated several anti-apoptotic genes. The inhibition of TLR4/NF-kappaB signaling could partially or completely reverse LPS-induced cell survival under FA treatment conditions. Interestingly, we found that the expression of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), a well-known tumor suppressor, was induced by FA treatment; however, it was suppressed by LPS treatment. Furthermore, the expression level of TXNIP was critical for FA-induced cytotoxicity or LPS-induced FA resistance of THP-1cells. Our data suggest that TXNIP plays an important role in FA-induced cytotoxicity and TLR4/NF-kappaB-mediated FA resistance of AML cells. Therefore, TXNIP may be a potential therapeutic target for AML treatment.","['Huy, Hangsak', 'Kim, Tae-Don', 'Kim, Won Sam', 'Kim, Dong Oh', 'Byun, Jae-Eun', 'Kim, Mi Jeong', 'Park, Young-Jun', 'Yoon, Suk Ran', 'Noh, Ji-Yoon', 'Lee, Jungwoon', 'Lee, Kyoo-Hyung', 'Choi, Inpyo', 'Jung, Haiyoung']","['Huy H', 'Kim TD', 'Kim WS', 'Kim DO', 'Byun JE', 'Kim MJ', 'Park YJ', 'Yoon SR', 'Noh JY', 'Lee J', 'Lee KH', 'Choi I', 'Jung H']","['Immunotherapy Convergence Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB), Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, 34141, Republic of Korea; Department of Functional Genomics, University of Science and Technology, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, 34113, Republic of Korea.', 'Immunotherapy Convergence Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB), Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, 34141, Republic of Korea; Department of Functional Genomics, University of Science and Technology, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, 34113, Republic of Korea.', 'Immunotherapy Convergence Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB), Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, 34141, Republic of Korea.', 'Immunotherapy Convergence Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB), Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, 34141, Republic of Korea.', 'Immunotherapy Convergence Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB), Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, 34141, Republic of Korea; Department of Biochemistry, School of Life Sciences, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, 28644, Republic of Korea.', 'Immunotherapy Convergence Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB), Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, 34141, Republic of Korea.', 'Immunotherapy Convergence Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB), Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, 34141, Republic of Korea; Department of Functional Genomics, University of Science and Technology, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, 34113, Republic of Korea.', 'Immunotherapy Convergence Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB), Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, 34141, Republic of Korea; Department of Functional Genomics, University of Science and Technology, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, 34113, Republic of Korea.', 'Immunotherapy Convergence Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB), Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, 34141, Republic of Korea.', 'Immunotherapy Convergence Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB), Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, 34141, Republic of Korea.', 'Hematology and Oncology Sections, Department of Internal Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, 05505, Republic of Korea.', 'Immunotherapy Convergence Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB), Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, 34141, Republic of Korea; Department of Functional Genomics, University of Science and Technology, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, 34113, Republic of Korea.

In the present study, we aim to understand the differences between the mucin-type O-glycosylation (MTOG) of two functionally divergent human cell lines, K562 (chronic myeloid leukemia) and U937 (histiocytic lymphoma), having myeloid origins. MTOG is initiated by the addition of N-acetyl-alpha-d-galactosamine (GalNAc) to Ser/Thr of glycoproteins. We exploited the metabolic glycan engineering (MGE) strategy using the peracetyl N-thioglycolyl-d-galactosamine (Ac5GalNTGc), a synthetic GalNAc analogue, to engineer the glycoconjugates. Ac5GalNTGc was metabolized and incorporated as N-thioglycolyl-d-galactosamine (GalNTGc) in cell surface glycoproteins in both the cell lines with varying degrees of efficiency. Notably, metabolic incorporation of GalNTGc resulted in differential inhibition of MTOG. It was observed that endogenous glycosylation machinery of K562 is relatively more stringent for selecting GalNTGc whereas U937 is flexible towards this selection. Additionally, we studied how the glycan modifications vary on a given CD antigen in these cell lines. Particularly, MTOG on CD43 was differentially inhibited in K562 and U937 as revealed by glycan-dependent and glycan-independent antibodies. It was observed that the effect of MGE on CD43 was similar to global effects on both cell lines. Consequences of MGE using GalNAc analogues depend on the expression and activity of various glycosyl transferases which determine global glycosylation on cell surface as well as on specific glycoproteins.","['Dwivedi, Vandita', 'Saini, Pratima', 'Tasneem, Anam', 'Agarwal, Kavita', 'Sampathkumar, Srinivasa-Gopalan']","['Dwivedi V', 'Saini P', 'Tasneem A', 'Agarwal K', 'Sampathkumar SG']","['National Institute of Immunology, Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, New Delhi, 110067, India.', 'National Institute of Immunology, Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, New Delhi, 110067, India.', 'National Institute of Immunology, Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, New Delhi, 110067, India.', 'Department of Molecular Microbiology, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, 63130, USA.', 'National Institute of Immunology, Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, New Delhi, 110067, India.

In a previous study, we found that nude mice injected with DAXX-overexpressing cells (ES-2-DAXX) accumulated large concentrations of first-generation ascites cells (I ascites cells). The role of DAXX in the development of ascites is unknown. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of DAXX on proliferation and migration of ascites cells in ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: Nude mice were housed in cages with a 14:10 h light:dark cycle; water and food were provided ad libitum. ES-2-DAXX cells (1x106) were injected intraperitoneally into athymic nude mice (8-week-old female mice). After 4 weeks, I ascites cells were collected. The I ascites cells were injected intraperitoneally into athymic nude mice (8-week-old female mice). After 4 weeks, II ascites cells were collected and cultured. Ascites cell survival, migration, and colony formation were measured using colony formation and cell growth assays. Immunofluorescent staining revealed the co-localization of DAXX and promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) in ascites cell nuclei. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry showed that extracellular signal-related kinase (p-ERK) 1/2 and CEBP-beta were highly expressed in tumor tissues formed by II ascites cells. Through immunoprecipitation, we also found that DAXX can interact with CEBP-beta. RESULTS: DAXX enhanced ascites cell survival, migration, and colony formation. DAXX and PML nuclear foci dramatically increased in a passage-dependent manner in ascites cells, DAXX promoted the tumor growth of ascites cells in vivo, increased ascites cell proliferation in vivo, and enhanced ascites cell survival and migration by activating the ERK signalling pathway and integrating with CEBP-beta. CONCLUSIONS: DAXX can interact with CEBP-beta. DAXX can induce ovarian cancer ascites formation by activating the ERK signal pathway and binding to CEBP-beta.","['Liu, Sheng-Bing', 'Lin, Xue-Ping', 'Xu, Ying', 'Shen, Zhong-Fei', 'Pan, Wei-Wei']","['Liu SB', 'Lin XP', 'Xu Y', 'Shen ZF', 'Pan WW']","['College of Medicine, Jiaxing University, Jiaxing, 314001, China.', 'College of Medicine, Jiaxing University, Jiaxing, 314001, China.', 'College of Medicine, Jiaxing University, Jiaxing, 314001, China.', 'College of Medicine, Jiaxing University, Jiaxing, 314001, China.', 'College of Medicine, Jiaxing University, Jiaxing, 314001, China. wwpan@mail.zjxu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['LY17H160060, LQ13H160020/The Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province']",['Journal Article'],20181018,England,J Ovarian Res,Journal of ovarian research,101474849,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, mouse)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Daxx protein, mouse)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ascites/*metabolism', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*metabolism']",PMC6193355,['NOTNLM'],"['Ascites cell', 'Cell migration', 'Cell proliferation', 'DAXX']",2018/10/20 06:00,2018/12/29 06:00,['2018/10/20 06:00'],"['2018/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13048-018-0462-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s13048-018-0462-4 [pii]']",epublish,J Ovarian Res. 2018 Oct 18;11(1):90. doi: 10.1186/s13048-018-0462-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chemotherapy is the most frequent therapeutic strategy; however, cytotoxicity and recurrence of cancer are the main concerns. The discovery of microRNA (miRNA) drew the attention of scientists who were working on targeted cancer therapy to use the potential of gene regulation by using this small RNAs. METHODS: miRanda, TargetScan, miRDB databases, and miRWalk software were applied to find probable miRNAs targeting 3'UTR of JAK1, STAT3, SOCS6, AKT1, APAF, BID, and Caspase9 mRNA. A lentiviral vector encoding miR-20a was used for overexpression of the miR-20a in C8166 cell lines to investigate the expression level of genes that are associated with the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and apoptosis using quantitative RTPCR. The effects of miR-20a overexpression also were examined on cell-cycle progression by flow cytometry. RESULTS: qRT-PCR results indicated that overexpression of miR-20a in C8166 cells resulted in significantly elevated expression of BID and Caspase9 (p-value < 0.01). Overexpression of miR-20a in C8166 cells led to cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested miR-20a may act as a tumor suppressor in CD4+ T cells and also has a potential therapeutic in these kinds of cancers.","['M, Razavi Hashemi', 'R, Vahabpour', 'N, Ranji', 'Mh, Sanati', 'M, Mapar', 'Sm, Sadat']","['M RH', 'R V', 'N R', 'Mh S', 'M M', 'Sm S']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Germany,Clin Lab,Clinical laboratory,9705611,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (MIRN20a microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 1/genetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'STAT Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']",,,,2018/10/20 06:00,2019/09/10 06:00,['2018/10/19 06:00'],"['2018/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7754/Clin.Lab.2018.180406 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Lab. 2018 Oct 1;64(10):1641-1647. doi: 10.7754/Clin.Lab.2018.180406.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD39 inhibits T-cell and Natural killer (NK) cell responses by hydrolyzing adenosine triphosphate and adenosine diphosphate, suppressing the immune system. We investigated expression of CD39 on CD4+ T Lymphocytes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients and its relationship with deletion 6q, its association with disease stage and survival. METHODS: Thirty CLL patients and 20 matched controls were included in the study. Bone marrow studies with immunophenotyping, CD39, CD38, and ZAP-70, and detection of del 6q by FISH were performed. RESULTS: CD39+ CD4+ T helper cells in CLL patients were significantly expressed compared with the controls (p<.001). Levels of CD39+ CD4+ T cells were significantly expressed in high risk CLL patients. Del 6q was detected in 63.3% of patients and it correlated with CD39, CD38, and ZAP-70, and advanced stage disease. There was a significant relation between response to treatment and CD39 expression and del 6q, also there was a significant difference in overall survival (OS) between patients with and without Del 6q. CONCLUSION: CD39 expression on CD4+ Tcells and del 6q act as prognostic markers in CLL. Blocking or inhibition of CD39 may be a target for new immune therapy for CLL.","['Mosaad Zaki, Eman', 'Mohamed Zahran, Asmaa', 'Abdelazeem Metwaly, Alshimaa', 'Hafez, Rania', 'Hussein, Safinaz', 'Elaiw Mohammed, Abdallah']","['Mosaad Zaki E', 'Mohamed Zahran A', 'Abdelazeem Metwaly A', 'Hafez R', 'Hussein S', 'Elaiw Mohammed A']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Clinical Hematology Unit, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.

To understand the relationship between PML/RARalpha and the oncogene in the development of APL, we investigate the regulation mechanism of PML/RARalpha to MYB proto-oncogene and the role of this regulation on the proliferation and differentiation of APL cells. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays show that MYB expression was significantly higher in PML/RARalpha positive cell lines. Microarray data verify that the MYB expression was significantly higher in APL patient samples than in normal promyelocyte samples. Further expression analysis from RT-qPCR and microarray data verifies that the expression of MYB is upregulated by PML/RARalpha. Transcriptional factor binding analysis shows that MYB is directly bound by PML/RARalpha and its cofactors. Luciferase assays show that PML/RARalpha transactivated MYB promoter activity through the RARalpha binding site and the coexistence of CCAAT enhancer binding protein epsilon. We also find that PML/RARalpha increases the acetylation level of the promoter region of MYB. Further evidence demonstrates that PML/RARalpha regulates MYB expression through long-range interaction. Functionally, PML/RARalpha increases the cell proliferation and blocks the differentiation through activating MYB expression. Collectively, this study uncovers a novel mechanism of PML/RARalpha-mediated transcriptional activation and enriches our knowledge of the onco-fusion protein-mediated transcription activation.","['Wang, Genjie', 'Tian, Ying', 'Hu, Qingzhu', 'Xiao, Xichun', 'Chen, Shuxia']","['Wang G', 'Tian Y', 'Hu Q', 'Xiao X', 'Chen S']","[""Department of Hematology, The First People's Hospital of Shangqiu, Shangqiu, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First People's Hospital of Shangqiu, Shangqiu, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First People's Hospital of Shangqiu, Shangqiu, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First People's Hospital of Shangqiu, Shangqiu, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First People's Hospital of Shangqiu, Shangqiu, China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181018,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['MYB', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'differentiation', 'promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor-alpha', 'trans-activation']",2018/10/20 06:00,2018/10/20 06:00,['2018/10/19 06:00'],"['2018/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.27077 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Cell Biochem. 2018 Oct 18. doi: 10.1002/jcb.27077.,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5724-6237', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2672-6382']",,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We made observations that involved EBF1 inhibiting the messenger RNA (mRNA) level of p38 MAPK, increasing the mRNA levels of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5), decreasing the protein expression of Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), and finally elevating the protein levels of B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2), stem cell factor (SCF), erythropoietin receptor (EpoR), p-ERK, p-JNK, p-ERK5, cyclin D, cyclin E, cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), and CDK6, implying that EBF1 may very well have an inhibitory role in the MAPK axis. Another discovery found that EBF1 had a positive effect on the promotion of bone marrow CD34+ cell proliferation as well as its migration, but inhibited the apoptosis of cells. The results we obtained from this study indicated that the EBF1 gene suppresses the activation of the MAPK axis, thereby promoting both the proliferation and migration of bone marrow CD34+ cells as well as inhibiting the associating apoptosis. The effects of the EBF1 gene are likely to present a new therapeutic target in preventing the progression of MDS.","['Hou, Shuang', 'Hao, Jie', 'Wang, Yan-Yu', 'Zhao, Bing-Bing', 'Xiao, Gong-Wei', 'Li, Yan-Qing', 'Liu, Xi', 'Zou, Zhi-Lan', 'Yao, Ye', 'Xiong, Hong']","['Hou S', 'Hao J', 'Wang YY', 'Zhao BB', 'Xiao GW', 'Li YQ', 'Liu X', 'Zou ZL', 'Yao Y', 'Xiong H']","['Department of Hematology, Shanghai Xuhui Central Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai Jingan North Station Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai Xuhui Central Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai Xuhui Central Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai Xuhui Central Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai Xuhui Central Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai Xuhui Central Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai Xuhui Central Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai Xuhui Central Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai Xuhui Central Hospital, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],['81470366/National Natural Science Foundation of China (General Program)'],"['Journal Article', 'Retracted Publication']",20181018,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['EBF1 gene', 'bone marrow CD34+ cells', 'cell apoptosis', 'cell migration', 'cell proliferation', 'mitogen-activated protein kinase axis', 'myelodysplastic syndrome']",2018/10/20 06:00,2018/10/20 06:00,['2018/10/19 06:00'],"['2018/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.27177 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Cell Biochem. 2018 Oct 18. doi: 10.1002/jcb.27177.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8051-2097'],,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,['J Cell Biochem. 2021 Nov;122 Suppl 1:S113.

Reeler mutant mice that lack the protein reelin (RELN) suffer from cell type- and region-dependent changes in their neocortical layers, and adult reeler mutant mice have dilated seminiferous tubules. Meanwhile, the mechanism by which Reelin regulates the spermatogenic cell development in mice and their reproductive abilities remains unclear. In the present study, we used reeler mutant mice to investigate the effects of Reelin on reproduction in mice. The results indicated variations in sex hormone expression among the reeler mice, indicating that they produce few offspring and their spermatogenic cells are irregularly developed. Moreover, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)/GDNF family receptor alpha 1, Ras/extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK), and promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF)/chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) serve as potential regulatory pathways that respond to the changes in sertoli cells and the niche of male germ cells.

Here, a case of CML with a t (9, 22, 16) (q34; q11; p13) translocation, which has never been described, is reported. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 59-year-old female with dry cough, referred to our hospital, exhibited hepatosplenomegaly, high basophil count, and high platelet count at admission without any other known chronic diseases. DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed with CML with the translocation t (9;22;16) (q34; q11; p13). The patient was treated with imatinib, a first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), discontinuously, achieving a complete hematological response for 7 years. Since November 8, 2017, the patient had recurrent fever, and her platelet count rose to 1422 x 10/L. Subsequently, the E279K mutation in the BCR-ABL kinase region was detected. OUTCOMES: According to a previous report, this mutation confers sensitivity to nilotinib, a second-generation TKI. In the end, the patient received treatment with nilotinib and showed a complete hematological response. LESSONS: The present study reports a rare case of CML with Ph chromosome and a t (9;22;16) (q34; q11; p13) translocation. For such cases about CML with variant Philadelphia chromosome translocations or BCR-ABL kinase region mutation, TKI may still be valuable.","['Shu, Yefei', 'Yang, Wei', 'Zhang, Xuejin', 'Xu, Xiaofeng']","['Shu Y', 'Yang W', 'Zhang X', 'Xu X']","['Department of Hematology, Hangzhou Red Cross Hospital, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, PR China.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Chromosomes, Human, 16-18/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/drug therapy/genetics', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",PMC6211866,,,2018/10/20 06:00,2018/10/31 06:00,['2018/10/19 06:00'],"['2018/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000012875 [doi]', '00005792-201810190-00068 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2018 Oct;97(42):e12875. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000012875.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In this review, we focus on the current knowledge of the immunological dysfunctions associated with LGL leukemia and the associated disorders coexistent with this disease. Novel therapeutic options targeting known molecular mechanisms are also discussed. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The pathogenesis of LGL leukemia involves the accumulation of gene mutations, dysregulated signaling pathways and immunological dysfunction. Mounting evidence indicated that dysregulated survival signaling pathways may be responsible for the immunological dysfunction in LGL leukemia including decreased numbers of neutrophils, dysregulated signal transduction of NK cells, abnormal B-cells, aberrant CD8+ T cells, as well as autoimmune and hematological abnormalities. CONCLUSION: A better understanding of the immune dysregulation triggered by LGL leukemia will be beneficial to explore the pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets for this disease.","['Sun, Houfang', 'Wei, Sheng', 'Yang, Lili']","['Sun H', 'Wei S', 'Yang L']","[""a Department of Immunology , Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital , Tianjin , People's Republic of China."", ""b National Clinical Research Center of Cancer , People's Republic of China."", ""c Key Laboratory of Cancer Immunology and Biotherapy , Tianjin , People's Republic of China."", ""d Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy , Tianjin , People's Republic of China."", ""e Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer , Tianjin , People's Republic of China."", 'f Immunology Program , The H.

Since 2013, Hungary has been participating as a full member in the work of the European Working Group on uniform diagnostics and therapy in patients with acquired bone marrow failure syndromes. Hypocellular refractory cytopenia of childhood has been emphasized as a frequent entity, transplanted by reduced intensity conditioning with excellent outcomes. AIM: To analyse and compare the results of treatment before and after our joining. METHOD: A total of 55 patients have been treated in the 8 centres of the Hungarian Pediatric Oncology Network during 5 years between 2013 and 2017 (severe aplastic anemia: 9, myelodysplastic syndrome: 41, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia: 5 patients). Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was performed in severe aplastic anemia in 7 cases, while antithymocyte globulin was administered in one case and one patient died before diagnosis. In patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, watch and wait strategy was applied in 4, while transplantation in 37 cases. Reduced intensity conditioning was used in 54 percent of these cases. Transplantation was the treatment of choice in all 5 patients with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. RESULTS: In the whole patient cohort, the time from diagnosis to treatment was median 92 (3-393) days, while in severe aplastic anemia median 28 (3-327) days only. Grade II-IV acute graft versus host disease occurred in 22.6%, grade III-IV in 6.8% and chronic in 11.2%. All the patients treated with severe aplastic anemia are alive and in complete remission (100%). The overall estimated survival rate is 85.1% in myelodysplastic syndrome, while 75% in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. The median follow-up was 30.4 (1.1-62.5) months. There was a remarkable increase in overall survival comparing the data before (1992-2012) and after (2013) joining the international group, 70% vs. 100% (p = 0.133) in severe aplastic anemia and 31.3% vs. 85.1% (p = 0.000026) in myelodysplastic syndrome. CONCLUSION: Due to a change in the paradigm of the conditioning regimen in hypocellular refractory cytopenia of childhood, the overall survival rate has significantly increased.

They are classified into lower and higher risk MDS according to prognostic scoring systems. In higher risk patients, treatments should aim to modify the disease course by avoiding progression to acute myeloid leukemia and, therefore, to improve survival. Areas covered: Stem cell transplantation remains the only curative treatment when feasible, but this concerns a small minority of patients. Treatment is principally based on hypomethylating agents (HMAs). Our understanding of MDS biology has led to the development of drugs targeting key cellular processes such as apoptosis or posttranslational protein changes, microenvironment-like immunotherapy, and gene mutations. Currently, new drugs are mainly being tested in combination with HMAs in several clinical trials. Expert commentary: Significant advances have been made in the field of MDS, especially in molecular typing, which are improving our ability to offer patients risk-adapted therapies. The current challenge in the management of higher risk MDS is to improve outcome by combining classical HMAs with novel drugs.","['Rahme, Ramy', 'Ades, Lionel']","['Rahme R', 'Ades L']","['a Service Hematologie Seniors, Hopital Saint Louis , Universite Paris Diderot, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris , Paris , France.', 'a Service Hematologie Seniors, Hopital Saint Louis , Universite Paris Diderot, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris , Paris , France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20181218,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,,IM,"['Aged', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*therapy', 'Risk Factors']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Myelodysplastic syndromes', '*clinical trials', '*high risk', '*hypomethylating agents', '*transplantation']",2018/10/20 06:00,2020/05/06 06:00,['2018/10/19 06:00'],"['2018/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/06 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2018.1537777 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2019 Jan;12(1):61-70. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2018.1537777.

We examined MMP transcription in two choriocarcinoma cell lines: JEG-3 (HLA-G positive) and JAR (HLA-G negative). We discovered that both cell lines express a similar panel of MMPs; except for MMP12. Transcript MMP12 was exclusively detected in HLA-G expressing JEG-3 cells but not in HLA-G deficient JAR cells. We observed HLA-G expression but no MMP12 transcription following 5-aza-2 -deoxycytidine (AZA) treatment of JAR cells. We then investigated HLA-G and MMP transcription in several human leukaemia cell lines. Leukaemia cells (lacking HLA-G expression) were converted to their HLA-G positive counterparts by AZA-treatment or by HLA-G transfection. It was found no correlation between HLA-G and MMP transcription in any examined leukaemia cell lines. The up-regulation of some MMPs and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs) was observed following AZA-treatment.","['Polakova, K', 'Bandzuchova, E']","['Polakova K', 'Bandzuchova E']","['Cancer Research Institute, Biomedical Research Center, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'National Transplantation Organisation, Bratislava, Slovakia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180904,Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (HLA-G Antigens)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinases)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Choriocarcinoma/*genetics', 'Decitabine/pharmacology', 'HLA-G Antigens/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases/*genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic']",,,,2018/10/20 06:00,2019/07/02 06:00,['2018/10/19 06:00'],"['2018/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/02 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.4149/neo_2018_180409N230 [doi]', '180409N230 [pii]']",ppublish,Neoplasma. 2018 Nov 15;65(6):943-951. doi: 10.4149/neo_2018_180409N230.

This fusion protein can induce interleukin 6 (IL-6) expression in leukemia stem cells (LSCs) which sustain stemness by binding IL-6R and activating the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of the transcription (STAT) pathway. IL-6R was one of the targets of miR-451a down-regulated in LSCs by BCR/ABL. We investigated the relationship between miR-451a, IL-6R, and BCR/ABL in Ph+ ALL and created a strategy to treat this disease. The expression levels of miR-451a and BCR/ABL of Ph+ ALL patients were examined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and serum IL-6 was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Ph+ ALL cell line SUP-B15 and Ph- ALL cell line Nalm-6 were treated with miR-451a mimic and inhibitor, respectively; proliferation rate was assessed by CCK-8, apoptosis rate was tested by Annexin/PI and the expression levels of Bcl-XL, Bax, cyclin D2 and c-myc were examined by qPCR and western blot (WB). The levels of STAT3, p-STAT3, JAK2, and p-JAK2 were tested by WB. We found that BCR/ABL was inversely related to miR-451a and positively related to IL-6 in Ph+ ALL. MiR-451a inhibited the proliferation of SUP-B15 through the apoptosis pathway. The oncogene c-myc was down-regulated by miR-451a. We confirmed that miR-451a could target IL-6R and inhibit activation of JAK and STAT3. In conclusion, miR-451a is down regulated in Ph+ ALL and increasing the expression levels of miR-451a in leukemia cells can increase the potential of curing this disease.","['Jiang, T', 'Chen, J', 'Huang, X B', 'Li, Y X', 'Zhong, L']","['Jiang T', 'Chen J', 'Huang XB', 'Li YX', 'Zhong L']","[""Department of Hematology, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences and Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, Chengdu, Sichuan, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences and Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, Chengdu, Sichuan, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences and Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, Chengdu, Sichuan, China."", ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences and Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, Chengdu, Sichuan, China."", ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences and Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180904,Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (IL6R protein, human)', '0 (MIRN451 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/*genetics']",,,,2018/10/20 06:00,2019/07/02 06:00,['2018/10/19 06:00'],"['2018/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/02 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.4149/neo_2018_180121N44 [doi]', '180121N44 [pii]']",ppublish,Neoplasma. 2018 Nov 15;65(6):907-914. doi: 10.4149/neo_2018_180121N44.

METHODS: Eight-color flow cytometry was used to immunophenotype blasts, monocytes, and granulocytes in the bone marrow of 34 patients with CMML and 12 patients with reactive monocytosis. RESULTS: Bone marrow myeloblast, promonocyte, and monocyte counts by flow cytometry were significantly higher in the CMML group than in the reactive monocytosis group. Myeloblast aberrancies were present in all CMML patients as compared with 2 of 12 (16.7%) reactive monocytosis patients (P < 0.001). The number of blast aberrancies ranged from one to nine (median, four) in CMML patients and 94.1% of CMML cases exhibited >/= two aberrancies. In contrast, two reactive monocytosis cases showed only one phenotypic abnormality of blasts. Monocyte and granulocyte aberrancies were present in 26 of 34 (76.5%) and in 31 of 34 (91.2%) CMML patients, respectively. Decreased side scatter (SSC) and abnormal CD11b/CD13/CD16 maturation pattern in granulocytes were more frequent in CMML than in reactive monocytosis. No significant differences in antigen expression were detected between the CMML subtypes except that altered CD45/SSC pattern on the blasts was more commonly observed in CMML-0/1 than in CMML-2. CONCLUSIONS: CMML has phenotypic aberrancies in monocytes, granulocytes, and more frequently in myeloblasts. Aberrant expression of two or more antigens in myeloblasts by flow cytometry has a high sensitivity (94.1%) and a high specificity (100%) to differentiate CMML from reactive monocytosis.

Multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) is being evaluated for the diagnosis and prognosis of MDS. METHODS: In the present study, five-color MFC was performed on bone marrow aspirates of 50 untreated patients, newly diagnosed with MDS and 27 age matched control samples. Patients were classified according to World Health Organization 2016, International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), and Revised IPSS (IPSS-R). RESULTS: Significantly higher CD133+/CD90-CD45weak, CD117+/TdT-CD45weak, and CD33+/MPO-neutrophil precursor percentages on CD34+ cells, as well as a significant decrease of lymphoid and erythroid precursors were observed in the group of MDS patients in comparison to controls. A new scoring system was based on these findings, which can be helpful in discriminating lower risk MDS patients, including those with normal karyotype (a subgroup of MDS with diagnostic challenges). In addition, an increased level of apoptosis of CD34+/CD117+ cells was identified as an independent favorable prognostic factor both for the risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia and for overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: A new scoring system based on the expression of immature cell antigens on CD34+ cells (by itself or in combination with the Ogata score) can discriminate lower risk MDS patients, including those with normal karyotype, from the normal control group.

Recently, an anti-tumor function mediated by MHC-unrestricted recognition of lipid and stress molecules, has also been described in these cells. This study aimed to quantify and phenotypically characterize circulating Vdelta1(+) T cells in B cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) and Monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis (MBL). METHODS: This study enrolled 58 individuals distributed in five groups: Binet B and C CLL (n = 9), Binet A CLL (n = 26), High count-MBL (n = 10), Low count-MBL (n = 5), and a control group (n = 8). The phenotypic characterization of Vdelta1(+) T cells, as well as the other T cell subpopulations (CD4(+) , CD8(+) , CD4(+) /CD8(+) , and Vdelta1(-) gammadeltaT cells), were assessed by flow cytometry, evaluating the frequency of each subset expressing CD27, CD69, and cytoplasmic granzyme B. RESULTS: We observed an increasing percentage of Vdelta1(+) T cells belonging to CD27(-) compartment from controls to advanced stages of the disease, which was accompanied by an increasing percentage of these cells expressing granzyme B, a phenotypic pattern that was also observed in the other T cell subpopulations under study since earlier stages of the disease. Moreover, a striking expansion of Vdelta1(+) T cells in Binet B and C CLL was observed. CONCLUSIONS: These experiment findings point to an expansion of CD27(-) Vdelta1(+) T cells with a cytotoxic profile, from controls to advanced stages of the disease, which points to a role of Vdelta1(+) T cells in the host's anti-tumor responses against clonal B-cells in MBL and CLL.

METHODS: This study examined heterogeneity of MDR functional efflux by AML blasts using two flow cytometry bioassays. Bone marrow specimens (N = 50) from elderly patients with newly diagnosed AML were analyzed for CD34+ blasts with MDR efflux function. Efflux was measured with a fluorescent dye (DiOC2 ) as a surrogate for oncology drugs that are substrates for MDR efflux. P-gp-mediated efflux was differentiated from non-P-gp MDR activities using zosuquidar, a highly selective P-gp modulator. The bioassays included a zosuquidar-dependent DiOC2 accumulation bioassay that measured only P-gp. The second method, termed the efflux bioassay, could detect P-gp and other non-P-gp efflux depending on bioassay culture conditions. RESULTS: Sixty-two percent of the specimens were considered positive for blasts with P-gp function, and 26% of such P-gp-positive specimens also exhibited zosuquidar-resistant (i.e., non-P-gp) MDR efflux activity; 37% of P-gp-negative AML blast specimens displayed zosuquidar-resistant MDR function in the efflux bioassay. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the heterogeneous nature of MDR efflux pumps in AML blasts, and provide support for the hypothesis that non-P-gp MDR contributed to negative results with zosuquidar in AML trials like ECOG-ACRIN E3999.

Here we report initial findings from the Beat AML programme on a cohort of 672 tumour specimens collected from 562 patients. We assessed these specimens using whole-exome sequencing, RNA sequencing and analyses of ex vivo drug sensitivity. Our data reveal mutational events that have not previously been detected in AML. We show that the response to drugs is associated with mutational status, including instances of drug sensitivity that are specific to combinatorial mutational events. Integration with RNA sequencing also revealed gene expression signatures, which predict a role for specific gene networks in the drug response. Collectively, we have generated a dataset-accessible through the Beat AML data viewer (Vizome)-that can be leveraged to address clinical, genomic, transcriptomic and functional analyses of the biology of AML.","['Tyner, Jeffrey W', 'Tognon, Cristina E', 'Bottomly, Daniel', 'Wilmot, Beth', 'Kurtz, Stephen E', 'Savage, Samantha L', 'Long, Nicola', 'Schultz, Anna Reister', 'Traer, Elie', 'Abel,

This result suggests that leukaemia uses unique mechanisms to evade this therapy. Certain immune inhibitory receptors that are expressed by normal immune cells are also present on leukaemia cells. Whether these receptors can initiate immune-related primary signalling in tumour cells remains unknown. Here we use mouse models and human cells to show that LILRB4, an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif-containing receptor and a marker of monocytic leukaemia, supports tumour cell infiltration into tissues and suppresses T cell activity via a signalling pathway that involves APOE, LILRB4, SHP-2, uPAR and ARG1 in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells. Deletion of LILRB4 or the use of antibodies to block LILRB4 signalling impeded AML development. Thus, LILRB4 orchestrates tumour invasion pathways in monocytic leukaemia cells by creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment. LILRB4 represents a compelling target for the treatment of monocytic AML.","['Deng, Mi', 'Gui, Xun', 'Kim, Jaehyup', 'Xie, Li', 'Chen, Weina', 'Li, Zunling', 'He, Licai', 'Chen, Yuanzhi', 'Chen,

Our aim was to assess whether pharmacological attenuation of macrophages can be achieved by imatinib, an anti-leukemia drug with known anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic properties, and how this impacts on NAFLD. We analyzed the pro- and anti-inflammatory gene expression of murine macrophages and human monocytes in vitro in the presence or absence of imatinib. In a time-resolved study, we characterized metabolic disease manifestations such as hepatic steatosis, systemic and adipose tissue inflammation as well as lipid and glucose metabolism in obese mice at one and three months of imatinib treatment. Our results showed that imatinib lowered pro-inflammatory markers in murine macrophages and human monocytes in vitro. In obese mice, imatinib reduced TNFalpha-gene expression in peritoneal and liver macrophages and systemic lipid levels at one month. This was followed by decreased hepatic steatosis, systemic and adipose tissue inflammation and increased insulin sensitivity after three months. As the transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) links lipid metabolism to the innate immune response, we assessed the gene expression of SREBPs and their target genes, which was indeed downregulated in the liver and partially in peritoneal macrophages. In conclusion, targeting both inflammatory and lipogenic pathways in macrophages and liver as shown by imatinib could represent an attractive novel therapeutic strategy for patients with NAFLD.","['AlAsfoor, Shefaa', 'Rohm, Theresa V', 'Bosch, Angela J T', 'Dervos, Thomas', 'Calabrese, Diego', 'Matter, Matthias S', 'Weber, Achim', 'Cavelti-Weder, Claudia']","['AlAsfoor S', 'Rohm TV', 'Bosch AJT', 'Dervos T', 'Calabrese D', 'Matter MS', 'Weber A', 'Cavelti-Weder C']","['Clinic of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel and University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Clinic of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel and University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Clinic of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel and University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Clinic of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel and University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel and University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Pathology and Molecular Pathology, University and University Hospital of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Clinic of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland. claudia.cavelti-weder@usb.ch.', 'Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel and University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland. claudia.cavelti-weder@usb.ch.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181017,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adipose Tissue/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Animals', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'Inflammation/genetics/metabolism/*prevention & control', 'Lipogenesis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Liver/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Macrophages/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Monocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/complications/metabolism/*prevention & control', 'Obesity/complications/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/metabolism']",PMC6193017,,,2018/10/20 06:00,2019/10/29 06:00,['2018/10/19 06:00'],"['2018/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-018-32853-w [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-018-32853-w [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2018 Oct 17;8(1):15331. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-32853-w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The HTLV-1 proviral plus-strand is typically transcriptionally silent in freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from infected individuals, but after short-term ex vivo culture, there is a strong, spontaneous burst of proviral plus-strand transcription. Here, we demonstrate that proviral reactivation in freshly isolated, naturally infected primary CD4+ T cells has 3 key attributes characteristic of an immediate-early gene. Plus-strand transcription is p38-MAPK dependent and is not inhibited by protein synthesis inhibitors. Ubiquitylation of histone H2A (H2AK119ub1), a signature of polycomb repressive complex-1 (PRC1), is enriched at the latent HTLV-1 provirus, and immediate-early proviral reactivation is associated with rapid deubiquitylation of H2A at the provirus. Inhibition of deubiquitylation by the deubiquitinase (DUB) inhibitor PR619 reverses H2AK119ub1 depletion and strongly inhibits plus-strand transcription. We conclude that the HTLV-1 proviral plus-strand is regulated with characteristics of a cellular immediate-early gene, with a PRC1-dependent bivalent promoter sensitive to p38-MAPK signaling. Finally, we compare the epigenetic signatures of p38-MAPK inhibition, DUB inhibition, and glucose deprivation at the HTLV-1 provirus, and we show that these pathways act as independent checkpoints regulating proviral reactivation from latency.","['Kulkarni, Anurag', 'Taylor, Graham P', 'Klose, Robert J', 'Schofield, Christopher J', 'Bangham, Charles Rm']","['Kulkarni A', 'Taylor GP', 'Klose RJ', 'Schofield CJ', 'Bangham CR']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Imperial College, London, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Imperial College, London, United Kingdom.', 'Laboratory of Chromatin Biology and Transcription, Department of Biochemistry, and.', 'Chemistry Research Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Imperial College, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'MR/K019090/1/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'WT100291MA/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181018,United States,JCI Insight,JCI insight,101676073,"['0 (2,6-diaminopyridine-3,5-bis(thiocyanate))', '0 (Aminopyridines)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (PRC1 protein, human)', '0 (Thiocyanates)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Deubiquitinating Enzymes)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aminopyridines/pharmacology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism/virology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Deubiquitinating Enzymes', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/drug effects/*physiology', 'Genes, Immediate-Early', 'HTLV-I Infections/blood/*genetics/virology', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Proviruses/*physiology', 'Thiocyanates/pharmacology', 'Ubiquitination/drug effects/physiology', 'Virus Activation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Virus Latency/drug effects/genetics']",PMC6237452,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cell stress', '*Epigenetics', '*Transcription', '*Virology']",2018/10/20 06:00,2020/01/07 06:00,['2018/10/19 06:00'],"['2018/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['123196 [pii]', '10.1172/jci.insight.123196 [doi]']",epublish,JCI Insight. 2018 Oct 18;3(20). pii: 123196. doi: 10.1172/jci.insight.123196.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pharmacodynamics of cerdulatinib, a dual SYK/JAK inhibitor, and associations with tumor response were investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a phase I dose-escalation study in adults with relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies, cerdulatinib was administered orally to sequential dose-escalation cohorts using once-daily or twice-daily schedules. The study enrolled 8 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), 13 with follicular lymphoma, 16 with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and 6 with mantle cell lymphoma. Correlation of tumor response with pharmacodynamic markers was determined in patients with meaningful clinical responses. RESULTS: Following cerdulatinib administration, complete SYK and JAK pathway inhibition was achieved in whole blood of patients at tolerated exposures. Target inhibition correlated with serum cerdulatinib concentration, and IC50 values against B-cell antigen receptor (BCR), IL2, IL4, and IL6 signaling pathways were 0.27 to 1.11 mumol/L, depending on the phosphorylation event. Significant correlations were observed between SYK and JAK pathway inhibition and tumor response. Serum inflammation markers were reduced by cerdulatinib, and several significantly correlated with tumor response. Diminished expression of CD69 and CD86 (B-cell activation markers), CD5 (negative regulator of BCR signaling), and enhanced expression of CXCR4 were observed in 2 patients with CLL, consistent with BCR and IL4 suppression and loss of proliferative capacity. CONCLUSIONS: Cerdulatinib potently and selectively inhibited SYK/JAK signaling at tolerated exposures in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies. The extent of target inhibition in whole-blood assays and suppression of inflammation correlated with tumor response.

Effective therapeutic options are limited for patients with Ph(-) MPNs in the blast phase (MPN-BP), and allogeneic stem-cell transplantation is the only known cure. Our increasing understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of this group of diseases, coupled with the increasing availability of targeted agents, has the potential to inform new subset-specific therapeutic approaches. Ultimately, progress in MPN-BP will hinge on prospective clinical and translational investigations with the goal of generating more effective treatment interventions.

Bcr-Abl fusion protein has constitutively activated Abl tyrosine kinase activity which is responsible for the uncontrolled proliferation in CML The tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as Imatinib, Dasatinib, and Nilotinib are the current first-line treatments approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) for the treatment of the disease. Despite the spectacular progress made over the decade with the TKIs, patients develop resistance to these TKIs. In such cases, stem cell transplant therapy, which is limited by donor availability, is the only proven cure for the patients. This highlights the need for the development of new strategies for CML treatment. The Bcr-Abl point mutations, including the gatekeeper T315I mutations, are the principal cause for the development of resistance to TKIs. However, other mechanisms are also involved in the failure of TKI therapy. This review outlines the Bcr-Abl dependent and independent mechanism of TKIs resistance development and the strategies used to overcome drug resistance, such as the development of ATP site and allosteric site inhibitors. Binding mode and structural elements of Bcr-Abl inhibition are discussed with emphasis on pathways involved in this complex disease to determine alternative strategies and combination therapies.","['Singh, Vivek Kumar', 'Coumar, Mohane Selvaraj']","['Singh VK', 'Coumar MS']","['Centre for Bioinformatics, School of Life Sciences, Pondicherry University, Kalapet, Puducherry 605014, India.', 'Centre for Bioinformatics, School of Life Sciences, Pondicherry University, Kalapet, Puducherry 605014, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Mini Rev Med Chem,Mini reviews in medicinal chemistry,101094212,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Discovery/*methods', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy']",,['NOTNLM'],"['ATP competitive inhibitor', 'Bcr-Abl', 'T315I mutation', 'allosteric inhibitor', 'chronic myeloid leukaemia', 'drug resistance', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor.']",2018/10/20 06:00,2019/03/07 06:00,['2018/10/19 06:00'],"['2018/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/26 00:00 [revised]', '2018/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/07 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['MRMC-EPUB-93775 [pii]', '10.2174/1389557518666181017124854 [doi]']",ppublish,Mini Rev Med Chem. 2019;19(4):333-345. doi: 10.2174/1389557518666181017124854.,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To compare insulin sensitivity in the study group to a group of patient with obesity. Materials and methods: The study group consisted of 30 (37% of the total number) patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia. Testing of insulin sensitivity was done before chemotherapy and during febrile neutropenia. Parameters were compared to a group of 30 age, and sex matched patients with obesity. Results: Insulin sensitivity was normal before chemotherapy. Obese patients were characterized by insulin resistance. Febrile neutropenia led to the development of insulin resistance (t = -2.43, p = 0.021). The level of insulin resistance was in positive correlation with fibrinogen (r = 0.59, p < 0.05). Patients with a documented site of infection had higher fasting insulin and an insulin resistance before chemotherapy (t = -2.38, p = 0.024). Insulin sensitivity did not influence outcome of the first hospitalization. Conclusion: Patients with acute leukemia in febrile neutropenia developed changes in insulin sensitivity similar to those seen in obesity. Insulin resistance was present in patients with a documented site of infection, and it worsened with the extent of inflammation.

The receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 is the most commonly mutated gene in AML, with internal tandem duplications within the juxtamembrane domain (FLT3-ITD) or missense mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (FLT3-TKD) present in 30(-)35% of AML patients at diagnosis. An established driver mutation and marker of poor prognosis, the FLT3 tyrosine kinase has emerged as an attractive therapeutic target, and thus, encouraged the development of FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, the therapeutic benefit of FLT3 inhibition, particularly as a monotherapy, frequently results in the development of treatment resistance and disease relapse. Commonly, FLT3 inhibitor resistance occurs by the emergence of secondary lesions in the FLT3 gene, particularly in the second tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) at residue Asp835 (D835) to form a 'dual mutation' (ITD-D835). Individual FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD mutations influence independent signaling cascades; however, little is known about which divergent signaling pathways are controlled by each of the FLT3 specific mutations, particularly in the context of patients harboring dual ITD-D835 mutations. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the known discrete and cooperative signaling pathways deregulated by each of the FLT3 specific mutations, as well as the therapeutic approaches that hold the most promise of more durable and personalized therapeutic approaches to improve treatments of FLT3 mutant AML.","['Staudt, Dilana', 'Murray, Heather C', 'McLachlan, Tabitha', 'Alvaro, Frank', 'Enjeti, Anoop K', 'Verrills, Nicole M', 'Dun, Matthew D']","['Staudt D', 'Murray HC', 'McLachlan T', 'Alvaro F', 'Enjeti AK', 'Verrills NM', 'Dun MD']","['School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, Faculty of Health and Medicine, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.

DOP-1-1 has been demonstrated to have remarkable immunomodulatory properties, but little is known about the influence of its structural diversity on bioactivity (and even less about the exact mechanism underlying its immune responses). First, DOP-1-1 was stabilized at different temperatures and pH conditions based on differential scanning calorimetry and size exclusion-chromatography(-)high-performance liquid chromatography. Then, a detailed study on the effects of DOP-1-1 on a human leukemia monocytic cell line (THP-1) under normal conditions was undertaken. DOP-1-1 promoted the translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) and degradation of IkappaB proteins. The expression of genes and proteins closely associated with the immune, survival and apoptotic functions of NF-kappaB were analyzed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Furthermore, CCL4 and IP10 were confirmed to be the novel targets of the immune response stimulated by DOP-1-1. The phosphorylation of NF-small ka, CyrillicB was inhibited by treatment with a toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) antagonist (TAK-242) and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) inhibitor (ST2825). These data suggested: (i) the O-acetylated glucomannan DOP-1-1 is present in the steady state in low-pH solutions; (ii) DOP-1-1 can induce an immune response through NF-small ka, CyrillicB mediated by a TLR4 signaling pathway; and (iii) CCL4 and IP10 could be the novel targets of the immune response stimulated by O-acetylated glucomannan.","['Huang, Yan-Ping', 'He, Tao-Bin', 'Cuan, Xian-Dan', 'Wang, Xuan-Jun', 'Hu, Jiang-Miao', 'Sheng, Jun']","['Huang YP', 'He TB', 'Cuan XD', 'Wang XJ', 'Hu JM', 'Sheng J']","['Key Laboratory of Pu-er Tea Science, Ministry of Education, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming 650201, China. fengzhongjiaren00@163.com.', 'College of Science, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming 650201, China. fengzhongjiaren00@163.com.', 'College of Food Science and Technology, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming 650201, China. fengzhongjiaren00@163.com.', 'Key Laboratory of Pu-er Tea Science, Ministry of Education, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming 650201, China. hetaobin@mail.kib.ac.cn.', 'College of Science, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming 650201, China. hetaobin@mail.kib.ac.cn.', 'College of Food Science and Technology, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming 650201, China. hetaobin@mail.kib.ac.cn.', 'Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming 650201, China. hetaobin@mail.kib.ac.cn.', 'Key Laboratory of Pu-er Tea Science, Ministry of Education, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming 650201, China. cuanxiangdan@163.com.', 'College of Science, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming 650201, China. cuanxiangdan@163.com.', 'College of Food Science and Technology, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming 650201, China. cuanxiangdan@163.com.', 'Key Laboratory of Pu-er Tea Science, Ministry of Education, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming 650201, China. xuanjunwang@gmail.com.', 'College of Science, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming 650201, China. xuanjunwang@gmail.com.', 'College of Food Science and Technology, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming 650201, China. xuanjunwang@gmail.com.', 'Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming 650201, China. hujiangmiao@mail.kib.ac.cn.', 'Key Laboratory of Pu-er Tea Science, Ministry of Education, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming 650201, China. shengjunpuer@163.com.', 'College of Science, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming 650201, China. shengjunpuer@163.com.', 'College of Food Science and Technology, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming 650201, China. shengjunpuer@163.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181016,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,"['0 (CCL4 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL4)', '0 (Mannans)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (TLR4 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', '36W3E5TAMG ((1-6)-alpha-glucomannan)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Calorimetry, Differential Scanning', 'Chemokine CCL4/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Dendrobium/*chemistry', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunity/*drug effects', 'Mannans/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Structure', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'THP-1 Cells', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/*metabolism']",PMC6222441,['NOTNLM'],"['1,4-beta-d-glucomannan', 'Dendrobium officinale', 'NF-small ka, CyrillicB', 'TLR4', 'thermal stability']",2018/10/20 06:00,2019/01/03 06:00,['2018/10/19 06:00'],"['2018/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/12 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/03 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules23102658 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules23102658 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2018 Oct 16;23(10). pii: molecules23102658. doi: 10.3390/molecules23102658.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-9013-8489'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although patients who have pPCL benefit from the use of stem cell transplantation (SCT) and novel agents, their prognosis remains inferior to that of patients who have myeloma. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of 38 consecutive patients with pPCL who were diagnosed between October 2005 and July 2016 and were registered in the Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University database. Baseline characteristics as well as data about treatment and survival outcomes were collected. RESULTS: The median patient age at diagnosis was 58 years. All patients received a bortezomib-based induction regimen, and 92% received both bortezomib and an immunomodulatory drug (thalidomide or lenalidomide); in addition, 74% of patients underwent autologous SCT (ASCT), and 61% received maintenance therapy. The best response to first-line therapy was a partial response or better in 87% of patients, and 45% had a complete response (CR). The achievement of >/=CR was a predictor for prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The median PFS was 20 months, and the median OS was 33 months. PFS was prolonged in patients who underwent ASCT compared with those who did not undergo ASCT (25 vs 6 months; P = .004), and patients who received maintenance therapy after ASCT had prolonged median PFS (27 vs 11 months; P = .03) and a trend toward prolonged OS (median, 38 vs 22 months; P = .06) compared with those who did not receive maintenance therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The current data support the use of regimens combining novel agents in the upfront treatment of patients with pPCL as well as the role of ASCT and maintenance therapy for long-term disease control.","['Mina, Roberto', 'Joseph, Nisha S', 'Kaufman, Jonathan L', 'Gupta, Vikas A', 'Heffner, Leonard T', 'Hofmeister, Craig C', 'Boise, Lawrence H', 'Dhodapkar, Madhav V', 'Gleason, Charise', 'Nooka, Ajay K', 'Lonial, Sagar']","['Mina R', 'Joseph NS', 'Kaufman JL', 'Gupta VA', 'Heffner LT', 'Hofmeister CC', 'Boise LH', 'Dhodapkar MV', 'Gleason C', 'Nooka AK', 'Lonial S']","['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181017,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Drugs, Investigational)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bortezomib/therapeutic use', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Drugs, Investigational/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/diagnosis/drug therapy/*mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thalidomide/therapeutic use', 'Therapies, Investigational', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT)', '*chemotherapy', '*maintenance', '*novel agents', '*primary plasma cell leukemia (pPCL)']",2018/10/18 06:00,2019/11/27 06:00,['2018/10/18 06:00'],"['2018/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/14 00:00 [revised]', '2018/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/27 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.31718 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2019 Feb 1;125(3):416-423. doi: 10.1002/cncr.31718.

Existing guidelines provide useful algorithms for diagnostic procedures and treatment options, but they do not give recommendations on how to evaluate early success or failure and if or when it is best to change therapy. Here, we review the diagnostic techniques currently used in association with clinical findings and propose an approach using a combination of computer tomography, clinical and all available biomarkers and inflammation parameters, especially those positive at baseline, to assess early response in invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Computed tomography scans should be carried out at regular intervals during early and long-term follow-up. Imaging on day seven, or even earlier in clinically unstable patients, combined with an additional testing of biomarkers and inflammatory markers in between, is needed for a reliable assessment at day 14. If no improvement is seen after 2 weeks of therapy or the clinical condition is deteriorating, a change of antifungal therapy should be considered. Alleged breakthrough infections or treatment failure should undergo early diagnostic workup, including tissue biopsies when possible, to retrieve fungal cultures for resistance testing.","['Heinz, Werner J', 'Vehreschild, Jorg J', 'Buchheidt, Dieter']","['Heinz WJ', 'Vehreschild JJ', 'Buchheidt D']","['Klinikum Weiden, Weiden, Wurzburg university medical center, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department for Internal Medicine, German Centre for Infection Research, University Hospital of Cologne, Partner Site Bonn-Cologne, University of Cologne, Koln, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, Mannheim University Hospital, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190429,Germany,Mycoses,Mycoses,8805008,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)']",,"['Adult', 'Antifungal Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Biopsy', 'Diagnostic Tests, Routine/*methods', 'Drug Monitoring/*methods', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Microbiological Techniques', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Aspergillus', 'biomarkers', 'diagnosis', 'imaging', 'treatment monitoring']",2018/10/18 06:00,2019/08/10 06:00,['2018/10/18 06:00'],"['2018/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/03 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/10 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/myc.12860 [doi]'],ppublish,Mycoses. 2019 Jun;62(6):486-493. doi: 10.1111/myc.12860.

The PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK signaling pathways are the best-characterized downstream signaling pathways activated by IRS signaling (canonical pathways). However, novel signaling axes involving IRS proteins (noncanonical pathways) have recently been identified in solid tumor and hematologic neoplasm models. Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1) and insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS2) are the best-characterized IRS proteins in hematologic-related processes. IRS2 binds to important cellular receptors involved in normal hematopoiesis (EPOR, MPL and IGF1R). Moreover, the identification of IRS1/ABL1 and IRS2/JAK2V617F interactions and their functional consequences has opened a new frontier for investigating the roles of the IRS protein family in malignant hematopoiesis. Insulin receptor substrate-4 (IRS4) is absent in normal hematopoietic tissues but may be expressed under abnormal conditions. Moreover, insulin receptor substrate-5 (DOK4) and insulin receptor substrate-6 (DOK5) are linked to lymphocyte regulation. An improved understanding of the signaling pathways mediated by IRS proteins in hematopoiesis-related processes, along with the increased development of agonists and antagonists of these signaling axes, may generate new therapeutic approaches for hematological diseases. The scope of this review is to recapitulate and review the evidence for the functions of IRS proteins in normal and malignant hematopoiesis.","['Machado-Neto, Joao Agostinho', 'Fenerich, Bruna Alves', 'Rodrigues Alves, Ana Paula Nunes', 'Fernandes, Jaqueline Cristina', 'Scopim-Ribeiro, Renata', 'Coelho-Silva, Juan Luiz', 'Traina, Fabiola']","['Machado-Neto JA', 'Fenerich BA', 'Rodrigues Alves APN', 'Fernandes JC', 'Scopim-Ribeiro R', 'Coelho-Silva JL', 'Traina F']","['Departamento de Medicina Interna, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, SP, BR.', 'Departamento de Farmacologia do Instituto de Ciencias Biomedicas da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, BR.', 'Departamento de Medicina Interna, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, SP, BR.', 'Departamento de Medicina Interna, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, SP, BR.', 'Departamento de Medicina Interna, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, SP, BR.', 'Departamento de Medicina Interna, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, SP, BR.', 'Departamento de Medicina Interna, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, SP, BR.', 'Departamento de Medicina Interna, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, SP, BR.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20181011,Brazil,Clinics (Sao Paulo),"Clinics (Sao Paulo, Brazil)",101244734,['0 (Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins)'],IM,"['Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins/*metabolism/physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",PMC6169455,,,2018/10/18 06:00,2019/03/01 06:00,['2018/10/18 06:00'],"['2018/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S1807-59322018000200332 [pii]', '10.6061/clinics/2018/e566s [doi]']",epublish,Clinics (Sao Paulo). 2018 Oct 11;73(suppl 1):e566s. doi: 10.6061/clinics/2018/e566s.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hypothetically, mESCs model gestational stress effects or stresses of in vitro fertilization/assisted reproductive technologies or drug/environmental exposures that endanger embryos. Testing mESCs stress responses should diminish and expedite in vivo embryo screening. Transgenic mESCs for green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporters of differentiation use the promoter for platelet-derived growth factor receptor (Pdgfr)a driving GFP expression to monitor hyperosmotic stress-forced mESC proliferation decrease (stunting), and differentiation increase that further stunts mESC population growth. In differentiating mESCs Pdgfra marks the first-lineage extraembryonic primitive endoderm (ExEndo). Hyperosmotic stress forces mESC differentiation gain (Pdgfra-GFP) in monolayer or three-dimensional embryoid bodies. Despite culture with potency-maintaining leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), stress forces ExEndo as assayed using microplate readers and validated by coexpression of Pdgfra-GFP, Disabled 2 (Dab2), and laminin by immunofluorescence and GFP protein and Dab2 by immunoblot. In agreement with previous reports, Rex1 and Oct4 loss was inversely proportional to increased Pdgfra-GFP mESC after treatment with high hyperosmotic sorbitol despite LIF. The increase in subpopulations of Pdgfra-GFP(+) cells>background at approximately 23% was similar to the previously reported approximately 25% increase in Rex1-red fluorescent protein (RFP)-negative subpopulation at matched high sorbitol doses. By microplate reader, there is a approximately 7-11-fold increase in GFP at a high nonmorbid and a morbid dose despite LIF, compared with LIF alone. By flow cytometry (FACS), the subpopulation of Pdgfra-GFP(+) cells>background increases approximately 8-16-fold at these doses. Taken together, the microplate, FACS, immunoblot, and immunofluorescence data suggest that retinoic acid or hyperosmotic stress forces dose-dependent differentiation whether LIF is present or not and this is negatively correlated with and possibly compensates for stress-forced diminished ESC population expansion and potency loss.","['Li, Quanwen', 'Louden, Erica', 'Zhou, Jordan', 'Drewlo, Sascha', 'Dai, Jing', 'Puscheck, Elizabeth E', 'Chen, Kang', 'Rappolee, Daniel A']","['Li Q', 'Louden E', 'Zhou J', 'Drewlo S', 'Dai J', 'Puscheck EE', 'Chen K', 'Rappolee DA']","['1 CS Mott Center for Human Growth and Development, Department of Ob/Gyn, Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan.', '1 CS Mott Center for Human Growth and Development, Department of Ob/Gyn, Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan.', '2 Program for Reproductive Sciences and Department of Physiology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan.', '3 Reproductive Endocrinology, Infertility & Genetics, Augusta University, Augusta, Georgia.', '4 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and Center for Molecular Medicine and Genetics, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan.', '5 Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Biology, College of Human Medicine, Michigan State University, Grand Rapids, Michigan.', '1 CS Mott Center for Human Growth and Development, Department of Ob/Gyn, Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan.', '1 CS Mott Center for Human Growth and Development, Department of Ob/Gyn, Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan.', '6 InVia Fertility, Hoffman Estates, Illinois.', '4 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and Center for Molecular Medicine and Genetics, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan.', '1 CS Mott Center for Human Growth and Development, Department of Ob/Gyn, Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan.', '2 Program for Reproductive Sciences and Department of Physiology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan.', '7 Institutes for Environmental Health Science, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan.', '8 Department of Biology, University of Windsor, Windsor, Ontario, Canada.', '9 Reproductive Stress, Measurement, Mechanism and Management, Inc., Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan.']",['eng'],"['R03 HD061431/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI122256/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R41 ES028991/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20190107,United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Dab2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Laminin)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Lineage', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays/*methods', 'Laminin/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', '*Osmotic Pressure', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/genetics/metabolism']",PMC6350416,['NOTNLM'],"['*compensatory differentiation', '*embryonic stem cells', '*high throughput screens', '*hyperosmotic stress', '*potency', '*transcription factors']",2018/10/18 06:00,2020/03/07 06:00,['2018/10/18 06:00'],"['2018/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/scd.2018.0157 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2019 Jan 15;28(2):101-113. doi: 10.1089/scd.2018.0157.

The authors aim to report medical risk factors of morbidity and mortality following inpatient sinus surgery in the pediatric population. METHODS:: Using data from the Kids' Inpatient Database from 2003 to 2012, patients with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, procedure codes for primary sinus surgery were identified. Mixed-effect multivariable logistic regression was used to identify risk factors of inpatient postoperative morbidity and mortality. RESULTS:: The final sample included a weighted estimate of 4965 pediatric patients. The rates of inpatient morbidity and mortality were 6% and 1%, respectively. Respiratory complications (2.5%) were the most prevalent postoperative adverse events. The most prevalent comorbidities were chronic sinusitis (59.8%), acute sinusitis (27.8%), and cystic fibrosis (26.4%). Compared with patients who did not experience any morbidity, patients with inpatient morbidity had higher rates of pneumonia, mycoses, and nasal or paranasal benign neoplasm ( P < .05). The odds of inpatient morbidity and mortality were highest for patients with leukemia (odds ratio, 2.74; 95% confidence interval, 1.59-4.72; P < .001) and mycoses (odds ratio, 15.84; 95% confidence interval, 6.45-38.89; P < .001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS:: This study is the first to report the national comorbidity burden and risk factors for postoperative adverse events following inpatient sinus surgery. Knowledge of the comorbidities and independent factors associated with morbidity and mortality will help in directing preoperative optimization and counseling.

This new classification, particularly the entity pre-MF, has been a subject of discussion between experts. Important questions have been raised in recent years, such as the need for bone marrow trephine for diagnosis; how this is interpreted and the weighting given to it in assigning a diagnosis; determination of prognosis for pre-MF patients; including which scoring system to use and, ultimately, an evidence-based management plan for this group of patients. Many pre-MF patients present as young adults, with thrombocytosis, elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels and increased bone marrow fibrosis (i.e. >/= grade 1). Current management strategies differ in view of age, comorbidities and bone marrow features and the opinion of the managing clinicians. Prognostic scoring systems have some limitations regarding this entity, and at the present time there is limited information about the overall survival and incidence of progression to overt-MF and acute leukaemia for pre-MF. In this clinically focussed article, we review the main characteristics of this new disease category in view of the current published literature and illustrate our discussion with some real patient cases. Lastly, we propose a management strategy for patients to whom this diagnostic label is applied.","['Curto-Garcia, Natalia', 'Ianotto, Jean-Christophe', 'Harrison, Claire N']","['Curto-Garcia N', 'Ianotto JC', 'Harrison CN']","[""Department of Haematology, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK."", ""Department of Haematology, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK."", 'Institut de Cancero-Hematologie, CHRU de Brest, Brest, France.', ""Department of Haematology, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20181017,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Disease Management', 'Fibrosis', 'Humans', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*classification', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*classification/diagnosis/pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'World Health Organization']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*classification', '*management', '*myeloproliferative neoplasm', '*prefibrotic myelofibrosis', '*primary myelofibrosis']",2018/10/18 06:00,2019/07/11 06:00,['2018/10/18 06:00'],"['2018/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/11 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.15562 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2018 Oct;183(1):23-34. doi: 10.1111/bjh.15562.

A striking morphological feature of Tk mutant colonies is the bimodal distribution of their sizes, with cells from the large colonies growing at a normal rate and cells from the small colonies growing at a slower rate than normal. To understand the molecular distinction for the different growth rates, we performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) analysis of the large and small colony mutants generated from the MLA. Three large colony and three small colony mutants generated from cells treated with 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4-NQO) or the vehicle control were selected for analysis. The WGS data were analyzed for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and chromosome copy number along chromosome 11, where the Tk gene is located. Although there were LOH alterations in both large and small colony mutants, copy number changes near Tk locus were found only in small colony mutants produced by the vehicle control and 4-NQO treatments. The chromosome copy number in the regions near the Tk locus increased from two to three or four in the spontaneous small colony mutants and decreased from two to one in the 4-NQO-induced small colony mutants. These results suggest that chromosome damage was repaired differently in the large and small colony mutants, resulting in significant chromosome alterations in the small colony mutants, but not in the large colony mutants. Thus, chromosome alterations near the Tk locus may play a major role in the inhibition of cell growth in the Tk small colony mutants.","['Guo, Xiaoqing', 'Pan, Bohu', 'Seo, Ji-Eun', 'Chen, Ying', 'Yan, Jian', 'Mei, Nan', 'Chen, Tao']","['Guo X', 'Pan B', 'Seo JE', 'Chen Y', 'Yan J', 'Mei N', 'Chen T']","['Division of Genetic and Molecular Toxicology, National Center for Toxicological Research, 3900 NCTR Road, Jefferson, AR, 72079, USA.', 'Division of Bioinformatics and Biostatistics, National Center for Toxicological Research, 3900 NCTR Road, Jefferson, AR, 72079, USA.', 'Division of Genetic and Molecular Toxicology, National Center for Toxicological Research, 3900 NCTR Road, Jefferson, AR, 72079, USA.', 'Division of Genetic and Molecular Toxicology, National Center for Toxicological Research, 3900 NCTR Road, Jefferson, AR, 72079, USA.', 'Division of Genetic and Molecular Toxicology, National Center for Toxicological Research, 3900 NCTR Road, Jefferson, AR, 72079, USA.', 'Division of Genetic and Molecular Toxicology, National Center for Toxicological Research, 3900 NCTR Road, Jefferson, AR, 72079, USA.', 'Division of Genetic and Molecular Toxicology, National Center for Toxicological Research, 3900 NCTR Road, Jefferson, AR, 72079, USA.

Lymphoma risk is increased in children with CHD. This study analyzes the effect of CHD and CHD severity on childhood cancer risk. METHODS: We analyzed cancer risk in a population-based cohort of children with and without CHD born between 1988 and 2004 by linking data from the California Birth Defects Monitoring Program with data from the California Cancer Registry. We compared cancer risk in children with and without CHD, excluding children with chromosomal anomalies. RESULTS: Of >3 million children in the birth cohort, 65,585 had birth defects (2%), 25,981 with CHD. Cancer occurred in 4,781 (0.15%) children, 43 (0.17%) with CHD. Cancer risk in CHD was increased (hazard ratio [HR]) 2.63, 95% CI: 1.95, 3.55). Leukemia was the most common cancer in those without CHD (1,722/4,738, 36%), central nervous system tumors were second (1,073/4,738, 23%), and lymphoma third (410/4,738, 9%). Among children with CHD, lymphoma and leukemia occurred with the same frequency (12/43, 28% for each). HR for lymphoma was 8.37 (CI: 4.71, 14.86) with CHD versus without. HR for leukemia was 2.05 (CI: 1.16, 3.61) with CHD versus without. CHD complexity was higher in lymphoma (3, interquartile range [IQR]: 2-3) than those with leukemia (1, IQR, 1-2; p < .02). CONCLUSION: Cancer risk is increased in children with CHD. Lymphoma risk is increased in CHD and is correlated with more complex CHD. These results suggest a shared developmental origin for CHD and lymphoma may be present.","['Collins, R Thomas 2nd', 'Von Behren, Julie', 'Yang, Wei', 'Carmichael, Suzan L', 'Reynolds, Peggy', 'Fisher, Paul G', 'Shaw, Gary M']","['Collins RT 2nd', 'Von Behren J', 'Yang W', 'Carmichael SL', 'Reynolds P', 'Fisher PG', 'Shaw GM']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Cardiology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, California.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Cardiology, Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford, Palo Alto, California."", 'Cancer Prevention Institute of California, Berkeley, California.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatal and Developmental Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, California.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatal and Developmental Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, California.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Cardiology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, California.', 'Cancer Prevention Institute of California, Berkeley, California.', 'Department of Neurology, Division of Child Neurology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, California.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Child Neurology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, California.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatal and Developmental Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, California.']",['eng'],"['MM-1125-09/09/CC/CDC HHS/United States', 'U01DD001033/Centers for Birth Defects Research and Prevention/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20181016,United States,Birth Defects Res,Birth defects research,101701004,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'California', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Heart Defects, Congenital/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Registries', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*childhood cancer', '*congenital heart disease', '*lymphoma', '*malignancy', '*severity']",2018/10/18 06:00,2019/07/12 06:00,['2018/10/18 06:00'],"['2018/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/08 00:00 [revised]', '2018/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/bdr2.1390 [doi]'],ppublish,Birth Defects Res. 2018 Oct 16;110(17):1314-1321. doi: 10.1002/bdr2.1390.

Nevertheless, some patients with CLL can show an atypical phenotype, this raising the possibility of a lymphoproliferative disorder other than CLL. It has been recently shown that the expression of CD200 could be a rather consistent marker for CLL. METHODS: The expression of CD200 was investigated in 120 consecutive patients with B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (B-CLPD) (65 cases diagnosed as typical CLL, 16 atypical CLL, and 39 non-CLL before entering the study) by using multiparametric flow cytometry with four color combinations. CD200 was analyzed as percentage of positive cells (>/=30%) and MFIR expression. ROC curves were used to determine the cut-off for the CD200 MFIR. Matutes score (MS) was used as comparator. RESULTS: All 81 (100%) patients classified as CLL and 25 of 39 (64.1%) classified as non-CLL expressed high CD200 expression (>/=30%). CD200 expression showed a high sensitivity (100%) and a low specificity (35.9%), and the accuracy was similar to that of Matutes score markers (range: 79.2%-86.7%); except SmIg that was 59.1%. The addition of CD200 to the Matutes score correctly identified 74 of 81 (91.4%) CLL cases including 9 of 16 atypical CLL cases. As per non CLL cases, 37 of 39 (94.9%) were correctly diagnosed by the modified system. Altogether, CD200 improved the diagnostic accuracy of Matutes score from 86.7% to 92.5% (P < .01). CONCLUSION: These results show that CD200 is a valuable, albeit not specific, CLL diagnostic marker.

The major reason patients are not cured is resistance to treatment, often manifested as relapse from remission, rather than, even in older patients, TRM, whose incidence is decreasing. Knowledge of the pre-treatment mutation status of various genes has improved our ability to assign initial treatment and, of particular importance, knowledge of whether patients ostensibly in remission have measurable residual disease should influence subsequent management.

Omacetaxine mepesuccinate (OM) is safe and effective in myeloid malignancies but has not been studied in MDS with HMA failure. We conducted a phase II study of OM in patients with MDS or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) who had previously failed or been intolerant to HMAs. Patients received OM at a dose of 1.25 mg/m(2) subcutaneously every 12 hours for 3 consecutive days on a 4- to 7-week schedule. The primary endpoints were the overall response rate (ORR) and OS. A total of 42 patients were enrolled with a median age of 76 years. The ORR was 33%. Patients with diploid cytogenetics were more likely to respond to OM than were those with cytogenetic abnormalities (58% vs 23%, respectively; P = .03). Overall, the median OS was 7.5 months and 1-year OS rate was 25%. Patients with diploid cytogenetics had superior OS to those with cytogenetic abnormalities (median OS 14.8 vs 6.8 months, respectively; P = .01). Two patients had ongoing response to OM of 2 years or longer (both MDS with diploid cytogenetics and RUNX1 mutation). The most common grade >/= 3 adverse events were infections in 11 patients (26%), febrile neutropenia in 4 (10%), and hemorrhage in 3 (7%). Overall, OM was safe and active in patients with MDS or CMML who experienced HMA failure. These results support the further development of OM in this setting.","['Short, Nicholas J', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Naqvi, Kiran', 'Patel, Ami', 'Ning, Jing', 'Sasaki, Koji', 'Nogueras-Gonzalez, Graciela M', 'Bose, Prithviraj', 'Kornblau, Steven M', 'Takahashi, Koichi', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Sanchez-Petitto, Gabriela', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Dinardo, Courtney D', 'Montalban-Bravo, Guillermo', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Alvarado, Yesid', 'Bhalla, Kapil N', 'Fiskus, Warren', 'Khouri, Maria', 'Islam, Rubiul', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']","['Short NJ', 'Jabbour E', 'Naqvi K', 'Patel A', 'Ning J', 'Sasaki K', 'Nogueras-Gonzalez GM', 'Bose P', 'Kornblau SM', 'Takahashi K', 'Andreeff M', 'Sanchez-Petitto G', 'Estrov Z', 'Dinardo CD', 'Montalban-Bravo G', 'Konopleva M', 'Alvarado Y', 'Bhalla KN', 'Fiskus W', 'Khouri M', 'Islam R', 'Kantarjian H', 'Garcia-Manero G']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['K12 CA088084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA171338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA173877/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",20181115,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Substitution', 'Fatigue/chemically induced', 'Febrile Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/chemically induced', 'Hemorrhage/chemically induced', 'Homoharringtonine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/genetics']",PMC6570401,,,2018/10/18 06:00,2019/11/13 06:00,['2018/10/18 06:00'],"['2018/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/04 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/13 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25318 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2019 Jan;94(1):74-79. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25318.

The structures of 1-9 were determined based on conventional spectroscopic analysis and chemical evidence. As expected, based on previous data, 1-3 exhibited potent cytotoxic activity against HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells and A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. Furthermore, the ability of OSW-1 to induce apoptosis in HL-60 cells was examined. Aggregation of nuclear chromatin, accumulation of the sub-G1 cells, DNA fragmentation, and caspase-3 activation were assessed in HL-60 cells treated with OSW-1, providing evidence for OSW-1-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. No mitochondrial membrane potential or release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm were observed in the OSW-1-treated apoptotic HL-60 cells, indicating that a mitochondria-independent signaling pathway is involved in apoptotic cell death.","['Iguchi, Tomoki', 'Kuroda, Minpei', 'Naito, Rei', 'Watanabe, Tomoyuki', 'Matsuo, Yukiko', 'Yokosuka, Akihito', 'Mimaki, Yoshihiro']","['Iguchi T', 'Kuroda M', 'Naito R', 'Watanabe T', 'Matsuo Y', 'Yokosuka A', 'Mimaki Y']","['Department of Medicinal Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, 1432-1, Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo, 192-0392, Japan.', 'Department of Medicinal Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, 1432-1, Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo, 192-0392, Japan. kurodam@toyaku.ac.jp.', 'Department of Medicinal Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, 1432-1, Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo, 192-0392, Japan.', 'Department of Medicinal Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, 1432-1, Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo, 192-0392, Japan.', 'Department of Medicinal Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, 1432-1, Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo, 192-0392, Japan.', 'Department of Medicinal Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, 1432-1, Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo, 192-0392, Japan.', 'Department of Medicinal Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, 1432-1, Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo, 192-0392, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181016,Japan,J Nat Med,Journal of natural medicines,101518405,"['0 (Cholestanes)', '0 (Cholestenones)', '0 (Glycosides)', '0 (Saponins)', '145075-81-6 (OSW 1)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cholestanes/*chemistry', 'Cholestenones/*metabolism', 'Glycosides/*chemistry', 'HL-60 Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Ornithogalum/*chemistry', 'Saponins/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Cholestane glycosides', 'Cytotoxity', 'HL-60 cells', 'OSW-1', 'Ornithogalum saundersiae']",2018/10/18 06:00,2019/06/01 06:00,['2018/10/18 06:00'],"['2018/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/01 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11418-018-1252-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s11418-018-1252-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Nat Med. 2019 Jan;73(1):131-145. doi: 10.1007/s11418-018-1252-4.

Moreover, it is unknown whether mutational status affects survival, as seen in chronic-phase MPNs. Therefore, we performed a retrospective analysis of all patients treated at our institution with AP/BP MPNs (N = 122; AP = 14; BP = 108) to comprehensively describe the mutational profile and correlate with clinical outcomes. Targeted sequencing with a 54-gene panel was performed. Forty-four patients were treated with intensive therapy, 27 with nonintensive therapy, and 51 with best supportive care (BSC). The most common mutation was JAK2V617F, occurring in 55% of subjects; CALR was found in 13% of patients and MPL in 6%. Thirty-two (26%) patients were triple negative. Other frequently mutated genes were ASXL1 (30%), TET2 (25%), SRSF2 (22%), RUNX1 (20%), and TP53 (17%). Mutations in 1, 2, 3, and >/=4 genes were seen in 15%, 13%, 25%, and 46% of patients, respectively. There was no difference in survival between patients treated with intensive vs nonintensive therapy, and the benefit of intensive therapy was limited to patients who were able to undergo transplantation. TP53 was the only individual mutation to correlate with shorter overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.89; P = .03). In the multivariate analysis, mutated TP53, >/=4 mutations, low albumin, increased peripheral blood blasts, >/=3 cytogenetic abnormalities, and BSC were associated with shorter survival. In conclusion, mutational data enhance the understanding of patients with AP/BP MPN who are likely to benefit from current therapeutic options.","['McNamara, Caroline J', 'Panzarella, Tony', 'Kennedy, James A', 'Arruda, Andrea', 'Claudio, Jaime O', 'Daher-Reyes, Georgina', 'Ho, Jenny', 'Siddiq, Nancy', 'Devlin, Rebecca', 'Tsui, Hubert', 'Su, Jie', 'Stockley, Tracy', 'Sukhai, Mahadeo', 'Kanwar, Nisha', 'Chan, Steven', 'Maze, Dawn', 'Schimmer, Aaron', 'Schuh, Andre', 'Sibai, Hassan', 'Viswabandya, Auro', 'Yee, Karen', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Kamel-Reid, Suzanne', 'Gupta, Vikas']","['McNamara CJ', 'Panzarella T', 'Kennedy JA', 'Arruda A', 'Claudio JO', 'Daher-Reyes G', 'Ho J', 'Siddiq N', 'Devlin R', 'Tsui H', 'Su J', 'Stockley T', 'Sukhai M', 'Kanwar N', 'Chan S', 'Maze D', 'Schimmer A', 'Schuh A', 'Sibai H', 'Viswabandya A', 'Yee K', 'Minden MD', 'Kamel-Reid S', 'Gupta V']","['Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology and.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology and.', 'Department of Laboratory Hematology, Toronto General Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Advanced Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Genetics, Laboratory Medicine Program, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada; and.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Advanced Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Advanced Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology and.', 'Advanced Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology and.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,,IM,"['Blast Crisis/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6199664,,,2018/10/18 06:00,2019/09/05 06:00,['2018/10/18 06:00'],"['2018/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/05 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2018021469 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2018021469 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2018 Oct 23;2(20):2658-2671. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018021469.,,,['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We conducted an electronic medical record review to identify individuals >/=85 years treated with TT. RESULTS: The sample (N=295) was 53.5% male, 41% married/partnered, and 73.7% Caucasian. Common cancer types included breast (26.3%), prostate (31.3%), and leukemia (14.1%). Only one-third (n=98) of the sample had TT side effects noted in their patient chart.

Magnetic beads were modified with either asialofetuin (ASF) or soybean agglutinin (SBA) to evaluate the effect on cell sensing. Because SBA binds to the galactose residue that exists at the terminals of the carbohydrate chains in ASF, the target protein was accumulated on the protein magnetic beads. SBA is an example of N-acetylgalactosamine- and galactose-binding proteins that readily combine with YYYYC. When the peptides and protein-immobilized beads competed for a target protein, the peak current of the peptides changed according to the concentration of the protein at the 10(-12)M level. Next, human myeloid leukemia cells (K562cell) were measured using the peptide and the carbohydrate chains on the cell surface that recognize SBA. The electrode response was linear to the number of K562cells and ranged from 1.0x10(2) to 5.0x10(3)cells mL(-1). In addition, detection of a human liver cancer cell (HepG2 cell) was carried out using interactions with the peptide, the ASF receptors in HepG2 cells, and the carbohydrate chains of ASF. The peak currents were proportional and ranged between 5.0x10(1) and 1.5x10(3)cells mL(-1). When the values estimated from an electrochemical process were compared with those obtained by ELISA, the results were within the acceptable range of measurement error.","['Sugawara, Kazuharu', 'Kuramitz, Hideki', 'Kadoya, Toshihiko']","['Sugawara K', 'Kuramitz H', 'Kadoya T']","['Maebashi Institute of Technology, Gunma, 371-0816, Japan.

However, the dose-response relationship in normal versus malignant human cells is unclear. We evaluated how methylseleninic acid (MSA) modulates the toxicity and efficacy of chemotherapy and radiation on malignant and non-malignant human mononuclear blood cells in vitro. We specifically investigated its effects on endoplasmic reticulum stress induction, intracellular glutathione concentration, DNA damage and viability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and THP1 monocytic leukaemia cells in response to radiation, cytosine arabinoside or doxorubicin chemotherapy. MSA, at lower concentrations, induced protective responses in normal cells but cytotoxic effects in malignant cells, alone and in conjunction with chemotherapy or radiation. However, in normal cells higher concentrations of MSA were directly toxic and increased the cytotoxicity of radiation but not chemotherapy. In malignant cells higher MSA concentrations were generally more effective in combination with cancer treatments. Thus, optimal MSA concentrations differed between normal and malignant cells and treatments. This work supports clinical reports that selenium can significantly reduce dose-limiting toxicities of anticancer therapies and potentially improve efficacy of anticancer treatments. The optimal selenium compound and dose is not yet determined.","['Lobb, Richard J', 'Jacobson, Gregory M', 'Cursons, Ray T', 'Jameson, Michael B']","['Lobb RJ', 'Jacobson GM', 'Cursons RT', 'Jameson MB']","['Tumour Microenvironment Laboratory, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Herston, QLD 4006, Australia.

The purpose of this study was to link population-based cancer and birth defects data to evaluate characteristics and survival of children with acute leukemia according to the presence of DS or other birth defects. METHODS: ALL and AML cases diagnosed between 1983 and 2012 among children aged 0-14 years were obtained from the New York State Cancer Registry. Birth defect status (DS, other birth defects, or no birth defects) was determined by linking with birth defects data. Associations between birth defect status and demographic characteristics were evaluated using contingency table analysis. Ten-year survival was calculated by birth defect status and other potential prognostic factors. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was also performed. RESULTS: Among 2941 ALL children, 1.6% had DS, 3.8% had other birth defects, and 94.5% had no birth defects. Birth defect status was significantly associated with age at ALL diagnosis. Survivals were similar among three groups. Among 563 AML children, 11.0% had DS, 6.0% had other birth defects, and 83.0% had no birth defects. Children with DS were more likely to be diagnosed with AML at a younger age and showed the best survival. CONCLUSION: Age at leukemia diagnosis was significantly associated with the birth defect status. Comparable survival was observed for ALL children. However, AML children with DS demonstrated superior survival compared to children with other birth defects or no birth defects.","['Qiao, Baozhen', 'Austin, April A', 'Schymura, Maria J', 'Browne, Marilyn L']","['Qiao B', 'Austin AA', 'Schymura MJ', 'Browne ML']","['New York State Cancer Registry, New York State Department of Health, Albany, NY, USA.

In case of an autologous HSCT, patients receive their own stem cells after myeloablation before extraction. Allogeneic HSCT uses stem cells derived from a donor. Despite being associated with a high risk of early and long-term complications, it is often the last curative option. 229 pediatric patients, who between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2015 received an HSCT at the University Children's Hospital Wuerzburg, were studied. Correlations between two groups were calculated with the Chi square test or with a 2x2-contingency table. To calculate metric variables, the Mann-Whitney-U-test was used. Survival curves were calculated according to Kaplan and Meier. Significance was assumed for results with a p-value <0.05 (CI (Confident Interval) 95%). We retrospectively analyzed 229 pediatric patients (105 females, 124 males) for early and late complications of allogeneic and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Median age at HSCT was seven years. Underlying diseases were leukemia (n = 73), lymphoma (n = 22), solid tumor (n = 65), CNS (central nervous system)- tumor (n = 41), and ""other diseases"" (n = 28). Survival times, overall survival, and event-free survival were calculated. Of all patients, 80.8% experienced complications of some degree, including mild and transient complications. Allo-HSCT (allogeneic HSCT) carried a significantly higher risk of complications than auto-HSCT (autologous HSCT) (n = 118 vs. n = 67; p = < .001) and the remission rate after allo-HSCT was also higher (58.7% vs. 44,7%; p = .032). Especially infection rates and pulmonary complications are different between auto- and allo-HSCT. Leukemia patients had the highest risk of early and late complications (95,0%; p < .001). Complications within HSCT are major risk factors following morbidity and mortality. In order to detect complications and risk factors early, strict recordings are needed to reduce the rate of complication by recognition and prevention of triggering factors. In the future, these factors should receive greater attention in the planning of HSCT post-transplantation care in order to improve the results of the transplantation and establish protocols to prevent their occurrence.","['Hierlmeier, Sophie', 'Eyrich, Matthias', 'Wolfl, Matthias', 'Schlegel, Paul-Gerhardt', 'Wiegering, Verena']","['Hierlmeier S', 'Eyrich M', 'Wolfl M', 'Schlegel PG', 'Wiegering V']","[""University Hospital Wuerzburg, Children's Department of Oncology, Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Wuerzburg, Germany."", ""University Hospital Wuerzburg, Children's Department of Oncology, Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Wuerzburg, Germany."", ""University Hospital Wuerzburg, Children's Department of Oncology, Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Wuerzburg, Germany."", ""University Hospital Wuerzburg, Children's Department of Oncology, Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Wuerzburg, Germany."", ""University Hospital Wuerzburg, Children's Department of Oncology, Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Wuerzburg, Germany.""]",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20181016,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Autologous/*adverse effects', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*adverse effects']",PMC6191171,,,2018/10/17 06:00,2019/03/23 06:00,['2018/10/17 06:00'],"['2018/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0204914 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-09108 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2018 Oct 16;13(10):e0204914. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0204914. eCollection 2018.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-2921-7003'],['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods The medical records of 186 subjects [111 boys and 75 girls; lymphoid=75, myeloid=111; median age at HSCT was 10.7 (0.8-21.8) years old] were reviewed retrospectively. Results In children with leukemia, T3 decreased at 1 month (p<0.001) and recovered 9 months to the levels before HSCT. TSH decreased at 1 month (p<0.001), recovered at 3 months and increased at 12 months (p<0.001) to the levels before HSCT. The incidence of euthyroid sick syndrome (ESS, 23.2%, 15.5%, 5.9%, 5.2%, 3.9%, p for trend <0.001) decreased and subclinical hypothyroidism (SH, 0%, 3.9%, 14.8%, 22.1%, 21.3%, p for trend <0.001) increased at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after HSCT. Out of 55 patients developing ESS during 3 months after HSCT, 54 recovered to normal thyroid function within 5 months without medication. Among the total 186 subjects, 21 patients have been treated with levothyroxine. Both height and weight standard deviation scores continued to decrease over 1 year after HSCT. Conclusions In children with leukemia, one-quarter had ESS at 1 month and one-fifth had SH at 12 months and continued growth impairments were observed during 1 year after HSCT. Most of the ESS patients recovered to normal within 5 months without medication. More long-term follow-up of thyroid function and growth in children with leukemia after HSCT is crucial.","['Lee, Yoon-Ji', 'Lee, Hyun Young', 'Ahn, Moon Bae', 'Kim, Seong-Koo', 'Cho, Won Kyoung', 'Lee, Jae-Wook', 'Chung, Nack-Gyun', 'Cho, Bin', 'Suh, Byung-Kyu']","['Lee YJ', 'Lee HY', 'Ahn MB', 'Kim SK', 'Cho WK', 'Lee JW', 'Chung NG', 'Cho B', 'Suh BK']","[""Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Pediatrics, St. Vincent's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 93, Jungbudaero (Ji-dong), Paldal-gu, Suwon, Gyeonggi-do 16247, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Germany,J Pediatr Endocrinol Metab,Journal of pediatric endocrinology & metabolism : JPEM,9508900,"['06LU7C9H1V (Triiodothyronine)', 'Q51BO43MG4 (Thyroxine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Hypothyroidism/blood/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/blood/*physiopathology/*surgery', 'Male', 'Postoperative Complications/blood/etiology/physiopathology', 'Thyroid Gland/*physiopathology', 'Thyroxine/*blood', 'Triiodothyronine/*blood', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['children', 'growth', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'leukemia', 'thyroid']",2018/10/17 06:00,2019/01/11 06:00,['2018/10/17 06:00'],"['2018/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/11 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1515/jpem-2018-0162 [doi]', '/j/jpem.ahead-of-print/jpem-2018-0162/jpem-2018-0162.xml [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Endocrinol Metab. 2018 Nov 27;31(11):1241-1247. doi: 10.1515/jpem-2018-0162.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aims of this study were to confirm this finding in a larger cohort regardless of age and prognostic subgroups, to explore the expression and functional role of ferritin in AML cells as well as the regulation of serum ferritin levels in AML patients. PATIENTS/MATERIALS/METHODS: Serum ferritin levels at diagnosis were collected in a cohort of 525 patients treated by intensive chemotherapy. In silico, in vitro, and in vivo analyses were conducted to assess the pattern of expression and functional role of FTH1 and FTL in AML. RESULTS: We confirmed the independent prognostic value of serum ferritin. In transcriptomic databases, FTH1 and FTL were overexpressed in AML and leukemic stem cells compared to normal hematopoietic stem cells. The gene signature designed from AML patients overexpressing FTH1 revealed a significant enrichment in genes of the immune and inflammatory response including Nf-KB pathway, oxidative stress, or iron pathways. This gene signature was enriched in cytarabine-resistant AML cells in a patient-derived xenograft model. FTH1 protein was also overexpressed in patient's samples and correlated with the in vitro cytotoxic activity of cytarabine. Lastly, we demonstrated that chemotherapy induced an inflammatory response including a significant increase in serum ferritin levels between day 1 and 8 of induction chemotherapy that was blocked by dexamethasone. CONCLUSION: Ferritin is deregulated in most AML patients likely through inflammation, associated with chemoresistance, and could represent a new therapeutic target.","['Bertoli, Sarah', 'Paubelle, Etienne', 'Berard, Emilie', 'Saland, Estelle', 'Thomas, Xavier', 'Tavitian, Suzanne', 'Larcher, Marie-Virginie', 'Vergez, Francois', 'Delabesse, Eric', 'Sarry, Audrey', 'Huguet, Francoise', 'Larrue, Clement', 'Bosc, Claudie', 'Farge, Thomas', 'Sarry, Jean Emmanuel', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Recher, Christian']","['Bertoli S', 'Paubelle E', 'Berard E', 'Saland E', 'Thomas X', 'Tavitian S', 'Larcher MV', 'Vergez F', 'Delabesse E', 'Sarry A', 'Huguet F', 'Larrue C', 'Bosc C', 'Farge T', 'Sarry JE', 'Michallet M', 'Recher C']","[""Service d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, Toulouse, France."", 'Universite Toulouse III Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, UMR1037-INSERM, ERL5294 CNRS, Toulouse, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie, Lyon, France."", ""Service d'Epidemiologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Toulouse, France."", 'UMR 1027, INSERM-Universite de Toulouse III, Toulouse, France.', 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, UMR1037-INSERM, ERL5294 CNRS, Toulouse, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie, Lyon, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, Toulouse, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie, Lyon, France."", 'Universite Toulouse III Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, UMR1037-INSERM, ERL5294 CNRS, Toulouse, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, Toulouse, France."", 'Universite Toulouse III Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, UMR1037-INSERM, ERL5294 CNRS, Toulouse, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, Toulouse, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, Toulouse, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, Toulouse, France."", 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, UMR1037-INSERM, ERL5294 CNRS, Toulouse, France.', 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, UMR1037-INSERM, ERL5294 CNRS, Toulouse, France.', 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, UMR1037-INSERM, ERL5294 CNRS, Toulouse, France.', 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, UMR1037-INSERM, ERL5294 CNRS, Toulouse, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie, Lyon, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, Toulouse, France."", 'Universite Toulouse III Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, UMR1037-INSERM, ERL5294 CNRS, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['ANR-11-PHUC-001/French government (Agence Nationale de la Recherche) under the', '""Investissement d\'avenir"" program']",['Journal Article'],20181128,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (FTL protein, human)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', '9013-31-4 (Apoferritins)', 'EC 1.- (FTH1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Apoferritins/blood/*genetics', 'Biomarkers', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Ferritins/*blood/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/*genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', 'Oxidoreductases', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['FTH1', 'FTL', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'chemoresistance', 'dexamethasone', 'ferritin', 'glucocorticoids', 'inflammation', 'leukemic stem cells']",2018/10/17 06:00,2019/04/26 06:00,['2018/10/17 06:00'],"['2018/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/08 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/26 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13183 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2019 Feb;102(2):131-142. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13183.

Stuck tunneled central venous catheters in children: Four cases removed by angiography assistance. Turk J Pediatr 2018; 60: 221-224. Adherent tunneled catheters can usually be removed by a surgical cut down, but in some cases the line can become stuck to the wall of the central veins. In such cases, forceful traction can cause vascular injury, or fracture of the catheter. We present four cases of fixated cuffed tunneled catheters. Three children had acute lymphoblastic leukemia and one had an immunodeficiency syndrome. All catheters were made from polyurethane. Indwelling times were 12-24 months. All patients` catheters were removed with great difficulty by trans-femoral access. The angiography-assisted technique is safe and easily-applied for the removal of stuck catheters in pediatric patients. These cases raise important questions concerning the maximum indwelling time and the choice of catheter material when implanting permanent central venous catheters (CVCs) in children.","['Ates, Ufuk', 'Tastekin, Nil Yasam', 'Mammadov, Fuad', 'Ergun, Ergun', 'Gollu, Gulnur', 'Can, Ozlem Selvi', 'Ucar, Tayfun', 'Bingol-Kologlu, Meltem', 'Yagmurlu, Aydin', 'Aktug, Tanju']","['Ates U', 'Tastekin NY', 'Mammadov F', 'Ergun E', 'Gollu G', 'Can OS', 'Ucar T', 'Bingol-Kologlu M', 'Yagmurlu A', 'Aktug T']","['Departments of Pediatric Surgery, Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Departments of Pediatric Surgery, Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Departments of Pediatric Surgery, Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Departments of Pediatric Surgery, Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Departments of Pediatric Surgery, Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Departments of Anesthesiology and Reanimation, Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Pediatric Cardiology, Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Departments of Pediatric Surgery, Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Departments of Pediatric Surgery, Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Departments of Pediatric Surgery, Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Turkey,Turk J Pediatr,The Turkish journal of pediatrics,0417505,,IM,"['Angiography/*methods', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/*adverse effects', 'Central Venous Catheters/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Device Removal/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*angiography', '*catheter', '*children', '*stuck']",2018/10/17 06:00,2019/05/21 06:00,['2018/10/17 06:00'],"['2018/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1835 [pii]', '10.24953/turkjped.2018.02.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Turk J Pediatr. 2018;60(2):221-224. doi: 10.24953/turkjped.2018.02.019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we aim to determine the genotype distribution and allele frequencies of common TPMT (*2, *3A, *3B and *3C) polymorphisms in Turkish children with acute leukemia. The study population consisted of 169 patients aged between 1 and 15 years who were admitted to Losante Pediatric Hematology and Children`s Hospital with the diagnosis of acute leukemia. Genotyping of TPMT polymorphisms was screened with real-time PCR using fluorescence melting curve detection analysis. We found that the frequencies of four allelic variants of TPMT are *2 (238 G > C) (0,0%), *3A (460G > A and 719A > G) (1.7%), *3B (460G > A) (1,7%) and *3C (719A > G) (2.4%). Frequency of TPMT alleles increases the efficacy of leukemia treatment. Thus, TPMT genotyping can be useful for optimizing 6-MP therapy.","['Akin, Dilara Fatma', 'Aslar-Oner, Deniz', 'Kurekci, Emin', 'Akar, Nejat']","['Akin DF', 'Aslar-Oner D', 'Kurekci E', 'Akar N']","['Department of Medical Biology, Nigde Omer Halisdemir University, Faculty of Medicine, Nigde, Turkey.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Losante Children's and Adult Hospital Ankara, Turkey."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Losante Children's and Adult Hospital Ankara, Turkey."", 'Department of Pediatric Diseases, TOBB-ETU Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Turkey,Turk J Pediatr,The Turkish journal of pediatrics,0417505,"['EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (TPMT protein, human)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Alleles', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Male', 'Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Turkey']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*TPMT', '*childhood', '*leukemia', '*polymorphism']",2018/10/17 06:00,2019/05/21 06:00,['2018/10/17 06:00'],"['2018/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/21 06:00 [medline]']","['1821 [pii]', '10.24953/turkjped.2018.02.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Turk J Pediatr. 2018;60(2):147-152. doi: 10.24953/turkjped.2018.02.005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is an urgent need for the development of novel antineoplastic compounds to treat this devastating condition. Various alkylating anticancer drugs have been employed in the clinic for treating cancers. Unsaturated conjugated ketones are a group of alkylators which are of significant interest as potent antineoplastic agents. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to discover unsaturated conjugated ketones which are novel potent cytotoxins displaying growth-inhibitory properties towards neoplasms and also to serve as cytotoxic warheads in drug development. METHODS: A variety of 3,5-bis (benzylidene)-4-piperidones 2a-n were synthesized and evaluated against a number of neoplastic cell lines. The short-term neurotoxicity of 2a-k, n was evaluated in mice by i.p. administration using doses level of 30, 100 and 300 mg/kg. Statistical correlations for determining structure-activity relationships were performed using an SPSS software. RESULTS: A number of compounds display cytotoxic potencies in the region of 10-7 to 10-8 M and some of the structural features contributing to the cytotoxicity were identified. Compounds 2a-d, 2h demonstrated substantially higher cytotoxic potencies compared to melphalan and 5- fluorouracil against a panel of leukemic and colon cancer cell lines. These lead cytotoxins comply with drug-likeness properties. In general, the antineoplastics 2 are well tolerated in mice using a short-term neurotoxicity screening. CONCLUSION: In general, this group of compounds comprises excellent cytotoxic agents, which warrant their further development as cytotoxic warheads.","['Das, Swagatika', 'Gul, H Inci', 'Das, Umashankar', 'Balzarini, Jan', 'Dimmock, Stephen G', 'Dimmock, Jonathan R']","['Das S', 'Gul HI', 'Das U', 'Balzarini J', 'Dimmock SG', 'Dimmock JR']","['Drug Discovery and Development Research Group, College of Pharmacy and Nutrition, University of Saskatchewan, 104 Clinic Place, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan S7N 2Z5, Canada.', 'Drug Discovery and Development Research Group, College of Pharmacy and Nutrition, University of Saskatchewan, 104 Clinic Place, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan S7N 2Z5, Canada.', 'Drug Discovery and Development Research Group, College of Pharmacy and Nutrition, University of Saskatchewan, 104 Clinic Place, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan S7N 2Z5, Canada.', 'Rega Institute for Medical Research, KU Leuven, B- 3000, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Finance, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore 539798, Singapore.', 'Drug Discovery and Development Research Group, College of Pharmacy and Nutrition, University of Saskatchewan, 104 Clinic Place, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan S7N 2Z5, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Med Chem,Medicinal chemistry (Shariqah (United Arab Emirates)),101240303,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ketones)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Ketones/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Conjugated unsaturated ketones', 'apoptosis', 'colon cancer cells', 'cytotoxicity', 'drug-likeness', 'structure-activity relationships.']",2018/10/17 06:00,2019/06/08 06:00,['2018/10/17 06:00'],"['2018/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/03 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/08 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['MC-EPUB-93677 [pii]', '10.2174/1573406414666181015142633 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Chem. 2019;15(4):430-438. doi: 10.2174/1573406414666181015142633.,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Careful attention and investigation, including molecular testing, is required to confirm the diagnosis and exclude other mimicking conditions, such as inherited bone marrow failure syndromes. In a proportion of patients, the disease evolves to myelodysplasia or acute myeloid leukaemia and in some there is an association with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria. The disease has a major impact on patient quality of life. Haemopoietic stem/progenitor cell transplantation for eligible patients with an available donor is the only current curative therapy. Other patients may receive immunosuppression, most commonly with anti-thymocyte globulin and cyclosporin. An initial response to immunosuppression is often encouraging, but relapse is common. Supportive care, including management of transfusion requirements and infections, is central to management. Promising new diagnostic tools and emerging therapies will likely transform approaches to this important, chronic and life-threatening condition.","['Clucas, Danielle B', 'Fox, Lucy C', 'Wood, Erica M', 'Hong, Frank S', 'Gibson, John', 'Bajel, Ashish', 'Szer, Jeff', 'Blombery, Piers', 'McQuilten, Zoe K', 'Hiwase, Devendra', 'Firkin, Frank', 'Cole-Sinclair, Merrole F']","['Clucas DB', 'Fox LC', 'Wood EM', 'Hong FS', 'Gibson J', 'Bajel A', 'Szer J', 'Blombery P', 'McQuilten ZK', 'Hiwase D', 'Firkin F', 'Cole-Sinclair MF']","['Department of Clinical Haematology, Alfred Hospital, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, Epworth Hospital, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Transfusion Research Unit, Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Transfusion Research Unit, Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, Monash Medical Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, The Northern Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Clinical Services and Research, Australian Red Cross Blood Service, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Institute of Haematology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'The University of Sydney, Sydney, South Australia, Australia.', 'Integrated Haematology Service, Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre (The Royal Melbourne Hospital/Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre), Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Integrated Haematology Service, Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre (The Royal Melbourne Hospital/Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre), Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Molecular Haematology Laboratory, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Transfusion Research Unit, Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, Monash Medical Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Research Centre, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', ""Haematology Department, St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."", 'The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', ""Haematology Department, St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."", 'The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"[""Maddie Riewoldt's Vision/International""]","['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Australia,Intern Med J,Internal medicine journal,101092952,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']",IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/therapeutic use', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Pancytopenia/complications', 'Recurrence']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*anaemia', '*anti-thymocyte globulin', '*aplastic', '*blood transfusion', '*bone marrow transplantation', '*pancytopenia']",2018/10/17 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2018/10/17 06:00'],"['2018/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/26 00:00 [revised]', '2018/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/imj.14140 [doi]'],ppublish,Intern Med J. 2019 Feb;49(2):152-159. doi: 10.1111/imj.14140.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-7527-2340', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8331-2154', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6783-2301']",,['(c) 2018 Royal Australasian College of Physicians.'],,,,['Australian Aplastic Anaemia Registry Steering Committee'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multiple ESCCs are associated with poor clinical outcomes. Growing evidence has addressed that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in the carcinogenesis of various malignancies. We compared the lncRNA and messenger RNA (mRNA) profiles between solitary and multiple ESCC tissues through microarray analysis, aiming at studying their different mechanisms in tumor development. As a result, in multiple ESCCs, a total of 5257 lncRNAs and 3371 mRNAs were consistently differentially expressed compared with solitary ESCC, including 2986 upregulated and 2271 downregulated lncRNAs, and 2313 upregulated, and 1058 downregulated mRNAs. We validated the results in four differentially expressed lncRNAs using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. There were 38 and 20 pathways significantly related to up- and downregulated transcripts. The pathways associated with mostly enriched up- and downregulated mRNAs were hsa01200 (carbon metabolism) and hsa05221 (acute myeloid leukemia- homo sapiens [human]). Gene ontology analysis suggested that upregulated and downregulated mRNAs were mainly enriched in bounding membrane of organelle involved in the cellular component and positive regulation of transport involved in the biological process. Further analysis identified 189 differentially expressed paired antisense lncRNAs and relative sense mRNA, as well as 2134 differentially expressed long intergenic noncoding RNAs and their adjacent mRNA pairs. In conclusion, the aberrantly expressed lncRNAs might play a role in the carcinogenesis of multiple ESCCs and could be candidates as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.","['Li, Qi-Wen', 'Ma, Li', 'Qiu, Bo', 'Yang, Hong', 'Zhu, Yu-Jia', 'Qiang, Meng-Yun', 'Liu, Song-Ran', 'Chen, Nai-Bin', 'Guo, Jin-Yu', 'Cai, Ling-Zhi', 'Wang, Jun-Ye', 'Zhang, Xu', 'Liu, Hui']","['Li QW', 'Ma L', 'Qiu B', 'Yang H', 'Zhu YJ', 'Qiang MY', 'Liu SR', 'Chen NB', 'Guo JY', 'Cai LZ', 'Wang JY', 'Zhang X', 'Liu H']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital & Shenzhen Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Pathology, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Lung Cancer Research Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.']",['eng'],"['81301932/National Nature Science Fund', '2018A030313021/Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province']",['Journal Article'],20181015,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['long noncoding RNA', 'microarray analysis.', 'multiple primary esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs)']",2018/10/17 06:00,2018/10/17 06:00,['2018/10/17 06:00'],"['2018/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.27536 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Cell Biochem. 2018 Oct 15. doi: 10.1002/jcb.27536.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3335-3756'],,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To quantify the time and reimbursement associated with hospitalisations of patients with R/R ALL in a Spanish hospital. METHODS: Retrospective review of medical charts identified patients aged >/= 18 years with Ph- R/R ALL hospitalised between 1998 and 2014. Data were collected from the date of first diagnosis of R/R ALL (index) until death or loss to follow-up. The primary endpoint was the proportion of time hospitalised during chemotherapy. Reimbursement associated with hospitalisations (including associated chemotherapy) was also assessed. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were eligible for inclusion. Their median age was 41 years, and 50% had a first remission duration of </= 1 year; 34% had undergone allogeneic haematological stem-cell transplantation (alloHSCT). Overall, 31 patients had received intensive salvage chemotherapy, during which there were 42 hospitalisations (mean 1.4/patient; mean duration 26 days). Patients spent a mean of 71% of the chemotherapy period in hospital. Total mean reimbursement was euro26,417 per patient, almost all (euro25,723) attributable to inpatient stays (euro18,986/hospitalisation). From the index date to death or loss to follow-up (excluding alloHSCT-related hospitalisations), there were 80 hospitalisations (mean duration 24 days); mean reimbursement was euro16,692 per hospitalisation and euro41,730 per patient. AlloHSCT (n = 8) involved 18 hospitalisations (mean reimbursement euro39,782/hospitalisation; euro89,510/patient).

Patients were followed until death, progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), end of enrollment, or end of study (12/31/2015). Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-related costs/HCU (including medical/pharmacy claims with a primary diagnosis of MDS, MDS-related treatment, or supportive care) and non-MDS-related costs/HCU were evaluated. Costs were calculated as per-patient per-month (PPPM) costs adjusted to 2015 US dollars. RESULTS: Of the 209 HR-MDS patients included, median follow-up was 9.9 months (interquartile range 4.6-17.9), and 69.4% had at least one inpatient admission, 56.9% had at least one emergency department visit, and nearly all patients had at least one outpatient visit. Average PPPM costs over follow-up were $17,361; year 1 versus year 2 costs were higher ($17,337 vs $12,976) following HR-MDS diagnosis. The majority of costs were for MDS-related medical services ($10,327 PPPM). MDS-related medical PPPM costs decreased from $10,557 (year 1) to $6530 (year 2). The main drivers of MDS-related medical costs and the decrease in year 2 were chemotherapy and supportive care costs. CONCLUSIONS: The economic burden of HR-MDS is considerable, particularly within the first year of diagnosis. Treatment/supportive care costs accounted for a significant portion of MDS-related costs. As HR-MDS treatment evolves, the economic impact and HCU need to be further investigated.","['Bell, Jill A', 'Galaznik, Aaron', 'Blazer, Marlo', 'Shih, Huai-Che', 'Farrelly, Eileen', 'Ogbonnaya, Augustina', 'Eaddy, Michael', 'Fram, Robert J', 'Faller, Douglas V']","['Bell JA', 'Galaznik A', 'Blazer M', 'Shih HC', 'Farrelly E', 'Ogbonnaya A', 'Eaddy M', 'Fram RJ', 'Faller DV']","['Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Takeda Pharmaceuticals International Co., 40 Landsdowne Street, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA. jill.bell@takeda.com.', 'Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Takeda Pharmaceuticals International Co., 40 Landsdowne Street, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'Xcenda LLC, 4114 Woodlands Parkway, Suite 402, Palm Harbor, 34685, FL, USA.', 'Xcenda LLC, 4114 Woodlands Parkway, Suite 402, Palm Harbor, 34685, FL, USA.', 'Xcenda LLC, 4114 Woodlands Parkway, Suite 402, Palm Harbor, 34685, FL, USA.', 'Xcenda LLC, 4114 Woodlands Parkway, Suite 402, Palm Harbor, 34685, FL, USA.', 'Xcenda LLC, 4114 Woodlands Parkway, Suite 402, Palm Harbor, 34685, FL, USA.', 'Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Takeda Pharmaceuticals International Co., 40 Landsdowne Street, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Takeda Pharmaceuticals International Co., 40 Landsdowne Street, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Switzerland,Pharmacoecon Open,PharmacoEconomics - open,101700780,,,,PMC6533351,,,2018/10/17 06:00,2018/10/17 06:01,['2018/10/17 06:00'],"['2018/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/17 06:01 [medline]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s41669-018-0100-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s41669-018-0100-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Pharmacoecon Open. 2019 Jun;3(2):237-245. doi: 10.1007/s41669-018-0100-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The origins of stem cells date back to the 1960s, when they were first described as cells capable of self-renewal, extensive proliferation, and differentiation. Since then, many advances have been made and adult stem cells are now known to be present in a very wide variety of tissues. Neural stem cells were subsequently discovered 30 years later, which was shortly followed by the discovery of cancer stem cells in leukemia and in brain tumors over the next decade, effectively enabling a new understanding of cancer. Since then, many markers including CD133, brain cancer stem cells have been implicated in a variety of phenomena including intratumoral heterogeneity on the genomic, cellular, and functional levels, tumor initiation, chemotherapy-resistance, radiation-resistance, and are believed to be ultimately responsible for tumor relapse. Understanding this small and rare population of cells could be the key to solving the great enigma that is cancer.","['Yelle, Nicolas', 'Bakhshinyan, David', 'Venugopal, Chitra', 'Singh, Sheila K']","['Yelle N', 'Bakhshinyan D', 'Venugopal C', 'Singh SK']","['McMaster Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.', 'McMaster Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.', 'Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Surgery, Faculty of Health Sciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada. ssingh@mcmaster.ca.', 'Department of Surgery, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada. ssingh@mcmaster.ca.', 'Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada. ssingh@mcmaster.ca.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,,IM,"['Animals', 'Brain Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Neural Stem Cells/pathology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Brain tumor initiating cell makers', '*Brain tumor stem cells', '*Cancer stem cells', '*Intratumoral heterogeneity', '*Neural stem cells']",2018/10/17 06:00,2019/05/28 06:00,['2018/10/17 06:00'],"['2018/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-4939-8805-1_1 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2019;1869:1-9. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-8805-1_1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we found that the MT1 fusion protein attenuated the expression of Cebpa, Csf1r, and Cd11b and inhibited the differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells. Increased binding of the MT1 fusion protein to the Trib2 promoter upregulated Trib2 mRNA and protein expression and downregulated Cebpa expression. Trib2 knockdown relieved the inhibition of myeloid cell differentiation induced by the MT1 fusion protein. Thus, TRIB2 is important for the survival of leukemia cells during MT1-related leukemogenesis and is important in maintaining differentiation blockade of leukemic cells. KEY MESSAGES: * MLL-TET1 fusion decreases the 5-hmC levels in the myeloid progenitor cells. * MLL-TET1 fusion inhibits myeloid differentiation through decreased expression of Cebpa. * MLL-TET1 fusion blocks the differentiation of the myeloid progenitor cells by overexpressing Trib2. * Knockdown of Trib2 in MLL-TET1 transduced cells induces myeloid differentiation.","['Kim, Hyeng-Soo', 'Oh, Seung Hwan', 'Kim, Ju-Heon', 'Sohn, Wern-Joo', 'Kim, Jae-Young', 'Kim, Do-Hyung', 'Choi, Sang-Un', 'Park, Kwon Moo', 'Ryoo, Zae Young', 'Park, Tae Sung', 'Lee, Sanggyu']","['Kim HS', 'Oh SH', 'Kim JH', 'Sohn WJ', 'Kim JY', 'Kim DH', 'Choi SU', 'Park KM', 'Ryoo ZY', 'Park TS', 'Lee S']","['School of Life Science, BK21 plus KNU Creative BioResearch Group, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, 41566, Republic of Korea.', 'Institute of Life Science and Biotechnology, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, 41566, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, Inje University, Busan, 47392, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Life Science, BK21 plus KNU Creative BioResearch Group, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, 41566, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Dentistry, IHBR, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, 41940, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Dentistry, IHBR, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, 41940, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Physics, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, 41566, Republic of Korea.', 'Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology, Daejeon, 34186, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Anatomy, Kyungpook National University School of Medicine, Daegu, 41944, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Life Science, BK21 plus KNU Creative BioResearch Group, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, 41566, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Kyung Hee University School of Medicine, Seoul, 02447, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Life Science, BK21 plus KNU Creative BioResearch Group, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, 41566, Republic of Korea. slee@knu.ac.kr.']",['eng'],"['SI1706/Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology/International', 'NRF-2016R1C1B1010734/National Research Foundation of Korea/International']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181015,Germany,J Mol Med (Berl),"Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)",9504370,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 1.- (Mixed Function Oxygenases)', 'EC 1.- (TET1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (TRIB2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mixed Function Oxygenases/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/*physiology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'RAW 264.7 Cells']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Leukemia', '*MLL', '*MLL-TET1', '*TET1', '*Trib2']",2018/10/17 06:00,2019/11/07 06:00,['2018/10/17 06:00'],"['2018/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/09/25 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00109-018-1700-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s00109-018-1700-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Mol Med (Berl). 2018 Nov;96(11):1267-1277. doi: 10.1007/s00109-018-1700-3.

METHODS: We prospectively enrolled children and adolescents with cancer or pediatric HSCT recipients 8-18 years of age from three groups: inpatients receiving cancer treatments; outpatients in maintenance therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); and outpatients in survivorship. Bothersome changes in taste was self-reported using the Symptom Screening in Pediatrics Tool (SSPedi); nausea was self-reported using the Pediatric Nausea Assessment Tool (PeNAT). RESULTS: Among the 502 children included, 226 (45.0%) reported bothersome taste changes and 48 (9.6%) reported severely bothersome taste changes. In multiple regression, factors independently associated with severely bothersome taste changes were: inpatients receiving cancer treatments vs outpatients in survivorship (odds ratio (OR) 12.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.50-222.27), ALL in maintenance vs outpatients in survivorship (OR 7.43, 95% CI 1.06-147.77), current nausea (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.04-2.42), vomiting (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.06-4.38), and first language not English (OR 2.09, 95% CI 0.97-4.28). CONCLUSIONS: We found that 45% of children with cancer and pediatric HSCT recipients reported bothersome changes in taste and these were severely bothersome in 9.6% of children. Inpatients receiving cancer treatment, those experiencing more nausea and vomiting and children whose first language was not English were at greater risk of severely bothersome changes in taste. Future work should evaluate systematic symptom screening in clinical practice and identify interventions focused on addressing bothersome taste changes.","['Loves, Robyn', 'Tomlinson, Deborah', 'Baggott, Christina', 'Dix, David', 'Gibson, Paul', 'Hyslop, Shannon', 'Johnston, Donna L', 'Orsey, Andrea D', 'Portwine, Carol', 'Price, Victoria', 'Schechter, Tal', 'Vanan, Magimairajan', 'Kuczynski, Susan', 'Spiegler, Brenda', 'Tomlinson, George A', 'Dupuis, L Lee', 'Sung, Lillian']","['Loves R', 'Tomlinson D', 'Baggott C', 'Dix D', 'Gibson P', 'Hyslop S', 'Johnston DL', 'Orsey AD', 'Portwine C', 'Price V', 'Schechter T', 'Vanan M', 'Kuczynski S', 'Spiegler B', 'Tomlinson GA', 'Dupuis LL', 'Sung L']","['Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning, 686 Bay Street, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 0A4, Canada.', 'Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning, 686 Bay Street, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 0A4, Canada.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Stanford University School of Medicine, 800 Welch Road, MC5757, Palo Alto, CA, 94304, USA.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology/BMT, Department of Pediatrics, BC Children's Hospital, 4480 Oak Street Room B315, Vancouver, V6H 3V4, Canada."", 'Haematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, London Health Sciences Centre, 800 Commissioners Road East, London, Ontario, N6A 5W9, Canada.', 'Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning, 686 Bay Street, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 0A4, Canada.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, 401 Smyth Road, Ottawa, Ontario, K1H 8L1, Canada."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Connecticut Children's Medical Center, 282 Washington Street, Hartford, CT, 06106, USA."", ""Division of Haematology/Oncology, McMaster Children's Hospital, Health Sciences Centre, 1280 Main Street West, Hamilton, Ontario, L8S 4K1, Canada."", 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, IWK Health Centre, 5850/5980 University Avenue, Halifax, Nova Scotia, B3K 6R8, Canada.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 1X8, Canada.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/BMT, CancerCare Manitoba, Research Institute in Oncology and Hematology, Departments of Pediatrics & Child Health and Biochemistry & Medical Genetics, University of Manitoba, 675 McDermot Avenue, Winnipeg, Manitoba, R3E 0V9, Canada.', 'Ontario Parents Advocating for Children with Cancer (OPACC), 99 Citation Drive, Toronto, Ontario, M2K 1S9, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, The Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 1X8, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Toronto General Hospital, 200 Elizabeth Street, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 2C4, Canada.', 'Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning, 686 Bay Street, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 0A4, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 1X8, Canada.', 'Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Peter Gilgan Centre for Research and Learning, 686 Bay Street, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 0A4, Canada. lillian.sung@sickkids.ca.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 1X8, Canada. lillian.sung@sickkids.ca.']",['eng'],['702295/Canadian Cancer Society'],['Journal Article'],20181015,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*complications/pathology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Taste/*physiology', 'Taste Disorders/*etiology/pathology', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*adverse effects/methods']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Children', 'Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Oncology', 'Symptom screening', 'Taste changes']",2018/10/17 06:00,2019/06/22 06:00,['2018/10/17 06:00'],"['2018/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00520-018-4509-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s00520-018-4509-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2019 Jun;27(6):2247-2254. doi: 10.1007/s00520-018-4509-2.

We hypothesized that mapping erythrocyte levels of MTXpg with 1-6 glutamates and their associations with DNA-TG formation would facilitate future guidelines for maintenance therapy dosing. METHODS AND RESULTS: Summed MTX with 1-6 glutamates resolved by LCMS [median (interquartile): 5.47 (3.58-7.69) nmol/mmol hemoglobin] was in agreement with total MTX by radio ligand assay. In 16,389 blood samples from 1426 ALL maintenance therapy patients, MTXpg3 21.0 (15.2-27.4)% was the predominant metabolite, and MTXpg1 (the maternal drug) constituted 38.6 (27.2-50.2)% of MTXpg1-6. All subsets correlated; the strongest associations were between metabolites with similar polyglutamate lengths. Correlations of MTXpg1 with MTXpg2 and MTXpg3,4,5,6 were rs = 0.68 and rs = 0.25-0.42, respectively. Intercorrelations of MTXpg3,4,5,6 were all rs >/= 0.51. MTXpg4 accounted for 29.8 (24.7-33.3)% of MTXpg3-6, yet explained 96% of the summed MTXpg3-6 variation. MTXpg1-4, MTXpg1-6, MTXpg2-6 and MTXpg3 were all associated with DNA-TG levels (p < 0.00001), but collinearity precluded identification of the most informative subset. CONCLUSIONS: Measuring erythrocyte MTXpg4 simplifies and can replace longer chain MTXpg monitoring. Resolving individual MTXpg identifies samples that are unsuitable for dose guidance due to high levels of MTXpg1 remaining in the plasma fraction because of recent MTX intake. All tested MTXpg subsets correlated with DNA-TG and may be used for ALL maintenance therapy dose adjustments, but the most informative subset remains to be identified.","['Nersting, Jacob', 'Nielsen, Stine Nygaard', 'Grell, Kathrine', 'Paerregaard, Maria', 'Abrahamsson, Jonas', 'Lund, Bendik', 'Jonsson, Olafur Gisli', 'Pruunsild, Kaie', 'Vaitkeviciene, Goda', 'Kanerva, Jukka', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld']","['Nersting J', 'Nielsen SN', 'Grell K', 'Paerregaard M', 'Abrahamsson J', 'Lund B', 'Jonsson OG', 'Pruunsild K', 'Vaitkeviciene G', 'Kanerva J', 'Schmiegelow K']","['Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 9, 2100, Copenhagen, Denmark. jacob.nersting@regionh.dk.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 9, 2100, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 9, 2100, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Section of Biostatistics, Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 9, 2100, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Institution for Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Pediatrics, St. Olavs Hospital, Trondheim University Hospital, Trondheim, Norway.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland.', ""Tallinn Children's Hospital, Tallinn, Estonia."", 'University Hospital Santariskiu Klinikos, Vilnius, Lithuania.', ""Children's Hospital, Helsinki University Central Hospital, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland."", 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 9, 2100, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181015,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '82334-40-5 (methotrexate polyglutamate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', 'Polyglutamic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Prognosis']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia maintenance therapy', '*Methotrexate polyglutamates', '*Personalized/individualized therapy', '*Therapeutic drug monitoring', '*Thiopurine']",2018/10/17 06:00,2019/11/13 06:00,['2018/10/17 06:00'],"['2018/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/13 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00280-018-3704-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s00280-018-3704-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2019 Jan;83(1):53-60. doi: 10.1007/s00280-018-3704-7.

Historically, patients with BPDCN have an unfavorable prognosis and the optimal treatment is not established due to lack of prospective data. Case report: In this report we describe a patient with Felty's syndrome and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in whom a population of aberrant plasmacytoid dendritic cells emerged while on treatment with decitabine. Approximately 4 months later he transformed to leukemic BPDCN with skin and eye manifestations. Cytogenetic analysis showed diploid karyotype and molecular analysis showed mutations in KRAS, NOTCH1, and RUNX1 genes. He was treated with CD123-targeted therapy and had significant response in his marrow, skin, eyes, and functional status after one cycle. Conclusion: The case demonstrates that minimal transformative disease of BPDCN may be detectable in patients with MDS well before fulminant progression. Early detection of emerging leukemic clones may allow for alternative monitoring and treatment considerations.","['Chamoun, Kamal', 'Loghavi, Sanam', 'Pemmaraju, Naveen', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Kroll, Michael', 'Nguyen-Cao, Madeleine', 'Hornbaker, Marisa', 'DiNardo, Courtney D', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Jorgensen, Jeffrey', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Hu, Shimin', 'Benton, Christopher B']","['Chamoun K', 'Loghavi S', 'Pemmaraju N', 'Konopleva M', 'Kroll M', 'Nguyen-Cao M', 'Hornbaker M', 'DiNardo CD', 'Kadia T', 'Jorgensen J', 'Andreeff M', 'Hu S', 'Benton CB']","['1Departments of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit 428, Houston, TX 77030 USA.0000 0001 2291 4776grid.240145.6', '2Departments of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA.0000 0001 2291 4776grid.240145.6', '1Departments of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit 428, Houston, TX 77030 USA.0000 0001 2291 4776grid.240145.6', '1Departments of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit 428, Houston, TX 77030 USA.0000 0001 2291 4776grid.240145.6', '3Departments of Benign Hematology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA.0000 0001 2291 4776grid.240145.6', '1Departments of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit 428, Houston, TX 77030 USA.0000 0001 2291 4776grid.240145.6', '1Departments of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit 428, Houston, TX 77030 USA.0000 0001 2291 4776grid.240145.6', '1Departments of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit 428, Houston, TX 77030 USA.0000 0001 2291 4776grid.240145.6', '1Departments of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit 428, Houston, TX 77030 USA.0000 0001 2291 4776grid.240145.6', '2Departments of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA.0000 0001 2291 4776grid.240145.6', '1Departments of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit 428, Houston, TX 77030 USA.0000 0001 2291 4776grid.240145.6', '2Departments of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA.0000 0001 2291 4776grid.240145.6', '1Departments of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit 428, Houston, TX 77030 USA.0000 0001 2291 4776grid.240145.6']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Case Reports'],20181006,England,Exp Hematol Oncol,Experimental hematology & oncology,101590676,,,,PMC6174068,['NOTNLM'],"['BPDCN', 'Early detection', 'MDS', 'Myelodysplastic syndromes', 'Prognosis']",2018/10/17 06:00,2018/10/17 06:01,['2018/10/17 06:00'],"['2018/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40164-018-0117-6 [doi]', '117 [pii]']",epublish,Exp Hematol Oncol. 2018 Oct 6;7:26. doi: 10.1186/s40164-018-0117-6. eCollection 2018.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-3645-148X'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One potent immune stimulus is the encounter with allogeneic cells. Our group previously showed that the infusion of haploidentical donor white blood cells (1-2 x 10(8) CD3+ cells/kg) into patients with refractory hematological malignancies induced responses of varying magnitude in over half of the patients. Because donor cells were eliminated within 2 weeks in these patients, it is presumed that the responses of recipient lymphocytes were critically important in achieving prolonged anti-leukemic responses. Methods: The role of patient CD3+ cells in anti-leukemic responses was examined by isolating peripheral blood mononuclear cells from newly diagnosed leukemic patients. Immunophenotyping was performed on these peripheral blood mononuclear cells. CD3+ cells were isolated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tested for their ability to proliferate and lyse autologous leukemic cells when stimulated with unrelated allogeneic cells. Results: Allostimulated CD3+ cells effectively generated cytolytic responses to autologous CD3-cells in 11/21 patients. Increased numbers of CD4+ cells expressing high levels of granzyme A, B and perforin and CD8+CD39+ cells were found in nonresponsive CD3+ cells. Conclusions: These results indicate that CD3+ cells from leukemic patients are capable of generating anti-leukemic responses when stimulated with unrelated allogeneic cells. This model can be used to identify approaches using alloreactive responses by patient lymphocytes to enhance in vivo anti-leukemic responses.","['Pando, Alejandro', 'Reagan, John L', 'Nevola, Martha', 'Fast, Loren D']","['Pando A', 'Reagan JL', 'Nevola M', 'Fast LD']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Rhode Island Hospital and the Warren Alpert School of Medicine at Brown University, One Hoppin Street, Coro West Suite 5.0.1, Providence, RI 02903 USA.0000 0004 1936 9094grid.40263.33', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Rhode Island Hospital and the Warren Alpert School of Medicine at Brown University, One Hoppin Street, Coro West Suite 5.0.1, Providence, RI 02903 USA.0000 0004 1936 9094grid.40263.33', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Rhode Island Hospital and the Warren Alpert School of Medicine at Brown University, One Hoppin Street, Coro West Suite 5.0.1, Providence, RI 02903 USA.0000 0004 1936 9094grid.40263.33', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Rhode Island Hospital and the Warren Alpert School of Medicine at Brown University, One Hoppin Street, Coro West Suite 5.0.1, Providence, RI 02903 USA.0000 0004 1936 9094grid.40263.33']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181004,England,Exp Hematol Oncol,Experimental hematology & oncology,101590676,,,,PMC6172765,['NOTNLM'],"['Alloreactivity', 'Cross-reactivity', 'Cytolytic T lymphocytes', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia', 'T cells']",2018/10/17 06:00,2018/10/17 06:01,['2018/10/17 06:00'],"['2018/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40164-018-0118-5 [doi]', '118 [pii]']",epublish,Exp Hematol Oncol. 2018 Oct 4;7:25. doi: 10.1186/s40164-018-0118-5. eCollection 2018.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-8859-7248'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is associated with relatively low survivals and high incidence of relapse, especially when considering myeloid malignancies. Results: This retrospective study included 36 adults (males n = 18; median age: 60.5 years old; haplodonors n = 27; matched donors n = 8) with myeloid malignancies transplanted between March 2014 and March 2017 at the University Hospital of Nantes. Very encouraging results were observed with a 18-month overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and relapse incidence (RI) of 72% +/- 7.5%, 63.8 +/- 8%, and 25 +/- 6% respectively, and a GVHD relapse-free survival (GRFS) of 52.6 +/- 8%. In univariate analysis, there were no differences regarding 18-month survivals between patients allografted: i) for acute myeloid leukemia vs myelodysplastic syndrome (OS 70 +/- 11% vs 69.2 +/- 13%, p = 0.3; DFS 64.7 +/- 11% vs 61.5 +/- 13%, p = 0.65), or ii) with haplo-identical vs other donors (OS: 66.2 +/- 9% vs 88.8 +/- 10.4%, p = 0.16; DFS 59 +/- 9.5% vs 77.8%, p = 0.6).

The brain is being identified as a sanctuary site for harboring metastases despite excellent control of extracranial disease. This is thought to occur because the drug therapies that control extracranial disease have limited central nervous system (CNS) penetration. The development of brain metastases is a devastating diagnosis affecting both quality of life (QOL) and survival. Symptoms after diagnosis can include headache, nausea, vomiting, seizure, neurocognitive decline, and focal neurologic deficit. Some of these symptoms can be irreversible even after successful treatment of intracranial disease. Treatment of brain metastases often necessitates surgery and radiation. There have been some reports of systemic therapies offering an intracranial response however long-term data is lacking. These treatments for CNS metastases can also lead to neurocognitive sequelae impacting quality of life. Therefore, preventing disease from spreading to the brain is a topic that has generated much interest in oncology. Prophylactic cranial Irradiation (PCI) has been used in leukemia, small cell lung cancer (SCLC), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). While showing effectiveness in preventing intracranial disease development, its carries with it side effects of neurocognitive decline that can affect QOL. There are Clinical trials exploring novel delivery of PCI and concurrent neuroprotective drug therapy to try to mitigate these neurocognitive sequelae. These will be important trials to complete, as PCI has shown promise in controlling disease and prolonging survival in select patient populations. There are also drug therapies that have shown efficacy in preventing CNS metastases development. This review will explore the current therapies available to prevent CNS metastases.","['Bovi, Joseph A']",['Bovi JA'],"['Department of Radiation Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, United States.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180928,Switzerland,Front Neurol,Frontiers in neurology,101546899,,,,PMC6172309,['NOTNLM'],"['CNS metastases', 'SRS', 'WBRT', 'immunotherapy', 'prevention', 'targeted therapy (TT)']",2018/10/17 06:00,2018/10/17 06:01,['2018/10/17 06:00'],"['2018/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/17 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fneur.2018.00758 [doi]'],epublish,Front Neurol. 2018 Sep 28;9:758. doi: 10.3389/fneur.2018.00758. eCollection 2018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cost-effectiveness of MIDO and standard of care (SOC) followed by MIDO monotherapy was compared to SOC alone for newly-diagnosed FLT3+ AML in the UK. Methods: A partitioned survival model was developed from a UK public healthcare system perspective to compare the cost-effectiveness of MIDO plus SOC and SOC over a lifetime horizon. The model included the following health states/partitions: induction, consolidation, monotherapy, complete remission (CR), relapse, stem cell transplantation (SCT), SCT recovery, and post-SCT recovery. Data on CR, overall survival, and adverse events were obtained from a Phase III clinical trial. Overall survival was extrapolated beyond the trial horizon using a 'cure model' approach and data from the Office for National Statistics. Utilities were identified via a systematic review. Routine care utilization was obtained from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence single technology appraisal for azacitidine in AML (TA399). The costs of drugs and administration, adverse events, hospitalizations, physician visits, and end-of-life care were incorporated. Results: Incremental life years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained by patients on MIDO and SOC versus SOC were 1.67 and 1.47, respectively. At an incremental cost of pound54,072 over a lifetime horizon, the ICER was pound32,465 per LY and pound36,826 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses were generally consistent with the base case findings. Conclusions: With limited treatments in FLT3+ AML, MIDO represents a clinically significant advance in the management of newly-diagnosed AML. Using a threshold of pound50,000 per QALY for end-of-life treatment, MIDO was shown to be a cost-effective option for newly-diagnosed FLT3+ AML.","['Tremblay, Gabriel', 'Dolph, Mike', 'Patel, Sachin', 'Brandt, Patricia', 'Forsythe, Anna']","['Tremblay G', 'Dolph M', 'Patel S', 'Brandt P', 'Forsythe A']","['Purple Squirrel Economics, 4 Lexington Avenue, Suite 15K, New York, NY 10010 USA.', 'Purple Squirrel Economics, 4 Lexington Avenue, Suite 15K, New York, NY 10010 USA.', '2Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Limited, Frimley Business Park, Frimley, Camberley, Surrey GU16 7SR UK.0000 0001 0642 681Xgrid.418607.c', '3Novartis Pharmaceuticals, 1 Health Plaza, East Hanover, NJ 07936 USA.0000 0004 0439 2056grid.418424.f', 'Purple Squirrel Economics, 4 Lexington Avenue, Suite 15K, New York, NY 10010 USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181004,England,Cost Eff Resour Alloc,Cost effectiveness and resource allocation : C/E,101170476,,,,PMC6172753,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Cost-effectiveness analysis', 'Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3', 'Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio', 'Life years', 'Quality-adjusted life years']",2018/10/17 06:00,2018/10/17 06:01,['2018/10/17 06:00'],"['2018/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12962-018-0153-4 [doi]', '153 [pii]']",epublish,Cost Eff Resour Alloc. 2018 Oct 4;16:33. doi: 10.1186/s12962-018-0153-4. eCollection 2018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Traditionally, there were limited options for salvage therapy, which consisted mostly of conventional chemotherapy. However, in the past 5 years, novel agents have changed our treatment strategies in this population. Blinatumomab, a bispecific CD19 directed CD3 T-cell engager, has shown to be effective in both minimal residual disease and R/R B-cell ALL. In R/R B-cell ALL, blinatumomab was associated with an improved median overall survival of 7.7 months vs 4.0 months with traditional chemotherapy (HR for death, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.55-0.93; P=0.01). It has distinctive side effects as compared to chemotherapy, specifically cytokine release syndrome and neurological toxicities. When compared to standard of care chemotherapy, patients have higher quality of life scores and less financial burden. Using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire, blinatumomab-treated patients fared better and had a longer time to deterioration or death (global health status/quality of life subscale: HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.48-0.92; P=0.009) compared to conventional chemotherapy. Using an incremental cost effective ratio threshold of US$150,000 per quality adjusted life year, blinatumomab was determined to be more cost effective compared to chemotherapy with a probability of 73.7%. This review summarizes the current and future data with blinatumomab in R/R B-cell ALL in the adult and pediatric population.","['Hathaway, Lindsey', 'Sen, Jeremy Michael', 'Keng, Michael']","['Hathaway L', 'Sen JM', 'Keng M']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, MK2PV@virginia.edu.', 'Department of Pharmacy Services, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, MK2PV@virginia.edu.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20181002,New Zealand,Patient Relat Outcome Meas,Patient related outcome measures,101551170,,,,PMC6173178,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Blincyto', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'blinatumomab', 'relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia']",2018/10/17 06:00,2018/10/17 06:01,['2018/10/17 06:00'],"['2018/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/PROM.S149420 [doi]', 'prom-9-329 [pii]']",epublish,Patient Relat Outcome Meas. 2018 Oct 2;9:329-337. doi: 10.2147/PROM.S149420. eCollection 2018.,,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the broad clinical application of CAR T-cell therapy has been challenging, largely due to the lack of widespread ability to produce and high cost of CAR T-cell products using traditional methods of production. Automated cell processing in a closed system has emerged as a potential method to increase the feasibility of producing CAR T cells locally at academic centers due to its minimal reliance on experienced labor, thereby making the process less expensive and more consistent than traditional methods of production. Method: In this study, we describe the successful production of clinical grade CD19 CAR T cells using the Miltenyi CliniMACS Prodigy Automated Cell Processor at University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in a rapid manner with a high frequent CD19 CAR expression. Results: The final CAR T-cell product is highly active, low in immune suppression, and absent in exhaustion. Full panel cytokine assays also showed elevated production of Th1 cytokines upon IL-2 stimulation when specifically killing CD19+ target cells. Conclusion: These results demonstrate the feasibility of producing CAR T cells locally in a university hospital setting using automated cell processor for future clinical applications.","['Zhang, Wei', 'Jordan, Kimberly R', 'Schulte, Brian', 'Purev, Enkhtsetseg']","['Zhang W', 'Jordan KR', 'Schulte B', 'Purev E']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA, enkhtsetseg.purev@ucdenver.edu.', 'Division of Immunology, Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA, enkhtsetseg.purev@ucdenver.edu.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181005,New Zealand,Drug Des Devel Ther,"Drug design, development and therapy",101475745,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD19/*immunology', 'Automation', 'Cytokines/analysis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*immunology/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/transplantation']",PMC6181073,['NOTNLM'],"['CD19', 'activation status', 'automated decentralized cell production', 'chimeric antigen receptor', 'cytokine panel', 'immunophenotype']",2018/10/17 06:00,2019/02/02 06:00,['2018/10/17 06:00'],"['2018/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/DDDT.S175113 [doi]', 'dddt-12-3343 [pii]']",epublish,Drug Des Devel Ther. 2018 Oct 5;12:3343-3356. doi: 10.2147/DDDT.S175113. eCollection 2018.,,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DurCR >/= 24 months remained a significant predictor for OS (HR: 0.3, 95% CI: 0.2-0.5, p < 0.001) after adjusting for age, revised ISS stage, transplant and maintenance therapy. Landmark analysis at 24 months demonstrated similar results, OS: 150 vs. 83 months, p < 0.001. Survival benefit persisted even after loss of CR, with median OS being 89 vs. 56 months (p = 0.005), respectively. Patterns of loss of CR were heterogeneous, with biochemical relapse in 59 (25%); symptomatic relapse in 58 (24%); positive immunofixation/monoclonal protein rise not meeting relapse/progression criteria in 88 (37%) and abnormal free light chain ratio in LC MM in 34 (14%) patients. OS from start of first-line therapy was superior in patients starting second-line treatment for biochemical vs. symptomatic relapse (125 vs. 81 months, p = 0.001).

RAS mutations in myeloid cells are accompanied by excessive formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), but the source of ROS and their role for the initiation and progression of leukemia have not been clearly defined. To determine the role of NOX2-derived ROS in RAS-driven leukemia, double transgenic LSL-Kras(G12D) x Mx1-Cre mice expressing oncogenic KRAS in hematopoietic cells (M-Kras(G12D)) were treated with N(alpha)-methyl-histamine (NMH) that targeted the production of NOX2-derived ROS in leukemic cells by agonist activity at histamine H2 receptors. M-Kras(G12D) mice developed myeloid leukemia comprising mature CD11b(+)Gr1(+) myeloid cells that produced NOX2-derived ROS. Treatment of M-Kras(G12D) mice with NMH delayed the development of myeloproliferative disease and prolonged survival. In addition, NMH-treated M-Kras(G12D) mice showed reduction of intracellular ROS along with reduced DNA oxidation and reduced occurence of double-stranded DNA breaks in myeloid cells. The in vivo expansion of leukemia was markedly reduced in triple transgenic mice where KRAS was expressed in hematopoietic cells of animals with genetic NOX2 deficiency (Nox2(-/-) x LSL-Kras(G12D) x Mx1-Cre). Treatment with NMH did not alter in vivo expansion of leukemia in these NOX2-deficient transgenic mice.

Although expression profiling reveals common elevated genes in distinct T-ALL subtypes, little is known about their functional role(s) and regulatory mechanism(s). We here show that SHQ1, an H/ACA snoRNP assembly factor involved in snRNA pseudouridylation, is highly expressed in T-ALL. Mechanistically, oncogenic NOTCH1 directly binds to the SHQ1 promoter and activates its transcription. SHQ1 depletion induces T-ALL cell death in vitro and prolongs animal survival in murine T-ALL models. RNA-Seq reveals that SHQ1 depletion impairs widespread RNA splicing, and MYC is one of the most prominently downregulated genes due to inefficient splicing. MYC overexpression significantly rescues T-ALL cell death resulted from SHQ1 inactivation. We herein report a mechanism of NOTCH1-SHQ1-MYC axis in T-cell leukemogenesis. These findings not only shed light on the role of SHQ1 in RNA splicing and tumorigenesis, but also provide additional insight into MYC regulation.","['Su, Hexiu', 'Hu, Juncheng', 'Huang, Liang', 'Yang, Yang', 'Thenoz, Morgan', 'Kuchmiy, Anna', 'Hu, Yufeng', 'Li, Peng', 'Feng, Hui', 'Zhou, Yu', 'Taghon, Tom', 'Van Vlierberghe, Pieter', 'Qing, Guoliang', 'Chen, Zhichao', 'Liu, Hudan']","['Su H', 'Hu J', 'Huang L', 'Yang Y', 'Thenoz M', 'Kuchmiy A', 'Hu Y', 'Li P', 'Feng H', 'Zhou Y', 'Taghon T', 'Van Vlierberghe P', 'Qing G', 'Chen Z', 'Liu H']","['Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Medical Research Institute, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China.', 'Medical Research Institute, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430072, China.', 'Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Ghent, 9000, Belgium.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Ghent University, Ghent, 9000, Belgium.', 'Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China.', 'South China Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, 510530, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Department of Medicine, Cancer Research Center, Section of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, 02118, USA.', 'College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430072, China.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Ghent University, Ghent, 9000, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Ghent, 9000, Belgium.', 'Medical Research Institute, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China.', 'Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China. chenzhichao@hust.edu.cn.', 'Medical Research Institute, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China. hudanliu@whu.edu.cn.', 'Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China. hudanliu@whu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['2018CFA018/Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province (Hubei Provincial Natural', 'Science Foundation)/International', '81470332, 81770177/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science', 'Foundation of China)/International', '2017CFA072/Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province (Hubei Provincial Natural', 'Science Foundation)/International', '81725013/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science', 'Foundation of China)/International', 'R01 CA215059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '639784/EC | European Research Council (ERC)/International', '2042017kf0282/Wuhan University/International', '81470330/National Natural Science Foundation of China (National Science', 'Foundation of China)/International', '639784/ERC_/European Research Council/International', 'R56 CA215059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA215059/Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (Foundation for the', 'National Institutes of Health, Inc.)/International']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181015,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (RNA Precursors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (SHQ1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogenesis/metabolism/pathology', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Models, Biological', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA Precursors/metabolism', 'RNA Splicing/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1/metabolism']",PMC6189109,,,2018/10/17 06:00,2019/01/01 06:00,['2018/10/17 06:00'],"['2018/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-018-06523-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-018-06523-4 [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2018 Oct 15;9(1):4281. doi: 10.1038/s41467-018-06523-4.,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8370-3232', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4530-2400', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1318-821X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2102-9377', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9063-7205', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7892-2860']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such multistate design problems require navigating a high-dimensional space to find proteins with desired characteristics. A model that relates protein sequence to functional attributes can guide design to solutions that would be hard to discover via screening. In this work, we measured thousands of protein-peptide binding affinities with the high-throughput interaction assay amped SORTCERY and used the data to parameterize a model of the alpha-helical peptide-binding landscape for three members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins: Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, and Bfl-1. We applied optimization protocols to explore extremes in this landscape to discover peptides with desired interaction profiles. Computational design generated 36 peptides, all of which bound with high affinity and specificity to just one of Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, or Bfl-1, as intended. We designed additional peptides that bound selectively to two out of three of these proteins. The designed peptides were dissimilar to known Bcl-2-binding peptides, and high-resolution crystal structures confirmed that they engaged their targets as expected. Excellent results on this challenging problem demonstrate the power of a landscape modeling approach, and the designed peptides have potential uses as diagnostic tools or cancer therapeutics.","['Jenson, Justin M', 'Xue, Vincent', 'Stretz, Lindsey', 'Mandal, Tirtha', 'Reich, Lothar Luther', 'Keating, Amy E']","['Jenson JM', 'Xue V', 'Stretz L', 'Mandal T', 'Reich LL', 'Keating AE']","['Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139.', 'Computational and Systems Biology Program, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139.', 'Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139.', 'Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139.', 'Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139.', 'Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139; keating@mit.edu.', 'Computational and Systems Biology Program, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139.', 'Department of Biological Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139.', 'Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Cambridge, MA 02139.']",['eng'],"['S10 RR029205/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM087237/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM110048/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 GM124165/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM096466/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20181015,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Escherichia coli/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Peptides/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding/physiology', 'Protein Engineering/methods', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Yeasts/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",PMC6217393,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bcl-2 inhibitor', '*energy landscape', '*machine learning', '*peptide design', '*protein-protein interactions']",2018/10/17 06:00,2018/12/13 06:00,['2018/10/17 06:00'],"['2018/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/13 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['1812939115 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1812939115 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2018 Oct 30;115(44):E10342-E10351. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1812939115.

We have generated mice that carry Cre-dependent knock-in alleles of U2af1(S34F), the murine version of the most common mutant allele of U2AF1 encountered in human cancers. Cre-mediated recombination in murine hematopoietic lineages caused changes in RNA splicing, as well as multilineage cytopenia, macrocytic anemia, decreased hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, low-grade dysplasias, and impaired transplantability, but without lifespan shortening or leukemia development. In an attempt to identify U2af1(S34F)-cooperating changes that promote leukemogenesis, we combined U2af1(S34F) with Runx1 deficiency in mice and further treated the mice with a mutagen, N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU). Overall, 3 of 16 ENU-treated compound transgenic mice developed AML. However, AML did not arise in mice with other genotypes or without ENU treatment.

He was treated with antiallergic and antipyretic drugs, glucocorticoids, and tocilizumab (4 mg/kg, days 3 and 5). However, CRS was not under control, and his condition rapidly deteriorated. He was transferred to the intensive care unit, where dexamethasone 10 mg q6h was administered, and plasma exchange was performed, with 3,000 mL of plasma replaced by fresh frozen plasma per day for 3 consecutive days. His symptoms gradually improved, and the CRS-related symptoms were relieved. Additionally, a bone marrow smear showed no lymphoblast cells, and minimal residual disease was negative on day 28. The patient was eventually discharged in a normal condition. CONCLUSIONS: CRS is caused by an exaggerated systemic immune response, potentially resulting in organ damage that can be fatal. Although therapeutic plasma exchange is not included in CRS management guidelines, this case shows that plasma exchange is feasible in at least some patients with severe CRS.","['Xiao, Xia', 'He, Xiaoyuan', 'Li, Qing', 'Zhang, Huan', 'Meng, Juanxia', 'Jiang, Yanyu', 'Deng, Qi', 'Zhao, Mingfeng']","['Xiao X', 'He X', 'Li Q', 'Zhang H', 'Meng J', 'Jiang Y', 'Deng Q', 'Zhao M']","['Department of Hematology, Tianjin First Central Hospital, Tianjin, P.R.

However, the role of BCR blockade in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remains undefined. We recently characterized primary DLBCL subsets with distinct genetic bases for perturbed BCR/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling and dysregulated B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) expression. Herein, we explore the activity of PI3K inhibitors and BCL-2 blockade in a panel of functionally and genetically characterized DLBCL cell line models. A PI3K inhibitor with predominant alpha/delta activity, copanlisib, exhibited the highest cytotoxicity in all BCR-dependent DLBCLs. The proapoptotic effect of copanlisib was associated with DLBCL subtype-specific dysregulated expression of BCL-2 family members including harakiri (HRK) and its antiapoptotic partner BCL extra large (BCL-xL), BCL2 related protein A1, myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1), and BCL2 interacting mediator of cell death. Using functional BH3 profiling, we found that the cytotoxic activity of copanlisib was primarily mediated through BCL-xL and MCL-1-dependent mechanisms that might complement BCL-2 blockade. For these reasons, we evaluated single-agent activity of venetoclax in the DLBCLs and identified a subset with limited sensitivity to BCL-2 blockade despite having genetic bases of BCL-2 dysregulation. As these were largely BCR-dependent DLBCLs, we hypothesized that combined inhibition of PI3Kalpha/delta and BCL-2 would perturb BCR-dependent and BCL-2-mediated survival pathways. Indeed, we observed synergistic activity of copanlisib/venetoclax in BCR-dependent DLBCLs with genetic bases for BCL-2 dysregulation in vitro and confirmed these findings in a xenograft model. These results provide preclinical evidence for the rational combination of PI3Kalpha/delta and BCL-2 blockade in genetically defined DLBCLs.","['Bojarczuk, Kamil', 'Wienand, Kirsty', 'Ryan, Jeremy A', 'Chen, Linfeng', 'Villalobos-Ortiz, Mariana', 'Mandato, Elisa', 'Stachura, Joanna', 'Letai, Anthony', 'Lawton, Lee N', 'Chapuy, Bjoern', 'Shipp, Margaret A']","['Bojarczuk K', 'Wienand K', 'Ryan JA', 'Chen L', 'Villalobos-Ortiz M', 'Mandato E', 'Stachura J', 'Letai A', 'Lawton LN', 'Chapuy B', 'Shipp MA']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA; and.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA; and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA; and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA; and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA; and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA; and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA; and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA; and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA; and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA; and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA; and.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA206978/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA205967/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181015,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (PIK3CA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (PIK3CD protein, human)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)', 'WI6V529FZ9 (copanlisib)']",,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', '*Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC6318426,,,2018/10/17 06:00,2019/08/21 06:00,['2018/10/17 06:00'],"['2018/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)42893-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2018-08-872465 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2019 Jan 3;133(1):70-80. doi: 10.1182/blood-2018-08-872465.

METHOD: We retrospectively reviewed medical records and continuous EEG of all patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest from November 2013 to September 2016. Demographic, clinical data and immediate complications were collected. Characteristics of continuous EEG including EEG background, time to normal trace (TTNT) and electrographic seizures were reviewed by investigators. Cerebral performance category scales at 6 months' follow up were evaluated and divided into good (grade 1-2) and poor (grade 3-5) outcome groups. RESULT: Six patients were included (two boys and four girls) with median age of 19.5 months (range13-128 months). Five patients (83.3%) presented with cardiac arrest from near-drowning and one patient with underlying acute lymphocytic leukemia presented an in-hospital cardiac arrest. Initial EKG rhythm was asystole in 3 patients (50%), pulseless activity in 1 patient (16.7%) and initially unknown in 2 patients (33.3%). Two patients (33.3%) who had EEG reactivity and TTNT within 5minutes and 2.5hours had good neurological outcome (CPC1). Four patients (66.7%) with absent EEG reactivity had poor neurological outcome (CPC4, 5 in 3 and 1 children respectively). Three patients from the poor outcome group had electrographic seizures, of whom 2/3 progressed to status epilepticus. Three out of four patients in the poor outcome group had the following complications: pneumonia, bleeding and pancreatitis. CONCLUSION: Early TTNT and EEG reactivity help to predict good neurological outcome in children undergoing therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest. Seizures and status epilepticus may predict poor neurological outcome.","['Prajongkit, Tharapong', 'Veeravigrom, Montida', 'Samransamruajkit, Rujipat']","['Prajongkit T', 'Veeravigrom M', 'Samransamruajkit R']","['Division of neurology, department of pediatrics, faculty of medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Thailand; Division of neurology, department of pediatrics, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital/The Thai Red Cross Society.', 'Division of neurology, department of pediatrics, faculty of medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Thailand; Division of neurology, department of pediatrics, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital/The Thai Red Cross Society.

Here, we conducted a retrospective study to analyze demographics, microbiology, and risk factors for IMIs development in adult acute leukemia patients undergoing allo-HSCT. METHODS: We reviewed 245 adult acute leukemia patients undergoing allo-HSCT from January 2003 to December 2014. Clinical characteristics including age, sex, conditioning regimens, European Group for Blood and Bone marrow Transplantation (EBMT) risk score, and presence of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) or chronic GVHD (cGVHD) were collected and analyzed. Cox proportional hazard model was adopted to explore the independent risk factors for IMIs developments. RESULTS: Seventeen of 245 patients developed IMIs during the study period. The cumulative incidence of IMIs in this cohort was 8.7% and 16.8% at 6 and 12 months, respectively, with Aspergillus species being the most common pathogen. The significant risk factors predicting IMIs were unrelated donor transplantation (hazard ratio [HR] 5.11), smoking (HR 3.55), EBMT risk score > 2 (HR 4.22), and moderate to severe cGVHD (HR 3.76). CONCLUSIONS: We identified four risk factors-unrelated donor transplantation, smoking, EBMT risk score >2 and moderate to severe cGVHD to predict IMIs among acute leukemia patients undergoing allo-HSCT. This cohort study suggests early identification of high-risk patients and to provide better prevention strategies would reduce the incidence and severity of IMIs in these patients.","['Chien, Sheng-Hsuan', 'Liu, Yao-Chung', 'Liu, Chia-Jen', 'Ko, Po-Shen', 'Wang, Hao-Yuan', 'Hsiao, Liang-Tsai', 'Chiou, Tzeon-Jye', 'Liu, Jin-Hwang', 'Gau, Jyh-Pyng']","['Chien SH', 'Liu YC', 'Liu CJ', 'Ko PS', 'Wang HY', 'Hsiao LT', 'Chiou TJ', 'Liu JH', 'Gau JP']","['Division of Transfusion Medicine, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Faculty of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Clinical Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan; Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan; Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan; Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan; Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan; Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Transfusion Medicine, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Faculty of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan; Division of Hematology and Oncology, Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, New Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan; Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.

As a master transcription regulator, DUX4 can also bind the promoters and activate the transcription of hundreds ZGA-associated genes. Here we report on the structural and biochemical studies of DUX4 double homeodomains (DUX4-DH), representing the only structures contain both homeodomain 1 (HD1) and homeodomain 2 (HD2). HD1 and HD2 adopt classical homeobox fold; via the helix inserted into the major groove and the N-terminal extended loop inserted into the minor groove, HD1 and HD2 recognize the box1 (5'-TAA-3') and box2 (5'-TGA-3') nucleotides of the consensus sequence, respectively. Among the box1 and box2 linking nucleotides (CCTAA), the two adenine residues are reported to be highly conserved; however, they are not directly recognized by DUX4-DH in the structures. Besides different nucleotides, our ITC analysis indicated that DUX4-DH can also tolerate various changes in the linker length. Our studies not only revealed the basis for target DNA recognition by DUX4, but also advanced our understanding on multiple gene activation by DUX4.","['Li, Yangyang', 'Wu, Baixing', 'Liu, Hehua', 'Gao, Yanqing', 'Yang, Chun', 'Chen, Xi', 'Zhang, Jing', 'Chen, Yiqing', 'Gu, Yijun', 'Li, Jixi', 'Ma, Jinbiao', 'Gan, Jianhua']","['Li Y', 'Wu B', 'Liu H', 'Gao Y', 'Yang C', 'Chen X', 'Zhang J', 'Chen Y', 'Gu Y', 'Li J', 'Ma J', 'Gan J']","['State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center of Genetics and Development, Department of Physiology and Biophysics, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200438, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Centre of Genetics and Development, Department of Biochemistry, Institute of Plant Biology, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200438, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center of Genetics and Development, Department of Physiology and Biophysics, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200438, China; State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Centre of Genetics and Development, Department of Biochemistry, Institute of Plant Biology, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200438, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center of Genetics and Development, Department of Physiology and Biophysics, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200438, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center of Genetics and Development, Department of Physiology and Biophysics, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200438, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center of Genetics and Development, Department of Physiology and Biophysics, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200438, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center of Genetics and Development, Department of Physiology and Biophysics, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200438, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center of Genetics and Development, Department of Physiology and Biophysics, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200438, China.', 'Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Shanghai Advanced Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 203201, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center of Genetics and Development, Department of Physiology and Biophysics, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200438, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Centre of Genetics and Development, Department of Biochemistry, Institute of Plant Biology, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200438, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center of Genetics and Development, Department of Physiology and Biophysics, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200438, China.

We aimed at describing the approach taken to implement ANP in a pediatric oncology-hematology unit. METHOD: The Participatory, Evidence-informed, Patient-centered Process for Advanced practice was considered as a conceptual framework for the development, implementation and evaluation of the nursing role. Successive steps were taken for identifying patients and family needs, defining the health care priorities, and establishing a new health care model. RESULTS: The seven steps of the PEPPA framework were carried out over a year and contributed to the identification of the tasks and the role of the advanced nurse practitioner in the patient care pathway. The implementation of ANP was gradually achieved with the development of new evidenced-based health care procedures. The subsequent approval of a contract specification for advanced nurse practitioners facilitated the onset of a specific consultation, which facilitated a holistic approach. CONCLUSION: The impact of the implementation can be appreciated at different levels: i) the patient and his or her family, with improvement of communication and continuity of care; ii) the interdisciplinary team, with development of a dynamic and greater motivation of the health care providers; and iii) the profession, with a greater recognition of the competencies and conceptualization of the new role. An assessment of the process, the structure and the results should be carried out to validate the role of the advanced nurse practitioner throughout the long journey of a child with leukemia.","['Bovero, Maryline', 'Giacomo, Cristiano', 'Ansari, Marc', 'Roulin, Marie-Jose']","['Bovero M', 'Giacomo C', 'Ansari M', 'Roulin MJ']","[""Pediatric Oncology and Hematology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Geneva Children's Hospital, University Hospitals of Geneva, Rue Willy Donze, 6, Geneva, Switzerland.

Other groups have demonstrated that leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a cytokine that promotes neural cell survival through upregulation of antioxidant enzymes, promotes an anti-inflammatory phenotype in several types of immune cells. The goal of this study was to determine whether LIF treatment modulates the peripheral immune response after stroke. METHODS: Young male (3 month) Sprague-Dawley rats underwent sham surgery or permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Animals were administered LIF (125 mug/kg) or PBS at 6, 24, and 48 h prior to euthanization at 72 h. Bone marrow-derived macrophages were treated with LIF (20 ng/ml) or PBS after stimulation with interferon gamma + LPS. Western blot was used to measure protein levels of CD11b, IL-12, interferon inducible protein-10, CD3, and the LIF receptor in spleen and brain tissue. ELISA was used to measure IL-10, IL-12, and interferon gamma. Isolectin was used to label activated immune cells in brain tissue sections. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA and Student's t test. A Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Bonferroni-corrected Mann-Whitney tests was performed if data did not pass the D'Agostino-Pearson normality test. RESULTS: LIF-treated rats showed significantly lower levels of the LIF receptor and interferon gamma in the spleen and CD11b levels in the brain compared to their PBS-treated counterparts. Fluorescence from isolectin-binding immune cells was more prominent in the ipsilateral cortex and striatum after PBS treatment compared to LIF treatment. MCAO + LIF significantly decreased splenic levels of CD11b and CD3 compared to sham surgery. MCAO + PBS treatment significantly elevated splenic levels of interferon inducible protein-10 at 72 h after MCAO, while LIF treatment after MCAO returned interferon inducible protein 10 to sham levels. LIF administration with interferon gamma + LPS significantly reduced the IL-12/IL-10 production ratio compared to macrophages treated with interferon gamma + LPS alone. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that LIF promotes anti-inflammatory signaling through alterations of the IL-12/interferon gamma/interferon inducible protein 10 pathway.","['Davis, Stephanie M', 'Collier, Lisa A', 'Winford, Edric D', 'Leonardo, Christopher C', 'Ajmo, Craig T Jr', 'Foran, Elspeth A', 'Kopper, Timothy J', 'Gensel, John C', 'Pennypacker, Keith R']","['Davis SM', 'Collier LA', 'Winford ED', 'Leonardo CC', 'Ajmo CT Jr', 'Foran EA', 'Kopper TJ', 'Gensel JC', 'Pennypacker KR']","['Department of Neurology, University of Kentucky, 741 S.

With several reported miRNAs playing critical roles in spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), we aimed to explore the fundamental function of the highly conserved miR-34c in cryptorchidism. METHODS: To explore whether miR-34c participates in spermatogenesis by regulating Nanos2, we examined the effect of overexpression and inhibition for miR-34c on Nanos2 expression in GC-1 cells. Moreover, the expression levels of miR-34c and Nanos2 with cryptorchidism in humans and mice were examined. Furthermore, the homeostasis of SSCs was evaluated through counting the number of promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) positive spermatogonia in murine cryptorchid testes. RESULTS: In the present study, we show that miR-34c could inhibit the expression of Nanos2 in GC-1 cells. Meanwhile, miR-34c significantly decreased in both the testicular tissues of patients with cryptorchidism and surgery-induced murine model of cryptorchidism. Western blot revealed that the protein level of Nanos2 was up-regulated and showed to be negatively correlated to the expression of miR-34c in our model. The abnormal expression of miR-34c/Nanos2 disrupted the balance between SSC self-renewal and differentiation, eventually damaging the spermatogenesis of cryptorchid testes. CONCLUSIONS: The miR-34c/Nanos2 pathway provides new insight into the mechanism of male infertility caused by cryptorchidism. Our results indicate that miR-34c may serve as a biological marker for treatment of infertility caused by cryptorchidism.","['Huang, Zhenyu', 'Tang, Dongdong', 'Gao, Jingjing', 'Dou, Xianming', 'Cheng, Peng', 'Peng, Dangwei', 'Zhang, Yao', 'Mao, Jun', 'Zhang, Li', 'Zhang, Xiansheng']","['Huang Z', 'Tang D', 'Gao J', 'Dou X', 'Cheng P', 'Peng D', 'Zhang Y', 'Mao J', 'Zhang L', 'Zhang X']","['Department of Urology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, 230022, China.', 'Reproductive Medicine Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, 230022, China.', 'Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Reproductive Health and Genetics, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, 230032, China.', 'Anhui Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center for Biopreservation and Artificial Organs, Hefei, 230022, China.', 'Department of Urology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, 230022, China.', 'Department of Urology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, 230022, China.', 'Department of Urology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, 230022, China.', 'Department of Urology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, 230022, China.', 'Department of Urology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, 230022, China.', 'Department of Urology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, 230022, China.', 'Department of Urology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, 230022, China.', 'Department of Urology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, 230022, China. xiansheng-zhang@163.com.']",['eng'],['81370749/National Natural Science Foundation of China'],['Journal Article'],20181015,England,Reprod Biol Endocrinol,Reproductive biology and endocrinology : RB&E,101153627,"['0 (MIRN34a microRNA, mouse)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Nanos2 protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cryptorchidism/*genetics/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Homeostasis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Spermatogonia/*metabolism', 'Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Testis/*metabolism/pathology', 'Young Adult']",PMC6190564,['NOTNLM'],"['Cryptorchidism', 'Nanos2', 'Spermatogonial stem cell', 'miR-34c']",2018/10/17 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/10/17 06:00'],"['2018/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12958-018-0417-z [doi]', '10.1186/s12958-018-0417-z [pii]']",epublish,Reprod Biol Endocrinol. 2018 Oct 15;16(1):97. doi: 10.1186/s12958-018-0417-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: 46 AML patients were included in our research. ADAMTS-13 activity was measured before BMT. Their medical indicators were recorded one month after BMT. All the patients were followed up and their disease progression was evaluated afterwards. The medical indicators and prognosis situation were compared between Low ADAMTS13 Group (<481 ng/ml) and Normal Group (481-785 ng/ml) according to the reference range of local laboratory. ROC curves were used to evaluate the predictive value of ADAMTS13 for infection complications and survival. RESULTS: Low ADAMTS13 Group show extended APTT, PT and elevated CRP and D-Dimer levels, compared with Normal Group. Low ADAMTS13 Group suffered more BMT-related complications than Normal Group. In addition, Low ADAMTS13 Group underwent higher mortality than Normal Group in the one-year follow up after BMT and two-year follow up after onset of AML. ADAMTS13 has AUC of 0.7675, 0.7254, 0.8019 for lung infection, CMV infection and death within one year after BMT, suggesting that ADAMTS13 has predictive value for prognosis of AML patients after BMT. DISCUSSION: For patients with low ADAMTS13 activity, the prognosis was worse and the probability of serious complications and mortality was significantly higher than AML patients with normal ADAMTS13 activity, which suggest predictive role of ADAMTS13 activity for the prognosis of AML after BMT.

Children's environmental health is on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The incidence of childhood cancer is increasing worldwide and in Europe. Yet, the aetiology of most childhood cancers, including the role of environmental carcinogens, is still largely unknown. Contaminated areas, especially of industrial origin, are of high concern due to complex mix of hazardous pollutants and their potential health impacts on human populations, notably in children. OBJECTIVES: to describe cancer risk in children and young adults (YA) residing in national priority contaminated sites (NPCSs) in Italy and to provide a suitable framework for a development of cancer surveillance in industrially contaminated sites (ICSs) in Europe. METHODS: this study is based on a collaborative work of the Italian Institute of Health (ISS) and the Italian Association of Cancer Registries (AIRTUM), in the context of the SENTIERI project (Epidemiological study of residents in National Priority Contaminated Sites). Incidence rates were standardised according to the European standard population. The number of observed cases was compared to the expected cases derived from the age-, sex-, and cancer-specific incidence rates of the national pool of AIRTUM registries for the period 2006-2013. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed. The study reports the cancer profile in all combined 28 NPCSs covered by 22 cancer registries. RESULTS: 1,050 cases of malignant tumours (MTs) were recorded among 3,161,786 person-years in people aged 0-29 years in 28 NPCSs (SIR: 1.03; 90%CI 0.98-1.09), with an age-standardised incidence rate of 317 per million. Excess risks were observed for: MT of the central nervous system in the age-group <1 year (SIR: 3.2; 90%CI 1.4-6.3); soft tissue sarcoma in the age-group 0-14 years (SIR: 1.6; 90%CI 1.1-2.3); acute myeloid leukaemia in the agegroup 0-14 years (SIR: 1.7; 90%CI 1.1-2.4); non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the age-group 20-24 years (SIR 1.5; 90%CI 1.1-2.1), and germ cell tumours of male gonads in the age-group 20-29 years (SIR: 1.33; 90%CI 1.1-1.5). A deficit of cases was observed for Hodgkin lymphomas in the age-group 20-29 years (SIR 0.8; 90%CI 0.6-1.0). DISCUSSION: this study, which is based on standardized methods and accredited information sources, supports the hypothesis that living in an NPCS increases the risk of some cancer types in children and young adults. Further work will concern groups of NPCSs characterised by common sources of contamination/key carcinogenic pollutants. In fact, in a novel project proposal we aim to monitor the cancer profile in children living in ICSs in Europe. The new project, based on the SENTIERI-AIRTUM methodology, will build on the networking activities of the COST Action on Industrially Contaminated Sites and Health Networking (ICSHNet) and childhood cancer studies coordinated by the International Agency for research on Cancer (IARC).","['Iavarone, Ivano', 'Buzzoni, Carlotta', 'Stoppa, Giorgia', 'Steliarova-Foucher, Eva']","['Iavarone I', 'Buzzoni C', 'Stoppa G', 'Steliarova-Foucher E']","['Department of Environment and Health, Italian Institute of Health (ISS), Rome (Italy). ivano.iavarone@iss.it.', 'Clinical and Descriptive Epidemiology Unit, Oncological Network, Prevention, and Research Institute (ISPRO), Florence (Italy).', 'Clinical and Descriptive Epidemiology Unit, Oncological Network, Prevention, and Research Institute (ISPRO), Florence (Italy).', 'Section of Cancer Surveillance, International Agency for Research on Cancer, World Health Organization, Lyon (France).']",['eng'],"['001/World Health Organization/International', 'IS1408/COST Action - Industrially Contaminated Sites and Health Network (ICSHnet)']","['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,Italy,Epidemiol Prev,Epidemiologia e prevenzione,8902507,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Environmental Monitoring/methods', '*Environmental Pollution/adverse effects', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', '*Industry', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Internationality', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Young Adult']",,,,2018/10/17 06:00,2019/06/04 06:00,['2018/10/17 06:00'],"['2018/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.19191/EP18.5-6.S1.P076.090 [doi]', '4189 [pii]']",ppublish,Epidemiol Prev. 2018 Sep-Dec;42(5-6S1):76-85. doi: 10.19191/EP18.5-6.S1.P076.090.,,,,,,,['SENTIERI-AIRTUM Working Group'],,,,,,,,,,,,"['Ardizzone A', 'Barchielli A', 'Borciani E', 'Boschetti L', 'Brustolin A', 'Buzzoni C', 'Caiazzo M', 'Candela G', 'Carrozzi G', ""Cavalieri D'Oro L"", 'Cesaraccio R', 'Contiero P', 'Contrino ML', 'Coviello V', 'Falcini F', 'Fanetti AC', 'Ferretti S', 'Filiberti R', 'Galasso R', 'Giorno A', 'Grappasonni I', 'Magoni M', 'Mangone L', 'Mazzoleni G', 'Melcarne A', 'Michiara M', 'Minerba A', 'Pannozzo F', 'Piffer S', 'Pisani S', 'Ricci P', 'Rugge M', 'Russo AG', 'Sacerdote C', 'Sanpietro G', 'Sciacca S', 'Stoppa G', 'Stracci F', 'Sutera A', 'Tagliabue G', 'Tumino R', 'Usala M', 'Vitale F', 'Zanetti R']","['Ardizzone, Antonino', 'Barchielli, Alessandro', 'Borciani, Elisabetta', 'Boschetti, Lorenza', 'Brustolin, Angelita', 'Buzzoni, Carlotta', 'Caiazzo, Maria', 'Candela, Giuseppina', 'Carrozzi, Giuliano', ""Cavalieri D'Oro, Luca"", 'Cesaraccio, Rosaria', 'Contiero, Paolo', 'Contrino, Maria Lia', 'Coviello, Vincenzo', 'Falcini, Fabio', 'Fanetti, Anna Clara', 'Ferretti, Stefano', 'Filiberti, Rosa', 'Galasso, Rocco', 'Giorno, Anna', 'Grappasonni, Iolanda', 'Magoni, Michele', 'Mangone, Lucia', 'Mazzoleni, Guido', 'Melcarne, Anna', 'Michiara, Maria', 'Minerba, Aldo', 'Pannozzo, Fabio', 'Piffer, Silvano', 'Pisani, Salvatore', 'Ricci, Paolo', 'Rugge, Massimo', 'Russo, Antonio Giampiero', 'Sacerdote, Carlotta', 'Sanpietro, Giuseppe', 'Sciacca, Salvatore', 'Stoppa, Giorgia', 'Stracci, Fabrizio', 'Sutera, Antonella', 'Tagliabue, Giovanna', 'Tumino, Rosario', 'Usala, Mario', 'Vitale, Francesco', 'Zanetti, Roberto']","['Registro tumori Brindisi.', 'Registro tumori toscano.', 'Registro tumori Piacenza.', 'Registro tumori Pavia.', 'Registro tumori Viterbo.', 'Registro tumori toscano.', 'Istituto per lo studio, la prevenzione e la rete oncologica - ISPRO, Firenze.', 'Registro tumori Salerno.', 'Registro tumori Trapani.', 'Registro tumori Modena.', 'Registro tumori Monza Brianza.', 'Registro tumori Sassari.', 'Istituto nazionale dei tumori, Milano).', 'Registro tumori Siracusa.', 'Registro tumori Barletta.', 'Registro tumori Romagna.', 'Registro tumori Sondrio.', 'Registro tumori Ferrara.', 'Registro tumori Genova.', 'Registro tumori Basilicata.', 'Registro tumori Cosenza-Crotone.', 'Registro tumori infantili Marche.', 'Registro tumori Brescia.', 'Registro tumori Reggio Emilia.', 'Registro tumori Alto Adige.', 'Registro tumori Lecce.', 'Registro tumori Parma.', 'Registro tumori Taranto.', 'Registro tumori Latina.', 'Registro tumori Trento.', 'Registro tumori Como.', 'Registro tumori Mantova.', 'Registro tumori Veneto.', 'Registro tumori Milano.', 'Registro tumori infantili Piemonte.', 'Registro tumori Bergamo.', 'Registro tumori integrato Catania-Messina-Siracusa-Enna.', 'Registro tumori toscano.', 'Istituto per lo studio, la prevenzione e la rete oncologica - ISPRO, Firenze.', 'Registro tumori Umbria.', 'Registro tumori Catanzaro.', 'Registro tumori Varese.', 'Registro tumori Ragusa.', 'Registro tumori Nuoro.', 'Registro tumori Palermo.', 'Registro tumori del Piemonte, Province di Biella e Vercelli.']"

A causal bidirectional relationship exists between them. Loss of immunological tolerance with inappropriate activation of the immune system, likely due to environmental and genetic factors, can represent a breeding ground for the appearance of cancer cells and, on the other hand, blood cancers are characterized by imbalanced immune cell subsets that could support the development of the autoimmune clone. Considerable effort has been made for understanding the proteins that have a relevant role in both processes; however, literature advances demonstrate that microRNAs (miRNAs) surface as the epigenetic regulators of those proteins and control networks linked to both autoimmunity and hematological malignancies. Here we review the most up-to-date findings regarding the miRNA-based molecular mechanisms that underpin autoimmunity and hematological malignancies.","['Di Marco, Mirco', 'Ramassone, Alice', 'Pagotto, Sara', 'Anastasiadou, Eleni', 'Veronese, Angelo', 'Visone, Rosa']","['Di Marco M', 'Ramassone A', 'Pagotto S', 'Anastasiadou E', 'Veronese A', 'Visone R']","['Ageing Research Center and Translational medicine-CeSI-MeT, 66100 Chieti, Italy. dmamirco@gmail.com.', 'Department of Medical, Oral and Biotechnological Sciences (DSMOB), ""G. d\'Annunzio"" University Chieti-Pescara, 66100 Chieti, Italy. dmamirco@gmail.com.', 'Ageing Research Center and Translational medicine-CeSI-MeT, 66100 Chieti, Italy. alice.ramassone@unich.it.', 'Department of Medical, Oral and Biotechnological Sciences (DSMOB), ""G. d\'Annunzio"" University Chieti-Pescara, 66100 Chieti, Italy. alice.ramassone@unich.it.', 'Ageing Research Center and Translational medicine-CeSI-MeT, 66100 Chieti, Italy. sara.pagotto@unich.it.', 'Department of Medical, Oral and Biotechnological Sciences (DSMOB), ""G. d\'Annunzio"" University Chieti-Pescara, 66100 Chieti, Italy. sara.pagotto@unich.it.', 'Harvard Medical School Initiative for RNA Medicine, Department of Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA. elenasta@gmail.com.', 'Ageing Research Center and Translational medicine-CeSI-MeT, 66100 Chieti, Italy. a.veronese@unich.it.', 'Department of Medicine and Aging Science (DMSI), ""G. d\'Annunzio"" University Chieti-Pescara, 66100 Chieti, Italy. a.veronese@unich.it.', 'Ageing Research Center and Translational medicine-CeSI-MeT, 66100 Chieti, Italy. r.visone@unich.it.', 'Department of Medical, Oral and Biotechnological Sciences (DSMOB), ""G. d\'Annunzio"" University Chieti-Pescara, 66100 Chieti, Italy. r.visone@unich.it.']",['eng'],['AIRC IG 2015-17782/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro/International'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20181012,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['*Autoimmunity', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics']",PMC6213554,['NOTNLM'],"['*autoimmunity', '*leukemia', '*lymphoma', '*microRNAs']",2018/10/17 06:00,2019/01/15 06:00,['2018/10/17 06:00'],"['2018/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms19103139 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms19103139 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2018 Oct 12;19(10). pii: ijms19103139. doi: 10.3390/ijms19103139.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Emodin is an active component of Chinese herbs, and is effective against leukemia, lung cancer, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, and HCC; however, the sensitizing effect of emodin on sorafenib-based HCC therapy has not been evaluated. Here, we demonstrate that emodin significantly improved the anti-cancer effect of sorafenib in HCC cells, such as HepG2, Hep3B, Huh7, SK-HEP-1, and PLC/PRF5. Mechanistically, emodin inhibits sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) transcriptional activity, which suppresses cholesterol biosynthesis and oncogenic protein kinase B (AKT) signaling. Additionally, attenuated cholesterol synthesis and oncogenic AKT signaling inactivated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), an oncogenic transcription factor. Furthermore, emodin synergistically increased cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase and apoptotic cells in the presence of sorafenib. Animal models xenografted with HepG2 or SK-HEP-1 cells also showed that the combination of emodin and sorafenib was sufficient to inhibit tumor growth. Overall, these results suggested that the combination of emodin and sorafenib may offer a potential therapy for patients with advanced HCC.","['Kim, Young-Seon', 'Lee, Yoon-Mi', 'Oh, Taek-In', 'Shin, Dong Hoon', 'Kim, Geon-Hee', 'Kan, Sang-Yeon', 'Kang, Hyeji', 'Kim, Ji Hyung', 'Kim, Byeong Mo', 'Yim, Woo Jong', 'Lim, Ji-Hong']","['Kim YS', 'Lee YM', 'Oh TI', 'Shin DH', 'Kim GH', 'Kan SY', 'Kang H', 'Kim JH', 'Kim BM', 'Yim WJ', 'Lim JH']","['Department of Biomedical Chemistry, College of Biomedical & Health Science, Konkuk University, Chungju 27478, Chungbuk, Korea. yskim0801@kku.ac.kr.', 'Department of Food Bioscience, College of Biomedical & Health Science, Konkuk University, Chungju 27478, Chungbuk, Korea. yoonmilee@kku.ac.kr.', 'Department of Biomedical Chemistry, College of Biomedical & Health Science, Konkuk University, Chungju 27478, Chungbuk, Korea. dk1050@kku.ac.kr.', 'Research Institute, National Cancer Center, Department of Cancer Biomedical Science, National Cancer Center Graduate School of Cancer Science and Policy, Goyang 10408, Korea. dhshin@ncc.re.kr.', 'Department of Biomedical Chemistry, College of Biomedical & Health Science, Konkuk University, Chungju 27478, Chungbuk, Korea. rlarjsgml4@kku.ac.kr.', 'Department of Biomedical Chemistry, College of Biomedical & Health Science, Konkuk University, Chungju 27478, Chungbuk, Korea. hsb6477@kku.ac.kr.', 'Department of Biomedical Chemistry, College of Biomedical & Health Science, Konkuk University, Chungju 27478, Chungbuk, Korea. kkang@kku.ac.kr.', 'College of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul 02841, Korea. jay_kim@korea.ac.kr.', 'Severance Integrative Research Institute for Cerebral & Cardiovascular Diseases (SIRIC), Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul 03722, Korea. bkim2@yuhs.ac.', 'Jung-Ang Microbe Research Institute (JM), 398, Jikji-daero, Heungdeok-gu, Cheongju 28576, Chungbuk, Korea. ywj0808@naver.com.', 'Department of Biomedical Chemistry, College of Biomedical & Health Science, Konkuk University, Chungju 27478, Chungbuk, Korea. jhlim@kku.ac.kr.', 'Diabetes and Bio-Research Center, Konkuk University, Chungju 27478, Chungbuk, Korea. jhlim@kku.ac.kr.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181012,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (SREBF2 protein, human)', '0 (Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 2)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'KA46RNI6HN (Emodin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cholesterol/*metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Emodin/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sorafenib/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 2/genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC6213641,['NOTNLM'],"['cholesterol', 'combination', 'emodin', 'hepatocellular carcinoma', 'sorafenib']",2018/10/17 06:00,2019/01/15 06:00,['2018/10/17 06:00'],"['2018/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/01 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms19103127 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms19103127 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2018 Oct 12;19(10). pii: ijms19103127. doi: 10.3390/ijms19103127.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-0582-3132'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The utility of BM core biopsy in the workup of patients with CML has been questioned. METHODS: The potential added value of BM biopsy versus aspiration in the workup of a single-institution series of 508 patients with CML at their initial presentation was systematically assessed. BM biopsy was considered essential when it was needed to establish the disease phase, often because blast counts derived from aspirate smears were misleading because the biopsy specimen was more representative of the disease. BM biopsy was considered helpful if it was needed for other nonessential reasons. RESULTS: In 127 patients (25%), BM biopsy was either essential (109 patients) or helpful (18 patients). Patients with accelerated-phase (AP) or blast-phase (BP) disease often required a biopsy related to essential reasons. High-grade myelofibrosis (MF) was more frequent in patients with AP/BP disease than patients with chronic-phase disease (P = .0005), and the identification of BP disease required a BM biopsy assessment in 75% of the patients (P = .001). A follow-up BM evaluation more often yielded inadequate aspirates in patients with inadequate BM aspirates at the time of their initial diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: BM core biopsy remains valuable in the workup of 25% of patients with CML because it facilitates identification of the disease phase or MF. The initial grade of MF is associated with the disease stage and outcome after therapy. BM biopsy is, therefore, indicated for patients with CML who have AP/BP disease or other findings suggestive of progressive disease.","['Hidalgo-Lomicronpez, Juliana E', 'Kanagal-Shamanna, Rashmi', 'Quesada, Andres E', 'Gong, Zimu', 'Wang, Wei', 'Hu, Shimin', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Bassett, Roland L Jr', ""d'Orcy, Elizabeth"", 'Yin, C Cameron', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Jabbour, Elias J', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E']","['Hidalgo-Lomicronpez JE', 'Kanagal-Shamanna R', 'Quesada AE', 'Gong Z', 'Wang W', 'Hu S', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Bassett RL Jr', ""d'Orcy E"", 'Yin CC', 'Cortes J', 'Jabbour EJ', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Bueso-Ramos CE']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Departament of Hematology, Metropolitan Hospital Complex, Dr. Arnulfo Arias Madrid, Panama City, Panama.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",20181015,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination/methods', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR-ABL', '*accelerated phase', '*blast phase', '*bone marrow biopsy', '*chronic myeloid leukemia']",2018/10/16 06:00,2019/09/24 06:00,['2018/10/16 06:00'],"['2017/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/14 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/24 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.31663 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2018 Oct 1;124(19):3849-3855. doi: 10.1002/cncr.31663.

Their broad anti-cancer activity against different types of cancers makes them outstanding candidates for cancer immunotherapy. An issue of recent interest is whether their antigen presentation features are similar to mature dendritic cells. The antigen-presenting cell (APC)-like phenotype and function of gammadelta T lymphocytes have been confirmed in many clinical trials. In this study, to support the strong role played by Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells against cancer, we provide evidence that Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells activated with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell lysate antigens can efficiently express an APC phenotype and function. Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells derived from normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells were activated with tumor cell lysate, and the tumor-activated Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells could recognize and kill CML through their cytotoxic activity. In conclusion, the Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells activated by cancer cell lysate showed APC characteristics, and this may greatly increase interest in investigating their therapeutic potential in hematologic malignancies.

It is important to immediately distinguish if it is a benign or malignant leukocytosis and the analysis of the blood formula is the first step. The presence of abnormal cells such as blast cells is an alarm which must immediately consider the diagnosis of leukemia, and medullogram has to be performed. The presence of lymphoma cells will lead to the conclusion of lymphoproliferative disorder and the presence of myeloid precursors to a myeloproliferative disorder. However, a benign leukemoid reaction should be excluded. If there are no abnormal cells in the differential count, it will be necessary to distinguish hyperleucocytosis from myeloid origin (neutrophilies, eosinophilies, basophilies) from lymphoid origin. In the latter case, it is the lymphocytic phenotype that will confirm the malignancy by the presence of a clone of T or B lymphocytes but also by the monomorphic appearance of lymphocytes. In cytologically pleomorphic lymphocytosis, lymphoid reactions related to viral infections, autoimmune diseases or drug-related lymphoid reactions will be sought.

FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) mutations located in juxtamembrane domain (JMD) and tyrosine kinase domain 1 (TKD1) regions account for two-thirds of all FLT3 mutations. The outcome of patients remains unsatisfactory, with low survival rates. It is not yet known whether the different mutations within the FLT3 gene are all associated with patient outcome. In addition, the cause of FLT3-ITD in-frame duplication events remains unknown. Although there are some published studies investigating the FLT3-ITD mutation and its clinical implications in Chinese acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, sample sizes tend to be small and detailed molecular profiles of FLT3 mutations are lacking in these studies. In our study, 227 FLT3-ITD sequences were analyzed from 227 Chinese de novo AML patients. ITD were next classified into 3 types based on molecular profiles of insertion DNA sequences: DNA complete duplication (type I), DNA partial duplication (type II) and complete random sequence (type III). From the 154 patients, we confirmed that high ITD allelic ratio (>/=.5) and allogeneic stem cell transplant treatment under CR1 are independent prognostic factors. We also presented evidence that ITD integration sites in the hinge region or beta1-sheet region are an unfavorable prognostic factor in adult AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutations. These findings may help to decipher the mechanisms of FLT3-ITD in-frame duplication events and stratify patients when considering different therapeutic combinations.","['Liu, Song-Bai', 'Qiu, Qiao-Cheng', 'Bao, Xie-Bing', 'Ma, Xiao', 'Li, Hong-Zhi', 'Liu, Yue-Jun', 'Chen, Su-Ning', 'Song, Yao-Hua', 'Wu, De-Pei', 'Xue, Sheng-Li']","['Liu SB', 'Qiu QC', 'Bao XB', 'Ma X', 'Li HZ', 'Liu YJ', 'Chen SN', 'Song YH', 'Wu DP', 'Xue SL']","['Suzhou Key Laboratory of Medical Biotechnology, Suzhou Vocational Health College, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Suzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['81470296, 81500146, 31701198/National Natural Science Foundation of China', 'QNRC2016719/Jiangsu Provincial Medical Youth Talent Program', 'QNRC2016771/Jiangsu Provincial Medical Youth Talent Program', 'BK20170386/Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China', 'BK20150356/Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China', '2016-WSN-123/C class sponsored project of Jiangsu provincial Six Talent Peaks', 'szwzy201701/Key Programs of the Suzhou Vocational health college', 'China National Clinical Key Subject Project']",['Journal Article'],20181114,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'China', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Domains', 'Remission Induction', 'Sample Size', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Survival Analysis', '*Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*chemistry/*genetics']",PMC6272103,['NOTNLM'],"['FLT3-ITD', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'insertion sites', 'kinase activity', 'prognostic value']",2018/10/16 06:00,2019/01/03 06:00,['2018/10/16 06:00'],"['2018/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/03 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/03 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.13835 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2018 Dec;109(12):3981-3992. doi: 10.1111/cas.13835.

Our previous study has shown that SRSF1 potentially contributes to leukemogenesis; however, its underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, leukemic cells were isolated from pediatric ALL bone marrow samples, followed by immunoprecipitation assays and mass spectrometry analysis specific to SRSF1. Subcellular localization of the SRSF1 protein and its mutants were analyzed by immunofluorescence staining. Cell growth, colony formation, cell apoptosis, and the cell cycle were investigated using stable leukemic cell lines generated with lentivirus-mediated overexpressed WT or mutant plasmids. Cytotoxicity of the Tie2 kinase inhibitor was also evaluated. Our results showed the phosphorylation of SRSF1 at tyrosine 19 (Tyr-19) was identified in newly diagnosed ALL samples, but not in complete remission or normal control samples. Compared to the SRSF1 WT cells, the missense mutants of the Tyr-19 phosphorylation affected the subcellular localization of SRSF1. In addition, the Tyr-19 phosphorylation of SRSF1 also led to increased cell proliferation and enhanced colony-forming properties by promoting the cell cycle. Remarkably, we further identified the kinase Tie2 as a potential therapeutic target in leukemia cells. In conclusion, we identify for the first time that the phosphorylation state of SRSF1 is linked to different phases in pediatric ALL. The Tyr-19 phosphorylation of SRSF1 disrupts its subcellular localization and promotes proliferation in leukemia cells by driving cell-cycle progression. Inhibitors targeting Tie2 kinase that could catalyze Tyr-19 phosphorylation of SRSF1 offer a promising therapeutic target for treatment of pediatric ALL.","['Xu, Liting', 'Zhang, Han', 'Mei, Mei', 'Du, Chaohao', 'Huang, Xiahe', 'Li, Jing', 'Wang, Yingchun', 'Bao, Shilai', 'Zheng, Huyong']","['Xu L', 'Zhang H', 'Mei M', 'Du C', 'Huang X', 'Li J', 'Wang Y', 'Bao S', 'Zheng H']","[""Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education, Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Center for Children's Health, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education, Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Center for Children's Health, Beijing, China."", 'Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education, Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Center for Children's Health, Beijing, China."", 'Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education, Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Center for Children's Health, Beijing, China.""]",['eng'],"['No. 2016-1-2091/Capital Health and Development of Special Grants', 'No. ZY201404/Beijing Municipal Administration of Hospitals Clinical Medicine', 'Development of Special Grant', 'No. DFL20151101/Beijing Municipal Administration of Hospitals DengFeng Program']",['Journal Article'],20181114,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (SRSF1 protein, human)', '170974-22-8 (Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mutation', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism']",PMC6272096,['NOTNLM'],"['Tie2 kinase', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'childhood', 'splicing factor SRSF1', 'tyrosine phosphorylation']",2018/10/16 06:00,2019/01/03 06:00,['2018/10/16 06:00'],"['2018/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/21 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/03 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.13834 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2018 Dec;109(12):3805-3815. doi: 10.1111/cas.13834.

Valproic acid (VPA) is a recently emerged antineoplastic histone deacetylase inhibitor. The aim of the present study is to investigate the synergistic role of oridonin and VPA to inhibit the growth and metastasis of human leukemia cells. METHODS: The effect of oridonin and VPA on proliferation was evaluated by the MTT assay. Cell migration and invasion were evaluated by transwell and scratch assays, respectively. In addition, cell apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry. The inhibitive effects of oridonin and VPA in vivo were determined by using xenografted nude mice. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that oridonin in combination with VPA synergistically inhibited the proliferation of HL-60 cells, and induced obvious caspase-dependent apoptosis through activation of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, which is involved in the downregulation of Bcl-2/Bax ratio. Furthermore, the combination treatment in vivo remarkably reduced the xenograft tumor size and triggered tumor cell apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that the novel combination of oridonin plus VPA exerted synergistic antiproliferative and apoptosis-inducing effects on human myeloid leukemia cells, and may serve as a potentially promising antileukemia strategy.","['Li, Wei', 'Ma, LiEn']","['Li W', 'Ma L']","[""Department of hematology, Hunan Province People's Hospital, Changsha, Hunan, China."", ""Department of hematology, Hunan Province People's Hospital, Changsha, Hunan, China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181015,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Diterpenes, Kaurane)', '0APJ98UCLQ (oridonin)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Diterpenes, Kaurane/agonists/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Valproic Acid/agonists/*pharmacology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Notch signaling pathway', '*cell apoptosis', '*leukemia', '*oridonin', '*valproic acid (VPA)']",2018/10/16 06:00,2020/07/09 06:00,['2018/10/16 06:00'],"['2018/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/09 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.27845 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2019 Apr;120(4):5620-5627. doi: 10.1002/jcb.27845.

Mature T cells in the graft crucially mediate a graft versus leukemia (GvL) response, but also attack healthy tissues in the recipient leading to potentially life-threatening acute graft versus host disease. Using inducible CD28 knockout C57BL/6 mice as T-cell donors, we have now assessed whether CD28 costimulation of donor CD4(+) and/ or CD8(+) T cells is required for an efficient GvL effect after allogeneic T-cell transplantation into BALB/c recipients. Our results show that CD28 costimulation of donor CD8(+) cytotoxic, but not CD4(+) helper, T cells was dispensable for curing mice from the BCL-1 lymphoma. Therefore, donor lymphocyte infusion treated lymphoma-bearing BALB/c recipient mice showed enhanced long-term survival when receiving CD28-deficient as compared to wild-type donor CD8(+) T cells together with wild-type conventional and regulatory CD4(+) T cells. The same was observed when donor CD8(+) and conventional and regulatory CD4(+) T cells were CD28 deficient. Our data, thus, suggest that systemic CD28 blockade, for example, with the drug FR104 might also reduce acute graft versus host disease in patients after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, while maintaining the protective GvL response.","['Uri, Anna', 'Luhder, Fred', 'Kerkau, Thomas', 'Beyersdorf, Niklas']","['Uri A', 'Luhder F', 'Kerkau T', 'Beyersdorf N']","['Institute for Virology and Immunobiology, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Institute for Neuroimmunology and Multiple Sclerosis Research, University Medical Center Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology and Immunobiology, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology and Immunobiology, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181114,Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (CD28 Antigens)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'CD28 Antigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/transplantation', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/transplantation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin D1/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Lymphoma/*immunology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute graft versus host disease', '*CD28 costimulation', '*CD4+ T cells', '*CD8+ T cells', '*Graft versus leukemia effect']",2018/10/16 06:00,2019/05/23 06:00,['2018/10/16 06:00'],"['2018/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/02 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/23 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.201847669 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2018 Dec;48(12):2055-2067. doi: 10.1002/eji.201847669.

Here, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of the combination of the Bcl-2 antagonist ABT-199 and cytotoxic agent gemcitabine in T-ALL cell lines. Our results showed that the combination of ABT-199 and gemcitabine exhibited synergistic cytotoxicity and induced significant apoptosis in human T-ALL cell lines (Jurkat and Molt4). The augmented apoptosis induced by combination treatment was accompanied by the greater extent of mitochondrial depolarization and enhanced DNA damage. Importantly, single agent induced DNA damage alone but did not inhibit RAD51/BRCA1-mediated repair for DNA double-strand breaks. In contrast, the combination of ABT-199 and gemcitabine disrupted RAD51/BRCA1-dependent DNA repair and remarkably activated caspase-3 and PARP to trigger apoptosis. Moreover, ABT-199 exerted an antagonistic action towards Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, but to a certain extent moderately increased Mcl-1 level that could be compromised by gemcitabine. In conclusion, our study showed that the combination of ABT-199 and gemcitabine exhibited synergistic cytotoxicity in T-ALL cells by cooperatively targeting DNA damage repair pathway and Bcl-2 family proteins.","['Xiufeng, Zhu', 'Haijun, Zhao', 'Silei, Bi', 'Manman, Deng', 'Yong, Zhou', 'Lian, Yu', 'Zhihong, Fang', 'Bing, Xu']","['Xiufeng Z', 'Haijun Z', 'Silei B', 'Manman D', 'Yong Z', 'Lian Y', 'Zhihong F', 'Bing X']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, Medical College of Xiamen University, Xiamen.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, Medical College of Xiamen University, Xiamen.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, Medical College of Xiamen University, Xiamen.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, Medical College of Xiamen University, Xiamen.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, Medical College of Xiamen University, Xiamen.', ""Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Longyan First Hospital Affiliated to Fujian Medical University, Longyan, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, Medical College of Xiamen University, Xiamen.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, Medical College of Xiamen University, Xiamen.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/administration & dosage', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Proliferation', '*DNA Damage', '*DNA Repair', 'Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', '*Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Sulfonamides/administration & dosage', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,,2018/10/16 06:00,2020/09/15 06:00,['2018/10/16 06:00'],"['2018/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/15 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/CAD.0000000000000702 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2019 Feb;30(2):138-148. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0000000000000702.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to the well-known effects on blocking myeloid differentiation at the promyelocytic stage, promyelocytic leukaemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML-RARalpha) has also been reported to interfere with multiple differentiation processes, including erythroid differentiation. However, the detailed molecular mechanism by which PML-RARalpha impairs erythropoiesis has not yet been fully addressed. By chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR assay, we found that PML-RARalpha bound to the distal promoter region of LMO2 (LIM-only protein 2), a critical erythroid-specific transcription factor. Luciferase reporter assays and qRT-PCR results demonstrated that PML-RARalpha down-regulated the expression of the LMO2 distal transcript through transrepressing its promoter activity. Analysis of gene expression profiling data from large cohorts of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients confirmed that LMO2 expressed at a markedly lower level in APL patients in comparison to non-APL AML patients. Further flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that PML-RARalpha inhibited erythropoietin-induced erythroid differentiation by down-regulating LMO2 expression. Our findings reveal a previously unidentified mechanism, by which PML-RARalpha interferes with erythropoiesis through directly targeting and transrepressing LMO2 expression in the development of APL.","['Yang, Xianwen', 'Tan, Yun', 'Wang, Ping', 'Zhang, Hui', 'Zhao, Ming', 'Zhao, Xujie', 'Wang, Kankan']","['Yang X', 'Tan Y', 'Wang P', 'Zhang H', 'Zhao M', 'Zhao X', 'Wang K']","['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics and Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Sino-French Research Center for Life Sciences and Genomics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181015,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Erythropoiesis/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'LIM Domain Proteins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",PMC6237603,['NOTNLM'],"['*LMO2', '*PML-RARalpha', '*acute promyelocytic leukaemia', '*erythropoiesis']",2018/10/16 06:00,2019/11/02 06:00,['2018/10/16 06:00'],"['2018/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/06 00:00 [revised]', '2018/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/02 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jcmm.13917 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2018 Dec;22(12):6275-6284. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.13917.

The Hippo pathway is a novelsignaling pathway that regulates organ size, cell proliferation, apoptosis and tumorigenesis. The chief component of this pathway is the transducer yesassociated protein (YAP) which is overexpressed in numerous categories of tumors. However, little is known about the effect of YAP in hematological malignancies. In the present study, YAP expression was screened in several leukemia and lymphoma cell lines, and high YAP expression was demonstrated in Jurkat cells. To further unravel its effect on the biological behavior of Jurkat cells, lentivirus transduced short hairpin RNA (shRNA) technique was used to silence YAP. As expected, the YAPspecific shRNA dramatically inhibited YAP expression at the mRNA and protein levels. Reduced leukemia cell proliferation and increased cell apoptosis were demonstrated in YAP knockdown Jurkat cells. It was also demonstrated that YAP knockdown resulted in deregulated expression of a cluster of downstream genes crucial to cell proliferation or apoptosis, including protein kinase B, Bcell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) and BCL2 like protein 1. Consequently, the results of the present study established that suppression of YAP expression serves an important role in Jurkat cell proliferation and apoptosis, which may serve as a potential therapeutic target.","['Wu, Ran', 'Yang, Hui', 'Wan, Jiangbo', 'Deng, Xiaohui', 'Chen, Linjun', 'Hao, Siguo', 'Ma, Liyuan']","['Wu R', 'Yang H', 'Wan J', 'Deng X', 'Chen L', 'Hao S', 'Ma L']","['Department of Hematology, Xinhua Hospital, Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200092, P.R.

Dysregulated miRNAs serve crucial roles in the formation and progression of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Therefore, the roles of differentially expressed miRNAs in AML require extensive investigation to obtain insight into the treatment of patients with AML. The present study demonstrated significant miR3395p downregulation in AML samples and cell lines. miR3395p overexpression attenuated AML cell proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest and promoting cell apoptosis. Additionally, sexdetermining region Yrelated highmobility group box 4 (SOX4) was identified as a direct target gene of miR3395p in AML. Furthermore, SOX4 expression was significantly upregulated in AML samples; this upregulation was inversely correlated with the expression levels of miR3395p. Additionally, a series of rescue experiments demonstrated that SOX4 resumption reversed the effects of miR3395p overexpression on cell proliferation, cycle status and apoptosis of AML. In conclusion, miR3395p may serve its antiproliferative role in AML by directly targeting SOX4, which suggests that miR3395p may be considered an effective novel therapeutic target for treating patients with such an aggressive haematological malignancy.","['Sun, Xueming', 'Liu, Huaqiang', 'Li, Tingting', 'Qin, Laiying']","['Sun X', 'Liu H', 'Li T', 'Qin L']","['Department of Hematology, Yidu Central Hospital of Weifang, Weifang, Shandong 262550, P.R.

In addition, some known risk factors in PNMPNs that may influence survival and therapeutic response to hydroxyurea (HU) were analyzed, taking into account three items: Disease progression, predisposition to new nonmyeloid neoplasms and thrombotic events. The present study involved a total of 133 Caucasian Portuguese PNMPNs patients treated with HU, whereby 17 cases showed progression to myelofibrosis/leukemia, 11 developed new nonmyeloid neoplasms and 22 presented with thrombotic events. Progression to secondary myelofibrosis/leukemia is influenced by exposure to cytoreductive agents, and caspase and BER polymorphisms {globally, CASP8 3'untranslated region [odds ratio (OR)=0.24; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.080.69], XRCC1 Arg194Trp [OR=3.58; 95% CI, 0.9813.01]; for essential thrombocythemia patients CASP9 Arg173His [OR=11.27; 95% CI, 1.13112.28], APEX1 Asp148Glu [OR=0.28; 95% CI, 0.741.03], and XRCC1 Arg194Trp [OR=6.60; 95% CI, 1.6027.06]}.

Larger studies are required to confirm these results, and to provide conclusive evidence of association between these and other variants with PNMPNs therapeutic response and clinical evolution. However, this study may allow the development of drugs more directly targeted to the pathophysiology of the disease, with high efficacy, fewer adverse effects, contributing to compliance of patients with treatments.

Nanoparticles <100 nm are thought to invade the trachea and lungs to cause inflammation, possibly through the activation of macrophages. On the other hand, titanium dioxide (TiO2) particles can be used in models of nanomicrosized particles, as one can prepare the particles with such sizes. TiO2 particles are classified into Rutile, Anatase, and Brookite types by their crystal structure. Among them, Anatasetype TiO2 particles with a primary diameter of 50 nm (A50) were reported to induce interleukin (IL)1beta production and secretion effectively in phorbol 12myristate 13acetatetreated human monocytic leukemia THP1 cells (THP1 macrophages). We previously designed and synthesized dehydroxymethylepoxyqinomicin (DHMEQ) as an inhibitor of NFkappaB. The present study investigated whether the NFkappaB inhibitor DHMEQ inhibits TiO2 nanoparticleinduced IL1beta production in THP1 macrophages, and determined the mechanism. As a result, DHMEQ inhibited A50induced IL1beta secretion in ELISA assays at nontoxic concentrations. It decreased the expression of IL1beta mRNA, which was dependent on NFkappaB. Although NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3)inflammasomecaspase1 activation is required for the maturation of IL1beta, and DHMEQ reduced the NLRP3 mRNA expression and caspase1 activity; a caspase1 inhibitor did not influence the A50induced IL1beta production. Therefore, it is likely that inhibition of proIL1beta expression by DHMEQ may be sufficient to inhibit mature IL1beta production. Thus, DHMEQ may be useful for the amelioration of inflammation in the trachea and lungs caused by inhalation of PM2.5.","['Fukatsu, Hitomi', 'Koide, Naoki', 'Tada-Oikawa, Saeko', 'Izuoka, Kiyora', 'Ikegami, Akihiko', 'Ichihara, Sahoko', 'Ukaji, Tamami', 'Morita, Naoko', 'Naiki, Yoshikazu', 'Komatsu, Takayuki', 'Umezawa, Kazuo']","['Fukatsu H', 'Koide N', 'Tada-Oikawa S', 'Izuoka K', 'Ikegami A', 'Ichihara S', 'Ukaji T', 'Morita N', 'Naiki Y', 'Komatsu T', 'Umezawa K']","['Department of Molecular Target Medicine, Aichi Medical University, Nagakute, Aichi 4801195, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Aichi Medical University, Nagakute, Aichi 4801195, Japan.', 'School of Life Studies, Sugiyama Jogakuen University, Nagoya, Aichi 4648662, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Regional Innovation Studies, Mie University, Tsu, Mie 5148507, Japan.', 'Department of Environmental and Preventive Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Shimotsuke, Tochigi 3290498, Japan.', 'Department of Environmental and Preventive Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Shimotsuke, Tochigi 3290498, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Aichi Medical University, Nagakute, Aichi 4801195, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Aichi Medical University, Nagakute, Aichi 4801195, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Aichi Medical University, Nagakute, Aichi 4801195, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Aichi Medical University, Nagakute, Aichi 4801195, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Target Medicine, Aichi Medical University, Nagakute, Aichi 4801195, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181003,Greece,Mol Med Rep,Molecular medicine reports,101475259,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cyclohexanones)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Particulate Matter)', '0 (dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin)', '15FIX9V2JP (titanium dioxide)', 'D1JT611TNE (Titanium)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Biomarkers', 'Caspase 1/metabolism', 'Caspase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclohexanones/*pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Interleukin-1beta/*biosynthesis', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors', '*Nanoparticles/chemistry', 'Particulate Matter', 'Potassium/metabolism', '*Titanium/chemistry']",,,,2018/10/16 06:00,2019/01/29 06:00,['2018/10/16 06:00'],"['2018/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/29 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/mmr.2018.9533 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Med Rep. 2018 Dec;18(6):5279-5285. doi: 10.3892/mmr.2018.9533.

On one hand, it regulates cellular energy sources by ""cannibalization"" of its own cellular components, feeding on proteins and other unused cytoplasmic factors. On the other, it is a recycling process that removes dangerous waste from the cytoplasm keeping the cell clean and healthy. Failure of the autophagic machinery is translated in dysfunction of the immune response, in aging, and in the progression of pathologies such as Parkinson disease, diabetes, and cancer. Further investigation identified autophagy with a protective role in specific types of cancer, whereas in other cases it can promote tumorigenesis. Evidence shows that treatment with chemotherapeutics can upregulate autophagy in order to maintain a stable intracellular environment promoting drug resistance and cell survival. Leukemia, a blood derived cancer, represents one of the malignancies in which autophagy is responsible for drug treatment failure. Inhibition of autophagy is becoming a strategic target for leukemic stem cell (LSC) eradication. Interestingly, the latest findings demonstrate that LSCs show higher levels of mitochondrial metabolism compared to normal stem cells. With this review, we aim to explore the links between autophagy and metabolism in the hematopoietic system, with special focus on primitive LSCs.","['Ianniciello, Angela', 'Rattigan, Kevin M', 'Helgason, G Vignir']","['Ianniciello A', 'Rattigan KM', 'Helgason GV']","['Wolfson Wohl Cancer Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Wolfson Wohl Cancer Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Wolfson Wohl Cancer Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180926,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,,,PMC6169402,['NOTNLM'],"['HSCs', 'LSCs', 'autophagy', 'metabolism', 'mitophagy', 'quiescence']",2018/10/16 06:00,2018/10/16 06:01,['2018/10/16 06:00'],"['2018/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/16 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2018.00120 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2018 Sep 26;6:120. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2018.00120. eCollection 2018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In CLL, the targeting of B-cell receptor signaling through a Burton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor (ibrutinib) has rendered outstanding clinical results. However, complete remission is not guaranteed due to drug resistance or relapse, revealing the need for novel approaches for CLL treatment. The characterization of metabolic rewiring in proliferative cancer cells is already being applied for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, but our knowledge of quiescent cell metabolism-relevant for CLL cells-is still fragmentary. Recently, we reported that glutamine metabolism in primary CLL cells bearing the del11q deletion is different from their del11q negative counterparts, making del11q cells especially sensitive to glutaminase and glycolysis inhibitors. In this work, we used our primary CLL lymphocyte bank and compounds interfering with central carbon metabolism to define metabolic traits associated with ibrutinib resistance. We observe a differential basal metabolite uptake linked to ibrutinib resistance, favoring glutamine uptake and catabolism. Upon ibrutinib treatment, the redox balance in ibrutinib resistant cells is shifted toward NADPH accumulation, without an increase in glutamine uptake, suggesting alternative metabolic rewiring such as the activation of fatty acid oxidation. In accordance to this idea, the curtailing of fatty acid oxidation by CPT1 inhibition (etomoxir) re-sensitized resistant cells to ibrutinib. Our results suggest that fatty acid oxidation could be explored as a target to overcome ibrutinib resistance.","['Galicia-Vazquez, Gabriela', 'Aloyz, Raquel']","['Galicia-Vazquez G', 'Aloyz R']","['Segal Cancer Center, Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Division of Experimental Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Segal Cancer Center, Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Division of Experimental Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Oncology, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180926,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC6168640,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'del17p', 'drug resistance', 'fatty acid oxidation', 'ibrutinib', 'metabolism']",2018/10/16 06:00,2018/10/16 06:01,['2018/10/16 06:00'],"['2018/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/16 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2018.00411 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2018 Sep 26;8:411. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2018.00411. eCollection 2018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LY2510924, a second generation CXCR4, showed significant anti-leukemia activity in a murine AML model. Methods: We conducted a phase I study to determine the safety and toxicity of LY2510924, idarubicin and cytarabine (IA) combination therapy in relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML. Eligible patients were 18-70 years of age receiving up to salvage 3 therapy. A peripheral blood absolute blast count of < 20,000/muL was required for inclusion. LY2510924 was administered daily for 7 days followed by IA from day 8. Two dose escalation levels (10 and 20 mg) were evaluated, with a plan to enroll up to 12 patients in the phase I portion. Results: The median age of the enrolled patients (n = 11) was 55 years (range, 19-70). Median number of prior therapies was 1 (1-3). Six and five patients were treated at dose-levels ""0"" (10 mg) and ""1"" (20 mg), respectively. Only one patient experiencing a dose limiting toxicity (grade 3 rash and myelosuppression). Three and one complete responses were observed at dose-levels ""0"" and ""1,"" respectively; the overall response rate (ORR) was 36% (4 of 11 patients). A >/= 50% decrease in CXCR4 mean fluorescence intensity was observed in 4 of 9 patients by flow cytometry, indicating incomplete suppression of CXCR4-receptor occupancy. Conclusions: The combination of LY2510924 with IA is safe in R/R AML. Dose-escalation to a 30 mg LY2510924 dose is planned to achieve complete blockade of CXCR4 receptor occupancy, followed by expansion phase at the recommended phase 2 dose-level.","['Boddu, Prajwal', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Koneru, Mythili', 'Huang, Xuelin', 'Naqvi, Kiran', 'Wierda, William', 'Bose, Prithviraj', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Burger, Jan', 'Alvarado, Yesid', 'Deshmukh, April', 'Patel, Ami', 'Cavazos, Antonio', 'Han, Lina', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Konopleva, Marina']","['Boddu P', 'Borthakur G', 'Koneru M', 'Huang X', 'Naqvi K', 'Wierda W', 'Bose P', 'Jabbour E', 'Estrov Z', 'Burger J', 'Alvarado Y', 'Deshmukh A', 'Patel A', 'Cavazos A', 'Han L', 'Cortes JE', 'Kantarjian H', 'Andreeff M', 'Konopleva M']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas at MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas at MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN, United States.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas at MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas at MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas at MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas at MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas at MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas at MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas at MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas at MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas at MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas at MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas at MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas at MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas at MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas at MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas at MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas at MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20180924,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC6167965,['NOTNLM'],"['CXC4', 'LY2510924', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'cytarabine', 'idarubicin', 'relapsed refractory']",2018/10/16 06:00,2018/10/16 06:01,['2018/10/16 06:00'],"['2018/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/16 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2018.00369 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2018 Sep 24;8:369. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2018.00369. eCollection 2018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) has led some groups to favor other options for therapeutic and prophylactic anticoagulation. This is particularly relevant in light of recent data demonstrating a lower rate of HIT in patients receiving enoxaparin compared with UFH. This study examines the cost-effectiveness of enoxaparin, compared to UFH for prophylactic and therapeutic usage in hospitals. Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients who underwent HIT panel testing at the Inspira Health Network, Vineland campus (an approximately 262-bedded community hospital located in southern New Jersey that services a population of approximately 61,050) from the period of April 1, 2015 through December 31, 2016. The starting date represents the time from which enoxaparin became the primary alternative anticoagulant available at this hospital. Records of the total usage and cost of UFH and enoxaparin for the specified time period were collected from the hospital pharmacy database for evaluation, as were records of HIT panels. The information was analyzed to determine the frequency of HIT panel testing orders for patients receiving UFH versus those receiving enoxaparin. Annual cost-savings for the hospital were extrapolated using the comparative incidence of HIT panels and associated costs, including increased length of stay, hematology/oncology consultation, use of an alternative anticoagulant, critical bleeding requiring transfusion, and complications of HIT-associated thrombosis. These variables were multiplied by the incidence rate for each specified drug and usage to determine the daily cost for each drug. Results: The use of enoxaparin did not result in a significant decrease in the ordering of HIT panels in the hospital, with a relative rate ratio of 0.948 (95% confidence interval: 0.336, 2.21). When the data were stratified to examine prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulation, there was a marked difference in the frequency of HIT testing. The rate ratio of HIT panel orders for patients receiving therapeutic enoxaparin rather than intravenous (IV) UFH was 0.118 (0.006, 0.625). These numbers were used to extrapolate the total daily cost of enoxaparin compared with IV UFH; therapeutic enoxaparin cost $30.66, while IV UFH cost $162.30. IV UFH use was associated with a higher incidence rate of HIT panel orders, and consequently a higher daily cost due to the likelihood of increased length of stay, use of alternative anticoagulation, bleeding requiring transfusion, and request for expert consultation. Conclusion: In this study, the use of enoxaparin was associated with a significant cost-saving over IV UFH when used for therapeutic anticoagulation, but this cost saving was not observed for prophylactic anticoagulation.","['Menon, Harry', 'Pillai, Adip', 'Aussenberg-Rodriguez, Jeanine', 'Ambrose, John', 'Youssef, Irini', 'Griffiths, Elizabeth A', 'Al Ustwani, Omar']","['Menon H', 'Pillai A', 'Aussenberg-Rodriguez J', 'Ambrose J', 'Youssef I', 'Griffiths EA', 'Al Ustwani O']","['Departments of Medicine and Pharmacy, Inspira Health Network, Vineland, New Jersey, USA.', 'Departments of Medicine and Pharmacy, Inspira Health Network, Vineland, New Jersey, USA.', 'Departments of Medicine and Pharmacy, Inspira Health Network, Vineland, New Jersey, USA.', 'Departments of Medicine and Pharmacy, Inspira Health Network, Vineland, New Jersey, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Suny Downstate Medical School, Brooklyn, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Leukemia Section, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York, USA.', 'Departments of Medicine and Pharmacy, Inspira Health Network, Vineland, New Jersey, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Germany,Avicenna J Med,Avicenna journal of medicine,101584155,,,,PMC6178568,['NOTNLM'],"['Anticoagulation', 'heparin-induced thrombocytopenia', 'low molecular weight heparin']",2018/10/16 06:00,2018/10/16 06:01,['2018/10/16 06:00'],"['2018/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/ajm.AJM_78_18 [doi]', 'AJM-8-133 [pii]']",ppublish,Avicenna J Med. 2018 Oct-Dec;8(4):133-138. doi: 10.4103/ajm.AJM_78_18.,,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib have drastically revolutionized the course and the prognosis of this hematologic malignancy. As we know, the association pregnancy-CML is an infrequent situation. Also the use of TKI in pregnant women is unsafe with a lack of alternatives and effective therapeutic options. Thus its cessation during gestation puts those patients at high risk of developing blast crisis characterized by poor outcomes. Case Report: A 37-year-old pregnant woman, gravida 2, para 2, with a previous cesarean section in 2011, presented to the obstetric unit. Her medical past revealed that she is a newly diagnosed patient with CML managed by TKI during her preconception period. Due to the perilous use of TKI during her pregnancy, a switch to interferon-alpha administration was adopted. But after the completion of 36 weeks of gestation, disease progression (relapse with blast crisis), attested by biological worsening, a white blood cell count = 245000/mm(3) with 32% blasts in the peripheral blood, urged the medical team to opt for cesarean delivery. She underwent general endotracheal anesthesia without any perioperative incidents and gave birth to a healthy newborn. Ten days later, the patient was started on TKI. Discussion: Although data on this specific and challenging situation are limited, this case highlights the difficulties encountered by the anesthesiologists when choosing the accurate anesthetic strategy and how important it is to weigh the risks and benefits inherent to each technique. Above all, taking into consideration the possible central nervous system (CNS) contamination by circulating blast cells when performing spinal or epidural approach is primordial. This potential adverse event (CNS blast crisis) is extremely scarce but it is responsible for high rates of morbidity and mortality.","['Rebahi, Houssam', 'Ait Sliman, Mourad', 'El Adib, Ahmed-Rhassane']","['Rebahi H', 'Ait Sliman M', 'El Adib AR']","['Department of Anesthesia, Intensive Care Medicine, Emergency & Simulation, Medical School of Marrakech (Cadi-Ayyad University), Mother & Child Hospital, Mohammed VI Teaching Hospital, Marrakech, Morocco.', 'Department of Anesthesia, Intensive Care Medicine, Emergency & Simulation, Medical School of Marrakech (Cadi-Ayyad University), Mother & Child Hospital, Mohammed VI Teaching Hospital, Marrakech, Morocco.', 'Department of Anesthesia, Intensive Care Medicine, Emergency & Simulation, Medical School of Marrakech (Cadi-Ayyad University), Mother & Child Hospital, Mohammed VI Teaching Hospital, Marrakech, Morocco.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20180918,United States,Case Rep Obstet Gynecol,Case reports in obstetrics and gynecology,101576454,,,,PMC6167580,,,2018/10/16 06:00,2018/10/16 06:01,['2018/10/16 06:00'],"['2018/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/18 00:00 [revised]', '2018/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/16 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2018/3138718 [doi]'],epublish,Case Rep Obstet Gynecol. 2018 Sep 18;2018:3138718. doi: 10.1155/2018/3138718. eCollection 2018.,['ORCID: 0000-0001-9938-9551'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about how the tumor environment including tumor cells themselves affects this process. Here we demonstrated that AML cells expressed inducible T-cell costimulator ligand (ICOSL) that can provide costimulation through ICOS for the conversion and expansion of Tregs sustaining high Foxp3 and CD25 expression as well as a suppressive function. TNF-a stimulation up-regulated the expression of ICOSL. Furthermore, both the conversion and expansion of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) T cells and CD4(+)ICOS(+)Foxp3(+) T cells were induced by co-culture with AML cells overexpressed ICOSL. CD4(+)CD25(+)ICOS(+) T cells possessed stronger ability to secrete IL-10 than CD4(+)CD25(+)ICOS(-) T cells. The mechanism by which IL-10 promoted the proliferation of AML cells was dependent on the activation of the Akt, Erk1/2, p38, and Stat3 signaling pathways. Blockade of ICOS signaling using anti-ICOSL antibody impaired the generation of Tregs and retarded the progression of an AML mice model injected with C1498 cells. The expression of ICOSL of patient AML cells and ICOS(+) Tregs were found to be predictors for overall survival and disease-free survival in patients with AML, with ICOS(+) Treg cell subset being a stronger predictor than total Tregs. These results suggest that ICOSL expression by AML cells may directly drive Treg expansion as a mechanism of immune evasion and ICOS(+) Treg cell frequency is a better prognostic predictor in patients with AML.","['Han, Yixiang', 'Dong, Yuqing', 'Yang, Qianqian', 'Xu, Wanling', 'Jiang, Songfu', 'Yu, Zhijie', 'Yu, Kang', 'Zhang, Shenghui']","['Han Y', 'Dong Y', 'Yang Q', 'Xu W', 'Jiang S', 'Yu Z', 'Yu K', 'Zhang S']","['Central Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Wenzhou Key Laboratory of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Wenzhou Key Laboratory of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Wenzhou Key Laboratory of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Wenzhou Key Laboratory of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Wenzhou Key Laboratory of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Wenzhou Key Laboratory of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Wenzhou Key Laboratory of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Division of Clinical Research, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180926,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (ICOSLG protein, human)', '0 (IL10 protein, human)', '0 (Inducible T-Cell Co-Stimulator Ligand)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor/transplantation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Inducible T-Cell Co-Stimulator Ligand/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-10/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*immunology/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Middle Aged', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Prognosis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Escape/*immunology', 'Tumor Microenvironment/immunology', 'Young Adult']",PMC6168677,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukemia', '*inducible T-cell costimulator', '*inducible T-cell costimulator ligand', '*interleukin-10', '*regulatory T cells']",2018/10/16 06:00,2019/10/28 06:00,['2018/10/16 06:00'],"['2018/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2018.02227 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2018 Sep 26;9:2227. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.02227. eCollection 2018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of extremely low-frequency electromagnetic field therapy (ELF-EMF) on brain plasticity in the rehabilitation of patients after stroke. Methods: Forty-eight patients were divided into two groups underwent the same rehabilitation program, but in the study group, the patients additionally were exposed to a standard series of 10 ELF-EMF treatments. To determine the level of neuroplasticity, we measured the plasma level of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the vascular-endothelial growth factor, as well as BDNF mRNA expression. Additionally, we determined the molecule levels for hepatocyte growth factor, stem cell factor, stromal cell-derived factor 1alpha, nerve growth factor beta, and leukemia inhibitory factor, using 5plex cytokine panel in plasma. After 4 weeks, during which patients had undergone neurorehabilitation and neurological examinations, we assessed functional recovery using the Barthel Index, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Geriatric Depression Scale, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Results: We observed that ELF-EMF significantly increased growth factors and cytokine levels involved in neuroplasticity, as well as promoted an enhancement of functional recovery in post-stroke patients. Additionally, we presented evidence that these effects could be related to the increase of gene expression on the mRNA level. Moreover, a change of BDNF plasma level was positively correlated with the Barthel Index, MMSE, and negatively correlated with GDS. Conclusion: Extremely low-frequency electromagnetic field therapy improves the effectiveness of rehabilitation of post-stroke patients by improving neuroplasticity processes.","['Cichon, Natalia', 'Bijak, Michal', 'Czarny, Piotr', 'Miller, Elzbieta', 'Synowiec, Ewelina', 'Sliwinski, Tomasz', 'Saluk-Bijak, Joanna']","['Cichon N', 'Bijak M', 'Czarny P', 'Miller E', 'Synowiec E', 'Sliwinski T', 'Saluk-Bijak J']","['Department of General Biochemistry, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of General Biochemistry, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Physical Medicine, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Neurorehabilitation Ward, III General Hospital in Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Medical Genetics, Department of Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Medical Genetics, Department of Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of General Biochemistry, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180926,Switzerland,Front Aging Neurosci,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,101525824,,,,PMC6168626,['NOTNLM'],"['brain-derived neurotrophic factor', 'extremely low-frequency electromagnetic field', 'neuroplasticity', 'rehabilitation', 'stroke']",2018/10/16 06:00,2018/10/16 06:01,['2018/10/16 06:00'],"['2018/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/16 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fnagi.2018.00294 [doi]'],epublish,Front Aging Neurosci. 2018 Sep 26;10:294. doi: 10.3389/fnagi.2018.00294. eCollection 2018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patients still encounter a high rate of relapse even after they receive hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). HSCT is considered the established therapy and best option for many malignant ALL cases, however, disease relapse remains the main reason of failure. In recent years, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has become a promising treatment for patients with advanced blood cancers. Here, we report a rare case of a Ph-positive ALL patient with extramedullary relapse in her cervix after receiving allogeneic HSCT. Given the unsatisfactory response to chemotherapy, tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment, and HSCT transplantation, she had received CD19+ CAR T-cell therapy 8 months earlier. The following ultrasound check indicated that her cervix relapse went through significant remission with almost undetectable tumor mass. This case strongly supports the efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy on adult ALL with extramedullary relapse.","['Wang, Dongmei', 'Shi, Rui', 'Wang, Qinglong', 'Li, Jianqiang']","['Wang D', 'Shi R', 'Wang Q', 'Li J']","[""Department of Hematology, Harrison International Peace Hospital, Hengshui, Hebei 053000, People's Republic of China, wdmys1970@sina.com."", ""Department of Hematology, Harrison International Peace Hospital, Hengshui, Hebei 053000, People's Republic of China, wdmys1970@sina.com."", ""Hebei Senlangbio Technology Co., Ltd, Shijiazhuang, Hebei 050000, People's Republic of China, sllijianqiang@163.com."", ""Hebei Senlangbio Technology Co., Ltd, Shijiazhuang, Hebei 050000, People's Republic of China, sllijianqiang@163.com.""]",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20180928,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,PMC6167997,['NOTNLM'],"['CAR T-cell therapy', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'cervix relapse']",2018/10/16 06:00,2018/10/16 06:01,['2018/10/16 06:00'],"['2018/10/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S164430 [doi]', 'ott-11-6327 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2018 Sep 28;11:6327-6332. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S164430. eCollection 2018.,,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to this risk, national guidelines recommend invasive fungal infection prophylaxis in this population until the resolution of neutropenia. Although posaconazole has demonstrated superiority over fluconazole and itraconazole, there is limited evidence for voriconazole for invasive fungal infection prophylaxis in this population. Even less data are available comparing posaconazole and voriconazole directly. The study objective was to investigate the efficacy and safety of delayed-release posaconazole tablets versus voriconazole for primary invasive fungal infection prophylaxis. The primary outcome was rate of discontinuation of either agent. Secondary outcomes included specific rates of discontinuation due to adverse events and drug-drug interactions, rates of breakthrough invasive fungal infection, and 30-day and 100-day mortality rates. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of adult patients admitted to NYU Langone Health between 1 January 2014 and 31 August 2017 and initiated on invasive fungal infection prophylaxis during induction or reinduction chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. RESULTS: In total, 77 patients were included in the study: 43 using posaconazole delayed-release tablets and 34 using oral voriconazole. In the posaconazole group, 30% of patients (n = 13) discontinued therapy for any reason compared with 35% (n = 12) of patients in the voriconazole group (p = 0.64). A higher percentage of patients in the voriconazole group discontinued due to adverse events (6 patients, 18% vs. 1 patient, 2%, p = 0.04). Mortality rates at 30 and 100 days were similar between both groups. No breakthrough invasive fungal infections was noted in either group. CONCLUSION: Overall, discontinuations for any reason were similar in patients taking both posaconazole delayed-release and oral voriconazole. Both posaconazole delayed-release tablets and oral voriconazole appear to be effective at preventing invasive fungal infection in acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome patients undergoing induction chemotherapy, although posaconazole may be more tolerable.","['Phillips, Kynlon', 'Cirrone, Frank', 'Ahuja, Tania', 'Siegfried, Justin', 'Papadopoulos, John']","['Phillips K', 'Cirrone F', 'Ahuja T', 'Siegfried J', 'Papadopoulos J']","['Department of Pharmacy, New York University Langone Health, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, New York University Langone Health, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, New York University Langone Health, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, New York University Langone Health, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, New York University Langone Health, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20181014,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Triazoles)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Invasive Fungal Infections/*prevention & control', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Triazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Voriconazole/*therapeutic use']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myelogenous leukemia', 'myelodysplastic syndrome', 'posaconazole', 'voriconazole']",2018/10/16 06:00,2019/03/21 06:00,['2018/10/16 06:00'],"['2018/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1078155218806975 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2019 Mar;25(2):398-403. doi: 10.1177/1078155218806975.

Although generally safe, TKI may have hitherto poorly recognized effects in the quality of life (QoL) of such patients. METHODS: We prospectively measured the symptom burden of patients with chronic phase CML enrolled on frontline TKI trials with dasatinib, nilotinib, or ponatinib. A total of 219 patients were enrolled and filled out the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI)-CML questionnaire before the start of therapy and during follow-up at defined time points of 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months. RESULTS: The median age was 50 years. Longitudinal analysis showed relatively stable symptom severity scores over time. Fatigue was the most common symptom in all three cohorts, both prior to the start of therapy and during therapy, including after achievement of deep molecular remission. Work was the most affected component of daily living. Overall patients tolerated therapy well with improvement of their symptoms from baseline, with few dose reductions related to toxicity or symptomatology. Although 31% of the patients who completed MDASI-CML achieved complete molecular remission by 24 months of treatment, nearly 90% experienced persistent mild symptoms. CONCLUSION: Side effects related to TKIs may impact the quality of life in patients with CML-CP. Further studies should investigate factors (comorbidities, concomitant medications, dose and schedule, etc) associated with these symptoms and interventions that may improve the patients' QoL, including treatment discontinuation when safely feasible.","['Zulbaran-Rojas, Alejandro', 'Lin, Huei-Kan', 'Shi, Qiuling', 'Williams, Loretta A', 'George, Binsah', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Jabbour, Elias', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Wierda, William', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Cleeland, Charles', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Zulbaran-Rojas A', 'Lin HK', 'Shi Q', 'Williams LA', 'George B', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Jabbour E', ""O'Brien S"", 'Ravandi F', 'Wierda W', 'Estrov Z', 'Borthakur G', 'Kadia T', 'Cleeland C', 'Cortes JE', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Symptom Research, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Symptom Research, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Symptom Research, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Symptom Research, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181014,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '4340891KFS (ponatinib)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Dasatinib/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyridazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Quality of Life', 'Symptom Assessment', 'Young Adult']",PMC6246941,['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR-ABL', '*chronic myeloid leukemia', '*symptom burden', '*tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2018/10/16 06:00,2019/11/15 06:00,['2018/10/16 06:00'],"['2018/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/28 00:00 [revised]', '2018/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/15 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.1808 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2018 Nov;7(11):5457-5469. doi: 10.1002/cam4.1808.

Among the chosen cancer cell lines, mal B showed maximum cytotoxicity to the A549 cells (IC50 = 8.1 +/- 1.0 muM), which was significantly better than that of curcumin (IC50 = 26.7 +/- 3.1 muM). Further morphological studies by phase contrast microscopy and a clonogenic assay of the A549 cells revealed that mal B treatment increased the number of shrinking cells and also abolished the clonal proliferation of the cells. Mal B induced apoptotic cell death was confirmed by DNA laddering and quantified by cytoplasmic oligonucleosome formation and annexin V/PI assays. The mal B-induced apoptosis was mediated by an increase in the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), because the cell-permeable antioxidants, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and PEG-SOD, strongly inhibited its cytotoxicity to the A549 cells. Mal B increased the BAX level while simultaneously decreasing the BCL-2 and BCL-XL levels in the A549 cells, triggering the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway as revealed from the release of cytochrome c, and the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Pre-treatment of cells with caspase-9, caspase-3 and pan-caspase inhibitors made them more resistant to mal B treatment. This effect of mal B was strongly associated with the concomitant decrease in anti-apoptotic (IAP1, IAP2 and survivin), angiogenic (growth factors) and cancer invasiveness (matrix metalloproteinase-9, COX-2) modulating proteins. Mal B induced cytotoxicity was unaffected by the shRNA-mediated depletion of p53 in A549 cells. Most importantly, mal B sensitized a wide range of human carcinoma cells regardless of their p53 status. Finally, mal B (100 mg kg-1) also inhibited lung tumor (xenograft) growth in SCID mice.","['Tyagi, Mrityunjay', 'Maity, Biswanath', 'Saha, Bhaskar', 'Bauri, Ajay Kumar', 'Subramanian, Mahesh', 'Chattopadhyay, Subrata', 'Patro, Birija Sankar']","['Tyagi M', 'Maity B', 'Saha B', 'Bauri AK', 'Subramanian M', 'Chattopadhyay S', 'Patro BS']","['Bio-Organic Division, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai-400085, India. bisank@barc.gov.in.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Food Funct,Food & function,101549033,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Resorcinols)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '63335-24-0 (malabaricone B)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['A549 Cells', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Curcumin/pharmacology', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Resorcinols/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",,,,2018/10/16 06:00,2019/03/21 06:00,['2018/10/16 06:00'],"['2018/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/c8fo00624e [doi]'],ppublish,Food Funct. 2018 Nov 14;9(11):5715-5727. doi: 10.1039/c8fo00624e.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A panel of wild-type and mutant p53 cancer cell lines of different tissues, including pancreas, breast, skin, and lung were used, as well as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients with different TP53 gene status. The effects of mutant p53 were evaluated by confocal microscopy, reactive oxygen species production assay, immunoblotting, and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction after cellular transfection. RESULTS: We demonstrate that oncogenic mutant p53 isoforms are able to inhibit SESN1 expression and consequently the amount of SESN1/AMPK complex, resulting in the downregulation of the AMPK/PGC-1alpha/UCP2 axis and mitochondrial O2-. production. We also show a correlation between the decrease of reduced thiols with a poorer clinical outcome of CLL patients bearing mutant TP53 gene. The restoration of the mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) expression, as well as the addition of the radical scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine, reversed the oncogenic effects of mutant p53 as cellular hyper-proliferation, antiapoptotic effect, and resistance to drugs. CONCLUSIONS: The inhibition of the SESN1/AMPK/PGC-1alpha/UCP2 axis contributes to the pro-oxidant and oncogenic effects of mutant p53, suggesting pro-oxidant drugs as a therapeutic approach for cancer patients bearing mutant TP53 gene.","['Cordani, Marco', 'Butera, Giovanna', 'Dando, Ilaria', 'Torrens-Mas, Margalida', 'Butturini, Elena', 'Pacchiana, Raffaella', 'Oppici, Elisa', 'Cavallini, Chiara', 'Gasperini, Sara', 'Tamassia, Nicola', 'Nadal-Serrano, Mercedes', 'Coan, Michela', 'Rossi, Davide', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Caraglia, Michele', 'Mariotto, Sofia', 'Spizzo, Riccardo', 'Roca, Pilar', 'Oliver, Jordi', 'Scupoli, Maria Teresa', 'Donadelli, Massimo']","['Cordani M', 'Butera G', 'Dando I', 'Torrens-Mas M', 'Butturini E', 'Pacchiana R', 'Oppici E', 'Cavallini C', 'Gasperini S', 'Tamassia N', 'Nadal-Serrano M', 'Coan M', 'Rossi D', 'Gaidano G', 'Caraglia M', 'Mariotto S', 'Spizzo R', 'Roca P', 'Oliver J', 'Scupoli MT', 'Donadelli M']","['Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, Section of Biochemistry, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Biochemistry Department, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (UAM), Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas ""Alberto Sols"" (CSIC-UAM), IdiPAZ, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, Section of Biochemistry, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, Section of Biochemistry, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Grupo Multidisciplinar de Oncologia Traslacional, Instituto Universitario de Investigacion en Ciencias de la Salud (IUNICS), Palma de Mallorca, Illes Balears, Spain.', 'Ciber Fisiopatologia Obesidad y Nutricion (CB06/03), Instituto Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria de Palma (IdISPa), Hospital Universitario Son Espases, edificio S.

METHODS: Around gestational week 17, mothers and fathers responded to a questionnaire on exposure to various agents during the last 6 months and 6 months pre-conception, respectively. Benzene exposure was assessed through self-reported exposure to ""gasoline or exhaust"". Cases of childhood leukaemia (n = 70) were identified through linkage with the Cancer Registry of Norway. Risk was estimated by hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI), comparing offspring from exposed and unexposed parents using a Cox regression model. RESULTS: Maternal exposure to ""gasoline or exhaust"" was associated with an increased risk of childhood leukaemia (HR = 2.59; 95%CI: 1.03, 6.48) and acute lymphatic leukaemia (HR = 2.71; 95%CI: 0.97, 7.58). There was an increasing risk for higher exposure (p value for trend = 0.032 and 0.027). The association did not change after adjustment for maternal smoking. CONCLUSION: In spite of rather few cases, the findings in this prospective study, with the exposure metric defined a priori, support previous observations relating maternal exposure to benzene from gasoline and other petroleum-derived sources and the subsequent development of childhood leukaemia in the offspring.","['Kirkeleit, Jorunn', 'Riise, Trond', 'Bjorge, Tone', 'Christiani, David C', 'Bratveit, Magne', 'Baccarelli, Andrea', 'Mattioli, Stefano', 'Hollund, Bjorg Eli', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore']","['Kirkeleit J', 'Riise T', 'Bjorge T', 'Christiani DC', 'Bratveit M', 'Baccarelli A', 'Mattioli S', 'Hollund BE', 'Gjertsen BT']","['Department of Occupational Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, 5021, Bergen, Norway.

Optimal management of life-threatening presentations of both of their diseases can pose significant challenges. The current study aimed to address the incidence, management, and outcome of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in patients with active hematological malignancies. METHODS: This retrospective registry-based cohort study included adults with active leukemia or lymphoma who were hospitalized at Mayo Clinic Rochester from 01/01/2004 to 12/31/2014. The diagnosis of ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI) or non-ST-segment elevation MI (NSTEMI) was made based on the 3rd Universal Definition for MI, or of unstable angina (UA) in the absence of cardiac troponin elevation. Main outcome measures included all-cause, cardiac, and non-cardiac death in-hospital and at one year. RESULTS: Of 5300 adult patients with active hematological malignancies, 73 (1.4%) were diagnosed with an ACS (78.1% NSTEMI and 13.7% STEMI). 17.5% and 40% of NSTEMI and STEMI patients underwent coronary angiography, with percutaneous coronary intervention in 5.3% and 30%, respectively. While >80% of patients received beta-blocker therapy, only half of all and <50% of patients managed ""medically"" received antiplatelet, anticoagulant, and/or statin therapy. The in-hospital and 1-year mortality was 21.9% and 58.9%, respectively, of which 25% and 15% were cardiac in etiology.

Here, we develop a versatile CRISPR-genome organization (CRISPR-GO) system that can efficiently control the spatial positioning of genomic loci relative to specific nuclear compartments, including the nuclear periphery, Cajal bodies, and promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies. CRISPR-GO is chemically inducible and reversible, enabling interrogation of real-time dynamics of chromatin interactions with nuclear compartments in living cells. Inducible repositioning of genomic loci to the nuclear periphery allows for dissection of mitosis-dependent and -independent relocalization events and also for interrogation of the relationship between gene position and gene expression. CRISPR-GO mediates rapid de novo formation of Cajal bodies at desired chromatin loci and causes significant repression of endogenous gene expression over long distances (30-600 kb). The CRISPR-GO system offers a programmable platform to investigate large-scale spatial genome organization and function.","['Wang, Haifeng', 'Xu, Xiaoshu', 'Nguyen, Cindy M', 'Liu, Yanxia', 'Gao, Yuchen', 'Lin, Xueqiu', 'Daley, Timothy', 'Kipniss, Nathan H', 'La Russa, Marie', 'Qi, Lei S']","['Wang H', 'Xu X', 'Nguyen CM', 'Liu Y', 'Gao Y', 'Lin X', 'Daley T', 'Kipniss NH', 'La Russa M', 'Qi LS']","['Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA; Cancer Biology Program, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA; Department of Statistics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA; Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA; Stanford ChEM-H, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.

Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) haploinsufficiency results in a bone loss by decreased bone formation; however, it is unclear whether Sirt1 overexpression in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) plays an anti-osteoporotic role. The aim of the study is to identify whether the overexpression of Sirt1 in MSCs could restore skeletal growth retardation and osteoporosis in Bmi-1 deficient mice. METHODS: We used our new generated transgenic mouse model that overexpresses Sirt1 in its MSCs (Sirt1(TG)) to cross with Bmi-1(-/-) mice to generate Bmi-1(-/-) mice with Sirt1 overexpression in MSCs, and compared their skeletal metabolism with those of their Bmi-1(-/-) and wild-type (WT) littermates (6 mice for each genotype) at 4weeks of age using imaging, histopathological, immunohistochemical, histomorphometric, cellular, and molecular methods. RESULTS: The levels of expression for Sirt1 were noticeably higher in the skeletal tissue of Sirt1(TG) mice than in those of WT mice. In Comparison to WT mice, the body weight and size, skeletal size, bone volume, osteoblast number, alkaline phosphatase and type I collagen positive areas, osteogenic related gene expression levels were all significantly increased in the Sirt1(TG) mice. Overexpression of Sirt1 in Bmi-1(-/-) mouse MSCs resulted in a longer lifespan, improved skeletal growth and significantly increased bone mass by stimulating osteoblastic bone formation and inhibiting osteoclastic bone resorption in the Bmi-1(-/-) mice, although the defects were not completely restored. Furthermore, Sirt1 overexpression in MSCs reduced the acetylation level of FOXO3a (Forkhead box O3a), increasing levels of expression for FOXO3a and SOD2 (Superoxide dismutase 2) in bony tissue, enhanced osteogenesis and reduced osteogenic cell senescence. We also demonstrated that nicotinamide, a Sirt1 inhibitor, blocks the effect of overexpression of Sirt1 in MSCs on osteogenesis and osteogenic cell senescence. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results demonstrate that Sirt1 overexpression in MSCs increased the osteoblastic bone formation and partially restores the defects in skeletal growth and osteogenesis in Bmi-1(-/-) mice by FOXO3a deacetylation and oxidative stress inhibition. Our data support the proposal that Sirt1 is a target for promoting bone formation as an anabolic approach for the treatment of osteoporosis.","['Sun, Wen', 'Qiao, Wanxin', 'Zhou, Bin', 'Hu, Zixuan', 'Yan, Quanquan', 'Wu, Jun', 'Wang, Rong', 'Zhang, Qian', 'Miao, Dengshun']","['Sun W', 'Qiao W', 'Zhou B', 'Hu Z', 'Yan Q', 'Wu J', 'Wang R', 'Zhang Q', 'Miao D']","['State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Medicine, The Research Center for Bone and Stem Cells, Department of Anatomy, Histology and Embryology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China; Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China; Department of Basic Science of Stomatology, Affiliated Hospital of Stomatology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Medicine, The Research Center for Bone and Stem Cells, Department of Anatomy, Histology and Embryology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Medicine, The Research Center for Bone and Stem Cells, Department of Anatomy, Histology and Embryology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Medicine, The Research Center for Bone and Stem Cells, Department of Anatomy, Histology and Embryology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Medicine, The Research Center for Bone and Stem Cells, Department of Anatomy, Histology and Embryology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China; Shanghai Lida Polytechnic Institute, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Medicine, The Research Center for Bone and Stem Cells, Department of Anatomy, Histology and Embryology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Medicine, The Research Center for Bone and Stem Cells, Department of Anatomy, Histology and Embryology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Medicine, The Research Center for Bone and Stem Cells, Department of Anatomy, Histology and Embryology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Medicine, The Research Center for Bone and Stem Cells, Department of Anatomy, Histology and Embryology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China; Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China; Department of Basic Science of Stomatology, Affiliated Hospital of Stomatology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.

Chromatin modifying agents, such as histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs), sodium butyrate (NaBu) and trichostatin A (TSA), may reverse chemo-resistance by modulating the activity of chromatin remodeling enzymes and/or genes that control cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the potential use of HDACIs and CLB combination therapies in an in vitro chemo-resistant leukemia model. METHODS: The p53-null promyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL60, was used as an in vitro model of chemo-resistant leukemia. Drug cytotoxicity was determined by tetrazolium salt-based colorimetric assays and Annexin V/propidium iodide staining (flow cytometry). The level of mRNA expression of the chromatin modifying genes was measured by quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: Micromolar concentrations of CLB combined with either NaBu or TSA triggered synergistic cytotoxic effects in HL-60 cells (p < 0.001). The effects of the combination treatments resulted in upregulated p21 gene expression (up to 59-fold; p<0.001) that preceded an increase in BCL6 gene expression (up to 20-fold; p < 0.001). Statistically significant but smaller magnitude changes (</= 2-fold; p <0.05) were noted in the expression of other genes studied regardless of the treatment type. CONCLUSION: The combination treatment of p53-null HL-60 cells with DNA-damaging agent CLB and HDACIs NaBu and TSA triggered additive to synergistic effects on apoptosis and upregulated BCL6 and p21 expression. These findings reveal BCL6 and p21 as potential targets of chemo-resistance for the development of anti-leukemic drugs.","['Kwa, Faith A A', 'Cole-Sinclair, Merrole F', 'Kapuscinski, Miroslav K']","['Kwa FAA', 'Cole-Sinclair MF', 'Kapuscinski MK']","['School of Health and Biomedical Sciences, Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology University, Bundoora, Victoria 3083, Australia.', 'Department of Pathology, The University of Melbourne, Victoria 3010, Australia.', ""Haematology Department, St Vincent's Hospital, Fitzroy, Victoria 3065, Australia."", 'Centre for Epidemiology and Biostatistics, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria 3053, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Mol Pharmacol,Current molecular pharmacology,101467997,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Chlorambucil/*pharmacology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1/genetics/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/genetics/metabolism', 'Survivin/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/deficiency/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chlorambucil', '*chromatin', '*cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21', '*drug resistance', '*histone deacetylase inhibitors', '*proto-oncogene BCL6', '*sodium butyrate', '*trichostatin A.']",2018/10/16 06:00,2019/06/18 06:00,['2018/10/16 06:00'],"['2018/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/14 00:00 [revised]', '2018/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/18 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['CMP-EPUB-93601 [pii]', '10.2174/1874467211666181010161836 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Mol Pharmacol. 2019;12(1):72-81. doi: 10.2174/1874467211666181010161836.,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is known as an anti-cancer agent and recently it has received an immense attention. Various microorganisms have the ability to secrete the L-ASNase. It is famous world-wide as anti-tumor medicine for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphosarcoma. L-ASNase helps in deamination of Asparagine and Glutamine. SOURCE: L-ASNase mainly found in two bacterial sources; Escherichia coli and Erwinia carotovora. Isolation from plants: Endophytes were also a great source of L-ASNase. It was isolated from four types of plants named as; C. citratus, O. diffusa, M. koengii, and also P. bleo. APPLICATIONS: L-ASNase is used as a potential anti-tumor medicine. It plays a very much essential role for the growth of tumor cells. Tumor cells require a lot of asparagine for their growth. But ASNase converts to aspartate and ammonia from asparagine. So the tumor cell does not proliferate and fails to survive. The L-ASNase is used as the medicine for the major type of cancer like acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), brain. It also used as a medicine for central nervous system (CNS) tumors, and also for neuroblastoma. Two types of L-ASNase have been found. CONCLUSION: L-ASNase becomes a powerful anti-tumor medicine and researchers should develop a potent strain of asparaginase which can produce asparaginase in the industrial level. It is also used in the pharmaceutical industry and food industry on a broader scale.","['Paul, Tania', 'Mondal, Abhijit', 'Bandyopadhyay, Tarun Kanti']","['Paul T', 'Mondal A', 'Bandyopadhyay TK']","['Department of Chemical Engineering, NIT Agartala, Agartala-799046, India.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering, NIT Agartala, Agartala-799046, India.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering, NIT Agartala, Agartala-799046, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Recent Pat Biotechnol,Recent patents on biotechnology,101309942,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/*chemistry/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Asparagine/chemistry', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology', 'Glutamine/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Neuroblastoma/drug therapy', '*Patents as Topic', 'Pectobacterium carotovorum/enzymology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['L-ASNase', 'anti-tumor medicine', 'enzyme', 'isolation', 'microorganisms', 'purification.']",2018/10/16 06:00,2019/03/19 06:00,['2018/10/16 06:00'],"['2018/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/11 00:00 [revised]', '2018/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/19 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['BIOT-EPUB-93656 [pii]', '10.2174/1872208312666181012150407 [doi]']",ppublish,Recent Pat Biotechnol. 2019;13(1):33-44. doi: 10.2174/1872208312666181012150407.,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Seventy-two cases of breast lymphoma in core needle biopsy between 2011 and 2016 were extracted from the pathology database of Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center. The clinicopathologic features were analyzed. The histological diagnosis of the tumors was based on the WHO classifications of tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues. Immunohistochemistry and molecular methods were performed to detect related antigens and genes. Results: Seventy-one patients were female and one was male. The median age was 54 years. The tumors were located in the right breast in 32 (44.4%) patients and in the left breast in 40 (55.6%) patients. Seven patients had a previous history of lymphoma. Most of the cases presented as a single and painless breast mass. Sixty-three patients received systemic treatment, and nine patients received systemic therapy after excision. The common morphological feature was that single tumor cells infiltrated the stroma, without cohesiveness between tumor cells, and lacking glandular or nested epithelioid structures. The normal ductal and lobular structures of the mammary gland were typically preserved. The tumor cells in some cases were distributed in single rows, and should be differentiated from invasive carcinoma. All cases were positive for LCA, negative for CK. Sixty-eight cases were classified as B-cell lymphoma, including 63 cases (87.5%) of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL; including 3 cases of EBV-positive DLBCL and 60 cases of DLBCL, NOS), two cases of Burkitt lymphoma, one case of mantle cell lymphoma, one case of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue and one case of precursor B lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. The remaining cases included two peripheral T-cell lymphoma (NOS), one extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma, nasal type and one myeloid sarcoma. In 63 cases of DLBCL, 22 cases (34.9%) expressed germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) phenotype and 41 cases (65.1%) showed non-germinal center B-cell-like (non-GCB) phenotype. Conclusions: Core needle biopsy could be the preferred method for diagnosis of breast lymphoma. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common histologic type of breast lymphoma, and non-GCB subtype is more frequent than GCB subtype.","['Rao, J', 'Ruan, M', 'Yu, B H', 'Li, X Q', 'Yang, W T', 'Shui, R H']","['Rao J', 'Ruan M', 'Yu BH', 'Li XQ', 'Yang WT', 'Shui RH']","['Department of Pathology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center; Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China.']",['chi'],"['15411965100/Research Project of the Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai', 'Municipality']",['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology,0005331,,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes', 'Biopsy, Large-Core Needle', '*Breast Neoplasms', 'China', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Germinal Center', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoid Tissue', '*Lymphoma', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Biopsy, needle', 'Breast neoplasms', 'Diagnosis, differential', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma']",2018/10/16 06:00,2018/11/06 06:00,['2018/10/15 06:00'],"['2018/10/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0529-5807.2018.10.001 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi. 2018 Oct 8;47(10):737-742. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0529-5807.2018.10.001.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Present work aims to study the function of microRNA (miR)-105 in EMT of NSCLC cells, which is unrevealed yet. METHODS: Two NSCLC cell lines A549 and Calu-3 were transfected with miR-105 mimic, inhibitor, or scrambled control. And then the effects of miR-105 were evaluated by performing trypan blue staining, transwell assay, ANNEXIN-FITC/propidium iodide (PI) double staining and Western blot analysis. The expression levels of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) after transfection were tested by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. Whether Mcl-1 was a downstream effector of miR-105, and the involvement of mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) signaling pathways were assessed. RESULTS: The overexpression of miR-105 significantly increased the viability and migration of A549 and Calu-3, but had no impacts on cell apoptosis. Meanwhile, E-cadherin was remarkably downregulated, and N-cadherin, Vimentin, ZEB1, and Snail were upregulated by miR-105 overexpression. Mcl-1 was positively regulated by miR-105, and the effects of miR-105 overexpression on A549 and Calu-3 cells viability, migration and EMT were all flattened by Mcl-1 silence. Both mTOR and p38MAPK pathways were activated in miR-105-overexpressing and Mcl-1-overexpressing cells. Besides, inhibition of mTOR and p38MAPK pathways by using Rapamycin and VX-702 abolished the regulatory effects of Mcl-1 on EMT. CONCLUSION: Our study underlines the importance of miR-105 in modulating NSCLC cells EMT. miR-105 promoted the EMT of NSCLC cells possibly via upregulation of Mcl-1 and thereby activation of mTOR and p38MAPK signaling.","['Jin, Xiangfeng', 'Yu, Yi', 'Zou, Qiang', 'Wang, Mingzhao', 'Cui, Yaojie', 'Xie, Jing', 'Wang, Zizong']","['Jin X', 'Yu Y', 'Zou Q', 'Wang M', 'Cui Y', 'Xie J', 'Wang Z']","['Department of Thoracic Surgery, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, China.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, China.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion, Qingdao Haici Hospital Affiliated to Qingdao University, Qingdao, China.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, China.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, China.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, China.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Retracted Publication']",20181014,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN105 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Snail Family Transcription Factors)', '0 (Vimentin)', '0 (ZEB1 protein, human)', '0 (Zinc Finger E-box-Binding Homeobox 1)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['A549 Cells', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Snail Family Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Vimentin/genetics/metabolism', 'Zinc Finger E-box-Binding Homeobox 1/genetics/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Mcl-1', '*epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)', '*microRNA-105', '*nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC)']",2018/10/15 06:00,2020/07/21 06:00,['2018/10/15 06:00'],"['2018/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.27873 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2019 Apr;120(4):5880-5888. doi: 10.1002/jcb.27873.

Recent data indicate that the proinsulin C-peptide (CP) exerts important physiological effects and shows the characteristics of an endogenous peptide hormone. So, this study was done to investigate the effect of C-peptide with or without insulin treatment on testicular function and architecture in diabetic rats. Rats were divided into the following groups: control, diabetic, and diabetic groups treated with either CP alone or combined with insulin. Tested parameters included, estimation of serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone, and glucose levels, testicular samples for histopathology and estimation of malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) levels as well as sperm count and motility. Results showed that DM caused a severe alteration in hormonal profile and reduced sperm parameters along with increased MDA and decrease in both TAC and BCL-2 levels. CP alone or with insulin treatment efficiently reversed all the negative effects of DM on rat testes, with maximum improvement in the combined regimen. Proposed mechanisms may involve its hypoglycemic, antioxidant, and antiapoptotic properties. Thus, CP could substitute for or better combined with insulin to prevent or retard diabetic-induced testicular dysfunction.","['Nazmy, Walaa Hassan', 'Elbassuoni, Eman Abdelmonem', 'Ali, Fatma Farrag', 'Rifaai, Rehab Ahmed']","['Nazmy WH', 'Elbassuoni EA', 'Ali FF', 'Rifaai RA']","['Physiology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Minia University, Minia, Egypt.', 'Physiology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Minia University, Minia, Egypt.', 'Physiology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Minia University, Minia, Egypt.', 'Histology and Cell Biology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Minia University, Minia, Egypt.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181014,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (C-Peptide)', '0 (Insulin)', '5W494URQ81 (Streptozocin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'C-Peptide/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*drug therapy', 'Infertility, Male/*drug therapy', 'Insulin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Sperm Count', 'Streptozocin', 'Testis/drug effects/pathology/*physiopathology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*C-peptide', '*diabetes mellitus', '*fertility impairments', '*testes', '*testicular dysfunction']",2018/10/15 06:00,2020/04/09 06:00,['2018/10/15 06:00'],"['2018/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/09 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.27618 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2019 Jun;234(6):9351-9357. doi: 10.1002/jcp.27618.

Real-time methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR; RQ-MSP) and bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) were performed to detect the methylation of ITGBL1 promoter. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed to analyze ITGBL1 transcript level. The results showed that ITGBL1 methylation level in 131 patients with AML was significantly higher than 29 controls (p < 0.001). The ITGBL1-hypermethylated group tended to have a higher bone marrow (BM) blasts ( p = 0.076). Meanwhile, ITGBL1-hypermethylated patients tended to have a lower complete remission (CR) rate ( p = 0.102). ITGBL1-hypermethylated patients had significantly shorter overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) than ITGBL1 hypomethylated patients in whole AML cohort ( p = 0.009 and 0.043, respectively) and patients with nonacute promyelocytic leukemia (APL ; p = 0.023 and 0.039, respectively). Multivariate analysis confirmed that the ITGBL1 methylation served as an independent prognostic factor in both patients with whole-cohort AML ( p = 0.030) and patients with non-APL ( p = 0.020). Furthermore, the ITGBL1 methylation level was significantly decreased in follow-up AML patients who achieved complete remission after induction therapy ( P = 0.001). ITGBL1 methylation negatively correlated with ITGBL1 expression in patients with AML ( R = -0.328, p = 0.008). Moreover, demethylation of ITGBL1 could increase the ITGBL1 expression in the K562 leukemic cell line ( p < 0.05). In conclusion, the ITGBL1 hypermethylation is a potential biomarker for predicting prognosis and monitoring disease status in patients with AML.","['Lian, Xin-Yue', 'Ma, Ji-Chun', 'Zhou, Jing-Dong', 'Zhang, Ting-Juan', 'Wu, De-Hong', 'Deng, Zhao-Qun', 'Zhang, Zhi-Hui', 'Li, Xi-Xi', 'He, Pin-Fang', 'Yan, Yang', 'Lin, Jiang', 'Qian, Jun']","['Lian XY', 'Ma JC', 'Zhou JD', 'Zhang TJ', 'Wu DH', 'Deng ZQ', 'Zhang ZH', 'Li XX', 'He PF', 'Yan Y', 'Lin J', 'Qian J']","[""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", 'Department of Rheumatology, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China.', ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", 'The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", 'The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", 'The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China.', 'The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China.', ""Department of Hematology, The Third People's Hospital of Kunshan City, Kunshan, Jiangsu, China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", 'The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", 'The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", 'The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China.', ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", 'The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China.', 'The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China.', 'School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China.', ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", 'The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", 'The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181014,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (ITGBL1 protein, human)', '0 (Integrin beta1)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Azacitidine/pharmacology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta1/*genetics/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*ITGBL1', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*expression', '*methylation', '*prognosis']",2018/10/15 06:00,2020/04/14 06:00,['2018/10/15 06:00'],"['2018/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.27629 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2019 Jun;234(6):9438-9446. doi: 10.1002/jcp.27629.

As a result, 668 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DELs) were found between the PE and RE. Further study showed that lncRNA882, regulated by estrogen (E2) and progestin (P4), could act as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) for miR-15b, which inhibited the expression of transforming growth factor-b-activated kinase 1 binding protein 3 (TAB3) and then indirectly regulated the level of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF).

Little knowledge is available about immunosuppressive and tumor-promoting properties of chronic myeloid leukemia derived exosomes in bone marrow stromal components. We report here that K562-derived exosomes can affect the gene expression, cytokine secretion, nitric oxide (NO) production, and redox potential of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) and macrophages. Human BM-MSCs and mouse macrophages were treated with K562-derived exosomes. Our results demonstrated that the expression of the genes involved in hematopoietic developmental pathways and immune responses, including C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (Cxcl12), Dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK1), wnt5a, interleukin 6 (IL-6), transforming growth factor-beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), changed with respect to time and exosome concentration in BM-MSCs. The TNF-alpha level was higher in exosome-treated BM-MSCs compared with the control. Exosome treatment of BM-MSCs led to an increased production of NO and a decreased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. We have shown that K562-derived exosomes induce overexpression of IL-10 and TNF-alpha and downregulation of iNOS transcript levels in macrophages. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results showed that TNF-alpha and IL-10 secretions increased in macrophages. Treatment of macrophages with purified exosomes led to reduced NO and ROS levels. These results suggest that K562-derived exosomes may alter the local bone marrow niche toward a leukemia-reinforcing microenvironment. They can modulate the inflammatory molecules (TNF-alpha and NO) and the redox potential of BM-MSCs and macrophages and direct the polarization of macrophages toward tumor-associated macrophages.","['Jafarzadeh, Nazli', 'Safari, Zohreh', 'Pornour, Majid', 'Amirizadeh, Naser', 'Forouzandeh Moghadam, Mehdi', 'Sadeghizadeh, Majid']","['Jafarzadeh N', 'Safari Z', 'Pornour M', 'Amirizadeh N', 'Forouzandeh Moghadam M', 'Sadeghizadeh M']","['Department of Genetics, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Genetics, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Photo Healing and Regeneration, Medical Laser Research Center, Yara Institute, Academic Center for Education Culture and Research (ACECR), Tehran, Iran.', 'Blood Transfusion Research Center, High Institute for Education and Research in Transfusion Medicine, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, Faculty of Medical Science, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Genetics, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181014,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (NOS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Communication', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Exosomes/genetics/immunology/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Macrophages/immunology/*metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/immunology/*metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II/genetics/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', '*Stem Cell Niche', 'Tumor Escape', '*Tumor Microenvironment']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC)', '*chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)-derived exosomes', '*immunosuppression', '*macrophages', '*tumor microenvironment']",2018/10/15 06:00,2020/03/17 06:00,['2018/10/15 06:00'],"['2018/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.27142 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2019 Apr;234(4):3697-3710. doi: 10.1002/jcp.27142.

RECENT FINDINGS: For T cell neoplasms, despite significant research effort, only few agents, such as monoclonal antibodies and allogeneic stem cell transplantation, showed some clinical activity. One of the major hurdles to targeting T cell neoplasms is that activation or elimination of T cells, either normal or neoplastic, can cause significant toxicity. A need to develop novel safe and effective immunotherapies for T cell neoplasms exists. In this review, we will discuss the rationale for immunotherapy of T cell leukemia and lymphoma and present the most recent therapeutic approaches.","['Ghione, Paola', 'Moskowitz, Alison J', 'De Paola, Nadia E K', 'Horwitz, Steven M', 'Ruella, Marco']","['Ghione P', 'Moskowitz AJ', 'De Paola NEK', 'Horwitz SM', 'Ruella M']","['Lymphoma Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Lymphoma Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Lymphoma Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Lymphoma Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA. mruella@upenn.edu.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA. mruella@upenn.edu.']",['eng'],"['K99 CA212302/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA214278/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 CA212302/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,,IM,"['Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/immunology/*therapy']",PMC6295363,['NOTNLM'],"['*CART cell therapy', '*Immune checkpoint inhibitors', '*Immunotherapy', '*T cell lymphoma', '*T-ALL']",2018/10/15 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2018/10/15 06:00'],"['2018/10/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-018-0480-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-018-0480-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2018 Dec;13(6):494-506. doi: 10.1007/s11899-018-0480-8.,,,,,['NIHMS1509675'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Median age was 51.1 years, and median follow-up time was 3 years. Overall, 119 patients had 221 skin cancers. The incidences of squamous cell carcinomas (incidence rate ratio = 9.8; 95% confidence interval = 7.7-12.3), basal cell carcinomas (incidence rate ratio = 2.5; 95% confidence interval = 1.9-3.2), and melanoma (standardized incidence ratio = 3.3; 95% confidence interval = 1.7-5.9) were elevated in our cohort. In multivariable models, risk factors for squamous cell carcinomas were increased age (P < 0.0001), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (P = 0.02), and chronic graft-versus-host disease (P = 0.0002). Risk factors for basal cell carcinomas were chronic lymphocytic leukemia (P = 0.003), reduced-intensity conditioning (P = 0.02), acute graft-versus-host disease (P = 0.03), and chronic graft-versus-host disease (P = 0.003). To our knowledge, previously unreported risk factors in this contemporary cohort include prior CLL for squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma and reduced-intensity conditioning for basal cell carcinoma.

The main objective of this study is to understand the role of IR signaling in pluripotency and lineage development. METHODS: To explore the role of IR signaling, we generated IR knock-out (IRKO) mouse induced pluripotent stem cells (miPSCs) from E14.5 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) of global IRKO mice using a cocktail of four reprogramming factors: Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, cMyc. We performed pluripotency characterization and directed the differentiation of control and IRKO iPSCs into neural progenitors (ectoderm), adipocyte progenitors (mesoderm), and pancreatic beta-like cells (endoderm). We mechanistically confirmed these findings via phosphoproteomics analyses of control and IRKO iPSCs. RESULTS: Interestingly, expression of pluripotency markers including Klf4, Lin28a, Tbx3, and cMyc were upregulated, while abundance of Oct4 and Nanog were enhanced by 4-fold and 3-fold, respectively, in IRKO iPSCs. Analyses of signaling pathways demonstrated downregulation of phospho-STAT3, p-mTor and p-Erk and an increase in the total mTor and Erk proteins in IRKO iPSCs in the basal unstimulated state. Stimulation with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) showed a approximately 33% decrease of phospho-ERK in IRKO iPSCs. On the contrary, Erk phosphorylation was increased during in vitro spontaneous differentiation of iPSCs lacking IRs. Lineage-specific directed differentiation of the iPSCs revealed that cells lacking IR showed enhanced expression of neuronal lineage markers (Pax6, Tubb3, Ascl1 and Oligo2) while exhibiting a decrease in adipocyte (Fas, Acc, Ppargamma, Fabp4, C/ebpalpha, and Fsp27) and pancreatic beta cell markers (Ngn3, Isl1, and Sox9). Further molecular characterization by phosphoproteomics confirmed the novel IR-mediated regulation of the global pluripotency network including several key proteins involved in diverse aspects of growth and embryonic development. CONCLUSION: We report, for the first time to our knowledge, the phosphoproteome of insulin, IGF1, and LIF stimulation in mouse iPSCs to reveal the importance of insulin receptor signaling for the maintenance of pluripotency and lineage determination.","['Gupta, Manoj K', 'De Jesus, Dario F', 'Kahraman, Sevim', 'Valdez, Ivan A', 'Shamsi, Farnaz', 'Yi, Lian', 'Swensen, Adam C', 'Tseng, Yu-Hua', 'Qian, Wei-Jun', 'Kulkarni, Rohit N']","['Gupta MK', 'De Jesus DF', 'Kahraman S', 'Valdez IA', 'Shamsi F', 'Yi L', 'Swensen AC', 'Tseng YH', 'Qian WJ', 'Kulkarni RN']","[""Islet Cell and Regenerative Biology, Joslin Diabetes Center, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA."", ""Islet Cell and Regenerative Biology, Joslin Diabetes Center, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA; Graduate Program in Areas of Basic and Applied Biology (GABBA), Abel Salazar Biomedical Sciences Institute, University of Porto, 5000 Porto, Portugal."", ""Islet Cell and Regenerative Biology, Joslin Diabetes Center, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA."", ""Islet Cell and Regenerative Biology, Joslin Diabetes Center, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA."", 'Section of Integrative Physiology and Metabolism, Joslin Diabetes Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Biological Sciences Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA 99352, USA.', 'Biological Sciences Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA 99352, USA.', 'Section of Integrative Physiology and Metabolism, Joslin Diabetes Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Biological Sciences Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA 99352, USA.', ""Islet Cell and Regenerative Biology, Joslin Diabetes Center, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.

In an effort to enhance the effectiveness of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) treatment and to investigate the potential therapeutic value of Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibition synergism with chemotherapy, we designed experiments to evaluate the effect of Arsenic trioxide (ATO) in combination with BKM120 for the treatment of APL-derived NB4 cells. The results of the present study highlighted the favorable outcome of the PI3K inhibition using BKM120 in potentiating the anti-cancer effect of ATO, while reducing its cytotoxic concentration. Investigating the molecular mechanisms leading to this synergistic effect showed that probably down-regulation of the transcription factor SIRT1 coupled with suppression of c-Myc might halt the progression of the cell cycle from the G1 phase, resulting in the enhanced growth suppressive effect in ATO-plus-BKM120 combination. Moreover, we found that the positive regulatory role of the PI3K inhibition in augmenting the intracellular level of reactive oxygen species disturbed the balance between the death promoter and death repressor genes, which in turn amplified the caspase-3-dependent apoptotic activity of ATO in NB4. By and large, this study laid a therapeutic value on BKM120 in combination with ATO and suggested this combination as a novel therapeutic strategy that may be clinically accessible in the near future.","['Bashash, Davood', 'Delshad, Mahda', 'Riyahi, Niknam', 'Safaroghli-Azar, Ava', 'Pourbagheri-Sigaroodi, Atieh', 'Momeny, Majid']","['Bashash D', 'Delshad M', 'Riyahi N', 'Safaroghli-Azar A', 'Pourbagheri-Sigaroodi A', 'Momeny M']","['Proteomics Research Center, Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

In a previous study, we observed that BLV-infected heifers produced a lower amount of antibodies in response to FMDV at first vaccination.

We screened the patient using medical examinations, but there was no obvious presence of malignancy. Although preoperative computed tomography showed a small lymph node swelling at the left renal hilum, we diagnosed it as an insignificant lymph node. When a laparoscopic donor nephrectomy was performed, however, we recognized the small lymph node during the surgery and performed a lymphadenectomy.

METHODS: This retrospective observational study analyzed records of children aged <18 years with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) registered for treatment at a tertiary-care teaching hospital, North India, between 1995 and 2012. Children who refused or abandoned therapy were tracked, and reasons for refusal/abandonment were recorded by telephone interviews or by surface mail. Sociodemographic parameters were compared using chi-square/Student t-test to identify predictors of refusal/abandonment. RESULTS: Treatment refusal was noted in 16.8% (96/572) of children with ALL; it was statistically higher for infants (p = 0.004), girls (p = 0.04), children of parents with poor literacy (p < 0.001), and those of lower socioeconomic status (p < 0.001). Main causes of treatment refusal were financial constraints (59.4%) and a misplaced belief about the incurability of cancer (22.9%). Therapy once started, was abandoned by 139/476 children (29.2%), the majority (41%) during induction, followed by maintenance (17.9%). Major reasons for abandonment were financial constraints (34.5%), false perception of cure (20%), poor general condition of the child (15%), no improvement in the child (13%), and blood donation refusal (3%). The reasons cited were different in different treatment phases. Abandonment was statistically higher in children from rural background (p < 0.001) or lower socioeconomic status (p < 0.001), and in those with fathers having a lower literacy status (p < 0.001). Low hemoglobin (p = 0.01) and severe wasting (p = 0.01) was greater in children who abandoned treatment. CONCLUSION: Treatment refusal or abandonment, noted in 40% of children, was due mainly to monetary difficulties, disbeliefs regarding curability, or false perceptions of cure; these factors need to be addressed to improve survival, particularly in children from rural areas and those of parents with a lower literacy status.","['Alam, Areesha', 'Kumar, Archana']","['Alam A', 'Kumar A']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, King George's Medical University, Shah Mina Road, Chowk, Lucknow, India."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, King George's Medical University, Shah Mina Road, Chowk, Lucknow, India.

The study proved that BDMC suppresses beta-hexosaminidase release, granule release, and membrane ruffling in monoclonal anti-2,4,6-dinitrophenyl-immunoglobulin (Ig) E/human serum albumin (DNP-IgE/HSA)-stimulated rat basophilic leukaemia cells (RBL-2H3 cells), and BDMC suppressed ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic rhinitis (AR) symptoms and OVA-specific IgE levels in AR mice. Furthermore, BDMC increased the survival of compound 48/80 anaphylaxis shock mice and elevated the decreased rectal temperature in OVA-induced active systemic anaphylaxis mice. These findings indicate that BDMC regulates the degranulation of mast cells, demonstrating its potential in the treatment of mast cell-induced allergic reactions.","['Fu, Meng', 'Fu, Shuilian', 'Ni, Saihong', 'Wang, Danni', 'Hong, Tie']","['Fu M', 'Fu S', 'Ni S', 'Wang D', 'Hong T']","['Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Jilin University, Changchun 130021, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Jilin University, Changchun 130021, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Jilin University, Changchun 130021, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Jilin University, Changchun 130021, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Jilin University, Changchun 130021, China.

To examine in-hospital survival, a full primary model and a base model with the least significant covariate from the primary model were established. Relative importance of covariates was calculated using percentages of difference in log-likelihood values when each covariate was iteratively added to the base model. A total of 154 unique patients with GNBSI were included. The primary model included active cefepime therapy (P=0.004), normalised days to positive culture (P=0.091), intensive care unit (ICU) at time of treatment (P=0.001), modified Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score on day zero (P=0.025), history of leukaemia (P=0.008) and prior immunosuppressive therapy (P=0.088).

Here, we investigated the role of TCF4 in myelopoiesis. Overexpression of TCF4 (TCF4(OE)) in umbilical cord blood (UCB) cells resulted in a twofold increase in erythroid colony forming units (CFU-Es), whereas knock-down (KD) of TCF4 (TCF4(KD)) caused a dramatic decrease in the number of erythroid colonies. In megakaryocyte CFUs (CFU-MKs), both TCF4(KD) and TCF4(OE) inhibited MK colony formation. TCF4 did not have an impact on granulocyte, macrophage, or granulocyte-macrophage colonies or on the proportion of MK-erythrocyte progenitors (MEPs) in culture. Because TCF4 affects erythroid/MK development and these lineages are affected in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), we studied the impact of TCF4 expression in this disease. MDS patients with high (>/=median) TCF4 mRNA expression had higher hemoglobin (Hb) levels than MDS patients with low TCF4 expression (mean 9.0 vs. 8.55 g/dL, p=0.02). Overall, TCF4 mRNA expression was lower in hematopoietic stem cells, common myeloid progenitors, and MEPs from MDS patients, but not in granulocyte-macrophage progenitors, compared with healthy controls. Therefore, in cell fractions with erythroid lineage potential, TCF4 is expressed less in MDS patients than in healthy controls. This correlates with the low overall Hb levels seen in MDS patients compared with healthy individuals and is consistent with the positive impact of TCF4 on erythroid development while not having impact on white colonies. These results indicate a role for TCF4 as a novel factor in erythroid-megakaryocytic differentiation.","[""In 't Hout, Florentien E M"", 'van Duren, Jolanda', 'Monteferrario, Davide', 'Brinkhuis, Emma', 'Mariani, Niccolo', 'Westers, Theresia M', 'Chitu, Dana', 'Nikoloski, Gorica', 'van de Loosdrecht, Arjan A', 'van der Reijden, Bert A', 'Jansen, Joop H', 'Huls, Gerwin']","[""In 't Hout FEM"", 'van Duren J', 'Monteferrario D', 'Brinkhuis E', 'Mariani N', 'Westers TM', 'Chitu D', 'Nikoloski G', 'van de Loosdrecht AA', 'van der Reijden BA', 'Jansen JH', 'Huls G']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Laboratory of Hematology, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Laboratory of Hematology, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Laboratory of Hematology, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Laboratory of Hematology, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Laboratory of Hematology, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'HOVON Data Center, Erasmus University Medical Center-Daniel den Hoed, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Laboratory of Hematology, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Laboratory of Hematology, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Laboratory of Hematology, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

Compounds that disrupt the interaction between menin, a chromatin-binding protein, and oncogenic mixed lineage leukemia fusion proteins (MLL-FPs) have shown significant promise in preclinical models of leukemia and have a high degree of selectivity for leukemia versus normal hematopoietic cells. Biochemical and structural studies demonstrate that, in addition to disrupting the menin-MLL-FP interaction, such compounds also inhibit menin-MLL1, menin-MLL2, and other menin-interacting proteins. Here, we address the degree to which disruption of menin-MLL-FP interactions or menin-MLL1/MLL2 interactions contribute to the antileukemia effect of menin inhibition. We show that Men1 deletion in MLL-AF9-transformed leukemia cells produces distinct cellular and molecular consequences compared with Mll1;Mll2 co-deletion and that compounds disrupting menin-MLL N-terminal interactions largely phenocopy menin loss. Moreover, we show that Mll1;Mll2-deficient leukemia cells exhibit enhanced sensitivity to menin interaction inhibitors, which is consistent with each regulating complementary genetic pathways. These data illustrate the heightened dependency of MLL-FPs on menin compared with wild-type MLL1/MLL2 for regulation of downstream target genes and argue that the predominant action of menin inhibitory compounds is through direct inhibition of MLL-FPs without significant contribution from MLL1/MLL2 inhibition.","['Chen, Yufei', 'Jones, Kenneth L', 'Anastassiadis, Konstantinos', 'Kranz, Andrea', 'Stewart, A Francis', 'Grembecka, Jolanta', 'Meyerson, Matthew', 'Ernst, Patricia']","['Chen Y', 'Jones KL', 'Anastassiadis K', 'Kranz A', 'Stewart AF', 'Grembecka J', 'Meyerson M', 'Ernst P']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado, Denver/Anschutz Medical Campus.

RESULTS: Patient 1 at cycle 6 was able to stand, gait was possible with monolateral support, hypoesthesia and strength improved. M-protein and IgM level decreased. In patient 2, already after three cycles, the monoclonal component disappeared and there was dramatic improvement of symptoms and gait normalization. At the end of therapy anti-MAG antibody titer decreased to 5462 BTU. Neurophysiology also improved. CONCLUSIONS: In our patients, obinutuzumab was effective as a first-line treatment of anti-MAG antibody polyneuropathy. CLL might have had a role in the response to therapy, but the associations might be considered in future trials.","['Briani, C', 'Visentin, A', 'Salvalaggio, A', 'Cacciavillani, M', 'Trentin, L']","['Briani C', 'Visentin A', 'Salvalaggio A', 'Cacciavillani M', 'Trentin L']","['Neurology Unit, Department of Neuroscience, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Neurology Unit, Department of Neuroscience, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'CEMES, Data Medica Group, Padova, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20181127,England,Eur J Neurol,European journal of neurology,9506311,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Myelin-Associated Glycoprotein)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', 'O43472U9X8 (obinutuzumab)']",IM,"['Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*therapeutic use', 'Autoantibodies/immunology', 'Chlorambucil/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications', 'Male', 'Myelin-Associated Glycoprotein/*immunology', 'Polyneuropathies/complications/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*anti-MAG neuropathy', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*obinutuzumab', '*paraprotein']",2018/10/14 06:00,2019/06/25 06:00,['2018/10/14 06:00'],"['2018/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/25 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ene.13838 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Neurol. 2019 Feb;26(2):371-375. doi: 10.1111/ene.13838.

Histamine dihydrochloride (HDC), a NOX2 inhibitor, exerts anti-cancer efficacy in experimental tumor models but the detailed mechanisms are insufficiently understood. To determine effects of HDC on the MDSC compartment we utilized three murine cancer models known to entail accumulation of MDSC, i.e. EL-4 lymphoma, MC-38 colorectal carcinoma, and 4T1 mammary carcinoma. In vivo treatment with HDC delayed EL-4 and 4T1 tumor growth and reduced the ROS formation by intratumoral MDSCs. HDC treatment of EL-4 bearing mice also reduced the accumulation of intratumoral MDSCs and reduced MDSC-induced suppression of T cells ex vivo. Experiments using GR1-depleted and Nox2 knock out mice supported that the anti-tumor efficacy of HDC required presence of NOX2(+) GR1(+) cells in vivo. In addition, treatment with HDC enhanced the anti-tumor efficacy of programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1) and PD-1 ligand checkpoint blockade in EL-4- and MC-38-bearing mice. Immunomodulatory effects of a HDC-containing regimen on MDSCs were further analyzed in a phase IV trial (Re:Mission Trial, ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT01347996) where patients with acute myeloid leukemia received HDC in conjunction with low-dose IL-2 (HDC/IL-2) for relapse prevention. Peripheral CD14(+)HLA-DR(-/low) MDSCs (M-MDSCs) were reduced during cycles of HDC/IL-2 therapy and a pronounced reduction of M-MDSCs during HDC/IL-2 treatment heralded favorable clinical outcome. We propose that anti-tumor properties of HDC may comprise the targeting of MDSCs.","['Grauers Wiktorin, Hanna', 'Nilsson, Malin S', 'Kiffin, Roberta', 'Sander, Frida Ewald', 'Lenox, Brianna', 'Rydstrom, Anna', 'Hellstrand, Kristoffer', 'Martner, Anna']","['Grauers Wiktorin H', 'Nilsson MS', 'Kiffin R', 'Sander FE', 'Lenox B', 'Rydstrom A', 'Hellstrand K', 'Martner A']","['TIMM Laboratory, Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, University of Gothenburg, Medicinaregatan 1F, Box 425, 413 90, Goteborg, Sweden.', 'TIMM Laboratory, Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, University of Gothenburg, Medicinaregatan 1F, Box 425, 413 90, Goteborg, Sweden.', 'TIMM Laboratory, Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, University of Gothenburg, Medicinaregatan 1F, Box 425, 413 90, Goteborg, Sweden.', 'TIMM Laboratory, Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, University of Gothenburg, Medicinaregatan 1F, Box 425, 413 90, Goteborg, Sweden.', 'TIMM Laboratory, Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, University of Gothenburg, Medicinaregatan 1F, Box 425, 413 90, Goteborg, Sweden.', 'TIMM Laboratory, Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, University of Gothenburg, Medicinaregatan 1F, Box 425, 413 90, Goteborg, Sweden.', 'TIMM Laboratory, Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, University of Gothenburg, Medicinaregatan 1F, Box 425, 413 90, Goteborg, Sweden.', 'TIMM Laboratory, Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, University of Gothenburg, Medicinaregatan 1F, Box 425, 413 90, Goteborg, Sweden. anna.martner@gu.se.']",['eng'],"['2016-01928/Vetenskapsradet', 'ALFGBG-724881/The Swedish state via the ALF agreement', 'CAN 2016/351/Cancerfonden']",['Journal Article'],20181012,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (Histamine Agonists)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antibodies/immunology/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'B7-H1 Antigen/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Clinical Trials, Phase IV as Topic', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Histamine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Histamine Agonists/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy/immunology/metabolism', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6394491,['NOTNLM'],"['Checkpoint inhibition', 'Histamine dihydrochloride', 'Myeloid-derived suppressor cells', 'NOX2', 'PD-1', 'Reactive oxygen species']",2018/10/14 06:00,2019/02/26 06:00,['2018/10/14 06:00'],"['2018/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/26 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00262-018-2253-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s00262-018-2253-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2019 Feb;68(2):163-174. doi: 10.1007/s00262-018-2253-6.

In this review, we discuss the prognostic role and therapeutic implications of chromosome 17p deletions and TP53 mutations in CLL. Unlike other recurrent genetic abnormalities, the frequency of TP53 alterations is relatively low in newly diagnosed patients, but increases sharply with disease progression, which suggests that these alterations represent an evolutionary mechanism of resistance. In comparison with patients without such abnormalities, those with 17p deletions and TP53 mutations have lower response rates and more aggressive disease. One important consequence of the diverse molecular mechanisms that affect the TP53 pathway is the need to assess both the presence of 17p deletion and TP53 mutations before treatment initiation. Several authors have attempted to incorporate TP53 abnormalities in different prognostic models for CLL, and the recent International Prognostic Index for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia formally considers patients with TP53 abnormalities (deletion 17p or TP53 mutation or both) as high-risk. Several novel agents may improve results in patients with CLL, including in those with TP53 mutations. Ibrutinib, idelalisib, and venetoclax have been approved in various settings and countries for treatment of CLL. Further progress in targeted therapy and judicious use of chemotherapy, monoclonal antibodies, and reduced-intensity allogeneic transplantation will provide patients with CLL in general, and those with TP53 abnormalities in particular, with a better prognosis.","['Buccheri, Valeria', 'Barreto, Wolney Gois', 'Fogliatto, Laura Maria', 'Capra, Marcelo', 'Marchiani, Mariana', 'Rocha, Vanderson']","['Buccheri V', 'Barreto WG', 'Fogliatto LM', 'Capra M', 'Marchiani M', 'Rocha V']","['Hospital das Clinicas da Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo/ICESP, Av.

Absolute survival benefit was evaluated with 1-year, 3-year, and median OS; relative benefit was evaluated with univariate and covariate-adjusted hazard ratios. CR conveyed a relative survival advantage in multivariable analysis, with a similar relative effect of CR across studies. CR also conferred an absolute survival benefit, but with a smaller magnitude of absolute benefit in the azacytidine trials. In AML, OS was similar for CRi and failure to achieve CR/CRi. In MDS, CR conferred a survival advantage versus HI and HI versus failure. The relative survival benefit of CR was similar regardless of initial therapy for AML or high-risk MDS.

The ALLG CML8 study enrolled 40 imatinib-treated patients with undetectable BCR-ABL1 mRNA (approximately MR(4.5)). Molecular relapse was defined as detectable BCR-ABL1 on two consecutive tests or any single value >0.1%. With a median follow-up of 8.6 years (range 5.7-11.2 years), 18 patients remain in continuous TFR (45.0%; 95% confidence interval 31.9-63.4%). The latest relapse detected was 27 months after stopping imatinib. No patient progressed to advanced phase. Twenty-two patients met criteria for imatinib re-treatment and all regained undetectable molecular response. Nine patients in long-term TFR were monitored by highly sensitive individualized BCR-ABL1 DNA PCR in a sufficient number of samples to enable more precise quantification of residual leukemia. BCR-ABL1 DNA decreased from a median of MR(5.0) in the first year of TFR to MR(6.1) in the sixth year of TFR. Our results support the long-term safety and remarkable stability of response after imatinib discontinuation in appropriately selected CML patients. Serial high sensitivity testing provides a new and unexpected finding of gradually reducing CML cells in patients in long-term TFR.","['Ross, David M', 'Pagani, Ilaria S', 'Shanmuganathan, Naranie', 'Kok, Chung H', 'Seymour, John F', 'Mills, Anthony K', 'Filshie, Robin J', 'Arthur, Christopher K', 'Dang, Phuong', 'Saunders, Verity A', 'Braley, Jodi', 'Yong, Agnes S', 'Yeung, David T', 'White, Deborah L', 'Grigg, Andrew P', 'Schwarer, Anthony P', 'Branford, Susan', 'Hughes, Timothy P']","['Ross DM', 'Pagani IS', 'Shanmuganathan N', 'Kok CH', 'Seymour JF', 'Mills AK', 'Filshie RJ', 'Arthur CK', 'Dang P', 'Saunders VA', 'Braley J', 'Yong AS', 'Yeung DT', 'White DL', 'Grigg AP', 'Schwarer AP', 'Branford S', 'Hughes TP']","['Cancer Theme, South Australian Health & Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, Australia.

Proteasome inhibitors (PIs) are initially effective in the treatment of MM, although cures are not achievable and the emergence of resistance limits the durability of responses. New therapies are needed for refractory patients, and those that combat resistance to standard of care agents would be particularly valuable. Screening of multiple chemical libraries for PI re-sensitizing compounds identified E61 as a potent enhancer of multiple PIs and MM specific activity. Using a tandem approach of click chemistry and peptide mass fingerprinting, we identified multiple protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family members as the primary molecular targets of E61. PDIs mediate oxidative protein folding, and E61 treatment induced robust ER and oxidative stress responses as well as the accumulation of ubiquitinylated proteins. A chemical optimization program led to a new structural class of indene (exemplified by lead E64FC26), which are highly potent pan-style inhibitors of PDIs. In mice with MM, E64FC26 improved survival and enhanced the activity of bortezomib without any adverse effects. This work demonstrates the potential of E64FC26 as an early drug candidate and the strategy of targeting multiple PDI isoforms for the treatment of refractory MM and beyond.","['Robinson, Reeder M', 'Reyes, Leticia', 'Duncan, Ravyn M', 'Bian, Haiyan', 'Reitz, Allen B', 'Manevich, Yefim', 'McClure, Jesse J', 'Champion, Matthew M', 'Chou, C James', 'Sharik, Meahgen E', 'Chesi, Marta', 'Bergsagel, P Leif', 'Dolloff, Nathan G']","['Robinson RM', 'Reyes L', 'Duncan RM', 'Bian H', 'Reitz AB', 'Manevich Y', 'McClure JJ', 'Champion MM', 'Chou CJ', 'Sharik ME', 'Chesi M', 'Bergsagel PL', 'Dolloff NG']","['Department of Cell and Molecular Pharmacology & Experimental Therapeutics, College of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA.', 'Department of Cell and Molecular Pharmacology & Experimental Therapeutics, College of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA.', 'Department of Cell and Molecular Pharmacology & Experimental Therapeutics, College of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA.', 'Fox Chase Chemical Diversity Center, Inc., Doylestown, PA, USA.', 'Fox Chase Chemical Diversity Center, Inc., Doylestown, PA, USA.', 'Department of Cell and Molecular Pharmacology & Experimental Therapeutics, College of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Biomedical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, College of Science, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Biomedical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic Arizona, Scottsdale, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic Arizona, Scottsdale, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic Arizona, Scottsdale, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Cell and Molecular Pharmacology & Experimental Therapeutics, College of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA. dolloffn@musc.edu.']",['eng'],"['P20GM103542/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | NIH | National', 'Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)/International', 'T32 CA193201/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R42 CA213488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR029882/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R41 CA213488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA190045/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R41CA213488-01/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | NIH | National', 'Cancer Institute (NCI)/International', 'R01 CA234181/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA138313/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 GM103542/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000062/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA186781/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181012,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Indenes)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)', 'EC 5.3.4.1 (Protein Disulfide-Isomerases)']",,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Combinatorial Chemistry Techniques', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays', 'Humans', 'Indenes/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Proteasome Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Disulfide-Isomerases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Small Molecule Libraries/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC7194280,,,2018/10/14 06:00,2019/08/10 06:00,['2018/10/14 06:00'],"['2018/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/24 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/10 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0263-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0263-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Apr;33(4):1011-1022. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0263-1.

We therefore applied high-resolution chromosomal conformation capture sequencing to map the three-dimensional (3D) organization of the human locus encoding the key myeloid transcription factor PU.1 in healthy monocytes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. We identified a dynamic approximately 75-kb unit (SubTAD) as the genomic region in which spatial interactions between PU.1 gene regulatory elements occur during myeloid differentiation and are interrupted in AML. Within this SubTAD, proper initiation of the spatial chromosomal interactions requires PU.1 autoregulation and recruitment of the chromatin-adaptor protein LDB1 (LIM domain-binding protein 1). However, once these spatial interactions have occurred, LDB1 stabilizes them independently of PU.1 autoregulation. Thus, our data support that PU.1 autoregulates its expression in a ""hit-and-run"" manner by initiating stable chromosomal loops that result in a transcriptionally active chromatin architecture.","['Schuetzmann, Daniel', 'Walter, Carolin', 'van Riel, Boet', 'Kruse, Sabrina', 'Konig, Thorsten', 'Erdmann, Tabea', 'Tonges, Alexander', 'Bindels, Eric', 'Weilemann, Andre', 'Gebhard, Claudia', 'Wethmar, Klaus', 'Perrod, Chiara', 'Minderjahn, Julia', 'Rehli, Michael', 'Delwel, Ruud', 'Lenz, Georg', 'Groschel, Stefan', 'Dugas, Martin', 'Rosenbauer, Frank']","['Schuetzmann D', 'Walter C', 'van Riel B', 'Kruse S', 'Konig T', 'Erdmann T', 'Tonges A', 'Bindels E', 'Weilemann A', 'Gebhard C', 'Wethmar K', 'Perrod C', 'Minderjahn J', 'Rehli M', 'Delwel R', 'Lenz G', 'Groschel S', 'Dugas M', 'Rosenbauer F']","['Institute of Molecular Tumor Biology and.', 'Institute of Medical Informatics, Medical Faculty, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Tumor Biology and.', 'Molecular Leukemogenesis Group, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Tumor Biology and.', 'Department of Medicine A, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Tumor Biology and.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medicine A, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'i3S, Instituto de Investigacao e Inovacao em Saude and Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular, Universidade do Porto, Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medicine A, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Molecular Leukemogenesis Group, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Internal Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany; and.', 'German Cancer Consortium, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Informatics, Medical Faculty, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Tumor Biology and.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181012,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)']",IM,"['Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genetic Loci', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism', '*Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",,,,2018/10/14 06:00,2019/07/17 06:00,['2018/10/14 06:00'],"['2018/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/17 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)42917-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2018-02-834721 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Dec 20;132(25):2643-2655. doi: 10.1182/blood-2018-02-834721.

Most affected infants spontaneously resolve, although some patients culminate in hepatic failure despite the hematological remission. It is impossible to determine the patients who are at high risk of progressive liver disease and leukemic transformation. The objective is to search for biomarkers predicting the development of hepatic failure in DS infants with TAM. METHODS: Among 60 newborn infants with DS consecutively admitted to our institutions from 2003 to 2016, 41 infants with or without TAM were enrolled for the study. Twenty-two TAM-patients were classified into ""progression group"" (n = 7) that required any therapy and ""spontaneous resolution group"" (n = 15). Serum concentrations of chemokines (CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL2 and CCL5) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 were measured at diagnosis of TAM for assessing the outcome of progressive disease. RESULTS: Three patients developed leukemia during the study period (median, 1147 days; range, 33-3753). Three died of hepatic failure. All patients in the progression group were preterm birth <37 weeks of gestational age and were earlier than those in the spontaneous resolution group (median, 34.7 vs. 37.0 weeks, p < 0.01). The leukocyte counts and CXCL8 and CCL2 levels at diagnosis in the progression group were higher than those in the spontaneous resolution group (leukocyte: median, 81.60 vs. 27.30 x 10(9)/L, p = 0.01; CXCL8: 173.8 vs. 34.3 pg/ml, p < 0.01; CCL2: 790.3 vs. 209.8 pg/mL, p < 0.01).

Epidemiological assessment of MDS has been hampered by evolving diagnostic criteria and delayed classification of MDS as cancers until 2001. The poorly-understood nature of these neoplasms combined with the lack of effective therapies for decades contributed to suboptimal case ascertainment and underreporting. The annual age-adjusted incidence in the United States is approximately 4.0/100,000 persons, and the incidence substantially rises with age. Beyond age, other risk factors include male gender, obesity, smoking, and prior receipt of radiotherapy or chemotherapy, but most cases remain idiopathic in nature. The overall 5-year survival probability remains relatively poor at approximately 31% without a clear temporal improvement in outcomes despite the approval of three MDS-specific therapies since 2004 and increasing use of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Better understanding of epidemiological trends of MDS will likely require incorporation of the key genetic determinants of the disease into consistent diagnostic paradigms that go beyond traditional morphologic assessments. The heterogeneity of the disease and lack of uniformly-defined genetic markers makes such a task difficult. Thorough case ascertainment and reporting efforts can provide vital insights that could inform treatment decisions and eventually improve the outcomes of patients with MDS.","['Zeidan, Amer M', 'Shallis, Rory M', 'Wang, Rong', 'Davidoff, Amy', 'Ma, Xiaomei']","['Zeidan AM', 'Shallis RM', 'Wang R', 'Davidoff A', 'Ma X']","['Section of Hematology, Division of Hematology/Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, USA; Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy, and Effectiveness Research (COPPER) Center, Yale University, New Haven, USA.

Age-adjusted incidence rates to the world standard population (ASRw) were calculated by direct method, and their comparisons were made using incidence rate rations. Survival proportions were calculated by Kaplan-Meier method and their comparisons with log-rank test. The median childhood population less than 15 years old was 296,776 children. A total of 615 cases were recorded from the population-based Childhood Cancer Registry, including all malignant and benign tumors of the central nervous system.Age-standardized incidence rates for all cancers were 176.6 per million. Leukemia incidence rates were highest in rural areas (51.08/million) than in urban areas (33.65/million; P = .018), and by age groups; these differences only remained at age 0 to 4 years with higher rural leukemia incidence (67.13/million) than in urban areas (39.32/million; P = .05). There were no statistically significant differences between rural and urban areas for lymphomas, central nervous system, and all other malignant solid tumors grouped. The 5-year overall survival rate for all patients was 84%, similar to other developed countries, with greater survival in rural areas (88%) compared with urban areas (80%; P = .033). The analysis by tumor groups showed a greater survival rate in rural areas for all the groups, although these differences only reached statistical significance in the group of leukemias, with a survival rate of 90% for rural areas compared with 76% for urban areas (P = .01). Analyzing survival rate by age groups in leukemias only significant survival differences at 10 to 14 years were encountered.We found a higher incidence of leukemia in girls, mainly in rural areas, and also a better survival rate in children diagnosed with leukemia belonging to this population area. Future studies that analyze these facts in similar populations can help us clarify what genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors influence our population and are responsible for these findings.","['Gonzalez Garcia, Hermenegildo', 'Garrote Molpeceres, Rebeca', 'Urbaneja Rodriguez, Elena', 'Gutierrez Melendez, Pilar', 'Herraiz Cristobal, Raquel', 'Pino Vazquez, Maria Asuncion']","['Gonzalez Garcia H', 'Garrote Molpeceres R', 'Urbaneja Rodriguez E', 'Gutierrez Melendez P', 'Herraiz Cristobal R', 'Pino Vazquez MA']","['Division of Haematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Valladolid Clinic University Hospital, C/ Ramon y Cajal.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Valladolid Clinic University Hospital, C/ Ramon y Cajal.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Valladolid Clinic University Hospital, C/ Ramon y Cajal.', 'Health Public Observatory of Junta de Castilla y Leon, Consejeria de Sanidad, Paseo de Zorrilla, Valladolid, Spain.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Valladolid Clinic University Hospital, C/ Ramon y Cajal.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Valladolid Clinic University Hospital, C/ Ramon y Cajal.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Rural Population/*statistics & numerical data', 'Sex Distribution', 'Spain', 'Survival Rate', 'Urban Population/*statistics & numerical data']",PMC6203519,,,2018/10/14 06:00,2018/10/30 06:00,['2018/10/14 06:00'],"['2018/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000012797 [doi]', '00005792-201810120-00090 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2018 Oct;97(41):e12797. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000012797.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lymph node biopsy immunohistochemistry (IHC) for T-lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) requires the establishment of antibody set screening. For identifying T-LBL and early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ETP-ALL) by lymph node biopsy and IHC, WHO has not yet proposed a better IHC antibody combination. PATIENT CONCERNS: Here we reported 1 case with tortuous diagnosis experience. Initially, a 51-year-old man was diagnosed as T-LBL by lymph node biopsy, but in another hospital acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was confirmed by bone marrow puncture. Finally, it was diagnosed as mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) through our comprehensive evaluation including bone marrow cell morphology, cytochemical staining and flow cytometry analysis. Importantly, the experience about differential diagnosis and our appreciation among the T-LBL, ETP-ALL and MPAL was discussed to enlighten readers. DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed with mixed phenotype acute leukemia (T+My)-NOS. INTERVENTIONS: The patient received 1 cycle of VDCLP scheme treatment firstly. The effect of chemotherapy is satisfactory, and then he received continuous treatment and was currently in good condition. OUTCOMES: This patient is alive at present. The follow-up period has been 1 year. LESSONS: For the diagnosis of T-LBL, the molecular markers of the myeloid and lymphoid tissues need to be included, such as CD117, CD33, Lys and MPO. The bone marrow puncture also needs to be conducted to distinguish T-LBL and T-ALL. Secondly, to identify ETP-ALL and MPAL, bone marrow cell morphology, cytochemical staining as well as flow cytometric analysis were needed to make a clear diagnosis. It is recommended that at least CD8, CD1a, Lys and MPO should be included in the panel to identify ETP-ALL.","['Wang, Ping', ""Peng, Xian'gui"", 'Deng, Xiaojuan', 'Gao, Li', 'Zhang, Xi', 'Feng, Yimei']","['Wang P', 'Peng X', 'Deng X', 'Gao L', 'Zhang X', 'Feng Y']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,,IM,"['Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/*diagnosis', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis']",PMC6203574,,,2018/10/14 06:00,2018/10/23 06:00,['2018/10/14 06:00'],"['2018/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000012743 [doi]', '00005792-201810120-00061 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2018 Oct;97(41):e12743. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000012743.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of these published cases, either they were accompanied with lymph node involvement or with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). To our knowledge, this is the first published case of RS of the brain and meninges diagnosed concurrently with CLL in the absence of any evidence of lymphoma outside of the CNS. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 67-year-old female presented with slurred speech, headache, and left-sided hemiparesis. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed an irregular lesion 30 mm in diameter in the right parietal lobe. The mass was totally removed and pathology revealed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) of non-germinal center type by Hans' classification. The patient's leukocyte count was 12.1 x 109/L (76.9% lymphocytes), and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of blood revealed a clonal B-cell population (36.75% leukocytes) corresponding to the immunological CLL profile (Matutes score of 5/5). Bone marrow (BM) aspiration and biopsy also indicated CLL. The analysis of immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IGH) and kappa chain gene (IGK) in the patient's BM and CNS tissue indicated that the DLBCL of the brain was derived from the CLL clone. DIAGNOSES: RS of the CNS diagnosed concurrently with CLL. INTERVENTIONS: The patient received intravenous chemotherapy (6.0 g methotrexate) and intrathecal chemotherapy (10 mg methotrexate, 50 mg cytarabine, 5 mg dexamethasone). OUTCOMES: The patient returned to our department with left-sided hemiparesis and headache 2 weeks after the chemotherapy. Repeat MRI showed progression of the brain lesion. Her general condition deteriorated significantly with confusion and high fever, and she died within a few days at only 10 weeks after the onset of symptoms. LESSONS: The survival of CNS-RS patients is very poor and and is always complicated with multiple and different genetic alterations. Because of chemotherapy insensitivity, a multidisciplinary treatment including surgery and radiotherapy together with novel agents may be an option to improving patient outcomes.","['Xu, Liye', 'Song, Jin Cheng', 'Sun, Xiu Hua', 'Gao, Zi Fen', 'Lv, Li', 'Zhu, Jie']","['Xu L', 'Song JC', 'Sun XH', 'Gao ZF', 'Lv L', 'Zhu J']","['Myeloma and Lymphoma Research Center.', 'Myeloma and Lymphoma Research Center.', 'Myeloma and Lymphoma Research Center, Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning Province.', 'Department of Pathology, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing.', 'Department of Pathology.', 'Flow Cytometry Center, Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Central Nervous System/*pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy/*pathology']",PMC6203471,,,2018/10/14 06:00,2018/10/30 06:00,['2018/10/14 06:00'],"['2018/10/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000012701 [doi]', '00005792-201810120-00047 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2018 Oct;97(41):e12701. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000012701.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the most abundant inflammatory cells, neutrophil has been reported that their apoptosis changed gradually in the circumstance of RA. Apoptosis, one modality of programmed cell death (PCD), is closely associated with autophagy, which indicates neutrophil autophagy may also alter in RA. Flow cytometry, western blotting, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, transmission electron microscope and multiplex antibody microarray were used to comparative investigate the status of neutrophil autophagy in patients with RA and in vitro. The results showed that the expression of autophagy related LC3 protein was up-regulated with lower lysosomal pH in neutrophils from synovial fluid of RA and changed under stimulation of CQ and small RNA interferences (siRNAs) Atg5 transfection, which proved in acute promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cell lines, predominantly a neutrophilic promyelocyte, treated by plasma and synovial fluid from RA. We further found out the concentration of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and MCP-1 was higher in their synovial fluid which may mediate neutrophil autophagy in RA via cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and IL-17 signaling pathway. Our results indicate that neutrophil autophagy may be a novel perspective to understand the pathology which may provide a new maker to diagnose RA and IL-8, IL-10, MCP-1 specific antagonists and neutrophil autophagy target inhibitors may improve the therapeutic effect of RA someday.","['An, Qiyuan', 'Yan, Wenkai', 'Zhao, Yi', 'Yu, Keqiang']","['An Q', 'Yan W', 'Zhao Y', 'Yu K']","['School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China.', 'School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China.', 'Division of Rheumatology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu 610000, China.

Younger patient age and greater difficulty accepting support (attachment security) have been linked to poorer communication experiences with HCPs. The present secondary data analysis examined the impact of age group and attachment security on perceived communication problems with HCPs in adults with acute leukemia (AL). METHODS: The sample included 95 younger (age < 40 years) and 225 older (age >/= 40 years) patients with newly diagnosed or recently relapsed AL. We assessed avoidant and anxious attachment security (reluctance to accept support and fear of its unavailability, respectively) with the modified 16-item Experiences in Close Relationships Scale. The impact of age group and attachment security on perceived communication problems, measured with the Cancer Rehabilitation Evaluation System-Medical Interaction Subscale, was assessed based on the presence and extent of communication problems. RESULTS: Younger patients (OR = 1.79-1.82, P = .030) and those with greater avoidant (OR = 1.44, P = .001) or anxious attachment (OR = 1.38, P = .009) were more likely to report communication problems. A similar relationship was found between age (beta's = -.17-.19, P = .015-.025), avoidant (beta = .29, P = .013), or anxious attachment (beta = .17, P = .031), and the extent of communication problems. A significant age-group x avoidant-attachment interaction (beta = -.31, P = .008) suggested that more avoidant attachment was associated with more perceived communication problems in the younger but not in the older group. CONCLUSIONS: Younger patients with AL, especially those more reluctant to seek or accept support, perceive more communication problems with their HCPs than older patients. Greater attention by HCPs to their communication with younger patients is needed.","['Fraser, Brooke', 'Korenblum, Chana', 'Mah, Kenneth', 'Watt, Sarah', 'Malfitano, Carmine', 'Rydall, Anne', 'Schimmer, Aaron', 'Zimmermann, Camilla', 'Rodin, Gary']","['Fraser B', 'Korenblum C', 'Mah K', 'Watt S', 'Malfitano C', 'Rydall A', 'Schimmer A', 'Zimmermann C', 'Rodin G']","['Department of Supportive Care, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Supportive Care, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Adolescent Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Supportive Care, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Supportive Care, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Supportive Care, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Supportive Care, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Supportive Care, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Supportive Care, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['CIHR MOP-84317/CIHR/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181112,England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Anxiety/*psychology', 'Attitude to Health', 'Communication', '*Defense Mechanisms', 'Female', 'Health Personnel', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*psychology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Object Attachment', '*Professional-Patient Relations']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute leukemia', '*age', '*attachment security', '*cancer', '*communication', '*hematology', '*oncology', '*young adults']",2018/10/13 06:00,2019/12/24 06:00,['2018/10/13 06:00'],"['2018/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/08 00:00 [revised]', '2018/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/24 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pon.4919 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2019 Jan;28(1):122-130. doi: 10.1002/pon.4919.

Accumulating evidence suggests that ionizing radiation can induce genomic instability and promote leukemogenesis in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs); however, the influence of age on this phenomenon has not been elucidated. In this study, infant (1-week-old) or adult (14-week-old) C3H/He mice received sham or 4 Gy whole-body irradiation, and bone marrow cells were transplanted to recipients at day 1 or 60 postirradiation. Twelve days after bone marrow transplant, we analyzed the radiation-induced genomic instability by scoring the frequency of DNA damage and micronucleus formation in colony-forming units-spleen (CFU-Ss). We observed significant increases in DNA damage and micronucleus formation in CFU-Ss of the 4 Gy irradiated adult cells transplanted at day 1 or 60 postirradiation. However, the frequency of DNA damage focus and micronucleus formation in CFU-Ss of 4 Gy irradiated infant cells transplanted at day 1 or 60 postirradiation was relatively decreased. Quantitative differences in the reactive oxygen species and cells expressing inducible nitric oxide synthase in CFU-Ss suggested that age-dependent radiation-induced genomic instability may result from chronic oxidative stress by pro-inflammatory states in HSC descendants after radiation exposure.","['Ariyoshi, Kentaro', 'Miura, Tomisato', 'Kasai, Kosuke', 'Akifumi, Nakata', 'Fujishima, Yohei', 'Yoshida, Mitsuaki A']","['Ariyoshi K', 'Miura T', 'Kasai K', 'Akifumi N', 'Fujishima Y', 'Yoshida MA']","['a Department of Radiation Biology, Institute of Radiation Emergency Medicine, Hirosaki University, Hirosaki 036-8564, Japan.', 'b Department of Biomedical Sciences, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Health Sciences, Hirosaki 036-8564, Japan.', 'b Department of Biomedical Sciences, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Health Sciences, Hirosaki 036-8564, Japan.', 'c Department of Basic Pharmacy, Hokkaido Pharmaceutical University School of Pharmacy, Otaru, 047-0264, Japan.', 'b Department of Biomedical Sciences, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Health Sciences, Hirosaki 036-8564, Japan.', 'a Department of Radiation Biology, Institute of Radiation Emergency Medicine, Hirosaki University, Hirosaki 036-8564, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181012,United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,,,,,,,2018/10/13 06:00,2018/10/13 06:00,['2018/10/13 06:00'],"['2018/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1667/RR15113.1 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Radiat Res. 2018 Oct 12. doi: 10.1667/RR15113.1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to fabricate a novelty DNA nanostructure drug delivery system target on PTK7-positive cells-CCRF-CEM (human T-cell ALL). METHODS: Aptamer-modified tetrahedron DNA was synthesized through one-step thermal annealing process. The sgc8c-TDNs (s-TDNs) loading DOX complexes were applied to investigate the effect to PTK7-negative and -positive cells. RESULTS: When s-TDN:DOX acted on PTK7-positive and -negative cells respectively, the complexes exhibited specific toxic effect on PTK7-positive cells but not on PTK7-negative Ramos cells in vitro research. CONCLUSIONS: In this work, we successfully constructed a PTK7-targeting aptamer-guided DNA tetrahedral nanostructure (s-TDN) as a drug delivery system via a facile one-pot synthesis method. The results showed that s-TDN:DOX exhibited enhanced cytotoxicity against PTK7-positive CCRF-CEM cells, with a minor effect against PTK7-negative Ramos cells. Hence, this functionalized TDNs drug delivery system displayed its potential application in targeting PTK7-positive tumour T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.","['Liu, Mengting', 'Ma, Wenjuan', 'Li, Qianshun', 'Zhao, Dan', 'Shao, Xiaoru', 'Huang, Qian', 'Hao, Liying', 'Lin, Yunfeng']","['Liu M', 'Ma W', 'Li Q', 'Zhao D', 'Shao X', 'Huang Q', 'Hao L', 'Lin Y']","['State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.']",['eng'],"['81671031, 81470721/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '(2014TD0001)/Sichuan Province Youth Science and Technology Innovation Team']",['Journal Article'],20181012,England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,"['0 (Aptamers, Nucleotide)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (PTK7 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Aptamers, Nucleotide/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence/genetics', 'Biological Transport/physiology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'DNA/*chemistry', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Carriers/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Nanostructures/*chemistry', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*biosynthesis/genetics']",PMC6430458,,,2018/10/13 06:00,2019/02/09 06:00,['2018/10/13 06:00'],"['2018/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/09 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cpr.12511 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Prolif. 2019 Jan;52(1):e12511. doi: 10.1111/cpr.12511.

Significant increases in onset age for follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma were observed in both men and women (all P values <0.0001 except for P = 0.0448 for the latter disease in women).

Here, we designed a p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect antibodies specific for BLV capsid protein p24 (encoded by the gag gene) in bovine serum samples. The p24 gene was inserted into an Escherichia coli expression system, and recombinant proteins (GST-p24, p24, and His-p24) were purified. His-p24 was the most suitable antigen for using in the ELISA. The cut-off point was calculated from a receiver operating characteristic curve derived from a set of 582 field samples that previously tested positive or negative by BLV-CoCoMo-qPCR-2, which detects BLV provirus. The new p24 ELISA showed almost the same specificity and sensitivity as a commercial gp51 ELISA kit when used to test field serum samples, and allowed monitoring of p24 antibodies in raw milk and whey. Comparing the results for the p24 ELISA and gp51 ELISA revealed that p24 antibodies were detected earlier than gp51 antibodies in three out of eight calves experimentally infected with BLV, indicating improved detection without diminishing BLV serodiagnosis. Thus, the p24 ELISA is a robust and reliable assay for detecting BLV antibodies in serum or milk, making it is a useful tool for large-scale BLV screening.","['Bai, Lanlan', 'Yokoyama, Kana', 'Watanuki, Sonoko', 'Ishizaki, Hiroshi', 'Takeshima, Shin-Nosuke', 'Aida, Yoko']","['Bai L', 'Yokoyama K', 'Watanuki S', 'Ishizaki H', 'Takeshima SN', 'Aida Y']","['Nano Medical Engineering Laboratory, RIKEN Cluster for Pioneering Research, 2-1 Hirowasa, Wako, Saitama, 3510198, Japan.', 'Viral Infectious Disease Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama, 3510198, Japan.', 'Nano Medical Engineering Laboratory, RIKEN Cluster for Pioneering Research, 2-1 Hirowasa, Wako, Saitama, 3510198, Japan.', 'Viral Infectious Disease Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama, 3510198, Japan.', 'Nano Medical Engineering Laboratory, RIKEN Cluster for Pioneering Research, 2-1 Hirowasa, Wako, Saitama, 3510198, Japan.', 'Viral Infectious Disease Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama, 3510198, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Global Animal Resource Science, Department of Global Agriculture Science, Graduate School of Agriculture and Life Science, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 1138657, Japan.', 'Grazing Animal Unit, Division of Grassland Farming, Institute of Livestock and Grassland Sciences, NARO, 768 Senbonmatsu, Nasushiobara, Tochigi, 3292793, Japan.', 'Nano Medical Engineering Laboratory, RIKEN Cluster for Pioneering Research, 2-1 Hirowasa, Wako, Saitama, 3510198, Japan.', 'Viral Infectious Disease Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama, 3510198, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Viral Infectious Diseases, Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Science, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 1138657, Japan.', 'Nano Medical Engineering Laboratory, RIKEN Cluster for Pioneering Research, 2-1 Hirowasa, Wako, Saitama, 3510198, Japan. aida@riken.jp.', 'Viral Infectious Disease Unit, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama, 3510198, Japan. aida@riken.jp.', 'Laboratory of Global Animal Resource Science, Department of Global Agriculture Science, Graduate School of Agriculture and Life Science, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 1138657, Japan. aida@riken.jp.', 'Laboratory of Viral Infectious Diseases, Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Science, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 1138657, Japan. aida@riken.jp.']",['eng'],"['16H02590 (A)/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science', '16K02590(C)/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science', '16817983/NARO Bio-oriented Technology Research Advancement Institution', '16930548/NARO Bio-oriented Technology Research Advancement Institution', '16F16404/Japan Society for the JSPS Postdoctoral Fellowship']",['Journal Article'],20181011,Austria,Arch Virol,Archives of virology,7506870,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood/isolation & purification', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/blood/*virology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/methods/*veterinary', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*isolation & purification', 'Milk/*virology', 'Viral Proteins/*immunology']",,,,2018/10/13 06:00,2019/02/06 06:00,['2018/10/13 06:00'],"['2018/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/06 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00705-018-4058-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s00705-018-4058-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Arch Virol. 2019 Jan;164(1):201-211. doi: 10.1007/s00705-018-4058-5.

Traditional medicine represents the first-treatment choice for the healthcare of approximately 80% of people living in developing countries. Also, its use in the United States has increased by 38% during within the last decade of the 20(th) century alone. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to explore the efficacy of a medicinal plant, Vernonia amygdalina Delile (VAD), as a new targeted therapy for the management of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), using HL-60 cells as a test model. To address our specific aim, HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells were treated with VAD. Live and dead cells were determined by acridine orange and propidium iodide (AO/PI) dye using the Cellometer Vision. The extent of DNA damage was evaluated by the comet assay. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry assessment. Data obtained from the AO/PI assay indicated that VAD significantly reduced the number of live cells in a dose-dependent manner, showing a gradual increase in the loss of viability in VAD-treated cells. We observed a significant increase in DNA damage in VAD-treated cells compared to the control group. Flow cytometry data demonstrated that VAD induced apoptosis in treated cells compared to the control cells. These results suggest that induction of cell death, DNA damage, and cell apoptosis are involved in the therapeutic efficacy of VAD. Because VAD exerts anticancer activity in vitro, it would be interesting to perform clinical trials to confirm its effectiveness as an anticancer agent towards the treatment of APL patients.","['Yedjou, Clement G', 'Sims, Jennifer N', 'Njiki, Sylvianne', 'Tsabang, Nole', 'Ogungbe, Ifedayo V', 'Tchounwou, Paul B']","['Yedjou CG', 'Sims JN', 'Njiki S', 'Tsabang N', 'Ogungbe IV', 'Tchounwou PB']","['Natural Chemotherapeutics Research Laboratory, NIH-RCMI Center for Environmental Health College of Science, Engineering and Technology, Jackson State University, 1400 Lynch Street, P.O.

Few studies regarding mitochondrial aberrations and haplogroups in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and their clinical impacts have been reported. Therefore, we focused on the mtDNA length heteroplasmies minisatellite instability (MSI), copy number alterations, and distribution of mitochondrial haplogroups in Korean patients with AML. Methods: This study investigated 74 adult patients with AML and 70 controls to evaluate mtDNA sequence alterations, MSI, mtDNA copy number, haplogroups, and their clinical implications. The hypervariable (HV) control regions (HV1 and HV2), tRNA(leu1) gene, and cytochrome b gene of mtDNA were analyzed. Two mtDNA minisatellite markers, 16189 poly-C ((16184)CCCCCTCCCC(16193), 5CT4C) and 303 poly-C ((303)CCCCCCCTCCCCC(315), 7CT5C), were used to examine the mtDNA MSI. Results: In AML, most mtDNA sequence variants were single nucleotide substitutions, but there were no significant differences compared to those in controls. The number of mtMSI patterns increased in AML. The mean mtDNA copy number of AML patients increased approximately 9-fold compared to that of controls (P<0.0001). Haplogroup D4 was found in AML with a higher frequency compared to that in controls (31.0% vs. 15.7%, P=0.046). None of the aforementioned factors showed significant impacts on the outcomes. Conclusion: AML cells disclosed more heterogeneous patterns with the mtMSI markers and had increased mtDNA copy numbers. These findings implicate mitochondrial genome instability in primary AML cells. Therefore, mtDNA haplogroup D4 might be associated with AML risk among Koreans.","['Kim, Hye Ran', 'Kang, Min-Gu', 'Lee, Young Eun', 'Na, Bo Ram', 'Noh, Min Seo', 'Yang, Seung Hyun', 'Shin, Jong-Hee', 'Shin, Myun-Geun']","['Kim HR', 'Kang MG', 'Lee YE', 'Na BR', 'Noh MS', 'Yang SH', 'Shin JH', 'Shin MG']","['College of Korean Medicine, Dongshin University, Naju, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Gwangyang Sarang General Hospital, Gwangyang, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School and Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Brain Korea 21 Plus Project, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School and Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Brain Korea 21 Plus Project, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School and Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Brain Korea 21 Plus Project, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School and Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Brain Korea 21 Plus Project, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School and Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School and Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Brain Korea 21 Plus Project, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, Korea.', 'Environmental Health Center for Childhood Leukemia and Cancer, Chonnam National University Medical School and Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180928,Korea (South),Blood Res,Blood research,101605247,,,,PMC6170299,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Haplogroup', 'Instability', 'Mitochondrial genome', 'Outcome']",2018/10/13 06:00,2018/10/13 06:01,['2018/10/13 06:00'],"['2018/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/01 00:00 [revised]', '2018/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/br.2018.53.3.240 [doi]'],ppublish,Blood Res. 2018 Sep;53(3):240-249. doi: 10.5045/br.2018.53.3.240.

This study assessed the role of syndecan-1 in the prognosis of patients with CLL and its correlation with other prognostic markers. Methods: This prospective study was performed in the hematology department of an Indian tertiary care center, over nineteen months (Jun. 2009-Jan. 2011). Forty-nine new patients with CLL presented during this period and were included. Twenty age- and gender-matched healthy patients served as controls, and six patients with multiple myeloma were included as positive controls. Baseline serum syndecan-1 concentrations were measured for all patients at presentation using ELISA (Diaclone, Besancon, France). At baseline, patients were divided into low (N=10), intermediate (N=18) and high (N=21) risk cohorts. Serum syndecan-1 levels in these patient subgroups were compared with clinical and laboratory parameters. Results: The median syndecan-1 level in patients with CLL (73.32 ng/mL, range, 28.71-268.0 ng/mL) was marginally higher than that in healthy patients (63.10 ng/mL, range, 55.0-75.11 ng/mL). At presentation, syndecan-1 levels in patients with CLL correlated strongly with symptomatic disease (cytopenias, P=0.004) and higher clinical stage (Rai stage III and IV, P=0.001) markers and poorly with beta2-microglobulin level (P=0.270), diffuse BM infiltration (P=0.882), and surrogate mutation status markers (CD 38, P=0.174 and ZAP-70, P=0.459). Syndecan-1 levels dichotomized by the median value were higher with progressive disease markers, e.g. shorter lymphocyte doubling time (LDT, P=0.015) and increased treatment (P=0.099). Conclusion: In CLL, serum syndecan-1 (sCD138) levels at presentation correlate with disease burden, and higher baseline levels may predict early treatment.","['Sharma, Monica', 'Tyagi, Seema', 'Tripathi, Preeti', 'Seth, Tulika']","['Sharma M', 'Tyagi S', 'Tripathi P', 'Seth T']","['Department of Hematology, Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180928,Korea (South),Blood Res,Blood research,101605247,,,,PMC6170314,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Prognostic marker', 'Syndecan-1', 'sCD138']",2018/10/13 06:00,2018/10/13 06:01,['2018/10/13 06:00'],"['2017/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/05 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/br.2018.53.3.205 [doi]'],ppublish,Blood Res. 2018 Sep;53(3):205-209. doi: 10.5045/br.2018.53.3.205.

This study investigated whether subsets of lymphocytes reflecting host-tumor immunologic interactions are related to the prognosis of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Methods: Lymphocyte subsets in the peripheral blood of 88 patients who were newly diagnosed with AML were analyzed by quantitative flow cytometry. The relationships of lymphocyte subsets with AML subtypes, genetic risk, and clinical courses were analyzed. Results: The percentages of T and NK cells differed between patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and those with AML with myelodysplasia-related changes. In non-APL, a high proportion of NK cells (>16.6%) was associated with a higher rate of death before remission (P=0.0438), whereas a low proportion of NK cells (</=9.4%) was associated with higher rates of adverse genetic abnormalities (P=0.0244) and relapse (P=0.0567). A multivariate analysis showed that the lymphocyte subsets were not independent predictors of survival. Conclusion: Lymphocyte subsets at diagnosis differ between patients with different specific subtypes of AML. A low proportion of NK cells is associated with adverse genetic abnormalities, whereas a high proportion is related to death before remission. However, the proportion of NK cells may not show independent correlations with survival.","['Park, Yumi', 'Lim, Jinsook', 'Kim, Seonyoung', 'Song, Ikchan', 'Kwon, Kyechul', 'Koo, Sunhoe', 'Kim, Jimyung']","['Park Y', 'Lim J', 'Kim S', 'Song I', 'Kwon K', 'Koo S', 'Kim J']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chungnam National University Hospital, Daejeon, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chungnam National University Hospital, Daejeon, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chungnam National University Hospital, Daejeon, Korea.', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology, Chungnam National University Hospital, Daejeon, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chungnam National University Hospital, Daejeon, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chungnam National University Hospital, Daejeon, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chungnam National University Hospital, Daejeon, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180928,Korea (South),Blood Res,Blood research,101605247,,,,PMC6170312,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Lymphocyte subset', 'NK cells', 'Prognosis']",2018/10/13 06:00,2018/10/13 06:01,['2018/10/13 06:00'],"['2017/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/06 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/br.2018.53.3.198 [doi]'],ppublish,Blood Res. 2018 Sep;53(3):198-204. doi: 10.5045/br.2018.53.3.198.

Here, we demonstrate that the transcriptional repressor ZBTB38 is a critical regulator of the cellular response to DNMTi. Treatments with 5-azacytidine, or its derivatives decitabine and zebularine, lead to down-regulation of ZBTB38 protein expression in cancer cells, in parallel with cellular damage. The depletion of ZBTB38 by RNA interference enhances the toxicity of DNMTi in cell lines from leukemia and from various solid tumor types. Further we observed that inactivation of ZBTB38 causes the up-regulation of CDKN1C mRNA, a previously described indirect target of DNMTi. We show that CDKN1C is a key actor of DNMTi toxicity in cells lacking ZBTB38. Finally, in patients with MDS a high level of CDKN1C mRNA expression before treatment correlates with a better clinical response to a drug regimen combining 5-azacytidine and histone deacetylase inhibitors. Collectively, our results suggest that the ZBTB38 protein is a target of DNMTi and that its depletion potentiates the toxicity of DNMT inhibitors in cancer cells, providing new opportunities to enhance the response to DNMT inhibitor therapies in patients with MDS and other cancers.","['Marchal, Claire', 'de Dieuleveult, Maud', 'Saint-Ruf, Claude', 'Guinot, Nadege', 'Ferry, Laure', 'Olalla Saad, Sara T', 'Lazarini, Mariana', 'Defossez, Pierre-Antoine', 'Miotto, Benoit']","['Marchal C', 'de Dieuleveult M', 'Saint-Ruf C', 'Guinot N', 'Ferry L', 'Olalla Saad ST', 'Lazarini M', 'Defossez PA', 'Miotto B']","['INSERM, U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'CNRS, UMR8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Department of Biological Science, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, 32306-4295, USA.', 'INSERM, U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'CNRS, UMR8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'INSERM, U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'CNRS, UMR8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'INSERM, U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'CNRS, UMR8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Epigenetics and Cell Fate, UMR 7216 CNRS, 75013, Paris, France.', 'Hematology and Blood Transfusion Center-University of Campinas/Hemocentro-Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Brazil.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Diadema, Brazil.', 'Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Epigenetics and Cell Fate, UMR 7216 CNRS, 75013, Paris, France.', 'INSERM, U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France. benoit.miotto@inserm.fr.', 'CNRS, UMR8104, Paris, France. benoit.miotto@inserm.fr.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France. benoit.miotto@inserm.fr.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181011,United States,Oncogenesis,Oncogenesis,101580004,,,,PMC6182000,,,2018/10/13 06:00,2018/10/13 06:01,['2018/10/13 06:00'],"['2018/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/13 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41389-018-0092-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41389-018-0092-0 [pii]']",epublish,Oncogenesis. 2018 Oct 11;7(10):82. doi: 10.1038/s41389-018-0092-0.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6463-9263'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Computational analysis of transcriptomics data from human cancer specimens, complemented with exhaustive clinical annotation, provides an opportunity to identify core regulators of the tumorigenic process. Here we exploit well-annotated clinical datasets of prostate cancer for the discovery of transcriptional regulators relevant to prostate cancer. Following this rationale, we identify Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) as a prostate tumor suppressor among a subset of transcription factors. Importantly, we further interrogate transcriptomics and clinical data to refine MITF perturbation-based empirical assays and unveil Crystallin Alpha B (CRYAB) as an unprecedented direct target of the transcription factor that is, at least in part, responsible for its tumor-suppressive activity in prostate cancer. This evidence was supported by the enhanced prognostic potential of a signature based on the concomitant alteration of MITF and CRYAB in prostate cancer patients. In sum, our study provides proof-of-concept evidence of the potential of the bioinformatics screen of publicly available cancer patient databases as discovery platforms, and demonstrates that the MITF-CRYAB axis controls prostate cancer biology.","['Valcarcel-Jimenez, Lorea', 'Macchia, Alice', 'Martin-Martin, Natalia', 'Cortazar, Ana Rosa', 'Schaub-Clerigue, Ariane', 'Pujana-Vaquerizo, Mikel', 'Fernandez-Ruiz, Sonia', 'Lacasa-Viscasillas, Isabel', 'Santos-Martin, Aida', 'Loizaga-Iriarte, Ana', 'Unda-Urzaiz, Miguel', 'Hermanova, Ivana', 'Astobiza, Ianire', 'Graupera, Mariona', 'Starkova, Julia', 'Sutherland, James', 'Barrio, Rosa', 'Aransay, Ana M', 'Carracedo, Arkaitz', 'Torrano, Veronica']","['Valcarcel-Jimenez L', 'Macchia A', 'Martin-Martin N', 'Cortazar AR', 'Schaub-Clerigue A', 'Pujana-Vaquerizo M', 'Fernandez-Ruiz S', 'Lacasa-Viscasillas I', 'Santos-Martin A', 'Loizaga-Iriarte A', 'Unda-Urzaiz M', 'Hermanova I', 'Astobiza I', 'Graupera M', 'Starkova J', 'Sutherland J', 'Barrio R', 'Aransay AM', 'Carracedo A', 'Torrano V']","['CIC bioGUNE, Bizkaia Technology Park, 801 feminine bld, 48160, Derio, Bizkaia, Spain.', 'CIC bioGUNE, Bizkaia Technology Park, 801 feminine bld, 48160, Derio, Bizkaia, Spain.', 'CIC bioGUNE, Bizkaia Technology Park, 801 feminine bld, 48160, Derio, Bizkaia, Spain.', 'CIBERONC, Madrid, Spain.', 'CIC bioGUNE, Bizkaia Technology Park, 801 feminine bld, 48160, Derio, Bizkaia, Spain.', 'CIBERONC, Madrid, Spain.', 'CIC bioGUNE, Bizkaia Technology Park, 801 feminine bld, 48160, Derio, Bizkaia, Spain.', 'CIC bioGUNE, Bizkaia Technology Park, 801 feminine bld, 48160, Derio, Bizkaia, Spain.', 'CIC bioGUNE, Bizkaia Technology Park, 801 feminine bld, 48160, Derio, Bizkaia, Spain.', 'Department of Urology, Basurto University Hospital, 48013, Bilbao, Spain.', 'Department of Urology, Basurto University Hospital, 48013, Bilbao, Spain.', 'Department of Urology, Basurto University Hospital, 48013, Bilbao, Spain.', 'Department of Urology, Basurto University Hospital, 48013, Bilbao, Spain.', 'CIC bioGUNE, Bizkaia Technology Park, 801 feminine bld, 48160, Derio, Bizkaia, Spain.', 'CIC bioGUNE, Bizkaia Technology Park, 801 feminine bld, 48160, Derio, Bizkaia, Spain.', ""Vascular Signalling Laboratory, Institut d Investigacio Biomedica de Bellvitge (IDIBELL), Gran Via de l'Hospitalet 199-203, Barcelona, Spain."", 'CLIP-Childhood Leukaemia Investigation.

Here, we employed high-throughput transcriptome screening to demonstrate immunosuppression-associated increases in the long noncoding (lnc) RNA lnc-insulin receptor precursor (INSR), which was corrected with INSR expression in CD4+ T cells extracted from the bone marrow of patients with childhood acute T lymphoblastic leukemia. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function assays in vitro and in vivo revealed that membrane-localized and cytoplasm-localized lnc-INSR promoted Treg distribution and decreased the percentage of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which induced tumor growth. Through direct binding with INSR, lnc-INSR blocked the INSR ubiquitination site, causing abnormal activation of INSR and the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase/AKT-signaling pathway. These results indicated that lnc-INSR might promote immune suppression by enhancing Treg-cell differentiation and serve as valuable therapeutic targets in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.","['Wang, Yaping', 'Yang, Xiaoyun', 'Sun, Xiaoyan', 'Rong, Liucheng', 'Kang, Meiyun', 'Wu, Peng', 'Ji, Xiaohui', 'Lin, Rufeng', 'Huang, Jie', 'Xue, Yao', 'Fang, Yongjun']","['Wang Y', 'Yang X', 'Sun X', 'Rong L', 'Kang M', 'Wu P', 'Ji X', 'Lin R', 'Huang J', 'Xue Y', 'Fang Y']","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing Medical University, 72# Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China. wyp_0919@163.com."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing Medical University, 72# Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing Medical University, 72# Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing Medical University, 72# Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing Medical University, 72# Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing Medical University, 72# Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing Medical University, 72# Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing Medical University, 72# Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing Medical University, 72# Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing Medical University, 72# Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing Medical University, 72# Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China. dryjfang@gmail.com.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181011,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (INSR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Insulin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/methods', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/immunology', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*immunology', 'Receptor, Insulin/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology', 'Transcriptome/immunology', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*genetics']",PMC6181910,,,2018/10/13 06:00,2019/11/14 06:00,['2018/10/13 06:00'],"['2018/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/21 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-018-1078-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-018-1078-8 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2018 Oct 11;9(10):1043. doi: 10.1038/s41419-018-1078-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multiple myeloma is considered to be a disease dependent mainly on MCL1 for survival, based mostly on studies using cell lines. We used a BH3-mimetic toolkit to study the dependency on BCL2, BCLXL, or MCL1 in malignant plasma cells from 60 patients. Dependencies were analyzed using an unbiased BH3 mimetics cell-death clustering by k-means. In the whole cohort of patients, BCL2 dependency was mostly found in the CCND1 subgroup (83%). Of note, MCL1 dependence significantly increased from 33% at diagnosis to 69% at relapse, suggesting a plasticity of the cellular dependency favoring MCL1 dependencies at relapse. In addition, 35% of overall patient samples showed codependencies on either BCL2/MCL1 or BCLXL/MCL1. Finally, we identified a group of patients not targeted by any of the BH3 mimetics, predominantly at diagnosis in patients not presenting the common recurrent translocations. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that BAK is crucial for cell death induced by MCL1 mimetic A1210477, according to the protection from cell death observed by BAK knock-down, as well as the complete and early disruption of MCL1/BAK complexes on A1210477 treatment. Interestingly, this complex was also dissociated in A1210477-resistant cells, but free BAK was simultaneously recaptured by BCLXL, supporting the role of BCLXL in A1210477 resistance.

On August 30, 2017, the FDA approved tisagenlecleucel for treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory in second or later relapse. Approval was based on the complete remission (CR) rate, durability of CR, and minimal residual disease (MRD) <0.01% in a cohort of 63 children and young adults with relapsed or refractory ALL treated on a single-arm trial (CCTL019B2202). Treatment consisted of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide followed 2 to 14 days later by a single dose of tisagenlecleucel. The CR rate was 63% (95% confidence interval, 50%-75%), and all CRs had MRD <0.01%. With a median follow-up of 4.8 months, the median duration of response was not reached. Cytokine release syndrome (79%) and neurologic events (65%) were serious toxicities reported in the trial. With implementation of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, the benefit-risk profile was considered acceptable for this patient population with such resistant ALL.

We, therefore, analyzed their prognostic value in a cohort of 1,537 patients with newly diagnosed disease, prospectively treated within three trials of the ""German-Austrian Acute Myeloid Leukemia Study Group"". Mutational analysis was performed by targeted deep sequencing and patients with TP53 mutations were categorized by their variant allele frequency into groups with frequencies >40%, 20%-40% and <20%. A total of 108 TP53 mutations were found in 98 patients (6.4%). Among these, 61 patients had variant allele frequencies >40%, 19 had variant allele frequencies between 20%-40% and 18 had frequencies <20%. Compared to specimens with clonal TP53 mutations, those with subclonal ones showed significantly fewer complex karyotypes and chromosomal losses. In either TP53-mutated group, patients experienced significantly fewer complete responses (P<0.001) and had worse overall and event-free survival rates (P<0.0001). In Cox regression analyses adjusting for age, white blood cell count, cytogenetic risk and type of acute myeloid leukemia, the adverse prognostic effect of TP53 mutations remained significant for all TP53-mutated subgroups. These data suggest that subclonal TP53 mutations are a novel prognostic parameter in acute myeloid leukemia and emphasize the usefulness of next-generation sequencing technologies for risk stratification in this disorder.

However, the introduction of novel compounds remains challenging and is hindered by a lack of understanding of their mechanistic interactions with established drugs. In the present study, we demonstrate a highly increased response of various acute leukemia cell lines, drug-resistant cells and patient-derived xenograft cells by combining the recently introduced protein disulfide isomerase inhibitor PS89 with cytostatics. In leukemic cells, a proteomics-based target fishing approach revealed that PS89 affects a whole network of endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis proteins. We elucidate that the strong induction of apoptosis in combination with cytostatics is orchestrated by the PS89 target B-cell receptor-associated protein 31, which transduces apoptosis signals at the endoplasmic reticulum -mitochondria interface. Activation of caspase-8 and cleavage of B-cell receptor-associated protein 31 stimulate a pro-apoptotic crosstalk including release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum and an increase in the levels of reactive oxygen species resulting in amplification of mitochondrial apoptosis. The findings of this study promote PS89 as a novel chemosensitizing agent for the treatment of acute leukemia and uncovers that targeting the endoplasmic reticulum - mitochondrial network of cell death is a promising approach in combination therapy.","['Koczian, Fabian', 'Naglo, Olga', 'Vomacka, Jan', 'Vick, Binje', 'Servatius, Phil', 'Zisis, Themistoklis', 'Hettich, Britta', 'Kazmaier, Uli', 'Sieber, Stephan A', 'Jeremias, Irmela', 'Zahler, Stefan', 'Braig, Simone']","['Koczian F', 'Naglo O', 'Vomacka J', 'Vick B', 'Servatius P', 'Zisis T', 'Hettich B', 'Kazmaier U', 'Sieber SA', 'Jeremias I', 'Zahler S', 'Braig S']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.', 'Department of Chemistry, Technical University of Munich, Garching.', 'Research Unit Gene Vectors, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Center for Environmental Health, Munich.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry, Saarland University, Saarbrucken, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry, Saarland University, Saarbrucken, Germany.', 'Department of Chemistry, Technical University of Munich, Garching.', 'Research Unit Gene Vectors, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Center for Environmental Health, Munich.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich simone.braig@cup.uni-muenchen.de.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181011,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Cytostatic Agents)', '0 (Proteome)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytostatic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics/methods', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC6395311,,,2018/10/13 06:00,2020/05/12 06:00,['2018/10/13 06:00'],"['2018/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.197368 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.197368 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2019 Mar;104(3):546-555. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.197368.

Indeed, Ampk alpha1(-/-) , Ampk beta1(-/-) and Ampk gamma1(-/-) mice develop hemolytic anemia and the plasma membrane of their red blood cells shows elasticity defects. The membrane composition evolves continuously along erythropoiesis and during red blood cell maturation; defects due to the absence of Ampk could be initiated during erythropoiesis. We, therefore, studied the role of AMPK during human erythropoiesis. Our data show that AMPK activation had two distinct phases in primary erythroblasts. The phosphorylation of AMPK (Thr172) and its target acetyl CoA carboxylase (Ser79) was elevated in immature erythroblasts (glycophorin A(low)), then decreased conjointly with erythroid differentiation. In erythroblasts, knockdown of the alpha1 catalytic subunit by short hairpin RNA led to a decrease in cell proliferation and alterations in the expression of membrane proteins (band 3 and glycophorin A) associated with an increase in phosphorylation of adducin (Ser726). AMPK activation in mature erythroblasts (glycophorin A(high)), achieved through the use of direct activators (GSK621 and compound 991), induced cell cycle arrest in the S phase, the induction of autophagy and caspase-dependent apoptosis, whereas no such effects were observed in similarly treated immature erythroblasts. Thus, our work suggests that AMPK activation during the final stages of erythropoiesis is deleterious. As the use of direct AMPK activators is being considered as a treatment in several pathologies (diabetes, acute myeloid leukemia), this observation is pivotal.

However, many patients achieving early complete remissions ultimately relapse. Immunosuppressive ligands are expressed on tumor and supportive cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). When activated, T cells express associated ""checkpoint"" receptors. Binding of co-inhibitory ligands and receptors may directly contribute to T-cell functional exhaustion. It is not known whether all T cells engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are subject to checkpoint-mediated regulation. It is also unknown whether distinct CAR signaling moieties modulate T-cell responsiveness to these inhibitory pathways. We have, therefore, directly compared functional co-inhibition in engineered T cells identically targeted to the tumor-associated antigen CD123, but distinct in their mode of T-cell activation: via the endogenous T-cell receptor (ENG), or downstream of CD28 or 41BB-containing CARs. In all cases, we have observed antigen-independent T-cell activation associated with upregulation of the co-inhibitory receptors programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1, CD279), Tim-3 and Lag-3. Notably, CD28.CAR T cells were uniquely susceptible to PD-1/PD-L1 mediated checkpoint inhibition. Together, our data indicate that PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blocking agents may be considered clinically when CD28.CAR T cells do not perform optimally in human trials.","['Zolov, Sergey N', 'Rietberg, Skyler P', 'Bonifant, Challice L']","['Zolov SN', 'Rietberg SP', 'Bonifant CL']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.

However, the wide applicability of this therapy finds limits in the high polymorphism of MHC molecules that restricts the use in the autologous context. CD1 antigen presenting molecules are nonpolymorphic and specialized for lipid antigen presentation to T cells. They are often expressed on malignant cells and, therefore, may represent an attractive target for ACT.

In this observational study we analyzed a cohort of 294 Italian chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia patients treated frontline with branded imatinib (Glivec(R)) for at least 6 months and then uniformly switched to generic imatinib upon requirement of health authorities in early 2017. Median age at diagnosis was 57 years (range 19-87). Sokal risk was low/intermediate/high in 55%, 32% and 8% of cases, respectively. Median duration of branded imatinib treatment was 7.4 years (range 0.5-16.7). At a median follow-up of 7.5 months after switch to generic imatinib, 17% of patients reported new or worsening side effects, but grade 3-4 non-hematological adverse events were rare. Six patients switched back to branded imatinib, with improvement in the side effect profile, and 4 pts moved to bosutinib or nilotinib for resistance/intolerance. The majority of patients were in major (26%) or deep molecular response (66%) at the time of switch. Molecular responses remained stable, improved or worsened in 61%, 25% and 14% of patients, respectively. We conclude that switch to generic imatinib for patients who have been receiving branded imatinib appears to be effective and safe. Molecular responses may continue to improve over time. Some patients experienced new or worsened side effects but less than 5% of the whole cohort needed to switch back to branded imatinib or move to other treatments. Savings were around 3 million Euros.","['Bonifacio, Massimiliano', 'Scaffidi, Luigi', 'Binotto, Gianni', 'Miggiano, Maria Cristina', 'Danini, Marco', 'Minotto, Claudia', 'Griguolo, Davide', 'Marin, Luciana', 'Frison, Luca', ""D'Amore, Fabio"", 'Basso, Marco', 'Sartori, Roberto', 'Tinelli, Martina', 'Stulle, Manuela', 'Fortuna, Stefania', 'Bonalumi, Angela', 'Bertoldero, Giovanni', 'De Biasi, Ercole', 'Ruggeri, Marco', 'Semenzato, Gianpietro', 'Fanin, Renato', 'Pizzolo, Giovanni', 'Krampera, Mauro', 'Tiribelli, Mario']","['Bonifacio M', 'Scaffidi L', 'Binotto G', 'Miggiano MC', 'Danini M', 'Minotto C', 'Griguolo D', 'Marin L', 'Frison L', ""D'Amore F"", 'Basso M', 'Sartori R', 'Tinelli M', 'Stulle M', 'Fortuna S', 'Bonalumi A', 'Bertoldero G', 'De Biasi E', 'Ruggeri M', 'Semenzato G', 'Fanin R', 'Pizzolo G', 'Krampera M', 'Tiribelli M']","['Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology, University of Verona, Italy.

In oncology, apoptosis regulating Bcl-2 family proteins are of particular interest. Apoptotic cell death is controlled via PPIs between the anti-apoptotic proteins hydrophobic groove and the pro-apoptotic proteins BH3 domain. In ovarian carcinoma, it has been previously demonstrated that Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 cooperate to protect tumor cells against apoptosis. Moreover, Mcl-1 is a key regulator of cancer cell survival and is a known resistance factor to Bcl-2/Bcl-xL pharmacological inhibitors making it an attractive therapeutic target. Here, using a structure-guided design from the oligopyridine lead Pyridoclax based on Noxa/Mcl-1 interaction we identified a new derivative, active at lower concentration as compared to Pyridoclax. This new derivative selectively binds to the Mcl-1 hydrophobic groove and releases Bak and Bim from Mcl-1 to induce cell death and sensitize cancer cells to Bcl-2/Bcl-xL targeting strategies.","['Hedir, Siham', 'De Giorgi, Marcella', 'Fogha, Jade', 'De Pascale, Martina', 'Weiswald, Louis-Bastien', 'Brotin, Emilie', 'Marekha, Bogdan', 'Denoyelle, Christophe', 'Denis, Camille', 'Suzanne, Peggy', 'Gautier, Fabien', 'Juin, Philippe', 'Ligat, Laetitia', 'Lopez, Frederic', 'Carlier, Ludovic', 'Legay, Remi', 'Bureau, Ronan', 'Rault, Sylvain', 'Poulain, Laurent', 'Oliveira Santos, Jana Sopkova-de', 'Voisin-Chiret, Anne Sophie']","['Hedir S', 'De Giorgi M', 'Fogha J', 'De Pascale M', 'Weiswald LB', 'Brotin E', 'Marekha B', 'Denoyelle C', 'Denis C', 'Suzanne P', 'Gautier F', 'Juin P', 'Ligat L', 'Lopez F', 'Carlier L', 'Legay R', 'Bureau R', 'Rault S', 'Poulain L', 'Oliveira Santos JS', 'Voisin-Chiret AS']","['Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, Inserm U1086 ANTICIPE <<Interdisciplinary Research Unit for Cancer Prevention and Treatment>>, Biology and Innovative Therapeutics for Ovarian Cancers Group (BioTICLA), Centre de Lutte Contre le Cancer F.

Accordingly, there is significant interest in drugging cancer-specific hypoxic responses. However, a major challenge in leukemia is identifying differential and druggable hypoxic responses between leukemic and normal cells. Previously, we found that arginase 2 (ARG2), an enzyme of the urea cycle, is overexpressed in CML but not normal progenitors. ARG2 is a target of the hypoxia inducible factors (HIF1-alpha and HIF2-alpha), and is required for the generation of polyamines which are required for cell growth. We therefore explored if the clinically-tested arginase inhibitor Nomega-hydroxy-nor-arginine (nor-NOHA) would be effective against leukemic cells under hypoxic conditions. Remarkably, nor-NOHA effectively induced apoptosis in ARG2-expressing cells under hypoxia but not normoxia. Co-treatment with nor-NOHA overcame hypoxia-mediated resistance towards BCR-ABL1 kinase inhibitors. While nor-NOHA itself is promising in targeting the leukemia hypoxic response, we unexpectedly found that its anti-leukemic activity was independent of ARG2 inhibition. Genetic ablation of ARG2 using CRISPR/Cas9 had no effect on the viability of leukemic cells and their sensitivity towards nor-NOHA. This discrepancy was further evidenced by the distinct effects of ARG2 knockouts and nor-NOHA on cellular respiration. In conclusion, we show that nor-NOHA has significant but off-target anti-leukemic activity among ARG2-expressing hypoxic cells. Since nor-NOHA has been employed in clinical trials, and is widely used in studies on endothelial dysfunction, immunosuppression and metabolism, the diverse biological effects of nor-NOHA must be cautiously evaluated before attributing its activity to ARG inhibition.","['Ng, King Pan', 'Manjeri, Aditi', 'Lee, Lin Ming', 'Chan, Zhu En', 'Tan, Chin Yee', 'Tan, Qiancheng Darren', ""Majeed, A'Qilah"", 'Lee, Kian Leong', 'Chuah, Charles', 'Suda, Toshio', 'Ong, S Tiong']","['Ng KP', 'Manjeri A', 'Lee LM', 'Chan ZE', 'Tan CY', 'Tan QD', 'Majeed A', 'Lee KL', 'Chuah C', 'Suda T', 'Ong ST']","['Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Signature Research Program, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Signature Research Program, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Signature Research Program, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Signature Research Program, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Signature Research Program, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Signature Research Program, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Signature Research Program, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'International Research Center for Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Japan.', 'Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Signature Research Program, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Centre, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, United States of America.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181011,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (N(omega)-hydroxynorarginine)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'EC 3.5.3.1 (ARG2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.3.1 (Arginase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arginase/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Arginine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems/genetics', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Assays', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism']",PMC6181325,,,2018/10/12 06:00,2019/03/21 06:00,['2018/10/12 06:00'],"['2018/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0205254 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-23457 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2018 Oct 11;13(10):e0205254. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0205254. eCollection 2018.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-0147-123X'],['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its pathogenesis and molecular mechanisms are still unknown, and only two individual cases have so far been molecularly characterized. The aim of this study was to define the pattern of numerical chromosomal alterations in tumor samples taken from 20 patients with pcAECyTCL at the time of diagnosis by means of array-comparative genomic hybridization (a-CGH). a-CGH detected numerous genomic aberrations in all the patients and, putting these together as a whole, they affected all the chromosomes. However, no specific profile of recurrent copy number alterations (CNAs) was found. Most of the gains involved regions previously described in other aggressive cutaneous lymphomas such as 7q, 8q24.3, and 17q, whereas the most significant CNA was the loss of 9p21.3 (CDKN2A-CDKN2B), which has already been found in a variety of malignant tumors and is associated with aggressive cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. In brief, CGH analysis revealed a large number of CNAs with only few recurring regions that probably do not represent driving events. The genomic instability found in this aggressive variant of cutaneous lymphoma may therefore be a secondary event but, at the time of the diagnosis of pcAECyTCL, the genomic integrity of tumor cells is already compromised.","['Fanoni, Daniele', 'Corti, Laura', 'Alberti-Violetti, Silvia', 'Tensen, Cornelis P', 'Venegoni, Luigia', 'Vermeer, Maarten', 'Willemze, Rein', 'Berti, Emilio']","['Fanoni D', 'Corti L', 'Alberti-Violetti S', 'Tensen CP', 'Venegoni L', 'Vermeer M', 'Willemze R', 'Berti E']","['Dipartimento di Fisiopatologia medico-chirurgica e dei trapianti, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy.', ""Department of Dermatology, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda - Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", ""Department of Dermatology, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda - Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", 'Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Mediche e Medicina Traslazionale, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Dermatology, Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC), Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Dipartimento di Fisiopatologia medico-chirurgica e dei trapianti, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Dermatology, Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC), Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Dermatology, Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC), Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Dipartimento di Fisiopatologia medico-chirurgica e dei trapianti, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy.', ""Department of Dermatology, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda - Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181011,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Cohort Studies', '*Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Female', 'Gene Dosage', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogenes', 'Skin Neoplasms/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*CGH', '*NGS', '*T-cell', '*cutaneous lymphoma', '*leukemia', '*molecular genetics']",2018/10/12 06:00,2019/02/26 06:00,['2018/10/12 06:00'],"['2017/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/31 00:00 [revised]', '2018/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/26 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.22673 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2018 Dec;57(12):622-629. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22673.

Inotuzumab ozogamicin and blinatumomab have single-agent activity in R-R ALL. Their addition to low-intensity chemotherapy may further improve the outcomes of patients with ALL in their first relapse. METHODS: The chemotherapy was lower in intensity than conventional hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, adriamycin, and dexamethasone and was called mini-hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dexamethasone (or mini-HCVD). Inotuzumab was given on day 3 of each of the first 4 cycles at 1.8 to 1.3 mg/m(2) for cycle 1, and this was followed by 1.3 to 1.0 mg/m(2) for subsequent cycles. From patient 39 onward, the inotuzumab dose was reduced and fractionated into weekly doses (0.6 and 0.3 mg/m(2) during cycle 1 and 0.3 and 0.3 mg/m(2) during subsequent cycles), and blinatumomab was administered for up to 4 cycles after inotuzumab therapy. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative ALL with a median age of 39 years were treated during their first relapse. Overall, 44 patients (92%) responded, with 35 of them (73%) achieving a complete response. The overall minimal residual disease negativity rate among the responders was 93%. Twenty-four patients (50%) underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Veno-occlusive disease of any grade occurred in 5 patients (10%). With a median follow-up of 31 months, the median progression-free survival (PFS) and the median overall survival (OS) were 11 and 25 months, respectively. The 2-year PFS and OS rates were 42% and 54%, respectively. Of the 24 patients (50%) who underwent ASCT, 14 patients were alive at the last follow-up (13 [54%] in remission). Of the remaining 20 responding patients who did not undergo subsequent ASCT, 6 (30%) remained in remission at the last follow-up. According to propensity score matching, the combination of mini-HCVD and inotuzumab with or without blinatumomab conferred better outcomes than intensive salvage chemotherapy or inotuzumab alone. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of inotuzumab and low-intensity mini-HCVD chemotherapy with or without blinatumomab shows encouraging results in patients with ALL in first salvage.","['Jabbour, Elias', 'Sasaki, Koji', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Huang, Xuelin', 'Short, Nicholas J', 'Khouri, Maria', 'Kebriaei, Partow', 'Burger, Jan', 'Khoury, Joseph', 'Jorgensen, Jeffrey', 'Jain, Nitin', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Jacob, Jovitta', 'Montalbano, Kathryn', 'Garris, Rebecca', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Kantarjian, Hagop M']","['Jabbour E', 'Sasaki K', 'Ravandi F', 'Huang X', 'Short NJ', 'Khouri M', 'Kebriaei P', 'Burger J', 'Khoury J', 'Jorgensen J', 'Jain N', 'Konopleva M', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Kadia T', 'Cortes J', 'Jacob J', 'Montalbano K', 'Garris R', ""O'Brien S"", 'Kantarjian HM']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California Irvine, Orange, California.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['K12 CA088084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",20181011,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '4FR53SIF3A (blinatumomab)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'P93RUU11P7 (Inotuzumab Ozogamicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dexamethasone/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/adverse effects/methods', 'Inotuzumab Ozogamicin', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Rituximab/therapeutic use', 'Salvage Therapy/adverse effects/methods', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Young Adult']",PMC6515924,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', '*first relapse', '*inotuzumab ozogamicin', '*salvage']",2018/10/12 06:00,2019/09/24 06:00,['2018/10/12 06:00'],"['2018/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/07 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/24 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.31720 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2018 Oct 15;124(20):4044-4055. doi: 10.1002/cncr.31720.

Immunosuppressive therapy (IST) using antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine is successful in this setting. Eltrombopag is active in patients with refractory AA, presumably by increasing the bone marrow progenitors. METHODS: This phase 2 trial initially was designed to evaluate standard IST in newly diagnosed patients with severe AA and later was amended to add eltrombopag to simultaneously address immune destruction and stem cell depletion. The primary outcome was the overall response rate (ORR) at 3 months and 6 months. RESULTS: A total of 38 patients were enrolled: 17 (45%) received IST alone and 21 (55%) received additional eltrombopag. The ORR was 74%. Patients receiving IST plus eltrombopag had a similar ORR (76% vs 71%; P = .72), complete remission rate (38% vs 29%; P = .73), and median time to response (84 days vs 57 days; P = .30) compared with those receiving IST alone. The 2-year overall survival rate in the IST group was 91% compared with 82% for those patients treated with IST plus eltrombopag (P = .82). No cumulative toxicities were noted after the addition of eltrombopag. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of eltrombopag to standard IST was well tolerated and resulted in similar responses.","['Assi, Rita', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Daver, Naval G', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Burger, Jan', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Dinardo, Courtney D', 'Alvarado, Yesid', 'Hendrickson, Stephany', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Wierda, William', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Kadia, Tapan M']","['Assi R', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Ravandi F', 'Borthakur G', 'Daver NG', 'Jabbour E', 'Burger J', 'Estrov Z', 'Dinardo CD', 'Alvarado Y', 'Hendrickson S', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Wierda W', 'Cortes J', 'Kantarjian H', 'Kadia TM']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20181011,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Hydrazines)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'S56D65XJ9G (eltrombopag)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Aplastic/diagnosis/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Benzoates/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrazines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pyrazoles/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC6800043,['NOTNLM'],"['*aplastic anemia', '*cyclosporine', '*eltrombopag', '*horse antithymocyte globulin', '*stem cells']",2018/10/12 06:00,2019/09/19 06:00,['2018/10/12 06:00'],"['2018/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/09 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.31658 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2018 Nov 1;124(21):4192-4201. doi: 10.1002/cncr.31658.

Methods: Bone marrow and blood from patients with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia treated with alemtuzumab were evaluated by flow cytometry. Healthy donor blood was analyzed with or without in vitro treatment with alemtuzumab for comparison. Results: Immunophenotypic analysis of bone marrow collected 4 weeks after alemtuzumab treatment demonstrated artifactual surface kappa light chain restriction in CD19+ B cells and CD3+ T cells. Similar findings were observed in blood from another patient in a specimen collected 3 days after alemtuzumab treatment. These findings were recapitulated in healthy donor blood incubated with alemtuzumab. Conclusions: Alemtuzumab can produce direct interference during flow cytometry analysis, resulting in false-positive evidence of light chain clonality.

However, while HSCT can induce beneficial graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect, the adverse effect of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which is closely linked to GVL, is the major source of morbidity and mortality following HSCT. Until recently, available diagnostic and staging tools frequently fail to identify those at higher risk of disease progression or death. Furthermore, there are shortcomings in the prediction of the need for therapeutic interventions or the response rates to different forms of therapy. The past decade has been characterized by an explosive evolution of proteomics technologies, largely due to important advances in high-throughput MS instruments and bioinformatics. Building on these opportunities, blood biomarkers have been identified and validated both as promising diagnostic tools, prognostic tools that risk-stratify patients before future occurrence of GVHD and as predictive tools for responsiveness to GVHD therapy and non-relapse mortality. These biomarkers might facilitate timely and selective therapeutic intervention. This review summarizes current information on clinical proteomics for GVHD as well as other complications following HSCT. Finally, it proposes future directions for the translation of clinical proteomics to discovery of new potential therapeutic targets to the development of drugs.","['Paczesny, Sophie', 'Metzger, Jochen']","['Paczesny S', 'Metzger J']","['Department of Pediatrics, Department of Microbiology Immunology, and Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center, Indiana University School of Medicine, 46202 Indianapolis, IN.', 'Mosaiques-Diagnostics GmbH, 30659 Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['1293-15/Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society/International', 'UL1 TR001108/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 HL139934/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD074587/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA168814/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20181017,Germany,Proteomics Clin Appl,Proteomics.

However, the efficacy of long-term opioid analgesics is attenuated by tolerance and/or hyperalgesia after long-term use, preventing adequate pain relief under stable opioid dosages for chronic pain patients. Classical neuron-centered concepts about tolerance, such as internalization of opioid receptors, upregulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor function, or downregulation of glutamate transporter activity, can only partially explain the phenomenon of tolerance. Recent evidence revealing glial activation and upregulation of inflammatory mediators in the rodent central nervous system has confirmed the pivotal role of neuroinflammation in neuropathic pain or opioid tolerance, or both. However, human evidence is still sparse.Based on our clinical practice, we conducted translational research by investigating the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytokine and chemokine profiles of opioid-tolerant patients after research ethic committee approval. CSF samples from opioid-tolerant patients and opioid-naive subjects were compared. We found CXCL1, CXCL12, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were significantly upregulated among the opioid-tolerant patients and positively correlated with the opioid dosage.We translated these findings back to lab animal experiment; after induction of tolerance by morphine infusion, the spinal cord expression of CXCL1, CXCL12, and LIF were all upregulated. Although CXCL1 and CXCL12 infusion alone did not affect baseline tail-flick latency, morphine analgesic efficacy dropped significantly after intrathecal infusion of CXCL1 and CXCL12. After establishing tolerance by intrathecal continuous infusion of morphine, tolerance development was accelerated by co-administration of CXCL1 and CXCL12. In parallel, the effect was attenuated by co-administration of CXCL1- or CXCL12-neutralizing antibody or concordant receptor antagonists.On the contrary, although chronic morphine administration still induced LIF upregulation in rat spinal cords, intrathecal injection of LIF potentiated the analgesic action of morphine and delayed the development of morphine tolerance. Upregulation of endogenously released LIF by long-term use of opioids might counterbalance the tolerance induction effects of other pro-inflammatory cytokines.CXCL1, CXCL12, and LIF are upregulated in both opioid-tolerant patients and rodents. The onset and extent of opioid tolerance were affected by modulating the intrathecal CXCL1/CXCR2, CXCL12/CXCR4, and LIF signaling and could be novel drug targets for the treatment of opioid tolerance.","['Lin, Chih-Peng', 'Lu, Dai-Hua']","['Lin CP', 'Lu DH']","['Department of Anesthesiology, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. cplin0123@gmail.com.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['0 (Analgesics, Opioid)', '0 (CXCL1 protein, human)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL1)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",,"['Analgesics, Opioid/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Chemokine CXCL1/*physiology', 'Chemokine CXCL12/*physiology', '*Drug Tolerance', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/*physiopathology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Spinal Cord/drug effects']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Chemokine', 'Cytokine', 'Neuroinflammation', 'Opioid tolerance', 'Translational research']",2018/10/12 06:00,2019/07/28 06:00,['2018/10/12 06:00'],"['2018/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-981-13-1756-9_11 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2018;1099:125-139. doi: 10.1007/978-981-13-1756-9_11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hu08BBz also recognized canine IL-13Ralpha2. Both of these CAR T cell constructs demonstrated superior tumor inhibitory effects in a subcutaneous xenograft model of human glioma compared with a humanized EGFRvIII CAR T construct used in a recent phase 1 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02209376). The Hu08BBz demonstrated a 75% reduction in orthotopic tumor growth using low-dose CAR T cell infusion. Using combination therapy with immune checkpoint blockade, humanized IL-13Ralpha2 CAR T cells performed significantly better when combined with CTLA-4 blockade, and humanized EGFRvIII CAR T cells' efficacy was improved by PD-1 and TIM-3 blockade in the same mouse model, which was correlated with the levels of checkpoint molecule expression in co-cultures with the same tumor in vitro. Humanized IL-13Ralpha2 CAR T cells also demonstrated benefit from a self-secreted anti-CTLA-4 minibody in the same mouse model. In addition to a canine glioma cell line (J3T), canine osteosarcoma lung cancer and leukemia cell lines also express IL-13Ralpha2 and were recognized by Hu08BBz. Canine IL-13Ralpha2 CAR T cell was also generated and tested in vitro by co-culture with canine tumor cells and in vivo in an orthotopic model of canine glioma. Based on these results, we are designing a pre-clinical trial to evaluate the safety of canine IL-13Ralpha2 CAR T cells in dog with spontaneous IL-13Ralpha2-positive glioma, which will help to inform a human clinical trial design for glioblastoma using humanized scFv-based IL-13Ralpha2 targeting CAR T cells.","['Yin, Yibo', 'Boesteanu, Alina C', 'Binder, Zev A', 'Xu, Chong', 'Reid, Reiss A',

IL6-mediated activation of STAT3 is implicated as a critical therapeutic target for cancer therapy. Less is known about the role of LIF, which can similarly activate STAT3, in ovarian cancer. We therefore sought to evaluate the tumorigenic effects of CA-MSC paracrine LIF signaling and the redundancy of IL6 and LIF in activating ovarian cancer STAT3 mediated cancer growth. As expected, we found that both IL6 and LIF induce STAT3 phosphorylation in tumor cells. In addition, both IL6 and LIF increased the percentage of ALDH+ ovarian cancer stem-like cells (CSC). Supporting redundancy of function by the two cytokines, CA-MSC induced STAT3 phosphorylation and increased cancer cell ""stemness"". This effect was not inhibited by LIF or IL6 blocking antibodies alone, but was prevented by dual IL6/LIF blockade or JAK2 inhibition. Similarly, small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated reduction of IL6 or LIF in CA-MSC partially decreased but could not completely abrograte the ability of CA-MSC to induce STAT3 phosphorylation and stemness. Importantly, the in vivo pro-tumorigenic effect of CA-MSC is abrogated by dual blockade with the JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib to a much greater extent than treatment with anti-IL6 or anti-LIF antibody alone. Ruxolitinib treatment also improves survival in the immunocompetent ovarian cancer mouse model system with ID8 tumor cells plus MSC. Ruxolitinib-treated tumors in both the immunocompromised and immunocompetent animal models demonstrate decreased phospho-STAT3, indicating on-target activity. In conclusion, CA-MSC activate ovarian cancer cell STAT3 signaling via IL6 and LIF and increase tumor cell stemness. This functional redundancy suggests that therapeutic targeting of a single cytokine may be less effective than strategies such as dual inhibitor therapy or targeting shared downstream factors of the JAK/STAT pathway.","['McLean, Karen', 'Tan, Lijun', 'Bolland, Danielle E', 'Coffman, Lan G', 'Peterson, Luke F', 'Talpaz, Moshe', 'Neamati, Nouri', 'Buckanovich, Ronald J']","['McLean K', 'Tan L', 'Bolland DE', 'Coffman LG', 'Peterson LF', 'Talpaz M', 'Neamati N', 'Buckanovich RJ']","['Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. karenmcl@umich.edu.', 'Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Magee-Womens Research Institute University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburg, PA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Division of Hematology Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry, College of Pharmacy North Campus Research Complex, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Magee-Womens Research Institute University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburg, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['K08 CA211362/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 HD065257/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20181010,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '82S8X8XX8H (ruxolitinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*genetics', 'Janus Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Nitriles', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC6374186,,,2018/10/12 06:00,2019/03/02 06:00,['2018/10/12 06:00'],"['2017/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/30 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/02 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-018-0523-6 [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-018-0523-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2019 Feb;38(9):1576-1584. doi: 10.1038/s41388-018-0523-6.

PRL-3 is an oncogenic phosphatase implicated in the development of LSCs. Here, we identified Leo1 as a direct and specific substrate of PRL-3. Serine-dephosphorylated form of Leo1 binds directly to beta-catenin, promoting the nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin and transactivation of TCF/LEF downstream target genes such as cyclin D1 and c-myc. Importantly, overexpression of PRL-3 in AML cells displayed enhanced sensitivity towards beta-catenin inhibition in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that these cells are addicted to beta-catenin signaling. Altogether, our study revealed a novel regulatory role of PRL-3 in the sustenance of aberrant beta-catenin signaling in AML. PRL-3 may serve as a biomarker to select for the subset of AML patients who are likely to benefit from treatment with beta-catenin inhibitors.

By identifying genes that influence sensitivity to GC-induced cell death, we found that histone methyltransferases G9a and G9a-like protein (GLP), two glucocorticoid receptor (GR) coactivators, are required for GC-induced cell death in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cell line Nalm6. We previously established in a few selected genes that automethylated G9a and GLP recruit heterochromatin protein 1gamma (HP1gamma) as another required coactivator. Here, we used a genome-wide analysis to show that HP1gamma is selectively required for GC-regulated expression of the great majority of GR target genes that require G9a and GLP. To further address the importance of G9a and GLP methylation in this process and in cell physiology, we found that JIB-04, a selective JmjC family lysine demethylase inhibitor, increased G9a methylation and thereby increased G9a binding to HP1gamma. This led to increased expression of GR target genes regulated by G9a, GLP and HP1gamma and enhanced Nalm6 cell death. Finally, the KDM4 lysine demethylase subfamily demethylates G9a in vitro, in contrast to other KDM enzymes tested. Thus, inhibiting G9a/GLP demethylation potentially represents a novel method to restore sensitivity of treatment-resistant B-ALL tumors to GC-induced cell death.","['Poulard, Coralie', 'Baulu, Estelle', 'Lee, Brian H', 'Pufall, Miles A', 'Stallcup, Michael R']","['Poulard C', 'Baulu E', 'Lee BH', 'Pufall MA', 'Stallcup MR']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, USA. coraliepoulard69@gmail.com.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, 52242, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA014089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK043093/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 DK055274/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181010,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Histone Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EHMT2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['A549 Cells', 'Cell Death/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Glucocorticoids/*genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/*genetics', 'Histone Methyltransferases/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Methylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*pathology', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/*pathology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/genetics', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/genetics']",PMC6180122,,,2018/10/12 06:00,2019/11/14 06:00,['2018/10/12 06:00'],"['2018/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/09/18 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-018-1110-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-018-1110-z [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2018 Oct 10;9(10):1038. doi: 10.1038/s41419-018-1110-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to being substrates, cellular nucleotides also allosterically regulate SAMHD1 activity. Recently, it was shown that high expression levels of SAMHD1 are also correlated with significantly worse patient responses to nucleotide analog drugs important for treating a variety of cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this study, we used biochemical, structural, and cellular methods to examine the interactions of various cancer drugs with SAMHD1. We found that both the catalytic and the allosteric sites of SAMHD1 are sensitive to sugar modifications of the nucleotide analogs, with the allosteric site being significantly more restrictive. We crystallized cladribine-TP, clofarabine-TP, fludarabine-TP, vidarabine-TP, cytarabine-TP, and gemcitabine-TP in the catalytic pocket of SAMHD1. We found that all of these drugs are substrates of SAMHD1 and that the efficacy of most of these drugs is affected by SAMHD1 activity. Of the nucleotide analogs tested, only cladribine-TP with a deoxyribose sugar efficiently induced the catalytically active SAMHD1 tetramer. Together, these results establish a detailed framework for understanding the substrate specificity and allosteric activation of SAMHD1 with regard to nucleotide analogs, which can be used to improve current cancer and antiviral therapies.","['Knecht, Kirsten M', 'Buzovetsky, Olga', 'Schneider, Constanze', 'Thomas, Dominique', 'Srikanth, Vishok', 'Kaderali, Lars', 'Tofoleanu, Florentina', 'Reiss, Krystle', 'Ferreiros, Nerea', 'Geisslinger, Gerd', 'Batista, Victor S', 'Ji, Xiaoyun', 'Cinatl, Jindrich Jr', 'Keppler, Oliver T', 'Xiong, Yong']","['Knecht KM', 'Buzovetsky O', 'Schneider C', 'Thomas D', 'Srikanth V', 'Kaderali L', 'Tofoleanu F', 'Reiss K', 'Ferreiros N', 'Geisslinger G', 'Batista VS', 'Ji X', 'Cinatl J Jr', 'Keppler OT', 'Xiong Y']","['Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520.', 'Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520.', 'Institute of Medical Virology, University Hospital Frankfurt, 60596 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmazentrum Frankfurt, Goethe University of Frankfurt, 60590 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Zentrum fur Arzneimittelforschung, -entwicklung, und -sicherheit, Goethe University of Frankfurt, 60590 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520.', 'Institute of Bioinformatics, University Medicine Greifswald, 17475 Greifswald, Germany.', 'Department of Chemistry, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520.', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Department of Chemistry, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmazentrum Frankfurt, Goethe University of Frankfurt, 60590 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Zentrum fur Arzneimittelforschung, -entwicklung, und -sicherheit, Goethe University of Frankfurt, 60590 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmazentrum Frankfurt, Goethe University of Frankfurt, 60590 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Zentrum fur Arzneimittelforschung, -entwicklung, und -sicherheit, Goethe University of Frankfurt, 60590 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Project Group Translational Medicine and Pharmacology, Frauenhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology, 60590 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Chemistry, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520.', 'The State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210023 Jiangsu, China.', 'Institute of Medical Virology, University Hospital Frankfurt, 60596 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Max von Pettenkofer-Institute, Department of Virology, Ludwig Maximilians University, 80336 Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520; yong.xiong@yale.edu.']",['eng'],"['R21 AI136737/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007223/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008283/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20181010,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nucleotides)', 'EC 3.1.5.- (SAM Domain and HD Domain-Containing Protein 1)', 'EC 3.1.5.- (SAMHD1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Allosteric Site/*drug effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Catalytic Domain/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Crystallography, X-Ray/methods', 'Drug Interactions/*physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Nucleotides/pharmacology', 'SAM Domain and HD Domain-Containing Protein 1/*metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity']",PMC6205433,['NOTNLM'],"['*SAMHD1', '*allosteric regulation', '*dNTPase', '*nucleotide analog drugs', '*substrate selection']",2018/10/12 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/10/12 06:00'],"['2018/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['1805593115 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1805593115 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2018 Oct 23;115(43):E10022-E10031. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1805593115.

A Study of Eltrombopag in Myelodysplastic Syndromes Receiving Azacitidine (SUPPORT), a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, investigated the platelet supportive effects of eltrombopag given concomitantly with azacitidine. International Prognostic Scoring System intermediate-1, intermediate-2, or high-risk MDS patients with baseline platelets <75 x 10(9)/L were randomized 1:1 to eltrombopag (start, 200 mg/d [East Asians, 100 mg/d], maximum, 300 mg/d [East Asians, 150 mg/d]) or placebo, plus azacitidine (75 mg/m(2) subcutaneously once daily for 7 days every 28 days). The primary end point was the proportion of patients platelet transfusion-free during cycles 1 through 4 of azacitidine therapy. Based on planned interim analyses, an independent data monitoring committee recommended stopping the study prematurely because efficacy outcomes crossed the predefined futility threshold and for safety reasons. At termination, 28/179 (16%) eltrombopag and 55/177 (31%) placebo patients met the primary end point. Overall response (International Working Group criteria; complete, marrow, or partial response) occurred in 20% and 35% of eltrombopag and placebo patients, respectively, by investigator assessment. There was no difference in hematologic improvement in any cell lineage between the 2 arms. There was no improvement in overall or progression-free survival. Adverse events with >/=10% occurrence in the eltrombopag vs placebo arm were febrile neutropenia and diarrhea. Compared with azacitidine alone, eltrombopag plus azacitidine worsened platelet recovery, with lower response rates and a trend toward increased progression to acute myeloid leukemia.

Developing successful therapeutic strategies using live cells could benefit from the ability to rapidly determine their in vivo biodistribution and persistence. Assaying cell biodistribution is unconventional compared to traditional small molecule drug pharmacokinetic readouts used in the pharmaceutical pipeline, yet this information is critical towards understanding putative therapeutic outcomes and modes of action. Towards this goal, efforts are underway to visualize and quantify immune cell therapy in vivo using advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. Cell labeling probes based on perfluorocarbon nanoemulsions, paired with fluorine-19 MRI detection, enables background-free quantification of cell localization and survival. Here, we highlight recent preclinical and clinical uses of perfluorocarbon probes and (19)F MRI for adoptive cell transfer (ACT) studies employing experimental T lymphocytes, NK, PBMC, and dendritic cell therapies. We assess the forward looking potential of this emerging imaging technology to aid discovery and preclinical phases, as well as clinical trials. The limitations and barriers towards widespread adoption of this technology, as well as alternative imaging strategies, are discussed.","['Chapelin, Fanny', 'Capitini, Christian M', 'Ahrens, Eric T']","['Chapelin F', 'Capitini CM', 'Ahrens ET']","['Department of Bioengineering, University of California San Diego, 2880 Torrey Pines Scenic Drive, La Jolla, CA, 92037, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, 1111 Highland Avenue, Madison, WI, 53705, USA. ccapitini@pediatrics.wisc.edu.', 'Department of Radiology, University of California of San Diego, 9500 Gilman Dr. #0695, La Jolla, CA, 92093-0695, USA. eta@ucsd.edu.']",['eng'],"['K08 CA174750/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA014520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA139579/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EB017271/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EB024015/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20181011,England,J Immunother Cancer,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,101620585,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy/*methods', 'Fluorine-19 Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging/immunology/pathology']",PMC6180584,['NOTNLM'],"['*19F MRI', '*Adoptive cell transfer', '*Cancer', '*Fluorine-19', '*Immunotherapy', '*Perfluorocarbon', '*T cell']",2018/10/12 06:00,2019/10/28 06:00,['2018/10/12 06:00'],"['2018/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40425-018-0416-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s40425-018-0416-9 [pii]']",epublish,J Immunother Cancer. 2018 Oct 11;6(1):105. doi: 10.1186/s40425-018-0416-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, only 2 Chinese WDSTS patients have been reported. Here, we report the phenotypes and KMT2A gene variations in 14 unrelated Chinese WDSTS patients and investigate the phenotypic differences between the Chinese and French cohorts. METHODS: Next generation sequencing was performed for each patient, and the variants in the KMT2A gene were validated by Sanger sequencing. The phenotypes of 16 Chinese WDSTS patients were summarized and compared to 33 French patients. RESULTS: Genetic sequencing identified 13 deleterious de novo KMT2A variants in 14 patients, including 10 truncating, 2 missenses and 1 splicing variants. Of the 13 variants, 11 are novel and two have been reported previously. One of the patients is mosaic in the KMT2A gene. The variation spectra and phenotypic profiles of the Chinese WDSTS patients showed no difference with patients of other ethnicities; however, differ in the frequencies of several clinical features. We demonstrated that variations in the KMT2A gene can lead to both advanced and delayed bone age. We identified 6 novel phenotypes, which include microcephaly, deep palmar crease, external ear deformity, carpal epiphyseal growth retardation, dyslipidemia, and glossoptosis. In addition, patients harbored missense variants in the CXXC zinc finger domain of KMT2A showed more severe neurophenotypes. CONCLUSION: Our study consists of the largest cohort of Chinese WDSTS patients that continues to expand the WDSTS phenotypic and variation spectrum. Our results support the notion that the CXXC zinc finger domain of KMT2A gene is a hotspot for missense variants associated with more severe neurophenotypes.","['Li, Niu', 'Wang, Yirou', 'Yang, Yu', 'Wang, Pengpeng', 'Huang, Hui', 'Xiong, Shiyi', 'Sun, Luming', 'Cheng, Min', 'Song, Cui', 'Cheng, Xinran', 'Ding, Yu', 'Chang, Guoying', 'Chen, Yao', 'Xu, Yufei', 'Yu, Tingting', 'Yao, Ru-En', 'Shen, Yiping', 'Wang, Xiumin', 'Wang, Jian']","['Li N', 'Wang Y', 'Yang Y', 'Wang P', 'Huang H', 'Xiong S', 'Sun L', 'Cheng M', 'Song C', 'Cheng X', 'Ding Y', 'Chang G', 'Chen Y', 'Xu Y', 'Yu T', 'Yao RE', 'Shen Y', 'Wang X', 'Wang J']","[""Department of Medical Genetics and Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, China."", ""Institute of Pediatric Translational Medicine, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, China."", ""Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, China."", ""Department of Endocrinology, Metabolism, and Genetics, Jiangxi Provincial Children's Hospital, Nanchang, 330029, Jiangxi, China."", 'MyGenostics Inc., Beijing, 101318, China.', ""Central laboratory, Jiangxi Provincial Children's Hospital, Nanchang, 330029, Jiangxi, China."", ""Fetal Medicine Unit & Prenatal diagnosis center, Shanghai First Maternity and Infant hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Fetal Medicine Unit & Prenatal diagnosis center, Shanghai First Maternity and Infant hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Neurology, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 400014, China."", ""Department of Endocrinology and Genetic Metabolic Diseases, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders.

Particular mutations involved in apoptosis may have a main role in the onset of ALL in the pediatric patients. It has been proven that cycloxygenase-2 is capable of impairing the apoptosis pathway through mitochondria in tumor cells. METHODOLOGY: In this study, we investigated selective toxicity of a newly synthesized chalconeferrocenyl derivative as a selective cycloxygenase-2 inhibitor in ALL and healthy B-lymphocytes, and also isolated mitochondria obtained from them. For this purpose, we evaluated the cellar parameters like viability, apoptosis/necrosis, caspase-3 activation and ATP content, and also mitochondrial parameters like mitochondrial membrane potential decline, reactive oxygen species formation, cytochrome C release and mitochondrial swelling. CONCLUSION: Our results implied that this compound can selectively induce cellular and mitochondrial toxicity in cancerous ALL B-lymphocytes and obtained mitochondria from them without any detrimental effects on healthy subjects.","['Aghvami, Marjan', 'Salimi, Ahmad', 'Eshghi, Peyman', 'Zarei, Mohammad H', 'Farzaneh, Shabnam', 'Sattari, Fatemeh', 'Zarghi, Afshin', 'Pourahmad, Jalal']","['Aghvami M', 'Salimi A', 'Eshghi P', 'Zarei MH', 'Farzaneh S', 'Sattari F', 'Zarghi A', 'Pourahmad J']","['Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, 1991953381, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Ardabil University of Medical Sciences, Ardabil, Iran.', 'Pediatric Congenital Hematologic Disorders Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, 1991953381, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, 1991953381, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, 1991953381, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, 1991953381, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, 1991953381, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181011,England,Future Med Chem,Future medicinal chemistry,101511162,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*apoptosis', '*cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors', '*mitochondria', '*pediatric ALL']",2018/10/12 06:00,2019/04/19 06:00,['2018/10/12 06:00'],"['2018/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/19 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.4155/fmc-2018-0032 [doi]'],ppublish,Future Med Chem. 2018 Oct 1;10(19):2277-2289. doi: 10.4155/fmc-2018-0032.

The field of epigenetic regulation of normal and malignant hematopoiesis is rapidly growing. In recent years, heterozygous somatic mutations in genes encoding epigenetic regulators have been found in all subtypes of myeloid malignancies, supporting the rationale for treatment with epigenetic modifiers. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are epigenetic modifiers that, in vitro, have been shown to induce growth arrest, apoptotic or autophagic cell death, and terminal differentiation of myeloid tumor cells. These effects were observed both at the bulk tumor level and in the most immature CD34(+)38(-) cell compartments containing the leukemic stem cells. Thus, there is a strong rationale supporting HDACi therapy in myeloid malignancies. However, despite initial promising results in phase I trials, HDACi in monotherapy as well as in combination with other drugs, have failed to improve responses or survival. This review provides an overview of the rationale for HDACi in myeloid malignancies, clinical results and speculations on why clinical trials have thus far not met the expectations, and how this may be improved in the future.","['Ungerstedt, Johanna S']",['Ungerstedt JS'],"['Department of Medicine, Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, and Hematology Center, and Karolinska University Hospital, S-141 86 Stockholm, Sweden. johanna.ungerstedt@ki.se.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20181009,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'DNA Methylation', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6212943,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'chronic myelomonocytic leukemia', 'myelodysplastic syndromes', 'myeloid mutations', 'systemic mastocytosis', 'treatment']",2018/10/12 06:00,2019/01/15 06:00,['2018/10/12 06:00'],"['2018/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/01 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms19103091 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms19103091 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2018 Oct 9;19(10). pii: ijms19103091. doi: 10.3390/ijms19103091.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This subtype of T-ALL has been associated with induction failure and aggressive disease. Identification of drug targets and mechanistic insights for this disease are still limited. Here, we established a human NOTCH1-independent MYC-translocated T-ALL cell line that maintains the genetic and phenotypic characteristics of the parental leukemic clone at diagnosis. The University of Padua T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia 13 (UP-ALL13) cell line has all the main features of the above described MYC-translocated T-ALL. Interestingly, UP-ALL13 was found to harbor a heterozygous R882H DNMT3A mutation typically found in myeloid leukemia. Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing for histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) acetylation revealed numerous putative super-enhancers near key transcription factors, including MYC, MYB, and LEF1. Marked cytotoxicity was found following bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) inhibition with AZD5153, suggesting a strict dependency of this particular subtype of T-ALL on the activity of super-enhancers. Altogether, this cell line may be a useful model system for dissecting the signaling pathways implicated in NOTCH1-independent T-ALL and for the screening of targeted anti-leukemia agents specific for this T-ALL subgroup.","['Tosello, Valeria', 'Milani, Gloria', 'Martines, Annalisa', 'Macri, Nadia', 'Van Loocke, Wouder', 'Matthijssens, Filip', 'Buldini, Barbara', 'Minuzzo, Sonia', 'Bongiovanni, Deborah', 'Schumacher, Richard Fabian', 'Amadori, Alberto', 'Van Vlierberghe, Pieter', 'Piovan, Erich']","['Tosello V', 'Milani G', 'Martines A', 'Macri N', 'Van Loocke W', 'Matthijssens F', 'Buldini B', 'Minuzzo S', 'Bongiovanni D', 'Schumacher RF', 'Amadori A', 'Van Vlierberghe P', 'Piovan E']","['UOC Immunologia e Diagnostica Molecolare Oncologica, Istituto Oncologico Veneto-IRCCS, Padova 35128, Italy. valeria.tosello@iov.veneto.it.', 'Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Ghent 9000, Belgium. gloria.milani@gmail.com.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent 9000, Belgium. gloria.milani@gmail.com.', 'UOC Immunologia e Diagnostica Molecolare Oncologica, Istituto Oncologico Veneto-IRCCS, Padova 35128, Italy. annalisa.martines@iov.veneto.it.', 'UOC Immunologia e Diagnostica Molecolare Oncologica, Istituto Oncologico Veneto-IRCCS, Padova 35128, Italy. nadia.macri@iov.veneto.it.', 'Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Ghent 9000, Belgium.

Currently, combined chemotherapy regimens, such as Hyper-CVAD and PETHEMA, are used in patients with adult ALL. However, there has been no study comparing the results of Hyper-CVAD and PETHEMA ALL-93. METHODS: In this retrospective single-center study, we evaluated the results of Hyper-CVAD and PETHEMA ALL-93 in 51 ALL patients treated between September 2008 and March 2017 at the Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Karadeniz Technical University. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients were treated with Hyper-CVAD and 13 with PETHEMA ALL-93. CR was obtained in 90 and 100% of patients, respectively. Survival estimates were comparable between Hyper-CVAD and PE-THEMA ALL-93, with a median overall survival (OS) and a median disease-free survival (DFS) of 17.5 and 12.1 months, respectively, for Hyper-CVAD and of 18.6 and 12.9 months, respectively, for PETHEMA ALL-93. The 2-year OS rates for Hyper-CVAD and PETHEMA ALL-93 were 30 and 40%, respectively, and the 2-year DFS rates were 28 and 44%, respectively. PETHEMA ALL-93 resulted in more hepatotoxicity, hypofibrinogenemia, aspergillus infection, and skin rash than Hyper-CVAD. CONCLUSIONS: Although Hyper-CVAD and PE-THEMA ALL-93 showed similar effects, Hyper-CVAD was tolerated better. Age and comorbidities should be taken into account before a chemotherapy regimen is determined for patients with ALL.","['Erkut, Nergiz', 'Akidan, Osman', 'Selim Batur, Derya', 'Karabacak, Volkan', 'Sonmez, Mehmet']","['Erkut N', 'Akidan O', 'Selim Batur D', 'Karabacak V', 'Sonmez M']","['Department of Hematology, School of Medicine, Karadeniz Technical University, Trabzon, Turkeydrnusta@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Karadeniz Technical University, Trabzon, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, School of Medicine, Karadeniz Technical University, Trabzon, Turkey.', 'Department of Public Health, School of Medicine, Karadeniz Technical University, Trabzon, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, School of Medicine, Karadeniz Technical University, Trabzon, Turkey.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20181010,Switzerland,Chemotherapy,Chemotherapy,0144731,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'CCG-141 protocol', 'CVAD protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Infections/etiology', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Dexamethasone/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fever/etiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prednisone/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Hyper-CVAD', 'PETHEMA ALL-93', 'Side effects', 'Survival']",2018/10/12 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/10/11 06:00'],"['2018/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['000492531 [pii]', '10.1159/000492531 [doi]']",ppublish,Chemotherapy. 2018;63(4):207-213. doi: 10.1159/000492531.

The aim of the study was to reveal the relationship between the elevated exosomal miR-125b level and the poor prognosis in adult patients with this disease. METHODS: A total of 154 consecutive patients with intermediate-risk acute myeloid leukemia were enrolled. Exosomes were isolated from blood specimens. The exosomal miR-125b level was determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Patients received standardized therapy and were followed up for 1-24 months. Details about relapse and overall death were recorded. RESULTS: Patients were divided into the high miR-125b level group (n = 77) and the low miR-125b level group (n = 77). In the multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression model, the high miR-125b level group was separately associated with increased risks of relapse and overall death in 2 years (hazard ratio [HR] 2.84, 95% CI 1.81-4.33 and HR 2.69, 95% CI 1.87-4.52). Kaplan-Meier analysis also revealed that a high miR-125b level was related to a higher cumulative relapse and overall death rates (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Circulating exosomal miR-125b concentration might be an independent prognostic indicator in intermediate-risk acute myeloid leukemia patients. An elevated miR-125b level indicated higher risks of relapse and overall death.","['Jiang, Lijun', 'Deng, Taoran', 'Wang, Di', 'Xiao, Yi']","['Jiang L', 'Deng T', 'Wang D', 'Xiao Y']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181010,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Exosomes/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Recurrence', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Exosomes', '*MIRN125 microRNA', '*Overall death', '*Recurrence']",2018/10/12 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2018/10/11 06:00'],"['2017/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['000491584 [pii]', '10.1159/000491584 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2018;140(3):183-192. doi: 10.1159/000491584.

Approval of tisagenlecleucel, a chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, represents a new and potentially curative treatment option. However, tisagenlecleucel is expensive, with a current list price of $475000 per one-time administration. Objective: To estimate the long-term survival and value of tisagenlecleucel for children and young adults with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cost-effectiveness analysis, a decision analytic model was designed to extrapolate trial evidence to a patient lifetime horizon. The survival evidence for the model was extracted from 3 studies: B2202 (enrolled patients from April 8, 2015, to November 23, 2016), B2205J (enrolled patients from August 14, 2014, to February 1, 2016), and B2101J (enrolled patients from March 15, 2012, to November 30, 2015). Long-term survival and outcomes of patients younger than 25 years with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia that is refractory or in second or later relapse were derived using flexible parametric modeling from the direct extrapolation of event-free survival and overall survival curves. The published Kaplan-Meier curves were digitized from November 1, 2017, to November 30, 2017, using an algorithm to impute patient-level time-to-event data. Sensitivity and scenario analyses assessed uncertainty in the evidence and model assumptions to further bound the range of cost-effectiveness. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2017, to March 31, 2018. Interventions: The primary intervention of interest was tisagenlecleucel. The comparator of interest was the chemoimmunotherapeutic agent clofarabine. Main Outcomes and Measures: Model outcomes included life-years gained, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, and incremental costs per life-year and QALY gained. Results: Forty percent of patients initiating treatment with tisagenlecleucel are expected to be long-term survivors, or alive and responding to treatment after 5 years. Tisagenlecleucel had a total discounted cost of $667000, with discounted life-years gained of 10.34 years and 9.28 QALYs gained. The clofarabine comparator had a total discounted cost of approximately $337000, with discounted life-years gained of 2.43 years and 2.10 QALYs gained. This difference resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of approximately $42000 per life-year gained and approximately $46000 per QALY gained for tisagenlecleucel vs clofarabine. These results were robust to probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Across scenario analyses that included more conservative assumptions regarding long-term relapse and survival, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ranged from $37000 to $78000 per QALY gained. Conclusions and Relevance: Tisagenlecleucel likely provides gains in survival and seems to be priced in alignment with these benefits. This study suggests that payers and innovators should develop novel payment models that reduce the risk and uncertainty around long-term value and provide safeguards to ensure high-value care.","['Whittington, Melanie D', 'McQueen, R Brett', 'Ollendorf, Daniel A', 'Kumar, Varun M', 'Chapman, Richard H', 'Tice, Jeffrey A', 'Pearson, Steven D', 'Campbell, Jonathan D']","['Whittington MD', 'McQueen RB', 'Ollendorf DA', 'Kumar VM', 'Chapman RH', 'Tice JA', 'Pearson SD', 'Campbell JD']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacy, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora.', 'The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco.', 'The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,JAMA Pediatr,JAMA pediatrics,101589544,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)', 'Q6C9WHR03O (tisagenlecleucel)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/economics/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clofarabine/economics/therapeutic use', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/economics/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/economics/mortality/*therapy', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC6583018,,,2018/10/12 06:00,2019/10/08 06:00,['2018/10/11 06:00'],"['2018/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/08 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['2704489 [pii]', '10.1001/jamapediatrics.2018.2530 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA Pediatr. 2018 Dec 1;172(12):1161-1168. doi: 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2018.2530.,,,,,,['JAMA Pediatr. 2018 Dec 1;172(12):1123-1124.

The aim of this was to assess Ki-67 expression on mature B-cell neoplasms samples with flow cytometry immunophenotyping. METHOD: After surface staining with CD19 and CD45, intracellular staining for Ki-67 was performed in leukemic mature B-cells. Ki-67 expression was evaluated with flow cytometry. RESULTS: Ki-67 expression was higher in mantle cell lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cases. It was also associated with CD38 mean fluorescence intensity. CONCLUSIONS: Ki-67 expression evaluated by flow cytometry can be a useful tool in the diagnosis of mature B-cell neoplasms. More studies are needed to validate Ki-67 assessment with flow cytometry immunophenotyping.","['Marcondes, Natalia', 'Fernandes, Flavo', 'Faulhaber, Gustavo']","['Marcondes N', 'Fernandes F', 'Faulhaber G']","['Programa de Pos Graduacao em Medicina: Ciencias Medicas, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brasil.', 'Laboratorio Zanol, Porto Alegre, RS, Brasil.', 'Laboratorio Zanol, Porto Alegre, RS, Brasil.', 'Programa de Pos Graduacao em Medicina: Ciencias Medicas, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brasil.', 'Laboratorio Zanol, Porto Alegre, RS, Brasil.', 'Departamento de Medicina Interna, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brasil.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Brazil,Rev Assoc Med Bras (1992),Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira (1992),9308586,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD19', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Ki-67 Antigen/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/metabolism']",,,,2018/10/12 06:00,2018/11/01 06:00,['2018/10/11 06:00'],"['2017/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0104-42302018000600525 [pii]', '10.1590/1806-9282.64.06.525 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Assoc Med Bras (1992). 2018 Jun;64(6):525-529. doi: 10.1590/1806-9282.64.06.525.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1346-2082'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although at diagnosis cytogenetic alterations are frequent in AML, roughly 50% of patients present an apparently normal karyotype (NK), leading to a highly heterogeneous prognosis. Due to this significant heterogeneity, it has been suggested that different molecular mechanisms may trigger the disease with diverse prognostic implications. We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) of tumor-normal matched samples of de novo AML-NK patients lacking mutations in NPM1, CEBPA or FLT3-ITD to identify new gene mutations with potential prognostic and therapeutic relevance to patients with AML. Novel candidate-genes, together with others previously described, were targeted resequenced in an independent cohort of 100 de novo AML patients classified in the cytogenetic intermediate-risk (IR) category. A mean of 4.89 mutations per sample were detected in 73 genes, 35 of which were mutated in more than one patient. After a network enrichment analysis, we defined a single in silico model and established a set of seed-genes that may trigger leukemogenesis in patients with normal karyotype. The high heterogeneity of gene mutations observed in AML patients suggested that a specific alteration could not be as essential as the interaction of deregulated pathways.","['Ibanez, Mariam', 'Carbonell-Caballero, Jose', 'Such, Esperanza', 'Garcia-Alonso, Luz', 'Liquori, Alessandro', 'Lopez-Pavia, Maria', 'Llop, Marta', 'Alonso, Carmen', 'Barragan, Eva', 'Gomez-Segui, Ines', 'Neef, Alexander', 'Hervas, David', 'Montesinos, Pau', 'Sanz, Guillermo', 'Sanz, Miguel Angel', 'Dopazo, Joaquin', 'Cervera, Jose']","['Ibanez M', 'Carbonell-Caballero J', 'Such E', 'Garcia-Alonso L', 'Liquori A', 'Lopez-Pavia M', 'Llop M', 'Alonso C', 'Barragan E', 'Gomez-Segui I', 'Neef A', 'Hervas D', 'Montesinos P', 'Sanz G', 'Sanz MA', 'Dopazo J', 'Cervera J']","['Hematology Service, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), Instituto Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Departamento de Ciencias Biomedicas, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad CEU Cardenal Herrera, Valencia, Spain.', ""ProCURE, Catalan Institute of Oncology, Bellvitge Institute for Biomedical Research (IDIBELL), L'Hospitalet del Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Hematology Service, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), Instituto Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'European Molecular Biology Laboratory-European Bioinformatics Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Hematology Service, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), Instituto Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), Instituto Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Medical Pathology, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, Hospital Arnau de Villanoba, Valencia, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), Instituto Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Medical Pathology, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), Instituto Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Biostatistics Unit, IIS La Fe Valencia, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), Instituto Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), Instituto Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), Instituto Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Functional Genomics Node, Spanish National Institute of Bioinformatics at CIPF, Valencia, Spain.', 'Bioinformatics of Rare Diseases (BIER), CIBER de Enfermedades Raras (CIBERER), Valencia, Spain.', 'Clinical Bioinformatics Area, Fundacion Progreso y Salud (FPS), CDCA, Hospital Virgen del Rocio, Sevilla, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), Instituto Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Genetics Unit, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181010,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cytodiagnosis', 'Female', 'Gene Regulatory Networks/genetics', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', '*Whole Exome Sequencing']",PMC6179200,,,2018/10/12 06:00,2019/03/13 06:00,['2018/10/11 06:00'],"['2018/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0202926 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-09254 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2018 Oct 10;13(10):e0202926. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0202926. eCollection 2018.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-7486-4659', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3318-120X']",['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Younger immunocompromised women can also be affected. We describe a case of vulvar carcinoma as a result of GATA2 deficiency. CASE: A 19-year-old woman presented to our gynecologic oncology clinic for management of a large vulvar mass. She was diagnosed with stage IB vulvar carcinoma after vulvectomy. GATA2 deficiency was the contributing factor causing vulvar carcinoma. CONCLUSION: GATA2 deficiency causes immunodeficiency in young women, and patients with early-onset HPV-related disease, a family or personal history of leukemia, recurrent infection, or immune irregularities should be screened. Health care providers for these women are often obstetrician-gynecologists, who can provide diagnosis, treatment, referral, and prevention of HPV-related diseases.","['Toboni, Michael D', 'Bevis, Kerri S']","['Toboni MD', 'Bevis KS']","['Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology and the Division of Gynecologic Oncology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Obstet Gynecol,Obstetrics and gynecology,0401101,,IM,"['Carcinoma in Situ/*etiology/surgery', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*etiology/surgery', 'Condylomata Acuminata/*etiology/surgery', 'Female', 'GATA2 Deficiency/*complications/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*complications/genetics', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*surgery', 'Vulvar Neoplasms/*etiology/surgery', 'Young Adult']",,,,2018/10/12 06:00,2019/09/26 06:00,['2018/10/11 06:00'],"['2018/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/AOG.0000000000002905 [doi]'],ppublish,Obstet Gynecol. 2018 Nov;132(5):1112-1115. doi: 10.1097/AOG.0000000000002905.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we investigated transcriptome-wide interactions of the RORC pathway in HTLV-1 and ATL, using our own and publicly available gene expression data for ATL and other leukemias. Gene expression data from ATL patients were analyzed using WGCNA to determine gene modules and their correlation to clinical and molecular data. Both PBMCs and CD4(+) T-Cells exhibited decreased RORC expression in four different ATL cohorts. A small subset of RORC(hi) ATL patients was identified with significantly lower pathognomonic CADM1 and HBZ levels but similar levels of other ATL markers (CD4/CD25/CCR4), hinting at a less aggressive ATL subtype. An age-dependent decrease in RORC expression was found in HTLV-1-infected individuals, but not in healthy controls, suggesting an early molecular event predisposing to leukemogenesis. Genes upstream of RORC signaling were members of a proliferative gene module (containing proliferation markers PCNA/Ki67), whereas downstream members clustered in an anti-proliferative gene module. IL17C transcripts showed the strongest negative correlation to PCNA in both ATL cohorts, which was replicated in two large cohorts of T- and B-cell acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL). Finally, IL17C expression in purified CD4 + CCR4 + CD26-CD7- ""ATL-like"" cells from HTLV-1-infected individuals and ATL patients was negatively correlated with clonality, underscoring a possible antileukemic/antiproliferative role. In conclusion, decreased RORC expression and downstream signaling might represent an early event in ATL pathogenesis.

METHODS: This study compared the treatment outcomes of patients overall and patients with a non-CNS-1 status (CNS-2, CNS-3, or TLP with blasts) in 2 treatment eras, one before and another after the revision of the TPOG-ALL-2002 protocol by the introduction of the modification (era 1 [2002-2008] with CrRT and era 2 [2009-2012] with delayed first TIT and no CrRT). RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in major outcomes between the 903 patients treated in era 1 and the 444 patients treated in era 2: the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rates were 75.7% +/- 1.4% and 72.1% +/- 2.4%, respectively (P = .260), and the cumulative risks of isolated CNS relapse were 4.0% +/- 0.7% and 4.1% +/- 1.0%, respectively (P = .960). There were also no differences between non-CNS-1 patients treated in era 1 (n = 76) and era 2 (n =28): the 5-year EFS rates were 52.3% +/- 5.8% and 62.9% +/- 9.4%, respectively (P = .199), and the cumulative risks of isolated CNS relapse were 6.3% +/- 3.1% and 3.6% +/- 3.5%, respectively (P = .639). Notably, TLP with blasts was completely eliminated after the first TIT was delayed in era 2. CONCLUSIONS: The delay of the first TIT until the clearance of circulating blasts and the total omission of CrRT did not compromise survival or CNS control in patients with childhood ALL, including those with a non-CNS-1 status.","['Yeh, Ting-Chi', 'Liang, Der-Cherng', 'Hou, Jen-Yin', 'Jaing, Tang-Her', 'Lin, Dong-Tsamn', 'Yang, Chao-Ping', 'Peng, Ching-Tien', 'Hung, Iou-Jih', 'Lin, Kai-Hsin',

Aims: To determine the prevalence of BRAFV600E in HCL from our center and derive clinicopathological correlation, if any. Materials and Methods: A 9-year retrospective analysis of 46 consecutive cases of HCL diagnosed on morphology and immunophenotyping was done. Stained smears were used as samples for amplification refractory mutation system polymerase-chain reaction using fluorescent primers for mutation detection. Results: BRAFV600E mutation was detected in 41/46 patients (89.1%) while absent in control samples of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Cases mimicking HCL-variant clinically or immunophenotypically too showed the presence of this mutation. HCL with mutated BRAF presented at a younger age. No statistical difference in blood counts, tumor load, and immunophenotype patterns existed among BRAF mutated and unmutated group. Nine patients (45%) with mutated BRAF had residual disease following treatment with cladribine.

Inhibiting FBXW7 enhances the malignant potential of several cancers. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of FBXW7 in cholangiocarcinoma. We found that FBXW7 expression was associated with clinicopathological outcomes in cholangiocarcinoma patients. Both disease-free and overall survival were significantly worse in the low-FBXW7 group than in the high-FBXW7 group (P = .001 and P < .001, respectively). Multivariate analysis with the Cox proportional hazards model indicated that FBXW7 was the most important independent prognostic factor for disease-free (P = .006) and overall (P = .0004) survival. We also showed that the two FBXW7 substrates, NOTCH1 and myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL1), regulate cholangiocarcinoma progression. Depletion of FBXW7 resulted in NOTCH1 accumulation and increased cholangiocarcinoma cell migration and self-renewal. Interestingly, when cells were stimulated with cis-diamminedichloridoplatinum(II) (cisplatin), FBXW7 suppression induced MCL1 upregulation, which reduced the sensitivity of cholangiocarcinoma cells to apoptosis, indicating that FBXW7-mediated ubiquitylation is context-dependent. These results indicate that FBXW7 modulates the malignant potential of cholangiocarcinoma through independent regulation of NOTCH1 and MCL1.","['Mori, Akiko', 'Masuda, Kunihiro', 'Ohtsuka, Hideo', 'Shijo, Masahiro', 'Ariake, Kyohei', 'Fukase, Koji', 'Sakata, Naoaki', 'Mizuma, Masamichi', 'Morikawa, Takanori', 'Hayashi, Hiroki', 'Nakagawa, Kei', 'Motoi, Fuyuhiko', 'Naitoh, Takeshi', 'Fujishima, Fumiyoshi', 'Unno, Michiaki']","['Mori A', 'Masuda K', 'Ohtsuka H', 'Shijo M', 'Ariake K', 'Fukase K', 'Sakata N', 'Mizuma M', 'Morikawa T', 'Hayashi H', 'Nakagawa K', 'Motoi F', 'Naitoh T', 'Fujishima F', 'Unno M']","['Department of Surgery, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Tohoku University Hospital, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],"['16K19910/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science', '26861058/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science']",['Journal Article'],20181105,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7)', '0 (FBXW7 protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bile Duct Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cholangiocarcinoma/*metabolism', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'Disease Progression', 'Down-Regulation', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Receptor, Notch1/*metabolism', 'Survival Analysis']",PMC6272118,['NOTNLM'],"['FBXW7 protein', 'NOTCH1 protein', 'cholangiocarcinoma', 'cisplatin', 'myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 protein']",2018/10/12 06:00,2019/01/03 06:00,['2018/10/11 06:00'],"['2018/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/03 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/03 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.13829 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2018 Dec;109(12):3883-3895. doi: 10.1111/cas.13829.

While the role of S1P in regulating migration of hematopoietic cells is well established, in this work we compared its biological effects to the effects of C1P, LPC, and LPA. We employed 10 human myeloid and lymphoid cell lines as well as blasts from AML patients. We observed that human leukemic cells express functional receptors for phospholipids and respond to stimulation by phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK and AKT. We also found that bioactive phospholipids enhanced cell migration and adhesion of leukemic cells by downregulating expression of HO-1 and iNOS in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner but did not affect cell proliferation. By contrast, downregulation of p38 MAPK by SB203580 enhanced expression of HO-1 and iNOS and decreased migration of leukemic cells in vitro and their seeding efficiency to vital organs in vivo after injection into immunodeficient mice. Based on these findings, we demonstrate that, besides S1P, human leukemic cells also respond to C1P, LPC, and LPA. Since the prometastatic effects of bioactive phospholipids in vivo were mediated, at least in part, by downregulating HO-1 and iNOS expression in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner, we propose that inhibitors of p38 MAPK or stimulators of HO-1 activity will find application in inhibiting the spread of leukemic cells in response to bioactive phospholipids.","['Abdelbaset-Ismail, Ahmed', 'Cymer, Monika', 'Borkowska-Rzeszotek, Sylwia', 'Brzezniakiewicz-Janus, Katarzyna', 'Rameshwar, Pranela', 'Kakar, Sham S', 'Ratajczak, Janina', 'Ratajczak, Mariusz Z']","['Abdelbaset-Ismail A', 'Cymer M', 'Borkowska-Rzeszotek S', 'Brzezniakiewicz-Janus K', 'Rameshwar P', 'Kakar SS', 'Ratajczak J', 'Ratajczak MZ']","['Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, 500 S.

The goals of the present study are to define the transcriptomic response of mouse spleen B cells (mSBC) to IL-4 used as single stimulus, its specificity compared to human peripheral blood B cells (hPBBC) and to mouse spleen T cells (mSTC), and the pathways affected. Oligonucleotide-based microarrays were performed using two references, the untreated sample and the cells cultured without IL-4, an experimental design which reduces the potential confounding effect of cellular stress during culture. Specificity was addressed by comparing the response of mSBC and our previously published study on hPBBC, of similar design, and a study by other authors on mSTC. We detected an mSBC-specific response (including novel genes, e.g., Sertad4, Lifr, Pmepa1, Epcam, Tbxas1; and common genes, e.g., Usp2, Cst7, Grtp1, and Casp6), an hPBBC-specific response (e.g., CCL17, MTCL1, GCSAM, HOMER2, IL2RA), and a common mSBC/hPBBC response (e.g., CISH, NFIL3, SOCS1, VDR, CDH1). In contrast, the mSBC and mSTC responses were largely divergent. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was applied for the first time to identify the pathways affected. Both in mSBC and hPBBC, IL-4 activated Myc, the transcriptional machinery itself, cell cycle, mitochondria and respiratory chain, ribosome, proteasome and antigen presentation, and Wnt signaling, and inhibited GPCR signaling. However, significant differences were found in histone demethylation, Nod signaling, and Rho signaling, which were downregulated in mSBC, and in chromatin condensation, which was downregulated in hPBBC. These findings may have therapeutic implications for the treatment of allergic diseases and parasitic infections.","['Ruiz-Lafuente, Natalia', 'Muro, Manuel', 'Minguela, Alfredo', 'Parrado, Antonio']","['Ruiz-Lafuente N', 'Muro M', 'Minguela A', 'Parrado A']","['Servicio de Inmunologia, Hospital Clinico Universitario Virgen de la Arrixaca, Instituto Murciano de Investigacion Biosanitaria (IMIB-Arrixaca), El Palmar, 30120 Murcia, Spain.', 'Servicio de Inmunologia, Hospital Clinico Universitario Virgen de la Arrixaca, Instituto Murciano de Investigacion Biosanitaria (IMIB-Arrixaca), El Palmar, 30120 Murcia, Spain.', 'Servicio de Inmunologia, Hospital Clinico Universitario Virgen de la Arrixaca, Instituto Murciano de Investigacion Biosanitaria (IMIB-Arrixaca), El Palmar, 30120 Murcia, Spain.', 'Servicio de Inmunologia, Hospital Clinico Universitario Virgen de la Arrixaca, Instituto Murciano de Investigacion Biosanitaria (IMIB-Arrixaca), El Palmar, 30120 Murcia, Spain.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181006,Netherlands,Biochem Biophys Rep,Biochemistry and biophysics reports,101660999,,,,PMC6174832,['NOTNLM'],"['ANOVA, analysis of variance', 'Acc.

The objective of present investigation is to screen various extracts of the rhizomes of Tectaria cicutaria for anti-cancer activity and to investigate the mechanism involved. Materials and methods: The rhizomes of Tectaria cicutaria were extracted with different solvents. In vitro anti-cancer activity of different rhizome extracts were studied in Human cancer Cell Lines using Sulphorodamine B (SRB) colorimetric cytotoxicity assay. The effect of ethanolic extract (TCe) on cell growth inhibition, modulation in gene expression, and induction of apoptosis using the K562 human leukemia cell line were studied. The extract was analyzed by GC-MS to identify their major chemical compounds. Results: TCe shows antioxidant potential in both DPPH scavenging assay and reducing capacity. Flow cytometric analysis showed that 11 mug/ml of TCe arrested cell cycle progression at the G0/G1 phase. In the TCe treated K562 cells, the mRNA and protein expression level of p53 was strongly up-regulated in reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, its downstream target p21 level was also increased. The GC-MS study has depicted results with the presence of twelve different compounds which will require significant further efforts for structure and putative identification. Conclusion: The present work has for the first time, tried to elucidate the anti leukemic potential of Tectaria cicutaria. TCe was more potent in K562 cells, altering the cell cycle progression and inducing apoptosis.","['Karade, Preeti Gajendra', 'Jadhav, Namdeo Ramhari']","['Karade PG', 'Jadhav NR']","['Department of Pharmaceutics, Appasaheb Birnale College of Pharmacy, Sangli 416416, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Pharmacy, Kolhapur 416013, Maharashtra, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20170726,Netherlands,J Tradit Complement Med,Journal of traditional and complementary medicine,101605474,,,,PMC6174258,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Cell cycle analysis', 'GC-MS', 'Tectaria cicutaria', 'p53']",2017/07/26 00:00,2017/07/26 00:01,['2018/10/11 06:00'],"['2017/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/28 00:00 [revised]', '2017/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/07/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/26 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.jtcme.2017.07.003 [doi]', 'S2225-4110(17)30090-1 [pii]']",epublish,J Tradit Complement Med. 2017 Jul 26;8(4):459-464. doi: 10.1016/j.jtcme.2017.07.003. eCollection 2018 Oct.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Older patients often have multiple comorbidities and poor performance status, and disease factors associated with poor prognosis are more common in this age group. Patient and disease-related factors should be taken into account to determine whether intensive therapy is appropriate. The use of comorbidity indices and comprehensive geriatric assessment tools can be valuable in this setting. Fit patients should be considered for aggressive therapies including allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, whereas low intensity options may be more suitable for the frail. The Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome is present in up to half of the cases of ALL in older patients. The incorporation of TK inhibitors into the treatment plans of older patients with Ph-positive ALL has improved the outcomes significantly. For less fit patients with Ph-positive ALL, the use of TK inhibitors with reduced-intensity chemotherapy or steroids alone results in high rates of remission, but, without further consolidation, relapses are inevitable. Many novel targeted and immunotherapeutic agents are being developed, offering more effective and tolerable treatment options.","['Sawalha, Yazeed', 'Advani, Anjali S']","['Sawalha Y', 'Advani AS']","['Department of Medical Oncology & Hematology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology & Hematology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180410,England,Int J Hematol Oncol,International journal of hematologic oncology,101600758,,,,PMC6176956,['NOTNLM'],"['Philadelphia chromosome', 'TK inhibitors', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'blinatumomab', 'elderly', 'inotuzumab']",2018/10/12 06:00,2018/10/12 06:01,['2018/10/11 06:00'],"['2017/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.2217/ijh-2017-0023 [doi]'],epublish,Int J Hematol Oncol. 2018 Apr 10;7(1):IJH02. doi: 10.2217/ijh-2017-0023. eCollection 2018 Mar.,,"['Financial & competing interests disclosure Yazeed Sawalha declares no financial', 'or competing interests.

The thorough understanding of the molecular basis of AML is paving the way for better therapeutic approaches.

Arsenic trioxide has been recently demonstrated to be the most effective single antileukemic agent and it has also showed synergistic action when combined with all-trans retinoic acid, decreasing relapse rate especially in low/intermediate-risk settings. Therapeutic advances led to complete remission rates of more than 90%, modifying disease history. In relapse setting, arsenic trioxide-based regimens showed efficacy for the achievement of second molecular complete remission. The most challenging issue in APL management remains the significant early deaths rate, nowadays the principal reason for treatment failure.","['Massaro, Fulvio', 'Molica, Matteo', 'Breccia, Massimo']","['Massaro F', 'Molica M', 'Breccia M']","['Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies & Hematology, Sapienza University, Via Benevento 6, 00161 Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies & Hematology, Sapienza University, Via Benevento 6, 00161 Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies & Hematology, Sapienza University, Via Benevento 6, 00161 Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170202,England,Int J Hematol Oncol,International journal of hematologic oncology,101600758,,,,PMC6171971,['NOTNLM'],"['APL', 'ATO', 'ATRA', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia']",2016/11/01 00:00,2016/11/01 00:01,['2018/10/11 06:00'],"['2016/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.2217/ijh-2016-0010 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol Oncol. 2016 Nov;5(3):105-118. doi: 10.2217/ijh-2016-0010.

TKIs are now integral components of therapy for Ph(+) ALL. The current consensus is that they improve patient outcomes compared with historical control patients treated with chemotherapy alone, and increase the number of patients able to receive stem cell transplant. New challenges have emerged with respect to induction of resistance mainly via Abelson tyrosine kinase mutations. Several novel kinase inhibitors with significantly more potent antileukemic activity are currently being developed. Furthermore novel immune therapies, which recruit or modify patient's own T cells to fight leukemic cells, are being developed and could find an important place in Ph(+) ALL therapy by few years. In this article, we reviewed treatment approaches in adults with Ph(+) ALL with a focus on TKIs and combined chemotherapy regimens.","['Thomas, Xavier', 'Heiblig, Mael']","['Thomas X', 'Heiblig M']","['Hematology Department, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre Benite, France.', 'Hematology Department, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre Benite, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160923,England,Int J Hematol Oncol,International journal of hematologic oncology,101600758,,,,PMC6171979,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL', 'Philadelphia chromosome', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'allogeneic stem cell transplantation', 'treatment', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2016/09/01 00:00,2016/09/01 00:01,['2018/10/11 06:00'],"['2016/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.2217/ijh-2016-0009 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol Oncol. 2016 Sep;5(2):77-90. doi: 10.2217/ijh-2016-0009.

By dissecting how different malignancies signal through BCR, researchers are contributing to the design of more customized therapeutics which have greater efficacy and lower toxicity than previous therapies.

The complexity of isolating DNA from plasma inhibits the development of point-of-care diagnostics. Here, we introduce an electrokinetic method that enables rapid recovery of DNA from plasma. Materials & methods: ccf-DNA was isolated from 25 microl of CLL plasma using dielectrophoresis. The DNA was used for PCR amplification, sequencing and analysis. Results: The ccf-DNA collected from plasma of 5 CLL patients revealed identical mutations to those previously identified by extracting DNA from CLL cells from the same patients. Conclusion: Rapid dielectrophoresis isolation of ccf-DNA directly from plasma provides sufficient amounts of DNA to use for identification of point mutations in genes associated with CLL progression.","['Manouchehri, Sareh', 'Ibsen, Stuart', 'Wright, Jennifer', 'Rassenti, Laura', 'Ghia, Emanuela M', 'Widhopf, George F 2nd', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Heller, Michael J']","['Manouchehri S', 'Ibsen S', 'Wright J', 'Rassenti L', 'Ghia EM', 'Widhopf GF 2nd', 'Kipps TJ', 'Heller MJ']","['Department of Bioengineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Department of Bioengineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Department of Bioengineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Department of Bioengineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Department of Bioengineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Department of Bioengineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Department of Nanoengineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Department of Nanoengineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Department of Nanoengineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Department of Nanoengineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Department of Nanoengineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Department of Nanoengineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Department of Nanoengineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Department of Nanoengineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Department of Bioengineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.', 'Department of Bioengineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.']",['eng'],"['R43 CA183414/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA119335/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20160505,England,Int J Hematol Oncol,International journal of hematologic oncology,101600758,,,,PMC6171991,['NOTNLM'],"['biomarkers', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'circulating cell free DNA', 'dielectrophoresis', 'electrokinetic', 'genetics', 'point mutations']",2016/05/01 00:00,2016/05/01 00:01,['2018/10/11 06:00'],"['2015/11/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.2217/ijh-2015-0009 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol Oncol. 2016 May;5(1):27-35. doi: 10.2217/ijh-2015-0009.

However, the RTK-dependent signaling state and its interpretation with regard to biological behavior are often elusive. To decipher signaling circuits that link RTK activity with biological output in vivo, we established patient-derived xenograft ALL (PDX-ALL) models with dependencies on fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRB), which were interrogated by phosphoproteomics using iTRAQ mass spectrometry. Signaling circuits were determined by receptor type and cellular context with few generic features, among which we identified group I p21-activated kinases (PAKs) as potential therapeutic targets. Growth factor stimulation markedly increased catalytic activities of PAK1 and PAK2. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated or pharmacological inhibition of PAKs using allosteric or adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-competitive compounds attenuated cell growth and increased apoptosis in vitro. Notably, PAK1- or PAK2-directed RNAi enhanced the antiproliferative effects of the type III RTK and protein kinase C inhibitor midostaurin. Treatment of FLT3- or PDGFRB-dependent ALLs with ATP-competitive PAK inhibitors markedly decreased catalytic activities of both PAK isoforms. In FLT3-driven ALL, this effect was augmented by coadministration of midostaurin resulting in synergistic effects on growth inhibition and apoptosis. Finally, combined treatment of FLT3 (D835H) PDX-ALL with the ATP-competitive group I PAK inhibitor FRAX486 and midostaurin in vivo significantly prolonged leukemia progression-free survival compared with midostaurin monotherapy or control. Our study establishes PAKs as potential downstream targets in RTK-dependent ALL of childhood, the inhibition of which might help prevent the selection or acquisition of resistance mutations toward tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","['Siekmann, Ina-Katrin', 'Dierck, Kevin', 'Prall, Sebastian', 'Klokow, Marianne', 'Strauss, Julia', 'Buhs, Sophia', 'Wrzeszcz, Antonina', 'Bockmayr, Michael', 'Beck, Florian', 'Trochimiuk, Magdalena', 'Gottschling, Kristina', 'Martens, Victoria', 'Khosh-Naucke, Melissa', 'Gerull, Helwe', 'Muller, Jurgen', 'Behrmann, Lena', 'Blohm, Martin', 'Zahedi, Rene P', 'Jeremias, Irmela', 'Sickmann, Albert', 'Nollau, Peter', 'Horstmann, Martin A']","['Siekmann IK', 'Dierck K', 'Prall S', 'Klokow M', 'Strauss J', 'Buhs S', 'Wrzeszcz A', 'Bockmayr M', 'Beck F', 'Trochimiuk M', 'Gottschling K', 'Martens V', 'Khosh-Naucke M', 'Gerull H', 'Muller J', 'Behrmann L', 'Blohm M', 'Zahedi RP', 'Jeremias I', 'Sickmann A', 'Nollau P', 'Horstmann MA']","[""Research Institute Children's Cancer Center Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center, Hamburg, Germany.', ""Research Institute Children's Cancer Center Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center, Hamburg, Germany.', ""Research Institute Children's Cancer Center Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center, Hamburg, Germany.', ""Research Institute Children's Cancer Center Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center, Hamburg, Germany.', ""Research Institute Children's Cancer Center Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center, Hamburg, Germany.', ""Research Institute Children's Cancer Center Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center, Hamburg, Germany.', ""Research Institute Children's Cancer Center Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center, Hamburg, Germany.', ""Research Institute Children's Cancer Center Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Leibniz-Institut fur Analytische Wissenschaften (ISAS), Dortmund, Germany.', ""Research Institute Children's Cancer Center Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center, Hamburg, Germany.', ""Research Institute Children's Cancer Center Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center, Hamburg, Germany.', ""Research Institute Children's Cancer Center Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center, Hamburg, Germany.', ""Research Institute Children's Cancer Center Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center, Hamburg, Germany.', ""Research Institute Children's Cancer Center Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center, Hamburg, Germany.', ""Research Institute Children's Cancer Center Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center, Hamburg, Germany.', ""Research Institute Children's Cancer Center Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Medical Center, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Leibniz-Institut fur Analytische Wissenschaften (ISAS), Dortmund, Germany.', 'Gerald Bronfman Department of Oncology and.', 'Segal Cancer Proteomics Centre, Lady Davis Institute, Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Helmholtz Center, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Munich, Germany.', 'Leibniz-Institut fur Analytische Wissenschaften (ISAS), Dortmund, Germany.', 'Medizinische Fakultat, Medizinisches Proteom Center, Ruhr-Universitat Bochum, Bochum, Germany;

Heterozygous GATA2 mutations cause immunodeficiency, myelodysplastic syndrome, and acute myeloid leukemia. GATA2 disease mutations commonly disrupt amino acid residues that mediate DNA binding or cis-elements within a vital GATA2 intronic enhancer, suggesting a haploinsufficiency mechanism of pathogenesis. Mutations also occur in GATA2 coding regions distinct from the DNA-binding carboxyl-terminal zinc finger (C-finger), including the amino-terminal zinc finger (N-finger), and N-finger function is not established. Whether distinct mutations differentially impact GATA-2 mechanisms is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that N-finger mutations decreased GATA-2 chromatin occupancy and attenuated target gene regulation. We developed a genetic complementation assay to quantify GATA-2 function in myeloid progenitor cells from Gata2 -77 enhancer-mutant mice. GATA-2 complementation increased erythroid and myeloid differentiation. While GATA-2 disease mutants were not competent to induce erythroid differentiation of Lin(-)Kit(+) myeloid progenitors, unexpectedly, they promoted myeloid differentiation and proliferation. As the myelopoiesis-promoting activity of GATA-2 mutants exceeded that of GATA-2, GATA2 disease mutations are not strictly inhibitory. Thus, we propose that the haploinsufficiency paradigm does not fully explain GATA-2-linked pathogenesis, and an amalgamation of qualitative and quantitative defects instigated by GATA2 mutations underlies the complex phenotypes of GATA-2-dependent pathologies.","['Katsumura, Koichi R', 'Mehta, Charu', 'Hewitt, Kyle J', 'Soukup, Alexandra A', 'Fraga de Andrade, Isabela', 'Ranheim, Erik A', 'Johnson, Kirby D', 'Bresnick, Emery H']","['Katsumura KR', 'Mehta C', 'Hewitt KJ', 'Soukup AA', 'Fraga de Andrade I', 'Ranheim EA', 'Johnson KD', 'Bresnick EH']","['University of Wisconsin-Madison Blood Research Program, Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI 53705.', 'University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI 53705.', 'University of Wisconsin-Madison Blood Research Program, Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI 53705.', 'University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI 53705.', 'University of Wisconsin-Madison Blood Research Program, Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI 53705.', 'University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI 53705.', 'University of Wisconsin-Madison Blood Research Program, Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI 53705.', 'University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI 53705.', 'University of Wisconsin-Madison Blood Research Program, Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI 53705.', 'University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI 53705.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI 53705.', 'University of Wisconsin-Madison Blood Research Program, Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI 53705.', 'University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI 53705.', 'University of Wisconsin-Madison Blood Research Program, Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI 53705; ehbresni@wisc.edu.', 'University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI 53705.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20181009,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,['0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics', 'Haploinsufficiency/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid/genetics', 'Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics']",PMC6205465,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*GATA-2', '*MDS', '*hematopoiesis', '*leukemia']",2018/10/12 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/10/11 06:00'],"['2018/10/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['1813015115 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1813015115 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2018 Oct 23;115(43):E10109-E10118. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1813015115.

However, these inhibitors have been less effective as single agents in the blast phase-CML. In this work, we show that anisomycin, a clinically available drug, targets CML cells at all stages of development and enhances BCR-ABL TKIs' efficacy. Anisomycin at nanomolar concentration inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in a panel of CML cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. It induces apoptosis CD34 stem/progenitor cells isolated from patients with blast phase CML. Using colony formation and serial replating assays, we further show that anisomycin inhibits CML CD34 cell differentiation, proliferation and self-renewal. Additionally, anisomycin is less effective in normal bone marrow (NBM) CD34 cells, suggesting the selective anti-leukemia activity of anisomycin. Combination of anisomycin with imatinib or dasatinib achieves significantly better efficacy than TKI alone in leukemia cell lines and patient samples while sparing normal counterparts. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that p38 MAPK/JNK activation is not required for anti-leukemia activities of anisomycin. Instead, anisomycin displays preferential inhibitory effects to Wnt/beta-catenin-mediated signaling in CML. Our work provides the preclinical evidence on the potent efficacy of anisomycin in leukemia and its mechanisms of action.

We found that AML20-29 were more similar to MDS-EB2 in terms of advanced age, less blood count, the increased presence of poor-risk cytogenetics. The frequency of mutated genes in AML20-29 had both the characters of AML and MDS. Median overall survival of AML20-29 and MDS-EB2 were similar and shorter than those of AML >/= 30 (p = .045).

The ability of OX40 to promote proliferation and differentiation of activated T cells fueled present attempts to modulate this immune checkpoint to reinforce antitumor immunity. While we recently found evidence for the involvement of OX40 in pathophysiology of acute myeloid leukemia including natural killer (NK) cell immunosurveillance, less is known on its role in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In the present study, OX40 expression on ALL cells was significantly associated with positivity for the adverse risk factor BCR-ABL. In line, signaling via OX40 increased metabolic activity of primary ALL cells and resulted in release of cytokines involved in disease pathophysiology. Furthermore, interaction of ALL-expressed OX40 with its cognate ligand on NK cells stimulated ALL cell lysis. The data presented thus not only identify the yet unknown involvement of OX40/OX40L in ALL pathophysiology and NK cell immunosurveillance but also point to the necessity to thoroughly consider the consequences of modulating the OX40/OX40L molecule system beyond its effects on T cells when developing OX40-targeting approaches for cancer immunotherapy.","['Rothfelder, Kathrin', 'Hagelstein, Ilona', 'Roerden, Malte', 'Blumenstock, Gunnar', 'Hofmann, Martin', 'Nuebling, Tina', 'Jung, Gundram', 'Salih, Helmut Rainer', 'Dorfel, Daniela']","['Rothfelder K', 'Hagelstein I', 'Roerden M', 'Blumenstock G', 'Hofmann M', 'Nuebling T', 'Jung G', 'Salih HR', 'Dorfel D']","['Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Partner site Tubingen, Germany.', 'Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Partner site Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Hematology, Immunology, Rheumatology and Pulmonology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Institute for Clinical Epidemiology and Applied Biometry, Eberhard Karls University, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Immunology, Eberhard Karls University, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Partner site Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Immunology, Eberhard Karls University, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Partner site Tubingen, Germany; Department of Medical Oncology, Hematology, Immunology, Rheumatology and Pulmonology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Partner site Tubingen, Germany; Department of Medical Oncology, Hematology, Immunology, Rheumatology and Pulmonology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.

Although GO and subsequently developed ADCs depend on lysosomes for activation, lysosome number and activity in tumor cells has not been well elucidated. In this study, we investigated whether an mTORC1/2 kinase inhibitor, PP242, which was reported to activate lysosomal function, potentiates the cytotoxicity of GO in AML cells. Eight AML cell lines (U937, THP-1, SKM-1, SKK-1, SKNO-1, HL-60, MARIMO and KO52) were treated with GO and PP242. The cytotoxic effect of GO was enhanced by concurrent treatment with a non-cytotoxic concentration (500 nM) of PP242 in most cell lines, except MARIMO and KO52 cells. We then used LysoTracker to label acidic lysosomes in U937, THP-1, SKM-1, MARIMO and KO52 cells. LysoTracker fluorescence was dramatically increased by treatment with PP242 in U937, THP-1 and SKM-1 cells, and the intensified fluorescence was retained with PP242 + GO. In contrast, PP242 did not induce a significant increase in fluorescence in MARIMO cells, consistent with the lack of combinatory cytotoxicity. LysoTracker fluorescence was also increased by PP242 in KO52 cells, which have been reported to strongly express multidrug resistance (MDR). Further, PP242 suppressed GO-induced Chk1 activation and G2/M cell cycle arrest, which in turn triggered cell cycle promotion and cell death. These results indicate that inhibition of mTORC1/2 kinase by PP242 enhanced the cytotoxicity of GO by increasing lysosomal compartments and promoting the cell cycle via suppression of GO-induced Chk1 activation. This combination may represent an attractive new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of leukemia.","['Maimaitili, Yimamu', 'Inase, Aki', 'Miyata, Yoshiharu', 'Kitao, Akihito', 'Mizutani, Yu', 'Kakiuchi, Seiji', 'Shimono, Yohei', 'Saito, Yasuyuki', 'Sonoki, Takashi', 'Minami, Hironobu', 'Matsuoka, Hiroshi']","['Maimaitili Y', 'Inase A', 'Miyata Y', 'Kitao A', 'Mizutani Y', 'Kakiuchi S', 'Shimono Y', 'Saito Y', 'Sonoki T', 'Minami H', 'Matsuoka H']","['Division of Medical Oncology/Hematology, Department of Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology/Hematology, Department of Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology/Hematology, Department of Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology/Hematology, Department of Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology/Hematology, Department of Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology/Hematology, Department of Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology/Hematology, Department of Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan; Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular and Cellular Signaling, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Wakayama Medical University, Wakayama, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology/Hematology, Department of Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology/Hematology, Department of Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.

Treatment with 10 muM I-BET151 significantly induced growth inhibition, apoptosis, and cell cycle modulation, including increases in sub-G1 and G1 phases and decreases in S and G2/M phases, in U937 cells. However, no significant changes in these factors were detected in I-BET151-resistant U937 (U937R) cells. Combined treatment with I-BET151 and IKK inhibitor VII synergistically induced apoptosis in U937 and U937R cells. Increased expression of bromodomain-containing protein (BRD) 2, BRD4, and nuclear NF-kappaBp65 proteins was detected in U937R cells. IKK inhibitor VII inhibited the activation of NF-kappaBp65 protein in the nuclear fraction of U937R cells. These findings suggest that resistance to I-BET151 in U937R cells is related to constitutive activation of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway via increased expression of both BRD2 and BRD4. Targeting the NF-kappaB signaling pathway may be an effective therapeutic strategy to enhance or restore the sensitivity to I-BET151 in U937 cells.","['Hishiki, Kotaro', 'Akiyama, Masaharu', 'Kanegae, Yumi', 'Ozaki, Koji', 'Ohta, Miyuki', 'Tsuchitani, Emi', 'Kaito, Ken', 'Yamada, Hisashi']","['Hishiki K', 'Akiyama M', 'Kanegae Y', 'Ozaki K', 'Ohta M', 'Tsuchitani E', 'Kaito K', 'Yamada H']","['Division of Molecular Genetics, Research Center for Medical Science, The Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan; Central Clinical Laboratory, The Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Genetics, Research Center for Medical Science, The Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Pediatrics, The Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.

We used epigenomic profiling data for an RNAi screen to interrogate the transcriptional network maintaining t(8;21) AML. This strategy identified Cyclin D2 (CCND2) as a crucial transmitter of RUNX1/ETO-driven leukemic propagation. RUNX1/ETO cooperates with AP-1 to drive CCND2 expression. Knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of CCND2 by an approved drug significantly impairs leukemic expansion of patient-derived AML cells and engraftment in immunodeficient murine hosts. Our data demonstrate that RUNX1/ETO maintains leukemia by promoting cell cycle progression and identifies G1 CCND-CDK complexes as promising therapeutic targets for treatment of RUNX1/ETO-driven AML.","['Martinez-Soria, Natalia', 'McKenzie, Lynsey', 'Draper, Julia', 'Ptasinska, Anetta', 'Issa, Hasan', 'Potluri, Sandeep', 'Blair, Helen J', 'Pickin, Anna', 'Isa, Asmida', 'Chin, Paulynn Suyin',

We tested whether CAR19-engineering of the CD1d-restricted invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells would result in enhanced anti-lymphoma activity. CAR19-iNKT cells co-operatively activated by CD1d- and CAR19-CD19-dependent interactions are more effective than CAR19-T cells against CD1d-expressing lymphomas in vitro and in vivo. The swifter in vivo anti-lymphoma activity of CAR19-iNKT cells and their enhanced ability to eradicate brain lymphomas underpinned an improved tumor-free and overall survival. CD1D transcriptional de-repression by all-trans retinoic acid results in further enhanced cytotoxicity of CAR19-iNKT cells against CD19(+) chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. Thus, iNKT cells are a highly efficient platform for CAR-based immunotherapy of lymphomas and possibly other CD1d-expressing cancers.","['Rotolo, Antonia', 'Caputo, Valentina S', 'Holubova, Monika', 'Baxan, Nicoleta', 'Dubois, Olivier', 'Chaudhry, Mohammed Suhail', 'Xiao, Xiaolin', 'Goudevenou, Katerina', 'Pitcher, David S', 'Petevi, Kyriaki', 'Kachramanoglou, Carolina', 'Iles, Sandra', 'Naresh, Kikkeri', 'Maher, John', 'Karadimitris, Anastasios']","['Rotolo A', 'Caputo VS', 'Holubova M', 'Baxan N', 'Dubois O', 'Chaudhry MS', 'Xiao X', 'Goudevenou K', 'Pitcher DS', 'Petevi K', 'Kachramanoglou C', 'Iles S', 'Naresh K', 'Maher J', 'Karadimitris A']","['Centre for Haematology, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Centre for Haematology, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Centre for Haematology, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK; Biomedical Center, Medical Faculty in Pilsen, Charles University, Alej Svobody 76, Pilsen 323 00, Czech Republic.', 'Biological Imaging Centre, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Biological Imaging Centre, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Centre for Haematology, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Centre for Haematology, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Centre for Haematology, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Centre for Haematology, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Centre for Haematology, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Department of Neuroradiology, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK.', 'Cellular Pathology, Hammersmith Hospital, Northwest London Pathology, London, UK.', 'Centre for Haematology, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.', ""King's College London, School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guy's Hospital, London, UK."", 'Centre for Haematology, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.

It is associated with various disorders of different organ systems. Serious disorders include cardiac defects and leukemia. With an onset during the newborn period, the latter does not always progress to classic myeloid leukemia (transient myeloproliferative disorder). Skin manifestations in newborns include pustules/vesiculopustules. In individuals with DS, such lesions should not only prompt suspicion for typical neonatal rashes and infections but also for transient myeloproliferative disorder. However, most dermatoses are benign. They essentially comprise disorders of keratinization that present as xerosis, keratosis pilaris, lichenification, and ichthyosis vulgaris. Also typical but not specific is the four-finger palmar crease (simian crease). Patients frequently develop folliculitides, which - due to elastolysis - subsequently progress to anetoderma. The known immune disturbance in DS patients explains the occurrence of autoimmune diseases such as alopecia areata and vitiligo. Typical skin conditions associated with DS include elastosis perforans serpiginosa, syringomas, milia-like calcinosis cutis, and multiple eruptive dermatofibromas.","['Folster-Holst, Regina', 'Rohrer, Tilman', 'Jung, Anna-Maria']","['Folster-Holst R', 'Rohrer T', 'Jung AM']","['Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Allergology, Schleswig-Holstein University Medical Center, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Division of Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetology, Saarland University Medical Center, Homburg, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Division of Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetology, Saarland University Medical Center, Homburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,J Dtsch Dermatol Ges,Journal der Deutschen Dermatologischen Gesellschaft = Journal of the German Society of Dermatology : JDDG,101164708,['Burnett Schwartz Berberian syndrome'],IM,"['Abnormalities, Multiple/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anetoderma/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Autoimmune Diseases/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Comorbidity', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Darier Disease/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Down Syndrome/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Exanthema/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Eyebrows/abnormalities', 'Female', 'Germany', '*Guideline Adherence', 'Humans', 'Ichthyosis/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Ichthyosis Vulgaris/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Lichen Planus/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Skin Diseases/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Skin Diseases, Infectious/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,,,2018/10/10 06:00,2019/10/08 06:00,['2018/10/10 06:00'],"['2018/10/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ddg.13665 [doi]'],ppublish,J Dtsch Dermatol Ges. 2018 Oct;16(10):1289-1295. doi: 10.1111/ddg.13665.,,,"['(c) 2018 The Authors | Journal compilation (c) Blackwell Verlag GmbH, Berlin.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Clinical data of 144 patients was retrospectively reviewed. The patients included 76 males and 68 females, with a median age of 41.5 years and inter-quartile ranging from 25.25 to 53.75 years. Based on cytogenetic prognostic stratification criteria, the patients were divided into good prognosis (GP group, 55 cases), moderate prognosis (MP group, 71 cases) and poor prognosis (PP group, 18 cases). The PP group was further divided into complex karyotype (CK group, 15 cases) and non-complex karyotype (NCK group, 3 cases), or monosomy karyotype (MK group, 9 cases) and non-monosomy karyotype (NMK group, 9 cases). All data was analyzed by Student's test, Chi-square test or rank sum test based on the type of data. RESULTS: Comparing the clinical data between GP, MP and PP group, there were statistically significant differences in the components of the FAB classification and the mutation of NPM1 and CSF1R genes (chi(2)=125.444, 15.538 and 7.049, P<0.05). Compared with the NCK group, the CK group had significantly fewer primitive cells in their bone marrow and fewer platelet in their peripheral blood (t=-3.059 and -2.830, P<0.05). Compared with the NMK group, the MK group had significantly fewer red blood cells and lower hemoglobin in their peripheral blood (t=-3.764 and -3.384, P<0.05). CONCLUSION: For patient with de novo primary AML, those with GP chromosome are more likely to be M2b or M3 with recurrent genetic abnormalities, the MP ones are more likely to be M1, M2a or M5 of AML-NOS based on WHO classification and associate with NPM1 mutations, while the PP ones are more likely to be M2a of AML-NOS based on WHO classification and M5 with recurrent genetic abnormalities and associate with CSF1R mutations. Compared with those with NCK chromosomes, the CK ones have lower proportion of primitive cells in their bone marrow and fewer platelets in peripheral blood. Compared with those with NMK chromosomes, the MK ones have lower red blood cell count and hemoglobin in their peripheral blood.","['Jiao, Yang']",['Jiao Y'],"['Clinical Laboratory, Tumor Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan 450008, China. jiaoyang820903@126.com.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue yi chuan xue za zhi = Zhonghua yixue yichuanxue zazhi = Chinese journal of medical genetics,9425197,"['0 (CSF1R protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monosomy', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,2018/10/10 06:00,2019/03/29 06:00,['2018/10/10 06:00'],"['2018/10/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/29 06:00 [medline]']","['940635152 [pii]', '10.3760/cma.j.issn.1003-9406.2018.05.025 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi. 2018 Oct 10;35(5):727-732. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.1003-9406.2018.05.025.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Case Report: Treatment consisted of neoadjuvant chemotherapy of cisplatin, doxorubicin and high dose methotrexate followed by distal tibial resection and free fibula flap reconstruction and consolidation chemotherapy. Treatment was complicated by a pulmonary exacerbation, where Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PsA) and Staphylococcus aureus were grown on sputum culture which was treated with a 2-week course of intravenous piptazobactam and tobramycin. Mycobacterium intracellulare and Mycobacterium abscessus were also cultured following commencement of chemotherapy and successfully treated with a 6-month course of oral azithromycin, ethambutol, and moxifloxacin along with a 1-month course of inhaled amikacin. Pulmonary function improved during his treatment from baseline FEV1 of 3.8 l (93.9%) to 4.15 l (102.3% predicted) whilst nutritional status remained stable. Discussion: The combination of CF and osteosarcoma is rare with only one previous case reported (1). Our case is instructive as the patient faced the challenge of chronic PsA and the first reported culturing and successful treatment of non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) during chemotherapy. Fatal outcomes have been reported previously for CF patients during immunosuppression (2). In concordance with our findings, a recent report noted an improvement in respiratory function in a child treated for leukemia (3). The anti-inflammatory nature of some chemotherapy agents could be responsible for the observed clinical improvement in CF with low dose methotrexate having been shown to increase FEV1 in adolescents with advanced CF (4). Whilst doxorubicin could improve pulmonary outcomes through increased total cellular CFTR protein expression and CFTR associated chloride secretion (5). It is hypothesized that the improved pulmonary function in patients with CF who require chemotherapy could be due to increased production of Multi-Drug Resistance Proteins (MDR) and Multi-Drug Resistant Associated Proteins (MRP) that may complement the depleted CFTR protein (6). Concluding Remarks: We report the well-tolerated management of osteosarcoma in a patient with CF including the first reported identification and eradication of NTM during chemotherapy. The observed positive pulmonary outcome following chemotherapy highlights several potential cellular mechanisms that deserve to be explored.","['Ruffles, Thomas J C', 'Black, Ryan', 'Nicholls, Wayne', 'Laing, Barbara', 'Isles, Alan']","['Ruffles TJC', 'Black R', 'Nicholls W', 'Laing B', 'Isles A']","['Department of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, South Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', ""Lady Cilento Children's Hospital and the Centre for Children's Health Research, South Brisbane, QLD, Australia."", 'Department of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, South Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', 'Department of Physiotherapy, South Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', ""Oncology Services Group, Lady Cilento Children's Hospital, South Brisbane, QLD, Australia."", 'Wesley Medical Imaging, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', 'Department of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, South Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', ""Lady Cilento Children's Hospital and the Centre for Children's Health Research, South Brisbane, QLD, Australia.""]",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20180921,Switzerland,Front Pediatr,Frontiers in pediatrics,101615492,,,,PMC6161692,['NOTNLM'],"['chemotherapy', 'cystic fibrosis', 'non-tuberculous mycobacteria', 'osteogenic sarcoma', 'tibia']",2018/10/10 06:00,2018/10/10 06:01,['2018/10/10 06:00'],"['2018/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fped.2018.00245 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pediatr. 2018 Sep 21;6:245. doi: 10.3389/fped.2018.00245. eCollection 2018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has been largely attributed to chemotherapy-induced impairment of innate immunity, such as neutropenia(2), whereas systemic effects of tumors on hematopoiesis and adoptive immunity remain incompletely understood. Here we observed anemia associated with severe deficiency of CD8(+) T cell responses against pathogens in treatment-naive mice bearing large tumors. Specifically, we identify CD45(+) erythroid progenitor cells (CD71(+)TER119(+); EPCs) as robust immunosuppressors. CD45(+) EPCs, induced by tumor growth-associated extramedullary hematopoiesis, accumulate in the spleen to become a major population, outnumbering regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). The CD45(+) EPC transcriptome closely resembles that of MDSCs, and, like MDSCs, reactive oxygen species production is a major mechanism underlying CD45(+) EPC-mediated immunosuppression. Similarly, an immunosuppressive CD45(+) EPC population was detected in patients with cancer who have anemia. These findings identify a major population of immunosuppressive cells that likely contributes to the impaired T cell responses commonly observed in patients with advanced cancer.","['Zhao, Lintao',

Here we show that developing resistant phenotypes during tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy depends on m(6)A reduction resulting from FTO overexpression in leukemia cells. This deregulated FTO-m(6)A axis pre-exists in naive cell populations that are genetically homogeneous and is inducible/reversible in response to TKI treatment. Cells with mRNA m(6)A hypomethylation and FTO upregulation demonstrate more TKI tolerance and higher growth rates in mice. Either genetic or pharmacological restoration of m(6)A methylation through FTO deactivation renders resistant cells sensitive to TKIs. Mechanistically, the FTO-dependent m(6)A demethylation enhances mRNA stability of proliferation/survival transcripts bearing m(6)A and subsequently leads to increased protein synthesis. Our findings identify a novel function for the m(6)A methylation in regulating cell fate decision and demonstrate that dynamic m(6)A methylome is an additional epigenetic driver of reversible TKI-tolerance state, providing a mechanistic paradigm for drug resistance in cancer.","['Yan, Fei', 'Al-Kali, Aref', 'Zhang, Zijie', 'Liu, Jun', 'Pang, Jiuxia', 'Zhao, Na', 'He, Chuan', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Liu, Shujun']","['Yan F', 'Al-Kali A', 'Zhang Z', 'Liu J', 'Pang J', 'Zhao N', 'He C', 'Litzow MR', 'Liu S']","['The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, MN, 55912, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Institute for Biophysical Dynamics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60637, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Institute for Biophysical Dynamics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60637, USA.', 'The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, MN, 55912, USA.', 'The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, MN, 55912, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Institute for Biophysical Dynamics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60637, USA. chuanhe@uchicago.edu.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA. litzow.mark@mayo.edu.', 'The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin, MN, 55912, USA. sliu@umn.edu.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA149623/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM071440/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 CA186176/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA155915/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181008,England,Cell Res,Cell research,9425763,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'CLE6G00625 (N-methyladenosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Humans', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC6218444,,,2018/10/10 06:00,2019/10/02 06:00,['2018/10/10 06:00'],"['2018/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/09/13 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/02 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41422-018-0097-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41422-018-0097-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Res. 2018 Nov;28(11):1062-1076. doi: 10.1038/s41422-018-0097-4.

Therapeutic interventions have not been associated with satisfactory outcomes. We showed that the porphyrin metabolic pathway preferentially accumulates the endogenous photosensitive metabolite, protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in ATL, after a short-term culture with 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). PpIX accumulated 10-100-fold more in ATL leukemic cells when compared to healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Patient specimens showed dynamic changes in flow cytometry profiles during the onset and progression of ATL. Furthermore, 98.7% of ATL leukemic cell death in the ATL patient specimens could be induced with 10 min of visible light exposure, while 77.5% of normal PBMCs survived. Metabolomics analyses revealed that a specific stage of the metabolic pathway progressively deteriorated with HTLV-I infection and at the onset of ATL. Therefore, this method will be useful in diagnosing and identifying high-risk HTLV-I carriers with single cell resolutions. Photodynamic therapy in the circulatory system may be a potential treatment due to its highly-specific, non-invasive, safe, simultaneous, and repeatedly-treatable modalities.","['Oka, Takashi', 'Mizuno, Hajime', 'Sakata, Masumi', 'Fujita, Hirofumi', 'Yoshino, Tadashi', 'Yamano, Yoshihisa', 'Utsumi, Kozo', 'Masujima, Tsutomu', 'Utsunomiya, Atae']","['Oka T', 'Mizuno H', 'Sakata M', 'Fujita H', 'Yoshino T', 'Yamano Y', 'Utsumi K', 'Masujima T', 'Utsunomiya A']","['Department of Pathology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University, Okayama, 700-8558, Japan. oka@md.okayama-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Virology, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University, Okayama, 700-8558, Japan. oka@md.okayama-u.ac.jp.', 'Laboratory for Single Cell Mass Spectrometry, RIKEN Quantitative Biology Center (QBiC), Osaka, 565-0874, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Analytical and Bio-Analytical Chemistry, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Shizuoka, Shizuoka, 422-8526, Japan.', 'Laboratory for Single Cell Mass Spectrometry, RIKEN Quantitative Biology Center (QBiC), Osaka, 565-0874, Japan.', 'Department of Cytology and Histology, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University, Okayama, 700-8558, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University, Okayama, 700-8558, Japan.', 'Department of Rare Diseases Research, Institute of Medical Science, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Kawasaki, 216-8512, Japan.', 'Department of Cytology and Histology, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University, Okayama, 700-8558, Japan.', 'Laboratory for Single Cell Mass Spectrometry, RIKEN Quantitative Biology Center (QBiC), Osaka, 565-0874, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Imamura General Hospital, Kagoshima, 890-0064, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181008,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Protoporphyrins)', '88755TAZ87 (Aminolevulinic Acid)', 'C2K325S808 (protoporphyrin IX)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aminolevulinic Acid/therapeutic use', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Metabolomics', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Protoporphyrins/therapeutic use']",PMC6175925,,,2018/10/10 06:00,2019/10/28 06:00,['2018/10/10 06:00'],"['2018/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-018-33175-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-018-33175-7 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2018 Oct 8;8(1):14979. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-33175-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrant activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in T-ALL is responsible for treatment failure and relapse, suggesting that mTOR inhibition may represents a new therapeutic strategy. In this study, we investigated whether the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) inhibitor everolimus could be used as a therapeutic agent against human T-ALL. We showed that rapamycin and its analog RAD001 (everolimus) exerted only mild inhibition on the viability of Jurkat, CEM and Molt-4 cell lines (for everolimus the maximum inhibition was <40% at 100 nM), but greatly enhanced the phosphorylation of eIF4E, a downstream substrate of MAPK-interacting kinase (MNK) that was involved in promoting cell survival. Furthermore, we demonstrated in Jurkat cells that mTOR inhibitor-induced eIF4E phosphorylation was independent of insulin-like growth factor-1/insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor axis, but was secondary to mTOR inhibition. Then we examined the antileukemia effects of CGP57380, a MNK1 inhibitor, and we found that CGP57380 (4-16 muM) dose-dependently suppressed the expression of both phosphor-MNK1 and phosphor-eIF4E, thereby inhibiting downstream targets such as c-Myc and survivin in T-ALL cells. Importantly, CGP57380 produced a synergistic growth inhibitory effect with everolimus in T-ALL cells, and treatment with this targeted therapy overcame everolimus-induced eIF4E phosphorylation. In conclusion, our results suggest that dual-targeting of mTOR and MNK1/eIF4E signaling pathways may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of human T-ALL.","['Huang, Xian-Bo', 'Yang, Chun-Mei', 'Han, Qing-Mei', 'Ye, Xiu-Jin', 'Lei, Wen', 'Qian, Wen-Bin']","['Huang XB', 'Yang CM', 'Han QM', 'Ye XJ', 'Lei W', 'Qian WB']","['Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, China.', 'Malignant Lymphoma Diagnosis and Therapy Center, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, China. yxjsunny@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, China.', 'Malignant Lymphoma Diagnosis and Therapy Center, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, China. qianwb@zju.edu.cn.', 'Malignant Lymphoma Diagnosis and Therapy Center, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, China. qianwb@zju.edu.cn.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, China. qianwb@zju.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181008,United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CGP 57380)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Purines)', '9HW64Q8G6G (Everolimus)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (MKNK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E/*metabolism', 'Everolimus/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Purines/*pharmacology', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology']",PMC6289382,['NOTNLM'],"['CGP57380', 'MNK1', 'T-ALL', 'drug-resistance', 'eIF4E', 'everolimus', 'mTOR']",2018/10/10 06:00,2019/01/05 06:00,['2018/10/10 06:00'],"['2018/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/05 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41401-018-0161-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41401-018-0161-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2018 Dec;39(12):1894-1901. doi: 10.1038/s41401-018-0161-0.

HSCs reside at the interface of the bone and bone marrow (BM), where active bone remodeling takes place. Although the cellular components of the BM niche have been characterized, little is known about its epigenetic regulation. Here we find that the histone methylation regulator PTIP (Pax interaction with transcription-activation domain protein-1) is required to maintain the integrity of the BM niche by promoting osteoclast differentiation. PTIP directly promotes chromatin changes required for the expression of Ppargamma (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma), a transcription factor essential for osteoclastogenesis. PTIP deletion leads to a drastic reduction of HSCs in the BM and induces extramedullary hematopoiesis. Furthermore, exposure of acute myeloid leukemia cells to a PTIP-deficient BM microenvironment leads to a reduction in leukemia-initiating cells and increased survival upon transplantation. Taken together, our data identify PTIP as an epigenetic regulator of osteoclastogenesis that is required for the integrity of the BM niche to sustain both normal hematopoiesis and leukemia.","['Das, Prosun', 'Veazey, Kylee J', 'Van, Hieu T', 'Kaushik, Saakshi', 'Lin, Kevin', 'Lu, Yue', 'Ishii, Masaru', 'Kikuta, Junichi', 'Ge, Kai', 'Nussenzweig, Andre', 'Santos, Margarida A']","['Das P', 'Veazey KJ', 'Van HT', 'Kaushik S', 'Lin K', 'Lu Y', 'Ishii M', 'Kikuta J', 'Ge K', 'Nussenzweig A', 'Santos MA']","['Department of Epigenetics and Molecular Carcinogenesis, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Epigenetics and Molecular Carcinogenesis, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Epigenetics and Molecular Carcinogenesis, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Epigenetics and Molecular Carcinogenesis, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Epigenetics and Molecular Carcinogenesis, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Center for Cancer Epigenetics, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Epigenetics and Molecular Carcinogenesis, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Center for Cancer Epigenetics, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.', 'Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine and Frontier Biosciences, Osaka University, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine and Frontier Biosciences, Osaka University, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Endocrinology and Receptor Biology, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Laboratory of Genome Integrity, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Department of Epigenetics and Molecular Carcinogenesis, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030; mialmeidasantos@mdanderson.org.', 'Center for Cancer Epigenetics, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181008,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PPAR gamma)', '0 (Paxip1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Bone and Bones/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Osteoclasts/metabolism', 'Osteogenesis/physiology', 'PPAR gamma/metabolism', 'Stem Cell Niche/*physiology']",PMC6205459,['NOTNLM'],"['*epigenetics', '*hematopoiesis', '*leukemia', '*osteoclasts']",2018/10/10 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/10/10 06:00'],"['2018/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['1806019115 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1806019115 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2018 Oct 23;115(43):E10137-E10146. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1806019115.

Investigators can assess the impact from such unmeasured variables on an observed relative risk (RR) by utilizing externally sourced information and applying an indirect adjustment procedure, for example, the ""Axelson adjustment."" Although simple and easy to use, this approach applies to exposure and confounder variables that are binary. Other approaches eschew specific values and provide only bounds on the potential bias. METHODS: For both multiplicative and additive RR models, we present formulae for indirect adjustment of observed RRs for unmeasured potential confounding variables when there are multiple categories. In addition, we suggest an alternative strategy to identify the characteristics that the confounder must have to explain fully the observed association. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We provide examples involving studies of pediatric computer tomography scanning and leukemia and nuclear radiation workers and smoking to demonstrate that with externally sourced information, an investigator can assess whether confounding from unmeasured factors is likely to occur.","['Lubin, Jay H', 'Hauptmann, Michael', 'Blair, Aaron']","['Lubin JH', 'Hauptmann M', 'Blair A']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD.

Dysregulation of HATs is strongly correlated with etiology of several diseases especially cancer, thus highlighting the utmost significance of the development of small molecule inhibitors against this potential therapeutic target. In the present study, through virtual screening and iterative optimization, we identified DCH36_06 as a bona fide, potent p300/CBP inhibitor. DCH36_06 mediated p300/CBP inhibition leading to hypoacetylation on H3K18 in leukemic cells. The suppression of p300/CBP activity retarded cell proliferation in several leukemic cell lines. In addition, DCH36_06 arrested cell cycle at G1 phase and induced apoptosis via activation of capase3, caspase9 and PARP that elucidated the molecular mechanism of its anti-proliferation activity. In transcriptome analysis, DCH36_06 altered downstream gene expression and apoptotic pathways-related genes verified by real-time PCR. Importantly, DCH36_06 blocked the leukemic xenograft growth in mice supporting its potential for in vivo use that underlies the therapeutic potential for p300/CBP inhibitors in clinical translation. Taken together, our findings suggest that DCH36_06 may serve as a qualified chemical tool to decode the acetylome code and open up new opportunities for clinical intervention.","['Lu, Wenchao', 'Xiong, Huan', 'Chen, Yu', 'Wang, Chen', 'Zhang, Hao', 'Xu, Pan', 'Han, Jie', 'Xiao, Senhao', 'Ding, Hong', 'Chen, Zhifeng', 'Lu, Tian', 'Wang, Jun', 'Zhang, Yuanyuan', 'Yue, Liyan', 'Liu, Yu-Chih', 'Zhang, Chenhua', 'Yang, Yaxi', 'Jiang, Hualiang', 'Chen, Kaixian', 'Zhou, Bing', 'Luo, Cheng']","['Lu W', 'Xiong H', 'Chen Y', 'Wang C', 'Zhang H', 'Xu P', 'Han J', 'Xiao S', 'Ding H', 'Chen Z', 'Lu T', 'Wang J', 'Zhang Y', 'Yue L', 'Liu YC', 'Zhang C', 'Yang Y', 'Jiang H', 'Chen K', 'Zhou B', 'Luo C']","['State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 19 Yuquan Road, Beijing 100049, China.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China; Department of Chemistry, College of Sciences, Shanghai University, 99 Shangda Road, Shanghai 200444, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 19 Yuquan Road, Beijing 100049, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 19 Yuquan Road, Beijing 100049, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 19 Yuquan Road, Beijing 100049, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 19 Yuquan Road, Beijing 100049, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 19 Yuquan Road, Beijing 100049, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China; School of Life Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, 100 Haike Road, Shanghai 201210, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China; Department of Pharmacy, Guiyang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, South Dong Qing Road, Guizhou 550025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China; Jiangsu Key Laboratory for High Technology Research of TCM Formulae, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, 138 Xianlin Road, Nanjing 210023, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai 201203, China.

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of all TKIs in CML patients. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review with network meta-analysis (NMA) of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib, radotinib and ponatinib. Searches were performed in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and SciELo (March 2018). The NMAs were built for six outcomes at 12 months: complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), major cytogenetic response (MCyR), deep molecular response, major molecular response (MMR), complete haematologic response and incidence of serious adverse events. We conducted rank order and surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) analyses. RESULTS: Thirteen RCTs were included (n = 5079 patients). Statistical differences were observed for some comparisons in all outcomes. Imatinib 400 mg was considered the safest drug (SUCRA values of 10.3%) but presented low efficacy. Overall, nilotinib 600 mg was superior to the other TKI in efficacy (SUCRA values of 61.1% for CCyR, 81.0% for MMR, 90.0% for MCyR); however, no data on its safety profile at 12 months were reported. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that nilotinib should be upgraded to first-line therapy for CML, although further cost-effectiveness analyses, including the new TKI (i.e., ponatinib, radotinib), are needed.","['Fachi, Mariana M', 'Tonin, Fernanda S', 'Leonart, Leticia P', 'Aguiar, Karina S', 'Lenzi, Luana', 'Figueiredo, Bonald C', 'Fernandez-Llimos, Fernando', 'Pontarolo, Roberto']","['Fachi MM', 'Tonin FS', 'Leonart LP', 'Aguiar KS', 'Lenzi L', 'Figueiredo BC', 'Fernandez-Llimos F', 'Pontarolo R']","['Pharmaceutical Sciences Postgraduate Programme, Universidade Federal Do Parana, Curitiba, Brazil.

This oil-in-water nanoemulsion (average size 17.20+/-0.11nm, zeta potential 4.17+/-0.82mV) containing Tween-80, glycol, squalene and gambogic acid with improving 4000 times solubility was prepared by pseudoternary phase diagrams. We found that this nanoemulsion successfully encapsulated gambogic acid; it was stable and showed an obvious delayed release effect for the drug in three different phosphate-buffered saline (pH=2.0, 5.8 and 7.4). The half inhibiting concentration (IC50) of this nanoemulsion (480.7mug/mL and 408mug/mL) were 1.67 times and 1.98 times higher than those of its water solution (287mug/mL and 206mug/mL) after acting on the toxicity standard cell line (L929 line) for 24h and 48h, respectively. Importantly, acute injection toxicity indicated that the half lethal dose (LD50) of this nanoemulsion (23.25mg/kg, 95% LD50, 21.7-25.16mg/kg) was 1.26 times higher than that of its water solution (18.59mg/kg, 95% LD50, 16.84-20.53mg/kg). Compared with its suspension, the bioavailability of this nanoemulsion was 318.2%. Furthermore, this nanoemulsion had a better efficacy against the acute myeloid leukemia in vitro and in vivo by improving the time and percent of survival (MV4-11 engrafts mice) and reducing half inhibiting concentration values in acute myeloid leukemia such as Jurket, HL-60 and MV4-11 cells.

Using data from the Chronic GVHD Consortium, we describe the insurance, employment, and financial challenges faced by these patients and the factors associated with the ability to work/attend school and associated financial burdens. A 15-item cross-sectional questionnaire designed to measure financial concerns, income, employment, and insurance was completed by 190 patients (response rate, 68%; 10 centers) enrolled on a multicenter Chronic GVHD Consortium Response Measures Validation Study. Multivariable logistic regression models examined the factors associated with financial burden and ability to work/attend school. The median age of respondents was 56years, and 87% of the patients were white. A higher proportion of nonrespondents had lower income before hematopoietic cell transplantation and less than a college degree. All but 1 patient had insurance, 34% had faced delayed/denied insurance coverage for chronic GVHD treatments, and 66% reported a financial burden. Patients with a financial burden had greater depression/anxiety and difficulty sleeping. Nonwhite race, lower mental functioning, and lower activity score were associated with a greater likelihood of financial burden. Younger age, early risk disease, and higher mental functioning were associated with a greater likelihood of being able to work/attend school. In this multicenter cohort of patients with chronic GVHD, significant negative effects on finances were observed even with health insurance coverage.

In recent years, there has been evidence indicating myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL1) plays a role in brain glioblastoma. Therefore, the present study was conducted with aims of exploring the ability of MCL1 silencing to influence glioma cell senescence and apoptosis through the mediation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway. Glioma and tumor-adjacent tissues were collected in order to detect the presence of higher levels of MCL1 protein expression. Next, the mRNA and protein expression of MCL1, PI3K, Akt, B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), Bcl2-associated X (Bax), B lymphoma Mo-MLV insertion region 1 homolog (Bmi-1), and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) were determined. Cell counting kit-8 assay was applied to detect cell proliferation, beta-galactosidase staining for cell senescence, and flow cytometry for cell cycle entry and apoptosis. Initially, the results revealed higher positive expression rate of MCL1 protein, increased mRNA and protein expression of MCL1, PI3K, Akt, Bmi-1, and Bcl-2 and decreased that of Bax and PTEN in human glioma tissues. The silencing of MCL1 resulted in a decrease in mRNA and protein expression of PI3K, Akt, Bmi-1, and Bcl-2 and an increase in Bax and PTEN expressions in glioma cells. Moreover, silencing of MCL1 also inhibited cell proliferation and cell cycle entry in glioma cells, and promoted glioma cell senescence and apoptosis. In conclusion, the aforementioned results collectively suggested that the silencing of MCL1 promotes senescence and apoptosis in glioma cells through inhibiting the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Thus, decreasing the expression of MCL1 might have therapeutic functions in glioma.

The poor outcome of AMLs necessitates therapeutic improvement. In AML, genes encoding for myeloid transcription factors, signaling receptors regulating cell proliferation, and epigenetic modifiers can be mutated by somatically acquired genetic mutations or altered by chromosomal translocations. These mutations modify chromatin organization at genes sites regulating HPCs proliferation, terminal differentiation, and DNA repair, contributing to the development and progression of the disease. The reversibility of the epigenetic modifications by drug treatment makes epigenetic changes attractive targets for AML therapeutic intervention. Recent findings underline increased DNA damage and abnormalities in the DNA damage response (DDR) as a critical feature of AML blasts. The DDR preserves cell integrity and must be tightly coordinated with DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling to ensure the accessibility to the DNA of transcription factors and repair enzymes. A crucial role in these events is played by the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) kinases, which are hyperactive in AML. Based on these findings, we hypothesize the inhibition of DNA damage kinases as an alternative or complementary strategy for the differentiation treatment of AML as it leads to a reduced ability to repair the DNA damage, and to the inhibition of specific epigenetic modifiers whose function is altered in leukemic cells.

The most advanced approach in clinical development is the use of anti-CD19 CAR T-cells for the treatment of CD19(+) B-cell malignancies, including acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Areas covered: Recently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first anti-CD19 CAR T-cell product, tisagenlecleucel, for the treatment of pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed/refractory ALL. In this overview, we described the advances in the field, including a summary of clinical trials with tisagenlecleucel in ALL published to date. Expert opinion: CAR T-cell therapy has been developed in the context of small clinical studies and very few centers have had to deal with the challenges of managing CAR T-cells administration. However, this approach is likely to become a standard option for patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell lineage ALL.","['Thomas, Xavier', 'Paubelle, Etienne']","['Thomas X', 'Paubelle E']","['a Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hematology Department , Lyon-Sud Hospital , Pierre Benite , France.', 'a Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hematology Department , Lyon-Sud Hospital , Pierre Benite , France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20181012,England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'Q6C9WHR03O (tisagenlecleucel)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD19/immunology', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*CAR T-cells', '*CD19-directed CARs', '*cytokine release syndrome', '*prognosis', '*relapse']",2018/10/09 06:00,2019/04/10 06:00,['2018/10/09 06:00'],"['2018/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14712598.2018.1533951 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2018 Nov;18(11):1095-1106. doi: 10.1080/14712598.2018.1533951.

Total body irradiation has been promoted as an important component of conditioning regimens for this process; however, recent reports of chemotherapy-based conditioning regimens have shown comparable outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report our experience with radiation-free conditioning using busulfan and cyclophosphamide in 127 pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who were treated between 1997 and 2014. The median age was 11 years (range, < 1 to 15 y), 70% of patients were male, 81.1% received transplants from HLA-matched siblings, 83% received peripheral blood stem cells, 41% were in second complete remission at the time of transplant, and 83% had B-lineage immunophenotype. RESULTS: In patients who were in complete remission at the time of transplant, 5-year overall survival, leukemia-free survival, and relapse rates were 62.48% (95% confidence interval, 52.29-71.09%), 49.43% (95% confidence interval, 39.57-58.53%), and 45.64% (95% confidence interval, 35.85-54.88%), respectively. We observed significant differences between outcomes in patients by time of transplant, presence of chronic graft-versus-host disease, and remission status. CONCLUSIONS: Our relapse rates were comparable to those shown in recent studies, although the transplant-related mortality rate was lower. The results of our study showed that a busulfan/cyclophosphamide conditioning regimen has acceptable outcomes without the undesirable adverse effects of total body irradiation, particularly in pediatric patients. Large multicenter studies are needed to assess less toxic conditioning regimens with fewer adverse effects in these patients.","['Hamidieh, Amir Ali', 'Eslami Shahre Babaki, Amir', 'Rostami, Tahereh', 'Kasaeian, Amir', 'Koochakzadeh, Leili', 'Sharifi Aliabadi, Leyla', 'Behfar, Maryam', 'Ghavamzadeh, Ardeshir']","['Hamidieh AA', 'Eslami Shahre Babaki A', 'Rostami T', 'Kasaeian A', 'Koochakzadeh L', 'Sharifi Aliabadi L', 'Behfar M', 'Ghavamzadeh A']","['From the Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181005,Turkey,Exp Clin Transplant,Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,101207333,"['0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Busulfan/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Iran', 'Male', 'Myeloablative Agonists/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/mortality/*surgery', 'Progression-Free Survival', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects/*methods/mortality', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects']",,,,2018/10/09 06:00,2019/08/14 06:00,['2018/10/09 06:00'],"['2018/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.6002/ect.2017.0226 [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Clin Transplant. 2019 Apr;17(2):243-250. doi: 10.6002/ect.2017.0226.

METHODS: CD160 expression on human leukemia cell line NK92 cells was confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot. The proliferation characteristics and cell surface markers of this cell line were determined. Cytotoxicity of NK92 against 2 human myeloid leukemia cell lines, K562 and THP-1 was analyzed ex vivo. CD160 blocking antibody CL1-R2 was employed to clarify its role in NK cell mediated cytolysis. Then, the expression of CD160 on NK cells in peripheral blood from various patients with hematological malignancies were measured by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The mRNA and protein levels of CD160 expressions on NK92 cells were confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. The flow cytometry results demonstrated that the strong positive expression of CD160 could be detected on the NK92 cell surface. NK92 could effectively kill K562 and THP-1 cells, while the cytolysis effect was abrogated in the presence of CD160 blocking antibody CL1-R2. The high levels of HVEM were expressed on both target cells, but the HLA class I molecules were absent on K562. The expression of CD160 on CD3(-)CD56(+) NK cells in peripheral blood from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) recipients was significant lower than that in the normal controls (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The cytolysis function of human NK cells is mediated partially by CD160 molecule. The decrease of CD160 expression on NK cells from patients with various hematological malignancies implies that down-regulation of CD160 expression may be a novel mechanism of tumor immune escape.","['Wang, Zhen-Hua', 'Liu, Hui-Hui', 'Ma, Ning', 'Wang, Li-Hong', 'Liu, Wei', 'Tang, Bo', 'Qiu, Zhi-Xiang', 'Cen, Xi-Nan', 'Ren, Han-Yun', 'Dong, Yu-Jun']","['Wang ZH', 'Liu HH', 'Ma N', 'Wang LH', 'Liu W', 'Tang B', 'Qiu ZX', 'Cen XN', 'Ren HY', 'Dong YJ']","['Department of Hematology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, 100034, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, 100034, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, 100034, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, 100034, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, 100034, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, 100034, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, 100034, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, 100034, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, 100034, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, 100034, China.E-mail: dongy@hsc.pku.edu.cn.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD160 protein, human)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Flow Cytometry', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Humans', '*Killer Cells, Natural', 'Receptors, Immunologic', 'Tumor Escape']",,,,2018/10/09 06:00,2019/03/06 06:00,['2018/10/09 06:00'],"['2018/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2018)05-1559-06 [pii]', '10.7534/j.issn.1009-2137.2018.05.050 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2018 Oct;26(5):1559-1564. doi: 10.7534/j.issn.1009-2137.2018.05.050.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 147 patients with MPN were selected, including 28 patients with polycythaemia vera (PV), 46 patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET), 10 patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF), and 63 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML); and 88 healthy persons were used as normal control. DNA of all cases was extracted from bone marrow or peripheral blood, and JAK2V617F gene mutation was detected by allele-specific PCR, then 23 exons of STAT3 gene were amplified by PCR. Mutation and single nucleotide polymorphism of Rs2293152 of STAT3 gene were identified by DNA sequencing. RESULTS: STAT3 gene mutation was found in 8 patients with CML. The mutation rate was 12.7%. the missense mutationS629Tas found in 3 cases, the synonymous mutation was found in 5 cases (Q469Q 3 cases, G618G 2 cases). One case had mutations at the both sites of S629T and G618G. No mutation of STAT3 gene was found in the normal control group. Rs2293152: detection showed that the G allele of CML group was significantly higher than that of normal control, PV, ET and PMF group (P<0.01), suggesting that the patients with Rs2293152 G allele were more likely to develop CML. The C allele of PV, ET and PMF group was significantly higher than that of CML group (P<0.05), suggesting that the patients with Rs2293152 C allele were more likely to develop PV, ET and PMF. The G allele fiequency of JAK2V617F-negative group was significantly lower than that of the normal control and JAK2V617F positive group (P<0.01), suggesting that the Rs2293152 G allele may be a factor protecting against JAK2V617F mutation.

CONCLUSION: The killing effect of NK cells on acute myelogenous leukemia cell line is inversely proportional to PD-L1 expression; blocking PD1/PD-L1 binding can significantly enhance the killing efficiency of effector-target cells, which way be related with promoting the release of IFN-gamma and IL-2.","['Liu, Yan-Feng', 'He, Peng-Cheng', 'Zhang, Mei']","['Liu YF', 'He PC', 'Zhang M']","[""Department of Hematology, The First Affliated Hospital, of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710061, Shaanxi Province, China.Department of Hematology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410008, Hunan Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affliated Hospital, of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710061, Shaanxi Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affliated Hospital, of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710061, Shaanxi Province, China.E-mailzhangmei_xjtu@hotmail.com.""]",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (CD274 protein, human)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['B7-H1 Antigen', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma', '*Killer Cells, Natural', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute']",,,,2018/10/09 06:00,2019/03/06 06:00,['2018/10/09 06:00'],"['2018/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2018)05-1317-06 [pii]', '10.7534/j.issn.1009-2137.2018.05.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2018 Oct;26(5):1317-1322. doi: 10.7534/j.issn.1009-2137.2018.05.010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: mononuclear cells were collected from 103 patients with acute leukemia (AL) and 28 healthy volunteers, and percentage changes of CD3(+)CD4(+), CD3(+)CD8(+) and CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) cell subsets were assayed by flow cytometory. Relationship between the T subsets and clinical features of the patients was analyzed. RESULTS: Ratio of CD3(+) T cells decreased more significantly in patients with >50% blast cells than that in patients with <50% blast cells, while the ratio of Treg between the 2 groups was not significantly different. Treg increased more statistically significantly in the patients with CD34(+) leukemia cell than that with CD34(-) leukemia cells. In constrast to the relationship between prognosis and immune cells in the patients from 3 groups (low, intermediate and high-risk group) it was found that Treg cells increased more significantly in high-risk group than that in low-risk group. By continuously monitoring immune cells in 18 patients, it was found that Treg cells gradually increased during the first 3 courses of chemotherapy, then began to decreased in the 4th course, finally approached gradually to the normal value in the 6th course, and this change correlated with the clinical remission after chemotherapy. Treg cell number in the patients with AL was significantly higher than that in healthy controls, and Treg cell number during the onset and recurrence was significantly higher than that in the period of complete remission (continuous remission for over 6 months). Compared with the changes of immune cell number between different types of disease, it was found that Treg cells were increased more significantly in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) than that in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Proportion of Treg cells, Treg/CD4 decreased more significantly after the 1st course of chemotherapy in the group with complete remission (CR) than that in the group without CR. The complete remission rate and recurrence rate were 68.9% and 20% respectively in the group with >10% Treg cells, while the complete remission rate and recurrence rate were 85.7% and 7.69% respectively in the group with.<10% Treg cells. In comparison of the 6 recurrent patients with 32 patients with sustained CR, it was found that the ratio of Treg cells and Treg/CD4 was increased more significantly in the patients with relapse than that with CR and in control group. CONCLUSION: Dynamic change of Treg cells in the peripheral blood was closely related with clinical feature, recurrence and prognosis in the patients with acute leukemia.","['Zheng, Run-Hui', 'Yu, Bao-Dan', 'Zheng, Li-Xia', 'Wang, Chun-Yan', 'Qin, Peng-Fei', 'Luo, Xiao-Dan', 'Lin, Jing-Ren', 'Tan, Huo', 'Xu, Jun']","['Zheng RH', 'Yu BD', 'Zheng LX', 'Wang CY', 'Qin PF', 'Luo XD', 'Lin JR', 'Tan H', 'Xu J']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University,Guangzhou 510230, Guangdong ProvinceChina.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University,Guangzhou 510230, Guangdong ProvinceChina.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University,Guangzhou 510230, Guangdong ProvinceChina.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University,Guangzhou 510230, Guangdong ProvinceChina.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University,Guangzhou 510230, Guangdong ProvinceChina.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University,Guangzhou 510230, Guangdong ProvinceChina.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University,Guangzhou 510230, Guangdong ProvinceChina.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University,Guangzhou 510230, Guangdong ProvinceChina.', 'Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou 510230, Guangdong ProvinceChina.E-mail: xufeili@vip.163.com.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,IM,"['Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Prognosis', '*T-Lymphocyte Subsets']",,,,2018/10/09 06:00,2019/03/06 06:00,['2018/10/09 06:00'],"['2018/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2018)05-1309-08 [pii]', '10.7534/j.issn.1009-2137.2018.05.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2018 Oct;26(5):1309-1316. doi: 10.7534/j.issn.1009-2137.2018.05.009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The clinical data of patients with newly diagnosed CML were analyzed retrospectively. According to BCR-ABL transcript level, the 80 patients were divided into group A and group B, the patients with BCR-ABL(IS) >0.1% and </= 1% (warning response) were entolled in group A, and the patients with BCR-ABL(IS) </= 0.1% (best response) were enrolled in group B as control. The ratio of patients with main molecular response (MMR) and deep molecular response (DMR), as well as aquistation rate and cummulative rate of MR(4) (DMR) at specified fine points in 2 groups were compared, the independent risk factors affecting the therapeutic efficacy and prognosis were analyzed. RESULTS: The MMR and MR(4) of the B group at 15, 18 and 24 months after TKI treatment were significantly higher than those of the A group, and the patients in the B group reached MR(4) faster. In the 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after the demarcation point (TKI 12 months), the A group was much less easy to obtain MR(4) (P<0.05) than the B group. Through survival analysis, there were more patients in the B group than the A group at different time points to reach MR(4), and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.01). The single factor analysis showed that the splenomegaly (below rib edge)> 10cm (P<0.01) and lactate dehydrogenase > 400 U/L (P<0.05) were the long-term warning factors for patients. Multivariate analysis showed that the size of the spleen was an independent factor (P<0.01) to affect the prognosis of the patients who had been warned for 12 months. CONCLUSION: Patients at 12 months warning effect are slower and less easier to get DMR, which has a poor long-term prognosis. The size of the spleen in the patient at warning for 12 months of treatment effect can predict the relatively poor long-term prognosis.

METHODS: Clinical data of 102 de novo AML patients who received primary anti-IPA prophylaxis during the first induction chemotherapy were analyzed retrospectively. All the cases were divided into voriconazole-treated group and posaconazole-treated group according to the prophylactic agent. The incidences of IPA and systemic antifungal treatment during induction chemotherapy were analyzed for both groups. RESULTS: Among 102 enrolled cases, 42 cases received voriconazole and other 60 received posaconazole as primary prophylaxis. IPA occurred in 3 cases of voriconazole group (1 probable, 2 possible); IPA occurred in 4 cases of posaconazose group, and all were possible cases. The incidence of IPA during remission-induction chemotherapy in variconazole group equaled to posaconazose group (7.1% vs. 6.7%) (P=0.925). Beside IPA cases, 2 cases in voriconazole group and 4 cases in posaconazole group received intravenous anti aspergillosis drugs preemptive treatment, and no significant difference of prophylactic success rate was observed between two groups (88.1% vs. 86.7%) (P=0.831). Visual disturbance was the most common adverse event occurred in voriconazole group, but no significant differences of incidences of other adverse effects were observed when compared with posaconazole group. CONCLUSION: According to similar prophylactic effect with posaconazole, voriconazole appears to be a good alternative for primary prophylaxis of IPA during remission-induction chemotherapy in AML patients.","['Gong, Ben-Fa', 'Lin, Dong', 'Wei, Hui', 'Wang, Ying', 'Liu, Bing-Cheng', 'Zhou, Chun-Lin', 'Liu, Kai-Qi', 'Wei, Shu-Ning', 'Zhang, Guang-Ji', 'Liu, Yun-Tao', 'Gong, Xiao-Yuan', 'Li, Yan', 'Zhao, Xing-Li', 'Qiu, Shao-Wei', 'Gu, Run-Xia', 'Mi, Ying-Chang', 'Wang, Jian-Xiang']","['Gong BF', 'Lin D', 'Wei H', 'Wang Y', 'Liu BC', 'Zhou CL', 'Liu KQ', 'Wei SN', 'Zhang GJ', 'Liu YT', 'Gong XY', 'Li Y', 'Zhao XL', 'Qiu SW', 'Gu RX', 'Mi YC', 'Wang JX']","['Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Tianjin 300020, China.E-mail:ychmi@ihcams.ac.cn.', 'Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)']",IM,"['Antifungal Agents', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Mycoses', '*Pulmonary Aspergillosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Voriconazole']",,,,2018/10/09 06:00,2019/03/06 06:00,['2018/10/09 06:00'],"['2018/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2018)05-1269-06 [pii]', '10.7534/j.issn.1009-2137.2018.05.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2018 Oct;26(5):1269-1274. doi: 10.7534/j.issn.1009-2137.2018.05.003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Two hundred and fourteen AL patiens with mistranslation expressed lymphoid and myeloid-related antigens were grouped according to immunophenotypes, and the heterogeneous biologic charecteristics and prognosis related factors were analyzed, moreover the survival curves were drawn to analyze the survival of patiens. RESULTS: The immunophenotype in 214 cases was mainly cross-expression of myeloid and B lineage antigen (118 cases), followed by cross-expression of myeloid antigen and T lineage (88 cases), while the cross-expression of myeloid, T and B lineages, was less (only 8 cases). In ALL patiens with cross-expression of myeloid antigen, the CD33 was main type; while in AML patients with cross-expression of lymphoid antigen, CD7 was main type of lineage antigen, CD19 was main type of B lineage antigen. Among 214 AL patients, the cross-expression of CD55 and myeloid antigen was found in 30 cases, the cross-expression of CD7, CD19 and CD74 was observed in 6 cases, the cross-expressions of CD7, CD34 and CD56 was detected in 4 cases. Among AML patients with lymphoid antigen expression, the recurrent chromosmal abnormalities were found in 16 cases; among ALL patients with myeloid antigen expression, the recurrent chromosomal abnormalities were observed in 10 cases. The mistranslation antigen expression existed in 26 patients with recurrent chromosomal abnormalities, the mistranslated CD33 and CD13 in ALL patients with myeloid antigen expression was common, while the mistranslated CD2, CD56 and CD19 in AML patients with lymphoid antigen expression was common. As compared with patients without lymphoid antigen expression, the survival rate decreased significantly in patients with mistranslated CD7(+) and CD34(+) (both P<0.05). The logistic regression analysis showed that CD7, CD34 were main influencing factors for prognosis of AL patients (both P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The AL with mistranslation expressed lymphoid and myeloid antigens is a special kind of leukemia which possesses the heterogencous biological characteristcs and unique prognostic features, thus the immunophemotype of AL patients should be detected by flow cytometry. The existance of mistranlation-expressed differatiation antigens such as CD7 and CD34 is mainly influencing factors for the prognosis of AL patiens.","['Ma, Jiong', 'He, Guo-Min', 'Liu, Hong', 'Gao, Xiao-Yang', 'Zhu, Wen-Juan']","['Ma J', 'He GM', 'Liu H', 'Gao XY', 'Zhu WJ']","['Jiangsu Nursing Career Academy, Huaian 223001, Jiangsu Province, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Rugao People's Hospital, Rugao 226500, Jiangsu Province, China.E-mail: Zjb709@163.com."", ""Department of Hematology, Rugao People's Hospital, Rugao 226500, Jiangsu Province, China."", 'Jiangsu Nursing Career Academy, Huaian 223001, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Jiangsu Nursing Career Academy, Huaian 223001, Jiangsu Province, China.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Lymphoid Tissue', 'Prognosis']",,,,2018/10/09 06:00,2019/03/06 06:00,['2018/10/09 06:00'],"['2018/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2018)05-1263-06 [pii]', '10.7534/j.issn.1009-2137.2018.05.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2018 Oct;26(5):1263-1268. doi: 10.7534/j.issn.1009-2137.2018.05.002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, analysis of specific specimens is currently hindered by the incomplete representation of biological variability of protein sequences in canonical reference proteomes and the technical demands for their construction. Here, we report ProteomeGenerator, a framework for de novo and reference-assisted proteogenomic database construction and analysis based on sample-specific transcriptome sequencing and high-accuracy mass spectrometry proteomics. This enables the assembly of proteomes encoded by actively transcribed genes, including sample-specific protein isoforms resulting from non-canonical mRNA transcription, splicing, or editing. To improve the accuracy of protein isoform identification in non-canonical proteomes, ProteomeGenerator relies on statistical target-decoy database matching calibrated using sample-specific controls. Its current implementation includes automatic integration with MaxQuant mass spectrometry proteomics algorithms. We applied this method for the proteogenomic analysis of splicing factor SRSF2 mutant leukemia cells, demonstrating high-confidence identification of non-canonical protein isoforms arising from alternative transcriptional start sites, intron retention, and cryptic exon splicing as well as improved accuracy of genome-scale proteome discovery. Additionally, we report proteogenomic performance metrics for current state-of-the-art implementations of SEQUEST HT, MaxQuant, Byonic, and PEAKS mass spectral analysis algorithms. Finally, ProteomeGenerator is implemented as a Snakemake workflow within a Singularity container for one-step installation in diverse computing environments, thereby enabling open, scalable, and facile discovery of sample-specific, non-canonical, and neomorphic biological proteomes.","['Cifani, Paolo', 'Dhabaria, Avantika', 'Chen, Zining', 'Yoshimi, Akihide', 'Kawaler, Emily', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar', 'Poirier, John T', 'Kentsis, Alex']","['Cifani P', 'Dhabaria A', 'Chen Z', 'Yoshimi A', 'Kawaler E', 'Abdel-Wahab O', 'Poirier JT', 'Kentsis A']","['Molecular Pharmacology Program , Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center , New York City , New York 10065 , United States.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program , Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center , New York City , New York 10065 , United States.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program , Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center , New York City , New York 10065 , United States.', 'Institute for Systems Genetics and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology , New York University Langone Health , New York City , New York 10016 , United States.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program , Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center , New York City , New York 10065 , United States.', 'Institute for Systems Genetics and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology , New York University Langone Health , New York City , New York 10016 , United States.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program , Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center , New York City , New York 10065 , United States.', 'Departments of Pediatrics, Pharmacology, and Physiology & Biophysics, Weill Cornell Medical College , Cornell University , New York , New York 10065 , United States.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA204396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA188881/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA233208/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20181019,United States,J Proteome Res,Journal of proteome research,101128775,"['0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proteome)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '147153-65-9 (SRSF2 protein, human)', '170974-22-8 (Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors)']",,"['*Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Mass Spectrometry/statistics & numerical data', 'Molecular Sequence Annotation', 'Mutation', 'Peptide Mapping/statistics & numerical data', 'Peptides/*chemistry/classification/isolation & purification', 'Proteogenomics/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics/metabolism', 'Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors/genetics/metabolism', '*Software', '*Transcriptome']",PMC6727203,['NOTNLM'],"['*de novo database construction', '*peptide fractionation', '*peptide-spectral matching', '*protein isoform analysis', '*proteogenomics', '*scoring function', '*transcriptomics']",2018/10/09 06:00,2019/08/01 06:00,['2018/10/09 06:00'],"['2018/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/01 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00295 [doi]'],ppublish,J Proteome Res. 2018 Nov 2;17(11):3681-3692. doi: 10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00295.

Thus, 10 years ago, the National Cancer Institute supported the fielding of the Adolescent and Young Adult Health Outcomes and Patient Experiences (AYA HOPE) study to address this gap. We recruited individuals diagnosed at ages 15 to 39 with germ cell, Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and sarcoma from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registries into the first multicenter population-based study of medical care, physical, and mental health outcomes for AYAs with cancer in the United States.

Myeloid sarcoma is classified into two types based on whether onset of the disease is complicated by haematologic diseases: extramedullary infiltration of leukaemia (leukaemic MS) and isolated myeloid sarcoma. The incidence of isolated myeloid sarcoma is low. In particular, isolated myeloid sarcoma involving the pancreas is extremely rare and prone to misdiagnosis. This case report describes the long and eventful diagnostic process of a case of myeloid sarcoma involving the pancreas and orbit. Due to a lack of typical clinical manifestations and imaging characteristics, the patient underwent several rounds of treatment without a confirmed diagnosis. Eventually, the final diagnosis was pathologically confirmed using several types of biopsies and immunohistochemical detection. To date, this type of disease has not been reported in the literature.

To disseminate into tissues, leukemia cells migrate into the blood stream and then exit the circulation by migrating across vascular endothelial barriers. Formin proteins regulate cytoskeletal remodeling and cell migration of normal and malignant cells. The Formin mDia1 is highly expressed in transformed lymphocytes and regulates lymphocyte migration. However, the role of mDia1 in regulating leukemia progression in vivo is unknown. Here, we investigated how mDia1 mediates the ability of leukemia cells to migrate and disseminate in vivo. For these studies, we used a mouse model of Bcr-Abl pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Our data showed that mDia1-deficient leukemia cells have reduced chemotaxis and ability to complete transendothelial migration in vitro. In vivo, mDia1 deficiency reduced the ability of leukemia cells to engraft in recipient mice. Furthermore, leukemia dissemination to various tissues and leukemia progression were inhibited by mDia1 depletion. Finally, mDia1 depletion in leukemia cells resulted in prolonged survival of recipient mice in a leukemia transfer model. Overall, our data show that the Formin mDia1 mediates leukemia cell migration, and drives leukemia engraftment and progression in vivo, suggesting that targeting mDia1 could provide a new method for treatment of leukemia.","['Thompson, Scott B', 'Wigton, Eric J', 'Krovi, Sai Harsha', 'Chung, Jeffrey W', 'Long, Robert A', 'Jacobelli, Jordan']","['Thompson SB', 'Wigton EJ', 'Krovi SH', 'Chung JW', 'Long RA', 'Jacobelli J']","['Department of Biomedical Research, National Jewish Health, Denver, CO, United States.', 'Department of Immunology and Microbiology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, United States.', 'Department of Biomedical Research, National Jewish Health, Denver, CO, United States.', 'Department of Immunology and Microbiology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, United States.', 'Department of Biomedical Research, National Jewish Health, Denver, CO, United States.', 'Department of Immunology and Microbiology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, United States.', 'Department of Biomedical Research, National Jewish Health, Denver, CO, United States.', 'Department of Immunology and Microbiology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, United States.', 'Department of Biomedical Research, National Jewish Health, Denver, CO, United States.', 'Department of Immunology and Microbiology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, United States.', 'Department of Biomedical Research, National Jewish Health, Denver, CO, United States.', 'Department of Immunology and Microbiology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, United States.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA046934/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 RR029218/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI007405/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20180920,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC6158313,['NOTNLM'],"['Diaph1', 'cytoskeleton', 'formins', 'leukemia engraftment', 'mDia1', 'transendothelial migration']",2018/10/09 06:00,2018/10/09 06:01,['2018/10/09 06:00'],"['2018/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/09 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2018.00389 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2018 Sep 20;8:389. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2018.00389. eCollection 2018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The general population matched group with HIV antibody screening negative samples and WB negative matched group with WB negative samples were selected as the two compared groups by matching gender and age from HIV antibody screening in Fujian province in the same period. Blood concentrations of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody, anti-treponema pallidum (TP) antibody, antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) antibody, and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) were detected by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). chi(2) test and multivariate non-conditional logistic regression analysis were performed to identify the influencing factors that leading to nonspecific responses, to indeterminate HIV antibody tests. Results: A total of 13 WB band patterns were observed in 110 HIV antibody indeterminate samples, in which a single p24 band (58.18%, 64/110), a single gp160 band (17.27%, 19/110) and a single p17 band (7.27%, 8/110) were the three most common patterns. The positive rate of anti-TP antibody was significantly higher in HIV antibody indeterminate samples than general population control group and WB negative control group (10.91%, 12/110 vs. 1.77%, 4/226 and 3.64%, 4/110), compared with two control groups (chi(2)=13.627 and 4.314, P<0.05). The positive rate of AFP was significantly higher in HIV antibody indeterminate samples than general population control group (18.18%, 20/110 vs. 0.44%, 1/226, chi(2)=39.736, P<0.05), the different was not significant compared with WB negative control group (18.18%, 20/110 vs. 23.64%, 26/110, chi(2)=0.990, P>0.05) While no significant differences were found between HIV antibody indeterminate group and two control groups in terms of the positive rates of ANA, HBsAg, anti-HCV antibody or anti-HTLV antibody. Conclusions: The influencing factors that leading to nonspecific responses to indeterminate HIV antibody tests appeared complicate, and the anti-TP antibody positivity might be an influencing factor responsible for nonspecific responses to indeterminate HIV antibody tests.","['Wu, S L', 'Gao, M', 'Zheng, J', 'Yan, P P', 'Yan, Y S']","['Wu SL', 'Gao M', 'Zheng J', 'Yan PP', 'Yan YS']","['Institute for AIDS/STD Control and Prevention, Fujian Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Fuzhou 350001, China; School of Public Health, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou 350004, China; Fujian Province Key Laboratory of Zoonosis Research, Fuzhou 350001, China.', 'School of Public Health, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou 350004, China.', 'Institute for AIDS/STD Control and Prevention, Fujian Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Fuzhou 350001, China.', 'Institute for AIDS/STD Control and Prevention, Fujian Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Fuzhou 350001, China; Fujian Province Key Laboratory of Zoonosis Research, Fuzhou 350001, China.', 'Institute for AIDS/STD Control and Prevention, Fujian Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Fuzhou 350001, China; School of Public Health, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou 350004, China; Fujian Province Key Laboratory of Zoonosis Research, Fuzhou 350001, China.']",['chi'],"['2015-ZQN-ZD-11/Cultivation of Young Talents Project Fund from Fujian Provincial', 'Health and Family Planning Commission', '2016Y0010/Pilot Project of Fujian Provincial Department of Science and Technology']",['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,8208604,['0 (HIV Antibodies)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Blotting, Western/*methods', 'Case-Control Studies', 'China/epidemiology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/*methods', 'HIV Antibodies/*blood/isolation & purification', 'HIV Infections/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'HIV-1/immunology', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,['NOTNLM'],"['HIV antibody', 'Indeterminate', 'Influencing factor', 'Nonspecific responses']",2018/10/09 06:00,2019/04/04 06:00,['2018/10/09 06:00'],"['2018/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0254-6450.2018.09.021 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi. 2018 Sep 10;39(9):1255-1260. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0254-6450.2018.09.021.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Eighty-eight cases of newly-diagnosed AML patients, who were treated with the CAMS-2005 regimen from April 2005 to July 2009, were enrolled in this case observational study. Clinical characteristics, long-term prognosis and prognostic factors were analyzed retrospectively. Overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS) rates were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Rates of survival between the groups were compared by the Log-rank test. Prognostic factors were evaluated by COX regression analysis. Results: A total of 82 cases were enrolled in this study, including 34 core binding factor(CBF)-AML patients and 48 non-CBF-AML patients. There were 45 males and 37 females. The median age at diagnosis was 8.0 (0.7-16.0) years. During the induction therapy, 3 patients (4%) developed treatment-related early-death, while 63 patients (77%) achieved complete remission (CR) and 53 patients (65%) achieved CR after 1 course. Twenty-one patients (33%) had relapsed disease. The CR rates of CBF-AML patients and non-CBF-AML patients were 91% (31/34) and 67% (32/48) (chi(2)=5.410, P=0.020) , while the relapse rates were 29% (9/31) and 38% (12/32) (chi(2)=0.508, P=0.476) . The 8-year OS and EFS rates of all 82 patients were 59%(48/82) and 51%(42/82). The 8-year OS rates of CBF-AML patients and non-CBF-AML patients were 74% (25/34) and 48%(23/48) (chi(2)=5.812, P=0.016), while the 8-year EFS rates of CBF-AML patients and non-CBF-AML patients were 71%(24/34) and 38%(18/48) (chi(2)=8.682, P=0.003). There were statistically significant differences between groups. The 8-year OS rates of patients who achieved CR after 1 course and other patients were 68% (36/53) and 46% (12/26) (chi(2)=9.606, P=0.002), while the 8-year EFS rates were 66% (35/53) and 27% (7/26) (chi(2)=19.471, P=0.000), the differences were all statistically significant. COX multivariate analysis showed that CBF-AML or non-CBF-AML and whether achieved CR after 1 course were independent prognostic factors of OS rates (relative risk: 2.538, 2.561) and EFS rates (relative risk: 3.050, 3.686) (P <0.05). Conclusions: The efficacy of the CAMS-2005 regimen in the treatment of AML patients was well. CBF-AML or non-CBF-AML and whether achieved CR after 1 course were independent prognostic factors for pediatric AML patients.","['Ruan, M', 'Qi, B Q', 'Liu, F', 'Liu, T F', 'Liu, X M', 'Chen, X J', 'Yang, W Y', 'Guo, Y', 'Zhang, L', 'Zou, Y', 'Chen, Y M', 'Zhu, X F']","['Ruan M', 'Qi BQ', 'Liu F', 'Liu TF', 'Liu XM', 'Chen XJ', 'Yang WY', 'Guo Y', 'Zhang L', 'Zou Y', 'Chen YM', 'Zhu XF']","['Institute of Hematology, Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['chi'],"['2017-I2M-3-018/Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Innovation Fund for Medical', 'Sciences']","['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",,China,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,0417427,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Prognosis', '*Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Child', 'Follow-up studies', 'Leukemia, myeloid, acute']",2018/10/09 06:00,2019/04/02 06:00,['2018/10/09 06:00'],"['2018/10/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0578-1310.2018.10.003 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi. 2018 Oct 2;56(10):730-734. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0578-1310.2018.10.003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Soluble PML is rapidly modified to the insoluble form in response to As(3+), yet the relationship between the solubility change and nuclear localization of PML and PML-nuclear body (PML-NB) proteins remained elusive. We have investigated differences in the solubility change of well-known PML-NB proteins such as death-associated protein 6 (DAXX), SUMO, and PML in genetically engineered HEK293, and Jurkat and HL60 cells. The solubility of PML and SUMO2/3 monomers in RIPA solution decreased in 2h in response to As(3+). Live image analysis of GFP-PML revealed that extranuclear PML was insoluble in RIPA irrespective of the As(3+)-treatment and PML in PML-NBs, which was soluble in the untreated cells, was converted to insoluble forms by As(3+). The solubility of DAXX was not changed by As(3+), even though PML and DAXX co-localized completely in the subcellular compartments. Murine double mutant 2 (MDM2), which is known to interacts with intranuclear PML, did not affect the As(3+)-induced solubility change of PML. These results indicate that As(3+) selectively reorganizes PML and SUMO2/3 monomers into insoluble forms in PML-NBs, and then PML SUMOylation proceeds.","['Hirano, Seishiro', 'Udagawa, Osamu', 'Kobayashi, Yayoi', 'Kato, Ayaka']","['Hirano S', 'Udagawa O', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Kato A']","['Center for Health and Environmental Risk Research, National Institute for Environmental Studies, Japan.

Multiple GSE tools can be integrated into a single method as obtaining optimal results is challenging due to the plethora of GSE tools and their discrepant performances. Several existing ensemble methods lead to different scores in sorting pathways as integrated results; furthermore, it is difficult for users to choose a single ensemble score to obtain optimal final results. Here, we develop an ensemble method using a machine learning approach called Combined Gene set analysis incorporating Prioritization and Sensitivity (CGPS) that integrates the results provided by nine prominent GSE tools into a single ensemble score (R score) to sort pathways as integrated results. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, CGPS is the first GSE ensemble method built based on a priori knowledge of pathways and phenotypes. Compared with 10 widely used individual methods and five types of ensemble scores from two ensemble methods, we demonstrate that sorting pathways based on the R score can better prioritize relevant pathways, as established by an evaluation of 120 simulated datasets and 45 real datasets. Additionally, CGPS is applied to expression data involving the drug panobinostat, which is an anticancer treatment against multiple myeloma. The results identify cell processes associated with cancer, such as the p53 signaling pathway (hsa04115); by contrast, according to two ensemble methods (EnrichmentBrowser and EGSEA), this pathway has a rank higher than 20, which may cause users to miss the pathway in their analyses. We show that this method, which is based on a priori knowledge, can capture valuable biological information from numerous types of gene set collections, such as KEGG pathways, GO terms, Reactome, and BioCarta.

Relapse of hematologic malignancy after allogeneic stem cell transplantation limits the success of this approach, and PD-1 blockade may hold therapeutic promise. However, PD-1 expression and its relationship with post-transplant relapse is poorly described. Because the donor immunity is activated by alloresponses, PD-1 expression may differ from nontransplanted individuals, and PD-1 blockade could risk graft-versus-host disease. Here we analyzed T-cell exhaustion marker kinetics and their relationship with leukemia relapse in 85 patients undergoing myeloablative T-cell-depleted HLA-matched stem cell transplantation. At a median follow-up of 3.5 years, 35 (44%) patients relapsed. PD-1 expression in CD4 and CD8 T cells was comparably elevated in relapsed and nonrelapsed cohorts.

A large proportion of Ph-like ALL cases carry activating kinase mutations that could potentially allow them to be targeted by tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Ph-like ALL is not an uncommon entity, especially among adults, with a frequency exceeding 20%, including in older patients (>60 years old) with ALL. Ph-like ALL is associated with inferior outcomes across all ages, and studies have consistently shown a higher incidence of persistent postinduction minimal residual disease in patients carrying Ph-like ALL compared with other subgroups of ALL, and this translates into inferior leukemia-related outcomes. The inferior outcome of conventional chemotherapy for Ph-like ALL in adults raises the fundamental question of whether all adults with Ph-like ALL require an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in first complete remission (CR1) regardless of other presenting features and treatment response parameters. Here we present and discuss several scenarios in which adults with Ph-like ALL underwent or were considered for HCT in CR1 for various reasons. Although the decision to proceed with HCT was clear and indisputable in some of these situations, in others we struggled with the decision to transplant in CR1 because of the lack of published data regarding the efficacy of allogeneic HCT as consolidation for Ph-like ALL. We emphasize the urgent need for developing well-designed studies to address this important question.","['Aldoss, Ibrahim', 'Kamal, Muhammad O', 'Forman, Stephen J', 'Pullarkat, Vinod']","['Aldoss I', 'Kamal MO', 'Forman SJ', 'Pullarkat V']","['Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic cell transplantation, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.

To control BLV infections in Japan, segregating or managing cows according to their proviral load (PVL) is a rational strategy. This study was conducted to establish a quantitative procedure for estimating blood PVL per microliter using a statistical model to offer a cost-effective alternative to the conventional quantitative real-time PCR method. In total, 250 Holstein cows infected with BLV were identified from 10 commercial dairy farms. Information on age was collected and blood samples were tested for white blood cell and lymphocyte counts and PVL using PCR. Generalized linear models with quasi-Poisson errors were used to estimate PVL by selecting age, logarithm of lymphocyte count, and their interaction term as explanatory variables. To evaluate the model, blood samples of 92 BLV-infected Holstein cows from 2 other commercial dairy farms were tested, and measured PVL values were compared with estimated PVL values by the model. The logPVL per microliter was modeled by positive associations with log lymphocyte count and age and a negative association with the interaction term. In the evaluation, measured PVL values had a strong correlation with estimated PVL values (Spearman's rho = 0.87). In conclusion, our model provides a cost-effective and more rapid alternative to the conventional method to facilitate test and segregation or management of BLV-suspected cows.","['Nakada, S', 'Kohara, J', 'Makita, K']","['Nakada S', 'Kohara J', 'Makita K']","['Hokkaido Higashi Agriculture Mutual Aid Association, 14-37-3 Tawarabashi, Nakashibetsu, Hokkaido, 086-1137, Japan; Veterinary Epidemiology Unit, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Rakuno Gakuen University, 582 Bunkyodai Midorimachi, Ebetsu, Hokkaido, 069-8501, Japan.', 'Animal Research Center of Hokkaido Research Organization, 5-39 Shintoku, Hokkaido, 081-0038, Japan.', 'Veterinary Epidemiology Unit, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Rakuno Gakuen University, 582 Bunkyodai Midorimachi, Ebetsu, Hokkaido, 069-8501, Japan.

However, NK cells were recently reported to possess memory-like functions that were predominantly provided by hepatic NK cells. Memory properties were mainly documented in contact hypersensitivity models or during cytomegalovirus infections. However, the precise role and the physiologic importance of memory-like NK cells during retroviral infections are still under investigation. Here, we show that Friend retrovirus (FV) infection of mice induced a population of phenotypically memory-like NK cells at 28 days post infection. Upon secondary antigen encounter, these NK cells showed an increased production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFNgamma and TNFalpha as well as the death ligand FasL in comparison to naive NK cells. Furthermore, we found an augmented elimination of antigen-matched but not antigen-mismatched target cells by these memory-like NK cells. In adoptive cell transfer experiments, equal antiviral activities of splenic and hepatic memory-like NK cells during the late phase of acute FV infection were found. Our results strongly imply the existence and antiviral activity of spleen and liver memory-like NK cells in FV infection, which efficiently respond upon secondary exposure to retroviral antigens.","['Littwitz-Salomon, Elisabeth', 'Nguyen, Thanh', 'Schimmer, Simone', 'Dittmer, Ulf']","['Littwitz-Salomon E', 'Nguyen T', 'Schimmer S', 'Dittmer U']","['Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.

This is particularly important at regulatory regions, such as CpG islands (CGIs), which are known to recruit Trithorax (TrxG) and Polycomb group proteins. The CxxC zinc finger protein 1 (CFP1, also known as CGBP) is a subunit of the TrxG SET1 protein complex, a major catalyst of trimethylation of H3K4 (H3K4me3). RESULTS: Here, we used ChIP followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) to analyse genomic occupancy of CFP1 in two human haematopoietic cell types. We demonstrate that CFP1 occupies CGIs associated with active transcription start sites (TSSs), and is mutually exclusive with H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), a marker of polycomb repressive complex 2. Strikingly, rather than being restricted to active CGI TSSs, CFP1 also occupies a substantial fraction of active non-CGI TSSs and enhancers of transcribed genes. However, relative to other TrxG subunits, CFP1 was specialised to TSSs. Finally, we found enrichment of CpG-containing DNA motifs in CFP1 peaks at CGI promoters. CONCLUSIONS: We found that CFP1 is not solely recruited to CpG islands as it was originally defined, but also other regions including non-CpG island promoters and enhancers.","['van de Lagemaat, Louie N', 'Flenley, Maria', 'Lynch, Magnus D', 'Garrick, David', 'Tomlinson, Simon R', 'Kranc, Kamil R', 'Vernimmen, Douglas']","['van de Lagemaat LN', 'Flenley M', 'Lynch MD', 'Garrick D', 'Tomlinson SR', 'Kranc KR', 'Vernimmen D']","['The Roslin Institute and Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush, Midlothian, EH25 9RG, UK.', 'MRC Molecular Haematology Unit, Weatherall Institute for Molecular Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 9DS, UK.', 'MRC Molecular Haematology Unit, Weatherall Institute for Molecular Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 9DS, UK.', ""Centre for Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, 28th Floor Guy's Tower, Great Maze Pond, London, SE1 9RT, UK."", ""st John's institute of dermatology, Great Maze Pond, London, SE1 9RT, UK."", ""INSERM, UMRS-1126, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Universite Paris Diderot, 75010, Paris, France."", 'MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh, 5 Little France Drive, Edinburgh, EH16 4UU, UK.', 'MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh, 5 Little France Drive, Edinburgh, EH16 4UU, UK.', 'Laboratory of Haematopoietic Stem Cell & Leukaemia Biology, Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, Charterhouse Square, London, EC1M 6BQ, UK.', 'The Roslin Institute and Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, University of Edinburgh, Easter Bush, Midlothian, EH25 9RG, UK. douglas.vernimmen@roslin.ed.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['MR/P010008/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'BB/J004235/1/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'BB/P013732/1/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181006,England,Epigenetics Chromatin,Epigenetics & chromatin,101471619,"['0 (CXXC1 protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Protein Binding', 'Trans-Activators']",PMC6173865,['NOTNLM'],"['*CFP1', '*CpG islands', '*Enhancers', '*Epigenetics', '*Trithorax group proteins']",2018/10/08 06:00,2018/12/27 06:00,['2018/10/08 06:00'],"['2018/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13072-018-0230-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s13072-018-0230-0 [pii]']",epublish,Epigenetics Chromatin. 2018 Oct 6;11(1):59. doi: 10.1186/s13072-018-0230-0.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-2947-1557', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1308-9919']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GRFS at 2 years was superior in BM recipients compared with PB recipients (16%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 14% to 18% versus 10%; 95% CI, 8% to 11%; P <.0001) in the 8/8 HLA-matched cohort and 7/8 HLA-matched cohort (11%; 95% CI, 8% to 14% versus 5%; 95% CI, 4% to 7%; P=.001). With 8/8 HLA-matched unrelated donors, overall survival at 5 years was superior in recipients of BM (43%; 95% CI, 40% to 46% versus 38%; 95% CI, 36% to 40%; P=.014). The inferior 5-year survival in the PB cohort was attributable to a higher frequency of deaths while in remission compared with the BM cohort. For recipients of 7/8 HLA-matched grafts, survival at 5 years was similar in BM recipients and PB recipients (32% versus 29%; P=.329). BM grafts are associated with improved long-term GRFS and overall survival in recipients of matched unrelated donor HCT and should be considered the unrelated allograft of choice, when available, for adults with acute leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome.","['Alousi, Amin', 'Wang, Tao', 'Hemmer, Michael T', 'Spellman, Stephen R', 'Arora, Mukta', 'Couriel, Daniel R', 'Pidala, Joseph', 'Anderlini, Paolo', 'Boyiadzis, Michael', 'Bredeson, Christopher N', 'Cahn, Jean-Yves', 'Cairo, Mitchell S', 'Gadalla, Shahinaz M', 'Hashmi, Shahrukh K', 'Gale, Robert Peter', 'Kanda, Junya', 'Kamble, Rammurti T', 'Kharfan-Dabaja, Mohamed A', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Ringden, Olle', 'Saad, Ayman A', 'Schultz, Kirk R', 'Verdonck, Leo F', 'Waller, Edmund K', 'Yared, Jean A', 'Holtan, Shernan G', 'Weisdorf, Daniel J']","['Alousi A', 'Wang T', 'Hemmer MT', 'Spellman SR', 'Arora M', 'Couriel DR', 'Pidala J', 'Anderlini P', 'Boyiadzis M', 'Bredeson CN', 'Cahn JY', 'Cairo MS', 'Gadalla SM', 'Hashmi SK', 'Gale RP', 'Kanda J', 'Kamble RT', 'Kharfan-Dabaja MA', 'Litzow MR', 'Ringden O', 'Saad AA', 'Schultz KR', 'Verdonck LF', 'Waller EK', 'Yared JA', 'Holtan SG', 'Weisdorf DJ']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.

Whether clinical trial participation influences outcome has important implications for how clinicians should present trial participation to patients and families. Methodological challenges limit generalizations about the impact of clinical trial participation on outcome compared with nonparticipation. Oncologists should inform patients and families that clinical trials are the engine for future progress because they identify more effective therapies and that clinical trial participation is a reasonable option to consider for children with cancer. However, as noted in by Truong and colleagues in this issue, the rationale for trial enrollment should not include an expectation of better outcomes compared with nonenrollment.","['Smith, Malcolm A', 'Joffe, Steven']","['Smith MA', 'Joffe S']","['Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Comment']",20181006,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Child', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', '*Research Design']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*childhood cancer', '*clinical trials', '*informed consent', '*research ethics', '*selection bias']",2018/10/07 06:00,2019/09/10 06:00,['2018/10/07 06:00'],"['2018/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.31722 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2018 Oct 15;124(20):3965-3968. doi: 10.1002/cncr.31722.

Few studies have examined respiratory outcomes among this population using emergency department (ED) visits as an objective measure of respiratory health. METHODS: ED visits for respiratory conditions were identified for children and AYAs diagnosed with cancer, 0-25 years of age, from 1997 through 2012 (2535 cases) and compared with a birthdate-matched and sex-matched cohort without cancer drawn from the general population (7605 controls). Negative binomial regression with robust standard errors was used to estimate incidence rates, rate ratios (RRs), and 95% confidence intervals for primary respiratory ED visits, combined and by diagnosis (asthma, respiratory disease, and respiratory infection) from 1997 through 2015. Analyses were performed for new cases (0 to <5 years from diagnosis) and survivors (5-18 years from diagnosis). RESULTS: Subjects were followed for an average of 8 years (range, 0-18 years). Relative to the comparison cohort, cancer cases had higher incidence rates for all types of respiratory ED visits over both follow-up times. New cases had significantly higher RRs for any respiratory condition (RR, 4.14), respiratory disease (RR, 4.62), and respiratory infection (RR, 4.74). Among survivors, the RRs for any respiratory condition (RR, 2.00) and respiratory infection (RR, 2.10) were significantly elevated, although the magnitude tended to decline in survivorship. Demographic and clinical risk factors found to be associated with respiratory ED visits included Hispanic/other race/ethnicity, male sex, exposure to chemotherapy, diagnosis at a younger age, and a diagnosis of leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study demonstrated that children and AYAs with cancer face an increased burden of respiratory complications compared with a comparison cohort without cancer from diagnosis through survivorship.","['Ramsay, Joemy M', 'Ou, Judy Y', 'Fluchel, Mark N', 'Kirchhoff, Anne C']","['Ramsay JM', 'Ou JY', 'Fluchel MN', 'Kirchhoff AC']","['Cancer Control and Population Sciences, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.', 'Cancer Control and Population Sciences, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.', 'Cancer Control and Population Sciences, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.']",['eng'],['N/A/Menzies Health Institute Queensland/International'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181006,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Cancer Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Comorbidity', 'Emergency Service, Hospital/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Patient Admission/*statistics & numerical data', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/*epidemiology/*therapy', 'Survivorship', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*adolescent and young adult (AYA)', '*emergency department (ED)', '*late effects', '*pediatric cancer', '*respiratory health', '*survivorship']",2018/10/07 06:00,2019/09/24 06:00,['2018/10/07 06:00'],"['2017/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/22 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/24 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.31650 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2018 Oct 1;124(19):3924-3933. doi: 10.1002/cncr.31650.

The objectives of this study were to describe the impact of trial enrollment on event-free survival and overall survival in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) using the Cancer in Young People in Canada (CYP-C) database. METHODS: Children were included if they had had AML newly diagnosed between ages birth and 14 years from 2001 to 2012. CYP-C is a national pediatric cancer population-based database that includes all cases of pediatric cancer diagnosed and treated at 1 of the 17 tertiary pediatric oncology centers in Canada. Univariate and Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the impact of initial trial enrollment on survival. RESULTS: In total, 397 eligible children with AML were included in the analysis, of whom 94 (23.7%) were enrolled on a clinical trial at initial diagnosis. The most common reason for non-enrollment was that no trial was available. The event-free survival rate at 5 years was 57.8% +/- 5.2% for those enrolled versus 54.8% +/- 2.9% for those not enrolled (P = .75). The overall survival rate at 5 years was 70.1% +/- 4.9% for those enrolled versus 66.3% +/- 2.8% for those not enrolled (P = .58). Enrollment on a trial was not associated with improved event-free or overall survival in multiple regression analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Enrollment on a clinical trial was not associated with improved survival for children with AML in a population-based cohort. Rationale for trial enrollment should not include the likelihood of benefit compared with non-enrollment.","['Truong, Tony H', 'Pole, Jason D', 'Barber, Randy', 'Dix, David', 'Kulkarni, Ketan P', 'Martineau, Emilie', 'Randall, Alicia', 'Stammers, David', 'Strahlendorf, Caron', 'Strother, Douglas', 'Sung, Lillian']","['Truong TH', 'Pole JD', 'Barber R', 'Dix D', 'Kulkarni KP', 'Martineau E', 'Randall A', 'Stammers D', 'Strahlendorf C', 'Strother D', 'Sung L']","[""Departments of Pediatrics and Oncology, Alberta Children's Hospital, Calgary, Alberta, Canadas."", 'Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'C17 Research Council, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', ""Department of Pediatrics, British Columbia Children's Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, IWK Health Center, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Quebec Hospital Center-Laval University, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, IWK Health Center, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Royal University Hospital, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', ""Departments of Pediatrics and Oncology, Alberta Children's Hospital, Calgary, Alberta, Canadas."", 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181006,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age of Onset', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/*statistics & numerical data', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*mortality/*therapy', 'Male', '*Patient Selection', 'Survival Analysis', 'United States/epidemiology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Canada', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*cancer', '*children', '*clinical trial enrollment', '*population-based', '*survival']",2018/10/07 06:00,2019/09/24 06:00,['2018/10/07 06:00'],"['2018/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/13 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/24 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.31728 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2018 Oct 15;124(20):4098-4106. doi: 10.1002/cncr.31728.

Subsequently, the patient developed pyrexia, accompanying headache, nausea, and vomiting with no abnormal brain imaging. Despite receiving antimicrobial treatment, his febrile status and headache persisted. Given that the patient had symptoms consistent with viral meningitis with no evidence of etiology other than positive cytomegalovirus-DNA in his cerebrospinal fluid and cytomegalovirus pp65 antigenemia, cytomegalovirus meningitis was diagnosed. After commencing ganciclovir treatment, the patient's headache and febrile status rapidly improved.

The well-described immune abnormalities are not able to consistently explain these complications. Here, we report bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic dysfunction in early and late stage untreated CLL patients. Numbers of CD34(+) BM hematopoietic progenitors responsive in standard colony-forming unit (CFU) assays, including CFU-GM/GEMM and CFU-E, were significantly reduced. Flow cytometry revealed corresponding reductions in frequencies of all hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) subsets assessed in CLL patient marrow. Consistent with the reduction in HSPCs, BM resident monocytes and natural killer cells were reduced, a deficiency recapitulated in blood. Finally, we report increases in protein levels of the transcriptional regulators HIF-1alpha, GATA-1, PU.1, and GATA-2 in CLL patient BM, providing molecular insight into the basis of HSPC dysfunction. Importantly, PU.1 and GATA-2 were rapidly increased when healthy HSPCs were exposed in vitro to TNFalpha, a cytokine constitutively produced by CLL B cells. Together, these findings reveal BM hematopoietic dysfunction in untreated CLL patients that provides new insight into the etiology of the complex immunodeficiency state in CLL.","['Manso, Bryce A', 'Zhang, Henan', 'Mikkelson, Molly G', 'Gwin, Kimberly A', 'Secreto, Charla R', 'Ding, Wei', 'Parikh, Sameer A', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Medina, Kay L']","['Manso BA', 'Zhang H', 'Mikkelson MG', 'Gwin KA', 'Secreto CR', 'Ding W', 'Parikh SA', 'Kay NE', 'Medina KL']","['Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.

Here, we found, among well-established LSC markers, only CD123 and CD47 are correlated with AML cell chemosensitivities across cell lines and patient samples. Further study reveals that percentages of CD123(+)CD47(+) cells significantly increased in chemoresistant lines compared to parental cell lines. However, stemness signature genes are not significantly increased in resistant cells. Instead, gene changes are enriched in cell cycle and cell survival pathways. This suggests CD123 may serve as a biomarker for chemoresistance, but not stemness of AML cells. We further investigated the role of epigenetic factors in regulating the survival of chemoresistant leukemia cells. Epigenetic drugs, especially histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis), effectively induced apoptosis of chemoresistant cells. Furthermore, HDACi Romidepsin largely reversed gene expression profile of resistant cells and efficiently targeted and removed chemoresistant leukemia blasts in xenograft AML mouse model. More interestingly, Romidepsin preferentially targets CD123(+) cells, while chemotherapy drug Ara-C mainly targeted fast-growing, CD123(-) cells.

Being an important class of metabolites, alteration in free fatty acids (FFAs) levels play a key role in cancer development and progression. As they involve in cell signaling, maintain membrane integrity, regulate homeostasis and effect cell and tissue functions. Considering this fact, a comprehensive analysis of FFAs was conducted to monitor their alteration in AL, pre-leukaemic diseases and healthy control. Fifteen FFAs were analyzed in 179 serum samples of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), aplastic anemia (APA), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and healthy control using gas chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring-mass spectrometry (GC-MRM-MS). A multivariate statistical method of random forest (RF) was employed for chemometric analysis. Serum level of two FFAs including C18:0 and C14:0 were found discriminative among all five groups, and between ALL and AML, respectively. Moreover, C14:0 was identified as differentiated FFAs for systematic progression of pre-leukaemic conditions towards AML. C16:0 came as discriminated FFAs between APA and MDS/AML. Over all it was identified that FFAs profile not only become altered in leukaemia but also in pre-leukaemic diseases.","['Khalid, Ayesha', 'Siddiqui, Amna Jabbar', 'Huang, Jian-Hua', 'Shamsi, Tahir', 'Musharraf, Syed Ghulam']","['Khalid A', 'Siddiqui AJ', 'Huang JH', 'Shamsi T', 'Musharraf SG']","['H.E.J.

Intravenous immunoglobulin infusion, which is frequently used in supportive care, might facilitate passive transfer of anti-HBc. We aimed to estimate the probability of passive transfer of anti-HBc after intravenous immunoglobulin infusion in patients with cancer. METHODS: We reviewed institutional databases to identify adult patients who received outpatient chemotherapy between Jan 1, 2004, and Dec 31, 2011, at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. Eligible patients had received intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, had tested negative for both anti-HBc and HBsAg before infusion, and had been tested for anti-HBc after infusion. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who became positive for anti-HBc after intravenous immunoglobulin infusion. FINDINGS: 950 of 18 874 patients who underwent chemotherapy within the study time frame received intravenous immunoglobulin, of whom 870 had been tested for anti-HBc before infusion. 199 patients who were negative for anti-HBc before receiving intravenous immunoglobulin were retested after infusion, of whom 29 (15% [95% CI 10-20]) became positive for anti-HBc. The probability of anti-HBc conversion at 1 week after intravenous immunoglobulin infusion was 34% (95% CI 22-48) and at 12 weeks was 4% (2-7). INTERPRETATION: Conversion of patients from anti-HBc negativity to anti-HBc positivity was common after intravenous immunoglobulin administration. However, the probability of a positive test decreased with time since infusion. Positive anti-HBc tests done shortly after intravenous immunoglobulin infusion should be interpreted with caution because they might indicate passive transfer instead of true infection.

However, the poor water solubility and low bioavailability observed with oral BBR administration has limited its clinical use. Therefore, we design and develop a novel oil-in-water self-nanoemulsifying system for BBR (BBR SNE) to improve oral bioavailability and enhance BBR efficacy against acute myeloid leukemia by greatly improving its solubility. RESULTS: This system (size 23.50 +/- 1.67 nm, zeta potential - 3.35 +/- 0.03 mV) was prepared with RH40 (surfactant), 1,2-propanediol (co-surfactant), squalene (oil) and BBR using low-energy emulsification methods. The system loaded BBR successfully according to thermal gravimetric, differential scanning calorimetry, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses. The release profile results showed that BBR SNE released BBR more slowly than BBR solution. The relative oral bioavailability of this novel system in rabbits was significantly enhanced by 3.41-fold over that of BBR. Furthermore, Caco-2 cell monolayer transport studies showed that this system could help enhance permeation and prevent efflux of BBR. Importantly, mice with BBR SNE treatment had significantly longer survival time than BBR-treated mice (P < 0.001) in an MV4-11 engrafted leukemia murine model. CONCLUSIONS: These studies confirmed that BBR SNE is a promising therapy for acute myeloid leukemia.","['Li, Jieping', 'Yang, Li', 'Shen, Rui', 'Gong, Li', 'Tian, Zhiqiang', 'Qiu, Huarong', 'Shi, Zhe', 'Gao, Lichen', 'Sun, Hongwu', 'Zhang, Guangsen']","['Li J', 'Yang L', 'Shen R', 'Gong L', 'Tian Z', 'Qiu H', 'Shi Z', 'Gao L', 'Sun H', 'Zhang G']","[""Department of Hematology, Changsha Central Hospital, Changsha, 410004, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Changsha Central Hospital, Changsha, 410004, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Changsha Central Hospital, Changsha, 410004, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 401120, People's Republic of China."", ""Army Military Medical University of Chinese PLA, Chongqing, 400038, People's Republic of China."", ""Air Force Military Medical University of Chinese PLA, Xi'an, 710000, Shanxi, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Changsha Central Hospital, Changsha, 410004, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, Cancer Institute, Phase I Clinical Trial, Changsha Central Hospital, Changsha, 410004, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Army Military Medical University of Chinese PLA, Chongqing, 400038, People's Republic of China. sunhongwu2001@163.com."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, 410008, Hunan, People's Republic of China. zgsllzy@163.com.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181005,England,J Nanobiotechnology,Journal of nanobiotechnology,101152208,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Emulsions)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0I8Y3P32UF (Berberine)']",IM,"['*Absorption, Physiological', 'Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Berberine/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Liberation', 'Emulsions/*chemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Permeability', 'Phase Transition', 'Rabbits', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC6172716,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Berberine', 'Caco-2 monolayer transport', 'MV4-11', 'Self-nanoemulsifying system']",2018/10/07 06:00,2019/01/25 06:00,['2018/10/07 06:00'],"['2018/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12951-018-0402-x [doi]', '10.1186/s12951-018-0402-x [pii]']",epublish,J Nanobiotechnology. 2018 Oct 5;16(1):76. doi: 10.1186/s12951-018-0402-x.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4318-8424'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diels. APS-1II consists of arabinose (Ara), glucose (Glc) and fucose (Fuc) with a molar ratio of 2.48:1.05:1.00. The backbone of APS-1II is composed of 1,3-alpha-l-Araf and 1,6-alpha-d-Glcp with the branches containing 1,5-alpha-l-Araf, 1,4-beta-d-Glcp, T-beta-d-Glcp, 1,3-alpha-l-Fucp and T-alpha-l-Fucp. APS-1II inhibited the proliferation of human leukemia K562 and mouse L1210 cells in vitro and markedly prolonged the life span of L1210-bearing mice in vivo. APS-1II also increased the numbers of leukocytes and lymphocytes in peripheral blood, and significantly decreased plasma tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma levels in L1210-bearing mice. Moreover, APS-1II administration concentration-dependently promoted the proliferation of the splenocytes, enhanced phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophages and cytotoxicity of natural killer cells. These results suggest that APS-1II could effectively inhibit leukemia and induce a protective immune response, and it may be used as a suitable candidate reagent for leukemia therapy.","['Liu, Wenjuan', 'Li, Weiyan', 'Sui, Yi', 'Li, Xiao-Qiang', 'Liu, Caiqi', 'Jing, Hui', 'Zhang, Hongmei', 'Cao, Wei']","['Liu W', 'Li W', 'Sui Y', 'Li XQ', 'Liu C', 'Jing H', 'Zhang H', 'Cao W']","[""Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Natural Products & Chemical Biology, School of Chemistry & Pharmacy, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, China; Department of Natural Medicine & Institute of Materia Medica, School of Pharmacy, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an 710032,China; Key Laboratory of Gastrointestinal Pharmacology of Chinese Materia Medica of the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Xi'an 710032,China."", ""Department of Natural Medicine & Institute of Materia Medica, School of Pharmacy, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an 710032,China."", 'Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Natural Products & Chemical Biology, School of Chemistry & Pharmacy, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, China.', ""Key Laboratory of Gastrointestinal Pharmacology of Chinese Materia Medica of the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Xi'an 710032,China; Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an 710032,China."", 'Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Natural Products & Chemical Biology, School of Chemistry & Pharmacy, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, China.', ""Department of Natural Medicine & Institute of Materia Medica, School of Pharmacy, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an 710032,China."", 'Jinan Center for Food and Drug Control, Jinan 250020,China.', ""Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Natural Products & Chemical Biology, School of Chemistry & Pharmacy, Northwest A&F University, Yangling 712100, China; Department of Natural Medicine & Institute of Materia Medica, School of Pharmacy, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an 710032,China; Key Laboratory of Gastrointestinal Pharmacology of Chinese Materia Medica of the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Xi'an 710032,China.

Emerging evidence implicates a critical role for non-mutational drug resistance mechanisms underlying the survival of residual cancer 'persister' cells. Here, we utilized non-mutational imatinib-resistant K562/G cells to reveal SHP-2 as a resistance modulator of imatinib treatment response during the early phase. SHP-2 phosphorylation was significantly higher in K562/G cells than in sensitive K562 cells. In K562 cells, both short-term and long-term exposure to imatinib induced SHP-2 phosphorylation. Consistently, gain- and loss-of-function mutants in SHP-2 proved its regulation of imatinib resistance. SHP-2 inhibitor and imatinib exhibited a strong antitumor synergy in in vitro and in vivo K562/G models. Mechanistically, dual SHP-2 and BCR-ABL inhibition blocked RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways, respectively, leading to dramatic apoptotic death of K562/G cells. In conclusion, our results highlight that SHP-2 could be exploited as a biomarker and therapeutic target during the early phase of imatinib resistance development in CML.","['Li, Xin', 'Pang, Juan', 'Xue, Wenwen', 'Wang, Yixuan', 'Tian, Tian', 'Elgehama, Ahmed', 'Wu, Xuefeng', 'Wu, Xudong', 'Sun, Yang', 'Qiu, Hongxia', 'Shen, Yan', 'Xu, Qiang']","['Li X', 'Pang J', 'Xue W', 'Wang Y', 'Tian T', 'Elgehama A', 'Wu X', 'Wu X', 'Sun Y', 'Qiu H', 'Shen Y', 'Xu Q']","['State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China.

The aim of our study was to investigate the primary causes of anemia and/or macrocytosis of uncertain etiology. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, prospective study over 4 months in three hematology laboratories. In step 1, we used an automated informatics system to screen 137 453 hemograms for cases of anemia and/or macrocytosis (n = 2702). In step 2, we excluded all patients whose anemia appeared to be due to a known cause. This left 290 patients had anemia of uncertain etiology. In step 3, we conducted further investigations, including a peripheral blood smear, and analysis of iron, vitamin B12, folate, and thyroid hormone levels. RESULTS: A differential diagnosis was obtained in 139 patients (48%). The primary causes of anemia were iron deficiency (n = 59) and megaloblastic anemia (n = 39). In total, 25 hematologic disorders were diagnosed, including 14 patients with MDS (56%). The median age of MDS patients was 80 years, 12 had anemia as an isolated cytopenia, and most (n = 10) had lower-risk disease (IPSS-R </= 3.5). SF3B1 mutations were most frequent (n = 6) and correlated with the presence of ring sideroblasts (100%) and associated with better prognosis (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our prospective, four-step approach is an efficient and logical strategy to facilitate the diagnosis of MDS on the basis of unexplained anemia and/or macrocytosis, and may allow the early diagnosis of the most serious causes of anemia. Molecular analysis of genes related to MDS could be a promising diagnostic and prognostic approach.","['Bastida, Jose Maria', 'Lopez-Godino, Oriana', 'Vicente-Sanchez, Ana', 'Bonanad-Boix, Santiago', 'Xicoy-Cirici, Blanca', 'Hernandez-Sanchez, Jesus M', 'Such, Esperanza', 'Cervera, Jose', 'Caballero-Berrocal, Juan C', 'Lopez-Cadenas, Felix', 'Arnao-Herraiz, Mario', 'Rodriguez, Ines', 'Llopis-Calatayud, Inmaculada', 'Jimenez, Maria J', 'Del Canizo-Roldan, Maria Consuelo', 'Diez-Campelo, Maria']","['Bastida JM', 'Lopez-Godino O', 'Vicente-Sanchez A', 'Bonanad-Boix S', 'Xicoy-Cirici B', 'Hernandez-Sanchez JM', 'Such E', 'Cervera J', 'Caballero-Berrocal JC', 'Lopez-Cadenas F', 'Arnao-Herraiz M', 'Rodriguez I', 'Llopis-Calatayud I', 'Jimenez MJ', 'Del Canizo-Roldan MC', 'Diez-Campelo M']","['Hematology, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca-IBSAL, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hematology, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca-IBSAL, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hematology, Hospital de la Ribera, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hematology, Hospital de la Ribera, Valencia, Spain.', ""Institut Catala d'Oncologia, Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Badalona, Spain."", 'Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca, IBMCC, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hematology, Laboratorio de Citogenetica y Biologia Molecular, Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hematology, Laboratorio de Citogenetica y Biologia Molecular, Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hematology, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca-IBSAL, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hematology, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca-IBSAL, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hematology, Hospital de la Ribera, Valencia, Spain.', ""Institut Catala d'Oncologia, Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Badalona, Spain."", 'Hematology, Hospital de la Ribera, Valencia, Spain.', ""Institut Catala d'Oncologia, Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Badalona, Spain."", 'Hematology, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca-IBSAL, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hematology, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca-IBSAL, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20181005,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA Splicing Factors)', '0 (SF3B1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia/complications/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Anemia, Macrocytic', 'Anemia, Megaloblastic', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/*diagnosis', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics', 'Prospective Studies', 'RNA Splicing Factors/genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['anemia', 'hemogram', 'macrocytosis', 'mutation analysis', 'myelodysplastic syndrome']",2018/10/06 06:00,2019/03/21 06:00,['2018/10/06 06:00'],"['2018/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/30 00:00 [revised]', '2018/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12933 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2019 Feb;41(1):109-117. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12933.

Ex vivo manipulation of HSCs to improve their engraftment ability becomes necessary when the number or quality of donor HSCs is a limiting factor. Due to their hematopoiesis-supportive ability, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been traditionally used as feeder layers for ex vivo expansion of HSCs. MSCs form a special HSC-niche in vivo, implying that signaling mechanisms operative in them would affect HSC fate. We have recently demonstrated that AKT signaling prevailing in the MSCs affect the HSC functionality. Here we show that MSCs primed with nitric oxide donor, Sodium nitroprusside (SNP), significantly boost the engraftment potential of the HSCs co-cultured with them via intercellular transfer of microvesicles (MVs) harboring mRNAs encoding HSC-supportive genes. Our data suggest that these MVs could be used as HSC-priming agents to improve transplantation efficacy.

Herein we describe interruptions, discontinuations and switching of TKI therapy during the initial 2 years of treatment among 1121 patients prospectively enrolled between October 1, 2010 and March 7, 2017. Patient characteristics were broadly similar between the imatinib (n = 370), dasatinib (n = 376), and nilotinib (n = 375) cohorts. Treatment interruptions occurred in 16.4% (year 1) and 4.0% (year 2) of patients, mainly attributed to hematologic intolerances. Treatment discontinuations occurred in 21.8% (year 1) and 10.2% (year 2) of patients, with the highest rate within the first 3 months for intolerance. Switching of TKI was seen in 17.8% (year 1) and 9.5% (year 2) of patients. Significant associations were found between TKI switching and female gender (year 1), age >/=65 years at diagnosis (year 2) and treatment with imatinib (year 2). Intolerance was the most common reason given for patients discontinuing and for switching TKI therapy; however resistance was also cited. Lack of response monitoring in routine clinical practice may have resulted in lower identification of resistance in this dataset. Data from SIMPLICITY suggest that, in routine clinical practice, intolerance and resistance to TKIs influence decisions to change treatment. Changes in TKI therapy are frequent, with nearly a third of patients discontinuing their first-line TKI.","['Hehlmann, Rudiger', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Zyczynski, Teresa', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo', 'Goldberg, Stuart L', 'Mauro, Michael J', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Simonsson, Bengt', 'Williams, Loretta A', 'Gajavelli, Srikanth', 'DeGutis, Irene', 'Sen, Ginny P', 'Paquette, Ron L']","['Hehlmann R', 'Cortes JE', 'Zyczynski T', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C', 'Goldberg SL', 'Mauro MJ', 'Michallet M', 'Simonsson B', 'Williams LA', 'Gajavelli S', 'DeGutis I', 'Sen GP', 'Paquette RL']","['Universitat Heidelberg and ELN-Foundation, Weinheim, Germany.', 'The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, New Jersey.', 'University of Milano Bicocca, San Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Italy.', 'John Theurer Cancer Center, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey.', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Centre Hospitalier Lyon-Sud, Pierre-Benite, France.', 'Uppsala Universitet, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, New Jersey.', 'Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, New Jersey.', 'ICON Clinical Research LLC, South San Francisco, California.', 'UCLA Medical Centre, Los Angeles, California.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Bristol-Myers Squibb/International']","['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181031,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Dasatinib/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Disease Management', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Substitution', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy', 'Male', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases/chemically induced', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/chemically induced', 'United States']",PMC6587733,,,2018/10/06 06:00,2019/11/13 06:00,['2018/10/06 06:00'],"['2018/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/28 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/13 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25306 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2019 Jan;94(1):46-54. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25306.

It has been reported that mutations in PML-RARA confer resistance to ATRA and ATO, and are associated with poor prognosis. Although most PML-RARA mutations were point mutations, we identified a novel seven amino acid deletion mutation (p.K227_T233del) in the RARA region of PML-RARA in a refractory APL patient. Here, we analyzed the evolution of the mutated clone and demonstrated the resistance of the mutated clone to retinoic acid (RA). Mutation analysis of PML-RARA was performed using samples from a chemotherapy- and ATRA-resistant APL patient, and the frequencies of mutated PML-RARA transcript were analyzed by targeted deep sequencing. To clarify the biological significance of the identified PML-RARA mutations, we analyzed the ATRA-induced differentiation and PML nuclear body formation in mutant PML-RARA-transduced HL-60 cells. At molecular relapse, the p.K227_T233del deletion and the p.R217S point-mutation in the RARA region of PML-RARA were identified, and their frequencies increased after re-induction therapy with another type of retinoiec acid (RA), tamibarotene. In deletion PML-RARA-transduced cells, the CD11b expression levels and NBT reducing ability were significantly decreased compared with control cells and the formation of PML nuclear bodies was rarely observed after RA treatment. These results indicate that this deletion mutation was closely associated with the disease progression during RA treatment.","['Hattori, Hikaru', 'Ishikawa, Yuichi', 'Kawashima, Naomi', 'Akashi, Akimi', 'Yamaguchi, Yohei', 'Harada, Yasuhiko', 'Hirano, Daiki', 'Adachi, Yoshiya', 'Miyao, Kotaro', 'Ushijima, Yoko', 'Terakura, Seitaro', 'Nishida, Tetsuya', 'Matsushita, Tadashi', 'Kiyoi, Hitoshi']","['Hattori H', 'Ishikawa Y', 'Kawashima N', 'Akashi A', 'Yamaguchi Y', 'Harada Y', 'Hirano D', 'Adachi Y', 'Miyao K', 'Ushijima Y', 'Terakura S', 'Nishida T', 'Matsushita T', 'Kiyoi H']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Technique, Nagoya University Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine, Nagoya University Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181005,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (ITGAM protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['CD11b Antigen/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Progression', 'Down-Regulation', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Point Mutation', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",PMC6173414,,,2018/10/06 06:00,2019/03/23 06:00,['2018/10/06 06:00'],"['2018/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0204850 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-06779 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2018 Oct 5;13(10):e0204850. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0204850. eCollection 2018.,['ORCID: 0000-0001-6024-6617'],"['We have the following interests: Hitoshi Kiyoi received research funding, which', 'is unrelated to this study, from Chugai Pharmaceutical Co.

Mutations of RUNX1 gene can lead to acute leukemia and affect the prognosis of AML patients. We aimed to identify pivotal genes and pathways involved in RUNX1-mutated patients of with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and to explore possible molecular markers for novel therapeutic targets of the disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS The RNA sequencing datasets of 151 cases of AML were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using edgeR of the R platform. PPI (protein-protein interaction) network clustering modules were analyzed with ClusterONE, and the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway enrichment analyses for modules were performed. RESULTS A total of 379 genes were identified as DEGs. The KEGG enrichment analysis of DEGs showed significantly enriched pathways in cancer, extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction pathway, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling pathway. The top 10 genes ranked by degree were PRKACG, ANKRD7, RNFL7, ROPN11, TEX14, PRMT8, OTOA, CFAP99, NRXN1, and DMRT1, which were identified as hub genes from the protein-protein interaction network (PPI). Statistical analysis revealed that RUNX1-mutated patients with AML had a shorter median survival time (MST) with poor clinical outcome and an increased risk of death when compared with those without RUNX1 mutations. CONCLUSIONS DEGs and pathways identified in the present study will help understand the molecular mechanisms underlying RUNX1 mutations in AML and develop effective therapeutic strategies for RUNX1-mutation AML.","['Zhu, Fangxiao', 'Huang, Rui', 'Li, Jing', 'Liao, Xiwen', 'Huang, Yumei', 'Lai, Yongrong']","['Zhu F', 'Huang R', 'Li J', 'Liao X', 'Huang Y', 'Lai Y']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, China (mainland).', 'Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical College, Guilin, Guangxi, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, China (mainland).', 'Department of Oncology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, China (mainland).']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181005,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Protein Interaction Maps', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA/methods', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Transcriptome/genetics']",PMC6186152,,,2018/10/06 06:00,2018/12/18 06:00,['2018/10/06 06:00'],"['2018/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['910916 [pii]', '10.12659/MSM.910916 [doi]']",epublish,Med Sci Monit. 2018 Oct 5;24:7100-7108. doi: 10.12659/MSM.910916.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, aging progressively decreases the proliferative and differentiation potential of MSCs and diminishes their regenerative capacity, which represents a limiting factor for their endogenous use in elderly patients. Therefore, tissue regeneration therapy with MSCs in this age group may require a cellular source without the physiological limitations that MSCs exhibit in aging. In this sense, exogenous or allogeneic MSCs could have a better chance of success in regenerating periodontal tissue in elderly patients.

In this 7-year-old, it was documented to have occurred within a year of ataxia presentation. The instigating cancer was stage III adrenal adenocarcinoma, remitted after surgical resection at age 2. When her severe ataxia progressed, neuroinflammation was characterized by high cerebrospinal fluid Purkinje cell cytoplasmic antibody type 1 titers, oligoclonal bands, and neurofilament light chain. The immunotherapy strategy was to replace IV methylprednisolone, which lowered Purkinje cell cytoplasmic antibody type 1 titers without clinical improvement, with induction of adrenocorticotropic hormone/intravenous immunoglobulin/rituximab (ACTH/IVIG/rituximab) combination immunotherapy, ACTH/dexamethasone transition, and intravenous immunoglobulin maintenance. She became self-ambulatory and cerebrospinal fluid inflammatory markers regressed. Down syndrome predisposed her to a second cancer, pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 4 years later. Despite reversible cytosine arabinoside-provoked cerebellar toxicity, the ataxia is stable on monthly intravenous immunoglobulin without relapse, now 5 years after initial diagnosis. This report illustrates the use of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers to detect, target, and monitor neuroinflammation, and successful combinations of immunotherapy to better the quality of life.","['Philipps, Guillermo', 'Tate, Elizabeth D', 'Pranzatelli, Michael R']","['Philipps G', 'Tate ED', 'Pranzatelli MR']","[""Department of Pediatric Neurology, Golisano Children's Hospital of Southwest FL, Fort Myers, FL, USA."", 'National Pediatric Myoclonus Center and National Pediatric Neuroinflammation Organization, Inc., Orlando, FL, USA.', 'National Pediatric Myoclonus Center and National Pediatric Neuroinflammation Organization, Inc., Orlando, FL, USA.', 'National Pediatric Myoclonus Center and National Pediatric Neuroinflammation Organization, Inc., Orlando, FL, USA.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20181001,United States,Child Neurol Open,Child neurology open,101691975,,,,PMC6168721,['NOTNLM'],"['ANNA-1 (Hu) syndrome', 'Down syndrome', 'OMS', 'PCA-1 syndrome', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'adrenocortical carcinoma', 'cytosine arabinoside-induced ataxia', 'pediatric neuroinflammatory disorders', 'pediatric paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration']",2018/10/06 06:00,2018/10/06 06:01,['2018/10/06 06:00'],"['2018/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/28 00:00 [revised]', '2018/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2329048X18795546 [doi]', '10.1177_2329048X18795546 [pii]']",epublish,Child Neurol Open. 2018 Oct 1;5:2329048X18795546. doi: 10.1177/2329048X18795546. eCollection 2018.,,"['Declaration of Conflicting Interests: The author(s) declared no potential', 'conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or', 'publication of this article.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously we reported the effectiveness of combination immunotherapies that centre on 4-1BB-targeted co-stimulation of CD8 + T cells, particularly when simultaneously harnessing the immune adjuvant properties of Natural Killer T (NKT) cells. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of agonistic anti-4-1BB antibody-based combination therapy against two aggressive forms of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Anti-4-1BB treatment alone resulted in transient suppression of established AML-ETO9a tumor growth in 50% of mice, however the majority of these mice subsequently succumbed to disease. Combining alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer)-loaded tumor cell vaccination with anti-4-1BB antibody treatment increased the proportion of responding mice to 100%, and protection led to long-term, tumor-free survival, demonstrating complete eradication of AML. This finding was extended to established mixed lymphocytic leukemia (MLL)-AF9 tumors, whereby vaccine plus anti-4-1BB combination similarly resulted in 100% protection. The addition of anti-PD-1 to anti-4-1BB treatment, although improving survival outcomes compared to anti-4-1BB alone, was not as effective as NKT cell vaccination. The effectiveness of 4-1BB combination therapies was dependent on IFN-gamma signaling within host cells, but not tumors. Vaccine plus anti-4-1BB therapy elicited potent generation of functional effector and memory CD8 + T cells in all tumor-associated organs. Therapy induced KLRG1+ effector CD8 T cells were the most effective at controlling disease. We show that combining NKT cell-targeting vaccination with anti-4-1BB provides excellent therapeutic responses against AML and MLL in mice, and these results will guide ongoing efforts in finding immunotherapeutic solutions against acute myeloid leukemias.","['Kerage, Daniel', 'Soon, Megan S F', 'Doff, Brianna L', 'Kobayashi, Takumi', 'Nissen, Michael D', 'Lam, Pui Yeng', 'Leggatt, Graham R', 'Mattarollo, Stephen R']","['Kerage D', 'Soon MSF', 'Doff BL', 'Kobayashi T', 'Nissen MD', 'Lam PY', 'Leggatt GR', 'Mattarollo SR']","['The University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, The University of Queensland, Woolloongabba, Queensland, Australia.', 'The University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, The University of Queensland, Woolloongabba, Queensland, Australia.', 'The University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, The University of Queensland, Woolloongabba, Queensland, Australia.', 'The University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, The University of Queensland, Woolloongabba, Queensland, Australia.', 'The University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, The University of Queensland, Woolloongabba, Queensland, Australia.', 'The University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, The University of Queensland, Woolloongabba, Queensland, Australia.', 'The University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, The University of Queensland, Woolloongabba, Queensland, Australia.', 'The University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, The University of Queensland, Woolloongabba, Queensland, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180726,United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,,,,PMC6169580,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*CD8 T cells', '*NKT cells', '*alpha-galactosylceramide', '*anti-4-1BB', '*anti-PD-1', '*cancer vaccine', '*immunotherapy', '*mixed lineage leukemia', '*monoclonal antibody']",2018/10/06 06:00,2018/10/06 06:01,['2018/10/06 06:00'],"['2018/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/04 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/2162402X.2018.1486952 [doi]', '1486952 [pii]']",epublish,Oncoimmunology. 2018 Jul 26;7(10):e1486952. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2018.1486952. eCollection 2018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Data on cancer incidence and mortality were obtained from the GLOBOCAN project (only high-quality data, C3, or higher according to GLOBOCAN quality label), information on the number of RTMs from the Directory of Radiotherapy Centers database, and remaining data from the World Bank and World Health Organization database. We used linear regression models to assess the associations between RTM per 10,000,000 inhabitants (logarithmized) and the log-transformed mortality/incidence ratio. Models were adjusted for public health variables. To assess the bias due to unobserved confounders, mortality from leukemia was considered as a negative control. Here radiotherapy treatment is less frequently applied, but a common set of confounders is shared with cancer types where radiotherapy plays a stronger role, enabling us to estimate the bias due to confounding of unmeasured parameters. To assess an exposure-effect size relationship, estimated cancer type-specific estimates were related to the proportion of subjects receiving radiotherapy. Results: We found an inverse linear relationship between RTM in the population and the cancer mortality to incidence ratio for prostate cancer (14.1% per doubling of RTM; 95% CI: 0.1%-26.1%), female breast cancer (12.3%; 95% CI: 2.7%-20.9%), and lung cancer in women (11.2%; 95% CI: 4.3%-17.6%). There was no evidence for bias due to unobserved confounders after covariate adjustment. For women, an exposure-effect size relationship was found (P=0.02). Conclusion: In this ecological study, we found evidence that the population density of RTM is related to cancer mortality independently of other public health parameters.","['Medenwald, Daniel', 'Vordermark, Dirk', 'Dietzel, Christian T']","['Medenwald D', 'Vordermark D', 'Dietzel CT']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Halle (Saale), Halle (Saale), Germany, daniel.medenwald@uk-halle.de.', 'Institute of Medical Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Informatics, Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg, Halle (Saale), Germany, daniel.medenwald@uk-halle.de.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Halle (Saale), Halle (Saale), Germany, daniel.medenwald@uk-halle.de.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Halle (Saale), Halle (Saale), Germany, daniel.medenwald@uk-halle.de.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180921,New Zealand,Clin Epidemiol,Clinical epidemiology,101531700,,,,PMC6163015,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer mortality', 'negative controls', 'population', 'radiotherapy machines']",2018/10/06 06:00,2018/10/06 06:01,['2018/10/06 06:00'],"['2018/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CLEP.S156764 [doi]', 'clep-10-1249 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Epidemiol. 2018 Sep 21;10:1249-1273. doi: 10.2147/CLEP.S156764. eCollection 2018.,,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to the lack of direct comparison of high-dose imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib, we summarized the evidence to indirectly compare the efficacy among these treatment options. Methods: In total, 14 randomized clinical trials including 5,630 patients were analyzed by direct and mixed-treatment comparisons. Outcomes assessed were the following: complete cytogenetic response at 12 months; major molecular response at 12, 24, and 36 months; deep molecular response at 12, 24, 36, and 60 months; early molecular response at 3 months; progression-free survival (PFS); overall survival (OS); and Grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs). Results: The Bayesian network meta-analysis demonstrated that high-dose imatinib was less effective than all new-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors and had a higher probability of Grade 3 or 4 AEs. For molecular response, 300 mg of nilotinib was likely to be the preferred frontline treatment, as demonstrated by higher response rates and faster, deeper, and longer molecular response. For PFS and OS, there were high likelihoods (79% and 74%, respectively) that 400 mg of nilotinib was the preferred option. For AEs, standard-dose imatinib has the highest probability (65%) of being the most favorable toxicity profile. Conclusion: Considering the efficacy and toxicity profile, it is not recommended to use high-dose imatinib for treatment. This analysis also showed that nilotinib has the highest probability to become the preferred frontline agents for treating CML.","['Chen, Kang-Kang', 'Du, Tai-Feng', 'Wu, Ku-Sheng', 'Yang, Wei']","['Chen KK', 'Du TF', 'Wu KS', 'Yang W']","['Department of Preventive Medicine and MPH Education Center, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine and MPH Education Center, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Administrative Office, Shantou University Medical College Cancer Hospital, Shantou, Guangdong Province, China, yangwei_98@sina.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180925,New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,,,,PMC6163008,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'bosutinib', 'dasatinib', 'imatinib', 'nilotinib', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2018/10/06 06:00,2018/10/06 06:01,['2018/10/06 06:00'],"['2018/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S177566 [doi]', 'cmar-10-3891 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2018 Sep 25;10:3891-3910. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S177566. eCollection 2018.,,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, they have been highlighted as attractive targets for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and chronic myeloid leukemia. The PPAR agonist structure is consists of a polar head, a hydrophobic tail, and a linker. Each part interacts with PPARs through hydrogen bonds or hydrophobic interactions to stabilize target protein conformation, thus increasing its activity. Acidic head is essential for PPAR agonist activity. The aromatic linker plays an important role in making hydrophobic interactions with PPAR as well as adjusting the head-to-tail distance and conformation of the whole molecule. By tuning the scaffold of compound, the whole molecule could fit into the ligand-binding domain to achieve proper binding mode. We modified indol-3-ylacetic acid scaffold to (indol-1-ylmethyl)benzoic acid, whereas 2,4-dichloroanilide was fixed as the hydrophobic tail. We designed, synthesized, and assayed the in vitro activity of novel indole compounds with (indol-1-ylmethyl)benzoic acid scaffold. Compound 12 was a more potent PPAR-gamma agonist than pioglitazone and our previous hit compound. Molecular docking studies may suggest the binding between compound 12 and PPAR-gamma, rationalizing its high activity.","['Gim, Hyo Jin', 'Choi, Yong-Sung', 'Li, Hua', 'Kim, Yoon-Jung', 'Ryu, Jae-Ha', 'Jeon, Raok']","['Gim HJ', 'Choi YS', 'Li H', 'Kim YJ', 'Ryu JH', 'Jeon R']","[""Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Sookmyung Women's University, Cheongpa-ro 47-gil 100, Yongsan-gu, Seoul 04310, Korea. hjgim83@gmail.com."", ""Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Sookmyung Women's University, Cheongpa-ro 47-gil 100, Yongsan-gu, Seoul 04310, Korea. uriys2@gmail.com."", ""Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Sookmyung Women's University, Cheongpa-ro 47-gil 100, Yongsan-gu, Seoul 04310, Korea. cooldog227@hotmail.com."", ""Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Sookmyung Women's University, Cheongpa-ro 47-gil 100, Yongsan-gu, Seoul 04310, Korea. yoonjungkim73@gmail.com."", ""Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Sookmyung Women's University, Cheongpa-ro 47-gil 100, Yongsan-gu, Seoul 04310, Korea. ryuha@sookmyung.ac.kr."", ""Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Sookmyung Women's University, Cheongpa-ro 47-gil 100, Yongsan-gu, Seoul 04310, Korea. rjeon@sookmyung.ac.kr.""]",['eng'],"['No. 2011-0030074/National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)', '2014R1A2A1A11052761/National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)', 'NRF-2016R1A6A3A11932164/National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)', 'NRF-2017R1A6A3A11034603/National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)']",['Journal Article'],20181004,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (PPAR gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzoates/chemistry', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Indoles/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'PPAR gamma/*agonists/chemistry/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', '*Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship']",PMC6213020,['NOTNLM'],"['PPAR', 'agonist', 'indole', 'scaffold', 'tuning']",2018/10/06 06:00,2019/01/02 06:00,['2018/10/06 06:00'],"['2018/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/27 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/02 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms19103032 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms19103032 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2018 Oct 4;19(10). pii: ijms19103032. doi: 10.3390/ijms19103032.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We prospectively investigated the predictive value of somatic mutations, and biomarkers of ineffective erythropoiesis including the flow cytometry RED score, serum growth-differentiation factor-15, and hepcidin levels. Inclusion criteria were no prior treatment with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndrome according to the International Prognostic Scoring System, and a hemoglobin level <10 g/dL. Patients could be red blood cell transfusion-dependent or not and were given epoetin zeta 40 000 IU/week. Serum erythropoietin level, iron parameters, hepcidin, flow cytometry Ogata and RED scores, and growth-differentiation factor-15 levels were determined at baseline, and molecular analysis by next-generation sequencing was also conducted. Erythroid response (defined according to the International Working Group 2006 criteria) was assessed at week 12. Seventy patients, with a median age of 78 years, were included in the study. There were 22 patients with refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia, 19 with refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia, 14 with refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts, four with refractory anemia with excess blasts-1, six with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, two with del5q-and three with unclassifiable myelodysplastic syndrome. According to the revised International Prognostic Scoring System, 13 had very low risk, 47 had low risk, nine intermediate risk and one had high-risk disease. Twenty patients were transfusion dependent. Forty-eight percent had an erythroid response and the median duration of the response was 26 months. At baseline, non-responders had significantly higher RED scores and lower hepcidin:ferritin ratios. In multivariate analysis, only a RED score >4 (P=0.05) and a hepcidin:ferritin ratio <9 (P=0.02) were statistically significantly associated with worse erythroid response. The median response duration was shorter in patients with growth-differentiation factor-15 >2000 pg/mL and a hepcidin:ferritin ratio <9 (P=0.0008 and P=0.01, respectively). In multivariate analysis, both variables were associated with shorter response duration. Erythroid response to epoetin zeta was similar to that obtained with other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and was correlated with higher baseline hepcidin:ferritin ratio and lower RED score.

PI3K-delta,gamma signaling can promote B-cell proliferation and survival in clonal B-cell malignancies, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). In a phase 1 study, duvelisib showed clinically meaningful activity and acceptable safety in CLL/SLL patients. We report here the results of DUO, a global phase 3 randomized study of duvelisib vs ofatumumab monotherapy for patients with relapsed or refractory (RR) CLL/SLL. Patients were randomized 1:1 to oral duvelisib 25 mg twice daily (n = 160) or ofatumumab IV (n = 159). The study met the primary study end point by significantly improving progression-free survival per independent review committee assessment compared with ofatumumab for all patients (median, 13.3 months vs 9.9 months; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.52; P < .0001), including those with high-risk chromosome 17p13.1 deletions [del(17p)] and/or TP53 mutations (HR = 0.40; P = .0002). The overall response rate was significantly higher with duvelisib (74% vs 45%; P < .0001) regardless of del(17p) status. The most common adverse events were diarrhea, neutropenia, pyrexia, nausea, anemia, and cough on the duvelisib arm, and neutropenia and infusion reactions on the ofatumumab arm. The DUO trial data support duvelisib as a potentially effective treatment option for patients with RR CLL/SLL.

We hypothesized that individuals with MPM may have increased predisposition to developing internal malignancies. OBJECTIVE: To identify the risk of subsequent malignancies in MPM patients. METHODS: Multiple primary standardized incidence ratios were analyzed for individuals with >/=1, >/=2 and >/=3 primary melanomas (PM) in the SEER database from 1973-2014. RESULTS: 223,799 individuals with >/=1, 19,709 with >/=2 and 3,995 with >/=3 PM were identified. Risks of subsequent internal malignancy increased with number of PM, with observed to expected (O/E) ratios of 0.99, 1.14, and 1.23 (p<0.05) for patients with at least one, two and three PM respectively. Internal malignancy was higher in younger MPM patients and those with superficial spreading melanoma. The most common malignancies amongst MPM patients include breast, prostate, thyroid, soft tissue, brain, kidney, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Risk of subsequent cutaneous melanoma increased with O/E ratios of 8.09, to 22.52, to 41.03 (p<0.05) respectively. LIMITATIONS: SEER records limited information about pigmentation phenotypes, histology, and treatments. CONCLUSION: Patients with MPM have increased risk of subsequent internal and cutaneous malignancies and may benefit from tight adherence to age-specific cancer screening.","['Cai, Emily D', 'Swetter, Susan M', 'Sarin, Kavita Y']","['Cai ED', 'Swetter SM', 'Sarin KY']","['Department of Dermatology, Stanford University Medical Center, Redwood City, CA.', 'Department of Dermatology, Stanford University Medical Center, Redwood City, CA; Dermatology Service, Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto, CA.', 'Department of Dermatology, Stanford University Medical Center, Redwood City, CA.

Since the introduction of the first-in-class PIs bortezomib, the therapeutic landscape for multiple myeloma has shifted with the development of next-generation PIs (carfilzomib and ixazomib) and new classes of agents. Treatment with modern combination therapies has been shown to result in deep responses and improved outcomes, and these potent regimens are increasingly used as frontline therapy. As patients continue to live longer with modern frontline therapy, there will be an increased need for effective regimens after initial treatment failure. Several recent studies have shown that treatment with combination therapy incorporating PIs induces deep and durable responses in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma. In this review, we review pivotal data and discuss the role of PIs-based doublet and triplet regimens for the management of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma in the era of modern combination therapy.","['Leleu, Xavier', 'Martin, Thomas G', 'Einsele, Hermann', 'Lyons, Roger M', 'Durie, Brian G M', 'Iskander, Karim S', 'Ailawadhi, Sikander']","['Leleu X', 'Martin TG', 'Einsele H', 'Lyons RM', 'Durie BGM', 'Iskander KS', 'Ailawadhi S']","['Department of Hematology, CHU la Miletrie and Inserm CIC 1402, Poitiers, France.

This study included 10 cases of canine IVL restricted to the CNS. Dogs had an average age of 8 years and neurological signs mainly referred to brain involvement such as depression, seizures, and ambulatory deficits. Gross examination at necropsy showed focal extensive or multiple hemorrhagic areas mainly distributed in the telencephalon and diencephalon. Histopathologically, numerous veins and capillaries were filled with neoplastic lymphoid cells, accompanied by edema, hemorrhage, and thrombosis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CD3, CD20, and PAX5 was performed to phenotype the neoplastic lymphocytes. IHC for CD44 and CD29 were used to investigate the pathogenetic mechanism leading to the intravascular aggregation of the neoplastic lymphocytes. The same IHC panel was applied to 8 cases of primary and metastatic canine CNS lymphoma in order to compare IVL immunoreactivity. Three IVLs were typified as T-cell, 3 as B-cell, and 4 as non-T non-B. Neoplastic lymphocytes showed marked expression of CD44 in all IVL cases, and CD29-immunolabeled cells were observed in 4 IVLs. CD44 immunoreactivity was consistent with the findings reported in human IVL, suggesting a predisposition to the formation of lymphocyte aggregates. CD29 was inconsistently immunonegative in canine IVL, confirming only partially the pathogenetic mechanism suggested for the human counterpart.","[""Degl'Innocenti, Sara"", 'Camera, Nicola Della', 'Falzone, Cristian', 'Cantile, Carlo']","[""Degl'Innocenti S"", 'Camera ND', 'Falzone C', 'Cantile C']","['1 Department of Veterinary Science, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', '1 Department of Veterinary Science, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', '2 Pedrani Veterinary Clinic, Zugliano, Vicenza, Italy.', '1 Department of Veterinary Science, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181005,United States,Vet Pathol,Veterinary pathology,0312020,,IM,"['Animals', 'Brain/pathology', 'Brain Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*veterinary', 'Cerebral Veins/pathology', 'Dog Diseases/diagnostic imaging/*pathology', 'Dogs', 'Female', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Lymphoma/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*veterinary', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging/veterinary', 'Male', 'Neuroimaging/veterinary', 'Vascular Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/pathology/*veterinary']",,['NOTNLM'],"['CD20', 'CD29', 'CD3', 'CD44', 'PAX5', 'brain', 'dogs', 'intravascular lymphoma']",2018/10/06 06:00,2019/05/08 06:00,['2018/10/06 06:00'],"['2018/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/08 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/0300985818806059 [doi]'],ppublish,Vet Pathol. 2019 Mar;56(2):239-243. doi: 10.1177/0300985818806059.

The Transducin-like enhancer of split 1 (TLE1), a transcriptional corepressor, has been described as dysregulated and recently emerged as a tumor marker in several cancer types, including hematologic malignancies. METHODS: In the present study TLE1 gene expression was evaluated by RT-qPCR. A total of 60 consecutive pathological ALL samples and 8 normal bone marrow samples were included. Associations between TLE1 levels and clinicopathological features were estimated using Mann-Whitney tests. RESULTS: TLE1 mRNA levels were significantly diminished in ALL samples when compared to normal counterparts (fold change -1.45, p-value 0.039). Lower TLE1 expression levels were associated with poorer prognostic features such as age at diagnosis (<1 or >9 years-old), absence of the Common Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Antigen (CALLA) and high white cell count. Considering immunophenotype, decreased expression of TLE1 was only evident for T-cell ALL, what was validated using gene expression profiling data available in public repositories. No associations with event or overall survival were observed. However, TLE1 expression was statistically different between patients who achieved complete clinical remission (CCR) from those that relapsed or died. CONCLUSION: These data are of particular interest and give support for a plausible role of TLE1 as a tumor suppressor in T-cell ALL. Moreover, the prognostic value of this corepressor may assist ALL treatment stratification and suggest the need of alternative regimens.","['Brassesco, Maria Sol', 'Pezuk, Julia Alejandra', 'Cortez, Maria Angelica', 'Bezerra Salomao, Karina', 'Scrideli, Carlos Alberto', 'Tone, Luiz Gonzaga']","['Brassesco MS', 'Pezuk JA', 'Cortez MA', 'Bezerra Salomao K', 'Scrideli CA', 'Tone LG']","['Department of Biology, Faculty of Philosophy, Sciences and Letters at Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.

The Canadian Consortium on MDS, comprised of hematologists from across Canada with a clinical and academic interest in MDS, reconvened to update these guidelines. A literature search was updated in 2017; topics reviewed include mechanisms of iron overload induced cellular damage, evidence for clinical endpoints impacted by iron overload including organ dysfunction, infections, marrow failure, overall survival, acute myeloid leukemia progression, and endpoints around hematopoietic stem-cell transplant. Evidence for an impact of iron reduction on the same endpoints is discussed, guidelines are updated, and areas identified where evidence is suboptimal.

Although PGCs are unipotent cells in vivo, they are reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), also known as embryonic germ cells (EGCs), in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in vitro. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for their reprogramming are not fully understood. Here we show identification of transcription factors that mediate PGC reprogramming. We selected genes encoding transcription factors or epigenetic regulatory factors whose expression was significantly different between PGCs and PSCs with in silico analysis and RT-qPCR. Among the candidate genes, over-expression (OE) of Bcl3 or Klf9 significantly enhanced PGC reprogramming. Notably, EGC formation was stimulated by Klf9-OE even without bFGF. G-protein-coupled receptor signaling-related pathways, which are involved in PGC reprogramming, were enriched among genes down-regulated by Klf9-OE, and forskolin which activate adenylate cyclase, rescued repressed EGC formation by knock-down of Klf9, suggesting a molecular linkage between KLF9 and such signaling.","['Otsuka, Kei', 'Takehara, Asuka', 'Chiba, Natsuko', 'Matsui, Yasuhisa']","['Otsuka K', 'Takehara A', 'Chiba N', 'Matsui Y']","['Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research, Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer (IDAC), Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer, Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.', 'Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research, Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer (IDAC), Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.', 'The Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development-Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (AMED-CREST), Chuo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer, Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Life Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.', 'Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research, Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer (IDAC), Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.', 'The Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development-Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (AMED-CREST), Chuo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Life Sciences, Tohoku University, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.', 'Center for Regulatory Epigenome and Diseases, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181004,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein)', '0 (Bcl3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Klf9 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein', '*Cellular Reprogramming', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Embryonic Germ Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Ovum/*cytology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Spermatozoa/*cytology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",PMC6171932,,,2018/10/05 06:00,2019/03/19 06:00,['2018/10/05 06:00'],"['2018/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0205004 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-14178 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2018 Oct 4;13(10):e0205004. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0205004. eCollection 2018.,['ORCID: 0000-0001-7026-6355'],['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, in the murine system Tcl1a is expressed in the ovary, testis and in pre-implantation embryos, where it plays an important role in blastomere proliferation and in embryonic stem cell (ESC) proliferation and self-renewal. We have also observed that Tcl1-/- adult mice exhibit alopecia and deep ulcerations. This finding has led us to investigate the role of TCL1 in mouse skin and hair follicles. We have found that TCL1 is expressed in the proliferative structure (i.e. the secondary hair germ) and in the stem cell niche (i.e. the bulge) of the hair follicle during regeneration phase and it is constitutively expressed in the basal layer of epidermis where it is required for the correct proliferative-differentiation program of the keratinocytes (KCs). Taking advantage of the murine models we have generated, including the Tcl1-/- and the K14-TCL1 transgenic mouse, we have analysed the function of TCL1 in mouse KCs and the molecular pathways involved. We provide evidence that in the epidermal compartment TCL1 has a role in the regulation of KC proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In particular, the colony-forming efficiency (CFE) and the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1)-induced proliferation are dramatically impaired, while apoptosis is increased, in KCs from Tcl1-/- mice when compared to WT. Moreover, the expression of differentiation markers such as cytokeratin 6 (KRT6), filaggrin (FLG) and involucrin (IVL) are profoundly altered in mutant mice (Tcl1-/-). Importantly, by over-expressing TCL1A in basal KCs of the K14-TCL1 transgenic mouse model, we observed a significant rescue of cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of the mutant phenotype. Finally, we found TCL1 to act, at least in part, via increasing phospho-ERK1/2 and decreasing phospho-P38 MAPK. Hence, our data demonstrate that regulated levels of Tcl1a are necessary for the correct proliferation and differentiation of the interfollicular KCs.","['Bresin, Antonella', 'Ragone, Gianluca', 'Cristofoletti, Cristina', 'Arcelli, Diego', 'Bassi, Cristian', 'Caprini, Elisabetta', 'Fiorenza, Maria Teresa', 'Helmer Citterich, Mauro', 'Russo, Giandomenico', 'Narducci, Maria Grazia']","['Bresin A', 'Ragone G', 'Cristofoletti C', 'Arcelli D', 'Bassi C', 'Caprini E', 'Fiorenza MT', 'Helmer Citterich M', 'Russo G', 'Narducci MG']","[""Molecular Oncology Laboratory, Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata, IDI-IRCCS, Rome, Italy."", ""Molecular Oncology Laboratory, Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata, IDI-IRCCS, Rome, Italy."", ""Molecular Oncology Laboratory, Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata, IDI-IRCCS, Rome, Italy."", ""Molecular Oncology Laboratory, Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata, IDI-IRCCS, Rome, Italy."", 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, Universita degli Studi di Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', ""Molecular Oncology Laboratory, Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata, IDI-IRCCS, Rome, Italy."", 'Sezione di Neuroscienze, Dipartimento di Psicologia, Universita degli studi di Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.', ""Molecular Oncology Laboratory, Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata, IDI-IRCCS, Rome, Italy."", ""Molecular Oncology Laboratory, Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata, IDI-IRCCS, Rome, Italy."", ""Molecular Oncology Laboratory, Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata, IDI-IRCCS, Rome, Italy.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181004,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (FLG protein, human)', '0 (Filaggrin Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (insulin-like growth factor-1, mouse)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation/*physiology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Epidermis/metabolism/pathology', 'Filaggrin Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/physiology', 'Hair Follicle/metabolism/pathology', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/*metabolism', 'Keratinocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Skin/metabolism/pathology', 'Stem Cell Niche/physiology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",PMC6171881,,,2018/10/05 06:00,2019/03/13 06:00,['2018/10/05 06:00'],"['2018/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0204775 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-18685 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2018 Oct 4;13(10):e0204775. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0204775. eCollection 2018.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-3954-5481'],['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inflammatory signals modulate the effects of miR-125b over-expression as demonstrated in a sterile peritonitis and a polymicrobial sepsis model.

However, this association was previously undefined and ambiguous. Therefore, we carried out an updated analysis to evaluate this relationship between rs4938723 polymorphism and cancer susceptibility. MATERIAL AND METHODS PubMed, EMbase, Web of Science and Chinese language (WanFang, CNKI and VIP) databases were searched for relevant studies until Sep 10, 2018. Odds ratios and 95% confidence interval were applied to assess this relationship. RESULTS Thirty case-control studies were retrieved. No positive association was found in either the overall study population or in the subgroups, based on ethnicity, source of group, sex, smoking, and drinking status. The main results were observed in the stratified analysis subgroups in cancer type subgroup: rs4938723 polymorphism may be a protective factor in leukemia, colorectal cancer, and esophageal cancer; however, C-allele was a risk factor in carriers for hepatocellular carcinoma. Last but not the least, poor positive results were discovered in the age subgroup. CONCLUSIONS Current meta-analysis suggested that rs4938723 polymorphism was potentially associated with hepatocellular carcinoma risk, but this polymorphism had a decreased association for susceptibility to esophageal cancer, leukemia, and colorectal cancer. Furthermore, studies with larger sample sizes and including gene-gene or gene-environment interactions should be carried out to elucidate the role of rs4938723 polymorphism in cancer risk.","['Xu, Bin', 'Zhu, Ya', 'Tang, Yu', 'Zhang, Zhenyong', 'Wen, Qiaxian']","['Xu B', 'Zhu Y', 'Tang Y', 'Zhang Z', 'Wen Q']","['Department of Oncology, Third Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, Wuxi, Jiangsu, China (mainland).', 'Department of Oncology, Third Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, Wuxi, Jiangsu, China (mainland).', 'Community Health-Service Center of Huangxiang Street, Wuxi, Jiangsu, China (mainland).', 'Department of Oncology, Third Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, Wuxi, Jiangsu, China (mainland).', 'Department of Oncology, Third Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, Wuxi, Jiangsu, China (mainland).']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",20181004,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,"['0 (MIRN34 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Liver Neoplasms/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Odds Ratio', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Protective Factors']",PMC6183103,,,2018/10/05 06:00,2018/12/18 06:00,['2018/10/05 06:00'],"['2018/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['912534 [pii]', '10.12659/MSM.912534 [doi]']",epublish,Med Sci Monit. 2018 Oct 4;24:7057-7071. doi: 10.12659/MSM.912534.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MicroRNAs function as important biomarkers in the clinical prognosis of AML. METHODS: This study identified miR-425 as a prognostic factor in AML by screening the TCGA dataset. A total of 162 patients with AML were enrolled for the study and divided into chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) groups. RESULTS: In the chemotherapy group, patients with high miR-425 expression had significantly longer overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) compared with patients with low miR-425 expression. In multivariate analyses, high miR-425 expression remained independently predictive of a better OS (HR = 0.502, P = 0.005) and EFS (HR = 0.432, P = 0.001) compared with patients with low miR-425 expression. Then, all patients were divided into two groups based on the median expression levels of miR-425. Notably, the patients undergoing allo-HSCT had significantly better OS (HR = 0.302, P < 0.0001) and EFS (HR = 0.379, P < 0.0001) compared with patients treated with chemotherapy in the low-miR-425-expression group. Mechanistically, high miR-425 expression levels were associated with a profile significantly involved in regulating cellular metabolism. Among these genes, MAP3K5, SMAD2, and SMAD5 were predicted targets of miR-425. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of miR-425 may be useful in identifying patients in need of strategies to select the optimal therapy between chemotherapy and allo-HSCT treatment regimens.

The health utility scores of the participants were estimated based on the Chinese EQ-5D-3L value set and compared with those of the local general population. Factors predicting the health utility scores were identified through the Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance and median regression analyses. RESULTS: FCs had lower health utility scores than the general population (p < 0.001). The participants with a lower socioeconomic status had lower utility scores and reported more problems than those with a higher socio-economic status. Better family function and higher social support were associated with higher health utility scores. The type of leukemia, household income, and social support are significant predictors of health utility scores of the FCs. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, low socio-economic status, and low social support are associated with lower health utility scores of the FCs. CONCLUSIONS: FCs for leukemia patients have lower health utility scores than the local general population, as measured by the EQ-5D-3L. There is an immediate need to address the health concerns of FCs, who play an important role in the Chinese health care system.","['Yu, Hongjuan', 'Zhang, Huan', 'Yang, Jinjin', 'Liu, Chaojie', 'Lu, Chengfang', 'Yang, Hongbin', 'Huang, Weidong', 'Zhou, Jin', 'Fu, Wenqi', 'Shi, Linmei', 'Yan, Yan', 'Liu, Guoxiang', 'Li, Limin']","['Yu H', 'Zhang H', 'Yang J', 'Liu C', 'Lu C', 'Yang H', 'Huang W', 'Zhou J', 'Fu W', 'Shi L', 'Yan Y', 'Liu G', 'Li L']","['The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150081, China.', 'Affiliate Tumor Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150000, China.', 'School of Health Management, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150086, China.', 'School of Psychology and Public Health, La Trobe University, Melbourne, VIC, 3086, Australia.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150081, China.', 'Affiliate Tumor Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150000, China.', 'School of Health Management, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150086, China. weidong218@126.com.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150081, China.', 'School of Health Management, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150086, China.', 'School of Health Management, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150086, China.', 'Heilongjiang Provincial Hospital, Harbin, 150081, China.', 'School of Health Management, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150086, China. lgx6301@163.com.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150081, China.

In Europe visceral leishmaniasis is considered endemic mainly in the Mediterranean countries and cases in non-endemic European countries north of the Alps have primarily been reported in returning travellers. The incubation period is typically described between 6 weeks to 6 months. The cases presented highlight the occurrence of longer incubation periods and illustrate the individual variability for progression from infection to disease. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the cases of 18-months-old twin girls living at the German-Swiss border, who developed visceral leishmaniasis 7 and 15 months after travelling to Tuscany. They presented with fever of unknown origin and pancytopenia. Both had splenomegaly and in the first case haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis or leukaemia was initially included in the differential diagnosis. Diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis was confirmed by presence of intracytoplasmic localised leishmania parasites on bone marrow aspirate and/or positive leishmania serology. Both girls responded well to treatment with liposomal amphotericin B. The mother and two older siblings remained uninfected, while the father was diagnosed to be an asymptomatic carrier. CONCLUSION: Visceral leishmaniasis is an important differential diagnosis for fever of unknown origin and pancytopenia in young children living in countries with endemic disease and highlights the importance of obtaining a detailed travel history. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and acute leukaemia present with similar symptoms and consequently are important differential diagnoses. Factors determining progression from infection to disease are not fully understood but younger age seems to be an important risk factor. Screening of siblings from affected individuals therefore may be warranted.","['Adamczick, Charlotte', 'Dierig, Alexa', 'Welzel, Tatjana', 'Schifferli, Alexandra', 'Blum, Johannes', 'Ritz, Nicole']","['Adamczick C', 'Dierig A', 'Welzel T', 'Schifferli A', 'Blum J', 'Ritz N']","['German Association for Tropical Paediatrics and International Child Health, Frankfurt, Germany.', ""University Children's Hospital Basel, Paediatric Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland."", ""University Children's Hospital Basel, Department of Haematology/Oncology, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland."", ""University Children's Hospital Basel, Paediatric Pharmacology, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland."", ""University Children's Hospital Basel, Department of Haematology/Oncology, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland."", 'Swiss Public Health and Tropical Institute, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', ""University Children's Hospital Basel, Paediatric Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland. nicole.ritz@unibas.ch."", ""University Children's Hospital Basel, Paediatric Pharmacology, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland. nicole.ritz@unibas.ch."", 'Department of Paediatrics, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia. nicole.ritz@unibas.ch.', ""Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology, University Children's Hospital Basel, Spitalstrasse 33, CH-4031, Basel, Switzerland. nicole.ritz@unibas.ch.""]",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20181001,England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,"['0 (Antiprotozoal Agents)', '0 (liposomal amphotericin B)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",IM,"['Amphotericin B/*therapeutic use', 'Antiprotozoal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Diseases in Twins', 'Endemic Diseases', 'Female', 'Fever/etiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Italy', 'Leishmaniasis, Visceral/*diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Lymphohistiocytosis, Hemophagocytic/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Pancytopenia/etiology', 'Splenomegaly/diagnosis', 'Travel']",PMC6167882,['NOTNLM'],"['Asymptomatic carrier', 'Liposomal amphotericin B', 'Sand fly']",2018/10/05 06:00,2018/11/20 06:00,['2018/10/05 06:00'],"['2017/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12879-018-3394-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s12879-018-3394-0 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2018 Oct 1;18(1):495. doi: 10.1186/s12879-018-3394-0.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1498-1685'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, to our knowledge, no studies have described any successful dermal filler injection performed on patients who are under imatinib mesylate treatment. Hence, we present a case successfully treated with hyaluronic acid filler injection on a patient under imatinib mesylate treatment.

30285359,,Publisher,,,,,,2022 Jan,Myeloproliferative Neoplasms,,,"Hematopoietic pluripotent stem cells have self-renewal capability and give rise to either myeloid or the lymphoid lineage which further differentiates into various mature blood cells such as red blood cells (RBC), lymphocytes, granulocytes, megakaryocytes, and macrophages. The hematopoietic process is determined by the bone marrow environment, growth factors, and transcription factors. The abnormal proliferation of one or more terminal myeloid cell lines in the peripheral blood gives rise to a heterogeneous group of disorders called myeloproliferative neoplasms. In 1951, William Dameshek coined the term myeloproliferative disorders which are now reformed to myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) by the World Health Organization (WHO). Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) are four classic types of myeloproliferative neoplasms. WHO classification also included chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL), chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL), and MPN, unclassifiable.[1] Out of the classic types of MPNs, CML is BCR-ABL1 positive, but PV, ET, and PMF are BCR-ABL1 negative. Besides, the fourth edition of WHO classification for myeloid and acute leukemia was revised in 2016 due to recent advances in hematology with the identification of molecular markers and prognostic markers, giving a better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis and genetics of the hematological malignancies.[2]","['Thapa, Bicky', 'Fazal, Salman', 'Parsi, Meghana', 'Rogers, Heesun J.']","['Thapa B', 'Fazal S', 'Parsi M', 'Rogers HJ']",,['eng'],,"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",,Treasure Island (FL),,,,,,,,,,2018/10/05 06:01,2018/10/05 06:01,,,['NBK531464 [bookaccession]'],,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2022, StatPearls Publishing LLC.']",,,,,,,,,,,20181005,['20220109'],['StatPearls Publishing'],['StatPearls'],['2018/10/05 06:01'],,,

METHODS: Cytogenetic analysis of metaphases was performed to detect ACAs, and the BCR-ABL1 KD was sequenced to detect KD mutations. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (11.0%) had ACAs in addition to the BCR-ABL1 or t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation. The most common abnormality was trisomy 8. Twelve different KD mutations were observed in 13 out of 53 imatinib-resistant patients (24.5%). p.(Y235H) (n = 3; 23.07%), p.(F359V) and p.(T315I) (n = 2; 15.38%) presented most frequently. KD mutations subtypes (p.(E255K), p.(T315I), p.(F359V), p.(M244V) and p.(L298V)) coexisted with ACAs. The incidence of CML progression was 12/22 (54.5%) in the group of patients with ACAs and/or KD mutations and 2/143 (1.4%) in the group of patients without ACAs or KD mutations (CI 95%, P < 0.001) and was higher in the KD mutations group than in the ACAs group (P = 0.046). The group of patients with ACAs and/or KD mutations had more men than the group of patients without ACAs or KD mutations (P = 0.013). CONCLUSION: We conclude that ACAs and/or KD mutations are related to CML progression and are adverse outcome factors. Their presence exhibits gender differences and is more common in males. p.(E255K), p.(T315I), p.(F359V), p.(M244V) and p.(L298V) emerge more frequently when ACAs and KD mutations coexist.","['Xue, Mingming', 'Cheng, Juan', 'Zhao, Jiangyun', 'Zhang, Shuling', 'Jian, Jinli', 'Qiao, Yanhong', 'Liu, Bei']","['Xue M', 'Cheng J', 'Zhao J', 'Zhang S', 'Jian J', 'Qiao Y', 'Liu B']","['The First Clinical Medical College, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', 'The First Clinical Medical College, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', 'Institute of Disease Control and Prevention, Academy of Military Medical Science, Beijing, China.', 'The First Clinical Medical College, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', 'The First Clinical Medical College, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', 'The First Clinical Medical College, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', 'The First Clinical Medical College, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.']",['eng'],"['GSWST2012-21/Health Profession Scientific Research Project of Gansu Province', 'Health Department']",['Journal Article'],20181004,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,['EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Protein Domains/genetics', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Sex Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['additional chromosome abnormalities', 'chronic myeloid leukaemia', 'tyrosine kinase domain mutations', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance']",2018/10/05 06:00,2019/03/21 06:00,['2018/10/05 06:00'],"['2018/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/15 00:00 [revised]', '2018/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12928 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2019 Feb;41(1):94-101. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12928.

METHODS: Birth certificates of Arizona, Illinois, and Kentucky children diagnosed as having acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) before age 5 years were matched with birth certificates from leukemia-free children of the same sex, race, and ethnicity who were born in the same county on or about the same day. Odds ratios (ORs) for ALL among children of low (<2.5 kg) or high (>4 kg) birth weight were calculated by conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Children with high birth weight had an elevated risk of ALL in the first 5 years of life (OR 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.61). The excess risk was confined to non-Hispanic whites (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.27-2.48), both boys (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.01-2.45) and girls (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.26-3.52). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the association between high birth weight and ALL previously reported by other studies in children of European ancestry. The literature on maternal risk factors for both macrosomia and ALL is reviewed, with maternal overnutrition emerging as a plausible risk factor for both outcomes.","['Groves, Frank D', 'Watkins, Brittany T', 'Roberts, Daniel J', 'Tucker, Thomas C', 'Shen, Tiefu', 'Flood, Timothy J']","['Groves FD', 'Watkins BT', 'Roberts DJ', 'Tucker TC', 'Shen T', 'Flood TJ']","['From the Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, School of Public Health and Information Sciences, University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky, Department of Epidemiology, College of Public Health, University of Kentucky, Lexington, the Illinois State Cancer Registry, Springfield, and the Arizona Cancer Registry, Phoenix.', 'From the Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, School of Public Health and Information Sciences, University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky, Department of Epidemiology, College of Public Health, University of Kentucky, Lexington, the Illinois State Cancer Registry, Springfield, and the Arizona Cancer Registry, Phoenix.', 'From the Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, School of Public Health and Information Sciences, University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky, Department of Epidemiology, College of Public Health, University of Kentucky, Lexington, the Illinois State Cancer Registry, Springfield, and the Arizona Cancer Registry, Phoenix.', 'From the Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, School of Public Health and Information Sciences, University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky, Department of Epidemiology, College of Public Health, University of Kentucky, Lexington, the Illinois State Cancer Registry, Springfield, and the Arizona Cancer Registry, Phoenix.', 'From the Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, School of Public Health and Information Sciences, University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky, Department of Epidemiology, College of Public Health, University of Kentucky, Lexington, the Illinois State Cancer Registry, Springfield, and the Arizona Cancer Registry, Phoenix.', 'From the Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, School of Public Health and Information Sciences, University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky, Department of Epidemiology, College of Public Health, University of Kentucky, Lexington, the Illinois State Cancer Registry, Springfield, and the Arizona Cancer Registry, Phoenix.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,South Med J,Southern medical journal,0404522,,IM,"['African Americans/*statistics & numerical data', 'Arizona/epidemiology', '*Birth Weight', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Fetal Macrosomia/*complications/ethnology', 'Hispanic or Latino/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Illinois/epidemiology', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Kentucky/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Whites/*statistics & numerical data']",,,,2018/10/05 06:00,2019/04/04 06:00,['2018/10/05 06:00'],"['2018/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.14423/SMJ.0000000000000873 [doi]', 'SMJ50603 [pii]']",ppublish,South Med J. 2018 Oct;111(10):579-584. doi: 10.14423/SMJ.0000000000000873.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most of studies are focused on detection of the hotspot c.7541_7542delCT NOTCH1 mutations in exon 34, while studies of mutations in the 3'UTR region are rare. The aims of work were to evaluate the frequencies of mutations in the 3'UTR region of the NOTCH1 gene (9:136,495553-136,495994) in Ukrainian CLL patients, the distribution of rs3124591 genotypes located in that area, and association of NOTCH1 mutations with structure of B-cell receptor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Detection of mutations in the 3'UTR region of the NOTCH1 was performed by direct sequencing in 87 previously untreated CLL patients (from the total group of 237 CLL patients) with unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable (UM IGHV) genes and without mutations in hotspot regions of TP53, SF3B1, and exon 34 of NOTCH1 genes. RESULTS: Mutations in the 3'UTR region of the NOTCH1 were revealed in three of 87 CLL patients (3.4%). Two cases with non-coding mutations were related to subset #1 of stereotyped B-cell receptors, and one case belonged to stereotyped subset #28a. Analysis with inclusion of 30 UM IGHV cases with previously detected c.7544_7545delCT mutations revealed that the frequency of UM IGHV genes of I phylogenetic clan (except IGHV1-69) was significantly increased, and the frequency of UM IGHV3 and IGHV4 genes, on the contrary, was reduced in NOTCH1-mutated cases comparing with NOTCH1-unmutated cases (p = 0.002) and the general group (p = 0.013). SNP rs3124591 did not affect the risk of CLL and survival parameters of the patients. At the same time, differences were found in the frequency of IGHV gene usage and in the structure of HCDR3 in carriers of individual genotypes. CONCLUSION: The frequency of NOTCH1 mutations in 3'UTR region was low. Our findings confirmed current data on the association between the structure of the B-cell receptor and the appearance of NOTCH1 mutations. Some features of HCDR3 structure were identified in carriers of TT and CC genotypes of rs3124591.","['Abramenko, I V', 'Bilous, N I', 'Chumak, A A', 'Dyagil, I S', 'Martina, Z V']","['Abramenko IV', 'Bilous NI', 'Chumak AA', 'Dyagil IS', 'Martina ZV']","['Department of Clinical Immunology, Research Center for Radiation Medicine, Kyiv 02000, Ukraine.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, Research Center for Radiation Medicine, Kyiv 02000, Ukraine.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, Research Center for Radiation Medicine, Kyiv 02000, Ukraine.', 'Department of Hematology, Research Center for Radiation Medicine, Kyiv 02000, Ukraine.', 'Department of Hematology, Research Center for Radiation Medicine, Kyiv 02000, Ukraine.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Phylogeny', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics', '*Prognosis', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics']",,,,2018/10/05 06:00,2019/01/12 06:00,['2018/10/05 06:00'],"['2018/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [medline]']",['11834 [pii]'],ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2018 Oct;40(3):211-217.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The data revealed that each amino acid binds to Pd(II) through the nitrogen of -NH2 and the oxygen of -COO(-) groups and acts as a bidentate chelate. These complexes have been assayed against leukemia cells (K562) using MTT method. The results indicated that both of the complexes display more cytotoxicity than the well-known anticancer drug, cisplatin. The interaction of the compounds with calf thymus DNA (CT-DNA) and human serum albumin (HSA) were assayed by a series of experimental techniques including electronic absorption, fluorescence, viscometry, gel electrophoresis, and FT-IR. The results indicated that the two complexes have interesting binding propensities toward CT-DNA as well as HSA and the binding affinity of (1) is more than (2). The fluorescence data indicated that both complexes strongly quench the fluorescence of ethidium bromide-DNA system as well as the intrinsic fluorescence of HSA via static quenching procedures. The thermodynamic parameters (DeltaH degrees , DeltaS degrees , and DeltaG degrees ) calculated from the fluorescence studies showed that hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions play a major role in the binding of the complexes to DNA and HSA.

The current study aimed to explore the nature and timing of psychosocial distress experienced by haematological cancer survivors. Twenty-three post-treatment haematological cancer survivors participated in a semi-structured interview. Data were analysed using thematic analysis which involved identifying, analysing and reporting themes. Four themes were identified: Apprehension about leaving the safety of the health care system comprises the struggles encountered when transitioning from patient to survivor, Uncertainty and life transitions in the post-treatment period encompasses the changes survivors face when attempting to re-enter their ""normal"" lives, Distress associated with ongoing physical problems or impairment describes issues associated with the ongoing physical sequelae, and Fear of recurrence encapsulates how the continuing threat of cancer recurrence impacted survivors. This study has found that distress is ongoing for many haematological cancer survivors in the post-treatment period. It is imperative that distress is identified and support offered to those in need to prevent further psychosocial issues. It is especially important to consider the psychosocial needs of survivors in the post-treatment stage who are discharged from the health system may be unsure where to seek help.","['Raphael, Deborah', 'Frey, Rosemary', 'Gott, Merryn']","['Raphael D', 'Frey R', 'Gott M']","['School of Nursing, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.', 'School of Nursing, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.', 'School of Nursing, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181004,England,Eur J Cancer Care (Engl),European journal of cancer care,9301979,,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anxiety/*psychology', 'Cancer Survivors/*psychology', 'Depression/*psychology', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*psychology', 'Hodgkin Disease/psychology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/psychology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/psychology', 'Stress, Psychological/*psychology', 'Time Factors']",,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer survivorship', 'haematological cancer', 'psychosocial distress', 'qualitative research']",2018/10/05 06:00,2019/05/15 06:00,['2018/10/05 06:00'],"['2017/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/19 00:00 [revised]', '2018/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/15 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ecc.12951 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Cancer Care (Engl). 2019 Jan;28(1):e12951. doi: 10.1111/ecc.12951.

With the improvement of therapies patients with these malignancies are living longer, however significant proportion these patient show poor quality of life (QoL) due to various physical and psychological consequences of the disease and the treatments. Health-related QoL (HRQoL) is multi-dimensional and temporal, relating to a state of functional, physical, psychological and social/family well-being. Compared with the general population, HRQoL of these patients is worse in most dimensions. However without routine holistic need assessment (HNA), clinicians are unlikely to identify patients with clinically significant distress. Surviving cancer is a chronic life-altering condition with several factors negatively affecting their QoL, such as psychological problems, including depression and excessive fear of recurrence, as well as social aspects, such as unemployment and social isolation. These need to be adequately understood and addressed in the healthcare of long-term survivors of haematological cancer. Applying a holistic approach to patient care has many benefits and yet, only around 25% of cancer survivors in the UK receive a holistic needs assessment. The efforts of the last decade have established the importance of ensuring access to psychosocial services for haematological cancer survivors. We need to determine the most effective practices and how best to deliver them across diverse settings.

The downregulation of MYCT1 has been reported to be associated with carcinogenesis. However, the role of MYCT1 in the development and progress of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains unknown and requires further investigation. In this study, we first found that the expression level of MYCT1 was significantly lower in the bone marrow (BM) derived from AML patients than that from healthy individuals. The low expression of MYCT1 in AML BM may be due to the hypermethylation in its promoter. MYCT1 expression was strongly associated with French-American-British classifications of AML. The low expression level of MYCT1 was more often observed in patients of M1, M5 and M6 types. In vitro, lentiviral particles carrying the complete CDS of MYCT1 gene were used to mediate the forced overexpression of MYCT1 in two AML cell lines, HL-60 and KG-1a. MYCT1 overexpression significantly inhibited cell proliferation, arrested cell cycle at G0/G1 phase, and downregulated the expression of cyclins D and E. Moreover, MYCT1 overexpression triggered apoptosis in AML cells, which was accompanied by enhanced cleavage of caspase-3 and -9, upregulated expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-associated X protein (Bax), and downregulated Bcl-2. Finally, in BALB/c nude mice bearing xenograft tumors generated by HL-60 and KG-1a cells, we noted that the intratumoral injection of MYCT1 lentivirus repressed tumor growth and led to massive apoptosis. In summary, our results reveal that MYCT1's promoter is hypermethylated and its expression is downregulated in the BM of AML patients. MYCT1 plays a tumor-suppressive role, and it may serve as a promising target for the genetic therapeutic strategy in treating AML.","['Fu, Shuang', 'Fu, Yu', 'Chen, Fang', 'Hu, Yanping', 'Quan, Bi', 'Zhang, Jihong']","['Fu S', 'Fu Y', 'Chen F', 'Hu Y', 'Quan B', 'Zhang J']","['Hematology Laboratory, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Hematology Laboratory, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Hematology Laboratory, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Hematology Laboratory, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Hematology Laboratory, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Hematology Laboratory, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20180918,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,,PMC6157318,['NOTNLM'],"['MYC target 1', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'cell cycle arrest', 'proliferation']",2018/10/05 06:00,2018/10/05 06:01,['2018/10/05 06:00'],"['2018/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2018.01045 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2018 Sep 18;9:1045. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2018.01045. eCollection 2018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These agents lead to improved outcomes in CLL, even among patients with high-risk features, such as del17p13 or TP53 mutation and unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGHV) genes. Each of these treatments is associated with a unique toxicity profile; in the absence of randomized data, the choice of one type of treatment over another depends on the co-morbidities of the patient. Chemoimmunotherapy still plays an important role in the management of previously untreated CLL patients, particularly among young fit patients who have standard risk FISH profile and mutated IGHV genes. Richter's transformation of CLL remains a difficult complication to treat, although therapy with programmed death 1 inhibitors such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab has shown impressive responses in a subset of patients. Our ability to risk stratify CLL patients continues to evolve; the CLL-International Prognostic Index (CLL-IPI) is the best validated tool in predicting time to first therapy among previously untreated patients.

To characterize the molecular pathogenesis of preBLL, we investigated 13 preBLL cases (including 1 cell line), of which 12 were analyzable using genome, exome, and targeted sequencing, imbalance mapping, and DNA methylation profiling. In 5 patients with reads across the IG-MYC breakpoint junctions, we found evidence that the translocation derived from an aberrant VDJ recombination, as is typical for IG translocations arising in B-cell precursors. Genomic changes like biallelic IGH translocations or VDJ rearrangements combined with translocation into the VDJ region on the second allele, potentially preventing expression of a productive immunoglobulin, were detected in 6 of 13 cases. We did not detect mutations in genes frequently altered in BL, but instead found activating NRAS and/or KRAS mutations in 7 of 12 preBLLs. Gains on 1q, recurrent in BL and preB lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (pB-ALL/LBL), were detected in 7 of 12 preBLLs. DNA methylation profiling showed preBLL to cluster with precursor B cells and pB-ALL/LBL, but apart from BL. We conclude that preBLL genetically and epigenetically resembles pB-ALL/LBL rather than BL. Therefore, we propose that preBLL be considered as a pB-ALL/LBL with recurrent genetic abnormalities.","['Wagener, Rabea', 'Lopez, Cristina', 'Kleinheinz, Kortine', 'Bausinger, Julia', 'Aukema, Sietse

Such secondary AMLs and those with typical MDS-related clinical features are known as AMLs with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC). Because patients with AML-MRC have poor prognosis, more accurate diagnostic approaches are required. In this study, we performed targeted sequencing of 54 genes in 3 cell populations (granulocyte, blast, and T-cell fractions) using samples from 13 patients with MDS, 16 patients with clinically diagnosed AML-MRC, 4 patients with suspected AML-MRC but clinically diagnosed as AML not otherwise specified (AML-NOS), and 11 patients with de novo AML. We found that overlapping mutations, defined as those shared at least by the blast and granulocyte fractions, were significantly enriched in patients with MDS and AML-MRC, including those with suspected AML-MRC, indicating a substantial history of clonal hematopoiesis. In contrast, blast-specific nonoverlapping mutations were significantly enriched in patients with de novo AML. Furthermore, the presence of overlapping mutations, excluding DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1, effectively segregated patients with MDS and AML-MRC or suspected AML-MRC from patients with de novo AML. Additionally, the presence of >/=3 mutations in the blast fraction was useful for distinguishing patients with AML-MRC from those with MDS. In conclusion, our approach is useful for classifying clinically diagnosable AML-MRC and identifying clinically diagnosed AML-NOS as latent AML-MRC. Additional prospective studies are needed to confirm the utility of this approach.","['Yokoyama, Kazuaki', 'Shimizu, Eigo', 'Yokoyama, Nozomi', 'Nakamura, Sousuke', 'Kasajima, Rika', 'Ogawa, Miho', 'Takei, Tomomi', 'Ito, Mika', 'Kobayashi, Asako', 'Yamaguchi, Rui', 'Imoto, Seiya', 'Miyano, Satoru', 'Tojo, Arinobu']","['Yokoyama K', 'Shimizu E', 'Yokoyama N', 'Nakamura S', 'Kasajima R', 'Ogawa M', 'Takei T', 'Ito M', 'Kobayashi A', 'Yamaguchi R', 'Imoto S', 'Miyano S', 'Tojo A']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital, Institute of Medical Science.', 'Laboratory of DNA Information Analysis, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science.', 'Department of Applied Genomics, Research Hospital, Institute of Medical Science.', 'Division of Molecular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center, Institute of Medical Science, and.', 'Division of Health Medical Data Science, Health Intelligence Center, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center, Institute of Medical Science, and.', 'Division of Molecular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center, Institute of Medical Science, and.', 'Division of Molecular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center, Institute of Medical Science, and.', 'Division of Molecular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center, Institute of Medical Science, and.', 'Laboratory of DNA Information Analysis, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science.', 'Division of Health Medical Data Science, Health Intelligence Center, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of DNA Information Analysis, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Research Hospital, Institute of Medical Science.', 'Division of Molecular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center, Institute of Medical Science, and.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,['0 (Biomarkers)'],,"['Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Lineage/*genetics', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Association Studies', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'ROC Curve', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Translocation, Genetic']",PMC6177645,,,2018/10/05 06:00,2019/08/27 06:00,['2018/10/05 06:00'],"['2017/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/27 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2017010744 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2017010744 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2018 Oct 9;2(19):2513-2521. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2017010744.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-2556-3833', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2486-2321', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1224-227X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2989-308X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1753-6616', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9016-1948']",,['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although increased accumulation of M2 macrophages has been demonstrated in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), particularly the eosinophilic type, their functional relevance in CRSwNP remains poorly understood. METHODS: M1 and M2 macrophages and IL-10 expression in sinonasal tissues were detected by double-immunofluorescence staining. THP-1 cells, a human monocytic leukemia cell line, were stimulated with various cytokines to study macrophage polarization and IL-10 expression. Polyp size, computed tomography (CT) scans, and symptom severity were scored. RESULTS: Compared with numbers in control tissues, the numbers of total CD68(+) macrophages, interferon regulatory factor 5-positive and CD68(+) M1 macrophages, and CD163(+) CD68(+) and CD206(+) CD68(+) M2 macrophages were increased in both eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic polyps. However, compared with non-eosinophilic polyps, eosinophilic polyps contained fewer M1 macrophages and more M2 macrophages. Consistent with this, the M1/M2 macrophage ratio was increased in non-eosinophilic polyps, whereas it decreased in eosinophilic polyps. Strikingly, the numbers of IL-10(+) CD68(+) macrophages and the percentage of IL-10(+) CD68(+) macrophages relative to the total number of macrophages were decreased in eosinophilic polyps, despite the upregulation of M2 macrophages in this type of polyp.

Diagnosis: Bone marrow morphology remains the cornerstone of diagnosis. In addition, the presence of JAK2 mutation is expected in PV while approximately 90% of patients with ET express mutually exclusive JAK2, CALR, or myeloproliferative leukemia mutations. In ET, it is most important to exclude the possibility of prefibrotic myelofibrosis. Survival: Median survivals are 14 years for PV and 20 years for ET; the corresponding values for younger patients are 24 and 33 years. Certain mutations (mostly spliceosome) and abnormal karyotype might compromise survival in PV and ET. Life-expectancy in ET is inferior to the control population. Driver mutations have not been shown to affect survival in ET. Risk of thrombosis is higher in JAK2-mutated ET. Leukemic transformation rates at 10 years are estimated at <1% for ET and 3% for PV. Thrombosis Risk: In PV, 2 risk categories are considered: high (age > 60 years or thrombosis history present) and low (absence of both risk factors); in ET, 4 risk categories are considered: very low (age </= 60 years, no thrombosis history, JAK2 wild-type), low (same as very low but JAK2 mutation present), intermediate (age > 60 years, no thrombosis history, JAK2 wild-type) and high (thrombosis history present or age > 60 years with JAK2 mutation). Risk-Adapted Therapy: The main goal of therapy in both PV and ET is to prevent thrombohemorrhagic complications. All patients with PV require phlebotomy to keep hematocrit below 45% and once- or twice-daily aspirin (81 mg), in the absence of contraindications. Very low-risk ET might not require therapy while aspirin therapy is advised for low-risk disease. Cytoreductive therapy is recommended for high-risk ET and PV but it is not mandatory for intermediate-risk ET. First-line drug of choice for cytoreductive therapy, in both ET and PV, is hydroxyurea and second-line drugs of choice are interferon-alpha and busulfan. We do not recommend treatment with ruxolutinib in PV, unless in the presence of severe and protracted pruritus or marked splenomegaly that is not responding to the aforementioned drugs.","['Tefferi, Ayalew', 'Barbui, Tiziano']","['Tefferi A', 'Barbui T']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Research Foundation, Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181109,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '6Q99RDT97R (Pipobroman)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aspirin/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Busulfan/therapeutic use', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Hemorrhage/etiology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Phlebotomy', 'Pipobroman/therapeutic use', 'Polycythemia Vera/diagnosis/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/etiology', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/diagnosis/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Thrombosis/etiology', 'Young Adult']",,,,2018/10/04 06:00,2019/11/13 06:00,['2018/10/04 06:00'],"['2018/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/13 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25303 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2019 Jan;94(1):133-143. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25303.

To establish a standardized method without interlaboratory discrepancies, we developed a novel one-step reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assay, called ""the Eprobe leukemia assay,"" for major and minor BCR-ABL1, RUNX1-RUNX1T1, and various isoforms of PML-RARA. This assay is comprised of Eprobes that are exciton-controlled hybridization-sensitive fluorescent oligonucleotides. Melting curve analyses were performed on synthetic quantitative standard RNAs with strict quality control. Quantification capacity was evaluated by comparison with TaqMan RT-qPCR using 67 primary leukemia patient samples. The lower limit of detection and the limit of quantification of this assay were less than 31.3 copies/reaction and 62.5 copies/reaction, respectively. This assay correctly detected the fusion genes in samples with 100% sensitivity and specificity. The specificity of the reactions was confirmed by melting curve analyses. The assay detected low-level expression of minor BCR-ABL1 co-expressed with major BCR-ABL1.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a rapidly improving technology whose application to the monitoring of MRD is an active area of research. We aim to describe existing methods of MRD in AML and MDS, with a focus on the utility of NGS in patients undergoing SCT. RECENT FINDINGS: Flow cytometry and quantitative PCR have been recommended by the European Leukemia Net as the preferred methods of MRD in AML and MDS, but these methods have limitations in cases without a disease-defining phenotype and genotype. Clinical trials are currently ongoing to assess the use of NGS in the setting of SCT for MDS and AML. Few studies have so far assessed the optimal method of MRD monitoring in the posttransplant setting. SUMMARY: The optimal method for the monitoring of MRD in AML and MDS both pre and post transplant may require more than one technology. NGS holds great promise for the monitoring of MRD, with prospective trials currently ongoing to evaluate its efficacy in this regard.","['Shapiro, Roman M', 'Kim, Dennis Dong Hwan']","['Shapiro RM', 'Kim DDH']","['Adult Hematology Training Program, Department of Medical Oncology & Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre/University Health Network.', 'Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,IM,"['Flow Cytometry', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', '*High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/genetics/*therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/genetics/*therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/genetics/*therapy', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,,2018/10/04 06:00,2019/09/26 06:00,['2018/10/04 06:00'],"['2018/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000464 [doi]', '00062752-201811000-00003 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2018 Nov;25(6):425-432. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000464.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six hundred and thirty-four patients with ALL were enrolled in this study between June 2008 and Dec 2014. High-risk group (HR) consisted of 217 cases, of which 28 cases were MLL related positive (first group), 22 cases were BCR/ABL positive (second group), and 167 cases were negative with MLL related or BCR/ABL (third group). The therapeutic efficacy was evaluated at the time points of day 8 (TP1), day 15 (TP2), day 33 (TP3) and 12th week (TP4) with the protocol, respectively. Overall-survival (OS) and relapse-free-survival (RFS) and treatment-related mortality (TRD) were analyzed as well. RESULTS: The first group accounted for 4.4% of all patients. Compared with the second and third group, the first group had more cases younger than 2 years, with initial leukocytes >/=50x109/L, and poor response on TP2. Moreover, patients older than 2 years old had a good 5 years OS (84% +/- 9% vs. 37% +/- 20%, p<0.05) and RFS (84% +/- 9% vs. 29% +/- 17%, p<0.05). There were no significant differences in the recurrence rate, TRD, 5 years OS and RFS among three groups. For the first group, compared with good response to prednisone, patients with poor response to prednisone had a poor 5 years RFS (41% +/- 17% vs. 81% +/- 10%, p<0.05). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified that RFS and OS were influenced by such factors as age, MLL fusion partners, and prednisone response (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Such factors as younger age than 2 years old, MLL/AF4 fusion gene, poor response to prednisone, or no complete remission (CR) on TP3 were poor prognostic parameters in predicting the outcome in childhood ALL with MLL gene rearrangement treated with CCLG-ALL 2008 protocol.","['Sun, Y-N', 'Hu, Y-X', 'Gao, L', 'Xiao, P-F', 'Lu, J', 'Wu, S-Y', 'Wang, M', 'Shao, X-J', 'Zhou, C-Y', 'Ling, J', 'Li, J-Q', 'Pan, J', 'Gao, J', 'Hu, S-Y']","['Sun YN', 'Hu YX', 'Gao L', 'Xiao PF', 'Lu J', 'Wu SY', 'Wang M', 'Shao XJ', 'Zhou CY', 'Ling J', 'Li JQ', 'Pan J', 'Gao J', 'Hu SY']","[""Department of Hematology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China. hu_shaoyan@sina.com.""]",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Prednisone/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,2018/10/04 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2018/10/04 06:00'],"['2018/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.26355/eurrev_201809_15938 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2018 Sep;22(18):6020-6029. doi: 10.26355/eurrev_201809_15938.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ibrutinib is the most advanced irreversible BTK inhibitor for treating mantle cell lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukaemia but with existing drug resistance and adverse effects. To design novel effective and safety reversible BTK inhibitors, 115 newly cinnoline analogues were selected to perform molecular docking and 3D-QSAR study because of the main scaffold similarity to Ibrutinib. Both established CoMFA and CoMSIA models obtained high predictive and satisfactory value. CoMFA/CoMSIA contour maps demonstrated that bulky substitutions are preferred at R1 and R3 positions, and introducing hydrophilic and negative electrostatic substitutions at R1 positions is important for improving BTK inhibitory activities.

We aimed to determine the genetic alterations including common fusion transcripts, overexpression of T-cell transcription factor oncogenes, and deletion or mutation of targeted genes in pediatric T-ALL in Taiwan as well as their impact on outcomes in those treated with the Taiwan Pediatric Oncology Group-ALL-2002 protocol. PROCEDURE: Between 1995 and 2015, bone marrow samples obtained from 102 children aged <18 years consecutively diagnosed with T-ALL were examined. Thirty-two genetic alterations were examined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays-PCR-based assays-followed by direct sequencing, real time quantitative PCR with TaqMan assays, or multiplex ligase probe amplification. RESULTS: TAL1 overexpression, CDKN2A/2B deletions, and NOTCH1 mutation were the most frequent aberrations while none had NF1, SUZ12 deletion, JAK1 or JAK2 mutations, or NUP214-ABL1 fusion in our cohort. The most frequent cooperating occurrence of genetic alterations included CDKN2A/2B and MTAP, MTAP and CDKN2B, LEF1 and PTPN2, and HOX11L2 and PHF6 mutation/deletion. NOTCH1 mutations conferred a favorable overall survival, whereas SIL-TAL1 fusion, TAL overexpression, LEF1 deletion, and PHF6 deletion/mutation were associated with an inferior outcome. By multivariate analysis, PHF6 mutation/deletion was the only independent predictor for inferior overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that the frequencies of genetic alterations in Taiwanese children with T-ALL differed considerably from those reported in Western countries. PHF6 mutation/deletion was an independently adverse predictor.","['Yeh, Ting-Chi', 'Liang, Der-Cherng', 'Liu, Hsi-Che', 'Jaing, Tang-Her', 'Chen, Shih-Hsiang', 'Hou, Jen-Yin', 'Yang, Chao-Ping', 'Huang, Ying-Jung', 'Yao, Hsien-Wen', 'Huang, Ting-Yu', 'Lin, Tung-Huei', 'Shih, Lee-Yung']","['Yeh TC', 'Liang DC', 'Liu HC', 'Jaing TH', 'Chen SH', 'Hou JY', 'Yang CP', 'Huang YJ', 'Yao HW', 'Huang TY', 'Lin TH', 'Shih LY']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Mackay Memorial Hospital and Mackay Medical College, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Mackay Memorial Hospital and Mackay Medical College, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Mackay Memorial Hospital and Mackay Medical College, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital-Linkou, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital-Linkou, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Mackay Memorial Hospital and Mackay Medical College, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital-Linkou, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital-Linkou, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Mackay Memorial Hospital and Mackay Medical College, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital-Linkou, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital-Linkou, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital-Linkou, Taoyuan, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181002,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Taiwan/epidemiology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Taiwan Pediatric Oncology Group', '*gene alteration', '*multiplex ligation probe amplification', '*pediatric']",2018/10/04 06:00,2019/10/23 06:00,['2018/10/04 06:00'],"['2018/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/23 00:00 [revised]', '2018/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/23 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27496 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 Jan;66(1):e27496. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27496.

Curative therapy for this group of diseases has previously been limited to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation HCT (alloHCT). The recent results of CAR-T cell therapy raise the question of how best to integrate CAR-T cell therapy and alloHCT in the care of these patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Within the past 2 years, results from larger trials and increased follow-up of patients treated with CD19 CAR-T cell therapy suggest that some may achieve durable remission without transplant. The balance of efficacy and toxicity for CAR-T cell therapy and alloHCT vary by disease type, disease status at the time of treatment, patient characteristics, and the specific therapy employed. There are early signals that subsequent transplantation of patients who have achieved remission with CAR-T may be a potentially viable (though expensive) strategy.","['Appelbaum, Jacob S', 'Milano, Filippo']","['Appelbaum JS', 'Milano F']","['Department of Medicine, University of Washington, 1100 Fairview AVE N, Mailstop # D5-100, Seattle, WA, 98109, USA. jappelb@uw.edu.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA. jappelb@uw.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington, 1100 Fairview AVE N, Mailstop # D5-100, Seattle, WA, 98109, USA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],['T32 HL007093/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,,IM,"['Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy/*methods', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods']",PMC6333424,['NOTNLM'],"['*BCMA', '*CAR-T cells', '*CD-19', '*CD-20', '*Cord blood', '*Stem cell transplant']",2018/10/04 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2018/10/04 06:00'],"['2018/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-018-0476-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-018-0476-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2018 Dec;13(6):484-493. doi: 10.1007/s11899-018-0476-4.,,,,,['NIHMS1508692'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bispecific antibodies exist which can redirect immune effector cells against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) targets. This review will highlight the progress to date and the challenges in developing bispecific antibodies for the treatment of AML. RECENT FINDINGS: Currently, a number of bispecific antibody formats including bispecific T cell engagers, dual affinity retargeting proteins, and tandem diabodies are in clinical development for AML. These antibodies target antigens present on AML blasts, including CD33, and the low affinity IL3 receptor, CD123. T cell redirecting bispecific antibodies in early phase clinical trials for AML include AG330, flotetuzumab, JNJ-63709178, and AMV564. Bispecific antibodies represent a promising immunotherapeutic approach for the treatment of cancer.

This disorder is characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, telangiectasia, immunodeficiency and a predisposition to leukemia/lymphoma. In this study, we investigated a family with a new mutation in ATM, confirmed by molecular genetic test. Materials&Methods: Four members of a family including a symptomatic AT patient, his parents and sibling were examined for ATM gene defects at Kerman University Hospital, Kerman, Iran in 2016. DNA was extracted from peripheral leukocytes and the coding regions and exon-intron boundaries of ATM gene were amplified by next-generation sequencing technique. The identified mutation was tested in all members of the family. Results: Molecular analyses identified a homozygous T to G substitution in c.7308-6 position resulting in a novel acceptor splice site in intron 49 of the ATM gene in the index patient. Parents and sibling of the proband were heterozygous for the same mutation. Conclusion: The variant c.7308-6T>G is predicted to be pathogenic due to impaired splice site causing exon skipping.

Fetal exposure to non-inherited maternal antigens (NIMA) may impart lifelong NIMA tolerance modulating the immune response, as shown in adult haploidentical transplantation. In cord blood transplantation, NIMA matching lowered rates of aGvHD and TRM; in haploidentical transplantation, sibling donors with non-shared maternal antigens showed less grade II-IV aGvHD. This retrospective analysis examined if 9/10 matched unrelated donor HSCT benefits from NIMA matching. DKMS contacted 1,735 donors and obtained 733 (42%) maternal samples.

In murine models of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), CCL3 is critical for the maintenance of a leukemia stem cell population, and leukemia progression. With CCL3 implicated as a potentially viable therapeutic target, it is important to carefully characterize its role in normal hematopoietic homeostasis. CCL3(-/-) mice were used to evaluate the role of CCL3 in regulating hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) populations. CCL3(-/-) mice had loss of mature myeloid populations, while myeloid progenitors and HSPCs were increased, and microenvironmental populations were unchanged. These data show that CCL3 promotes myeloid lineage differentiation and the size of the HSPC pool independent of the supportive bone marrow microenvironment. Our results demonstrate a previously unrecognized role of CCL3 in the maintenance of homeostatic hematopoiesis that should be evaluated when targeting CCL3 signaling for the treatment of hematologic malignancy.","['Staversky, Rhonda J', 'Byun, Daniel K', 'Georger, Mary A', 'Zaffuto, Brandon J', 'Goodman, Alexandra', 'Becker, Michael W', 'Calvi, Laura M', 'Frisch, Benjamin J']","['Staversky RJ', 'Byun DK', 'Georger MA', 'Zaffuto BJ', 'Goodman A', 'Becker MW', 'Calvi LM', 'Frisch BJ']","['Department of Medicine Hematology/Oncology Division University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine Hematology/Oncology Division University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine Endocrine Division University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine Endocrine Division University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine Hematology/Oncology Division University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine Hematology/Oncology Division University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'Wilmot Cancer Institute, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine Hematology/Oncology Division University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine Endocrine Division University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'Wilmot Cancer Institute, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'Center for musculoskeletal research, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine Hematology/Oncology Division University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY, USA. benjamin_frisch2@urmc.rochester.edu.', 'Wilmot Cancer Institute, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY, USA. benjamin_frisch2@urmc.rochester.edu.', 'Center for musculoskeletal research, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY, USA. benjamin_frisch2@urmc.rochester.edu.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA166280/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA166280/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | NIH | National Cancer', 'Institute (NCI)/International', 'P30 AR069655/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR002001/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000042/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'AG046293/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | NIH | National', 'Institute on Aging (U.S. National Institute on Aging)/International', 'CA180615/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | NIH | National Cancer', 'Institute (NCI)/International', 'AR061307/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | NIH | National', 'Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', '(NIAMS)/International', 'R01 AG046293/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20181002,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Ccl3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Chemokine CCL3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Count', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Chemokine CCL3/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Cells/*drug effects/*physiology']",PMC6168534,,,2018/10/04 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2018/10/04 06:00'],"['2018/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-018-32978-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-018-32978-y [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2018 Oct 2;8(1):14691. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-32978-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other species are non-permissive in LIF media, and form developmentally primed epiblast stem cells (EpiSC) similar to cells derived from post-implantation, egg cylinders. To evaluate whether non-permissiveness extends to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), we derived iPSC from the eight founder strains of the mouse Collaborative Cross. Two strains, NOD/ShiLtJ and the WSB/EiJ, were non-permissive, consistent with the previous classification of NOD/ShiLtJ as non-permissive to ESC derivation. We determined non-permissiveness is recessive, and that non-permissive genomes do not compliment. We overcame iPSC non-permissiveness by using GSK3B and MEK inhibitors with serum, a technique we termed 2iS reprogramming. Although used for ESC derivation, GSK3B and MEK inhibitors have not been used during iPSC reprogramming because they inhibit survival of progenitor differentiated cells. iPSC derived in 2iS are more transcriptionally similar to ESC than EpiSC, indicating that 2iS reprogramming acts to overcome genetic background constraints. Finally, of species tested for ESC or iPSC derivation, only some M. musculus strains are permissive under LIF culture conditions suggesting that this is an evolutionarily derived characteristic in the M. musculus lineage.","['Garbutt, Tiffany A', 'Konneker, Thomas I', 'Konganti, Kranti', 'Hillhouse, Andrew E', 'Swift-Haire, Francis', 'Jones, Alexis', 'Phelps, Drake', 'Aylor, David L', 'Threadgill, David W']","['Garbutt TA', 'Konneker TI', 'Konganti K', 'Hillhouse AE', 'Swift-Haire F', 'Jones A', 'Phelps D', 'Aylor DL', 'Threadgill DW']","['Program in Genetics, Department of Biological Science, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.', 'Program in Genetics, Department of Biological Science, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.', 'Texas A&M Institute for Genome Sciences and Society, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA.', 'Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA.', 'Texas A&M Institute for Genome Sciences and Society, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA.', 'Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA.', 'Program in Genetics, Department of Biological Science, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.', 'Program in Genetics, Department of Biological Science, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.', 'Program in Genetics, Department of Biological Science, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.', 'Program in Genetics, Department of Biological Science, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.', 'Center for Human Health and the Environment, W.M.

Expression profile of lncRNAs in PCa and paracancerous tissues were investgated by the high-throughput gene chip technology. Specific siRNA of RP13-650J16.1 or TCONS_00023979 was transfected into DU145 cells. Then, the relative expression of RP13-650J16.1, receptor-associated coactivator 3 (RAC3), promyelocytic leukemia (PML), and TCONS_00023979 was detected by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting. MTT assay was used to detect the proliferation of DU145 cells. The migration ability of DU145 cells was measured by Transwell chambers. Single cell proliferation and clonogenic ability were detected by plate clone formation assay. RP13-650J16.1 and RAC3 expression was up-regulated, and TCONS_00023979 and PML expression was down-regulated in PCa tissues.

Tissue-specific reduction in global 5hmC levels has been associated with various types of cancer. One of the challenges associated with detecting 5hmC levels is its extremely low content, especially in blood. The gold-standard for reliable global 5hmC quantitation is liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) operating in a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. Difficulties associated with 5hmC detection by LC-MS/MS include its low abundance, low ionization efficiency and possible ion suppression from co-eluted compounds. Hence, detecting 5hmC levels in blood samples for diagnosis of leukemia and other blood malignancies presents a unique challenge. To overcome these difficulties we introduce a simple chemoenzymatic method for specifically tagging 5hmC, resulting in an eight-fold increase in detection sensitivity. We demonstrate that we could quantitatively detect 5hmC levels in various human tissues, including blood samples from healthy individuals and leukemia patients, using the most basic quadrupole mass-analyzer instrument and only 200ng of DNA. The limit of detection (LOD) of our technique is 0.001% 5hmC from 300ng DNA, sufficient for future mass-spectroscopy based diagnostics of diseases associated with low 5hmC levels such as leukemia.","['Shahal, Tamar', 'Koren, Omri', 'Shefer, Gabi', 'Stern, Naftali', 'Ebenstein, Yuval']","['Shahal T', 'Koren O', 'Shefer G', 'Stern N', 'Ebenstein Y']","['Raymond and Beverly Sackler Faculty of Exact Sciences, School of Chemistry, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, 6997801, Israel; Sagol Center for the Epigenetics of Metabolism and Aging, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, 6423906, Israel.', 'Raymond and Beverly Sackler Faculty of Exact Sciences, School of Chemistry, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, 6997801, Israel.', 'Sagol Center for the Epigenetics of Metabolism and Aging, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, 6423906, Israel.', 'Sagol Center for the Epigenetics of Metabolism and Aging, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, 6423906, Israel.', 'Raymond and Beverly Sackler Faculty of Exact Sciences, School of Chemistry, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, 6997801, Israel.

Median OS was 8.0 (95% CI 6.6-9.4) months with a 1-year OS rate of (29.9 +/- 3.9)% and 3-year OS rate of (11.1 +/- 3.6)%. No difference of CR (P = .621), ORR (P = .385), and allo-HSCT (P = .537) achievement was observed among different chemotherapy regimens. Interestingly, we observed that the CLAG-based regimen did not affect CR (P = .165), while it achieved a numerically higher ORR (P = .093) and was an independent factor for prolonged OS (P = .016). No other regimens were determined to be correlated with CR, ORR, or OS.FLAG-, CAG/DAG-, CLAG-, MEA-, IA/DA/MA- and HAA/HAD-based regimens were found to achieve similar CR rates, while the CLAG-based regimen achieved numerically higher ORR rates and significant favorable OS.

A. glabra is a tropical tree that exhibits several clinical and pharmacological properties in humans and is effective against cancer. We investigated the antiproliferative effects of an alcoholic extract of A. glabra on MC-1010 human monocytic leukemia cells (crl-12253) based on phytochemical analyses, cell viability, free radical scavenging activity, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, ATP content, mitochondrial fragmentation, and cell migration assays. The results indicated the presence of flavonoids, terpenoids, glycosides, steroids, saponins, tannins, anthraquinones, and acidic compounds in extracts. Leukemia cell viability was reduced up to 28% after incubation with the extract, while the free radical reducing power and scavenging activity were significantly increased. Higher concentrations of extract significantly inhibited leukemia cell colony formation. ROS increased up to 66% following incubation with extract, while the ATP content decreased up to 31%. Condensed, fragmented, and clumped mitochondria were observed in treated cells. In flow cytometric analyses, 10.7% and 22.4% of cells were apoptotic following incubation with 80 and 100mug/mL extract, respectively. Moreover, treated leukemia cells exhibited reduced migratory potential. Overall, the results suggest that leaf extracts of A. glabra may act as potential anticancer agents against human leukemia cells.","['Liu, Ying', 'Liu, Donghai', 'Wan, Wuqing', 'Zhang, Hong']","['Liu Y', 'Liu D', 'Wan W', 'Zhang H']","['Department of Pediatrics, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410011, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410011, China.

On the other hand, the chimeric knock-in mouse develops acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. We created another mouse model of RUNX1-EVI1 using transplantation of retrovirus-infected bone marrow cells. Some mice transplanted with RUNX1-EVI1-expressing bone marrow cells developed acute megakaryoblastic leukemia within eight months, and the other non-leukemic mice showed thrombocytosis at around a year. In the non-leukemic mice, dysplastic megakaryocytes proliferated in the bone marrow and frequently infiltrated into the spleen, which was not associated with marrow fibrosis. In the leukemic mice, their tumor cells were positive for c-kit and CD41, and negative for TER119. Although they were negative for platelet peroxidase in the electron microscopic analysis, they had multiple centrioles in the cytoplasm, which are characteristic of megakaryocytes that undergo endomitosis. The leukemic cells were serially transplantable, and gene-expression analyses using quantitative RT-PCR arrays revealed that they showed significantly elevated expression of stem cell, primitive hematopoietic cell and endothelial cell-related genes compared with normal bone marrow cells. All these data suggested that RUNX1-EVI1 caused dysplastic hematopoiesis or leukemia of the megakaryocytic lineage and endowed gene expression profiles distinctive of immature hematopoietic cells.","['Nakamura, Yuka', 'Ichikawa, Motoshi', 'Oda, Hideaki', 'Yamazaki, Ieharu', 'Sasaki, Ko', 'Mitani, Kinuko']","['Nakamura Y', 'Ichikawa M', 'Oda H', 'Yamazaki I', 'Sasaki K', 'Mitani K']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Dokkyo Medical University School of Medicine, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Dokkyo Medical University School of Medicine, Tochigi, Japan.', ""Department of Pathology, Tokyo Women's Medical University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Department of Electron Microscope, BML Research Institute Inc., Saitama, Japan; Department of Molecular Pathology, Tokyo Medical University, School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Dokkyo Medical University School of Medicine, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Dokkyo Medical University School of Medicine, Tochigi, Japan.

Inhibition of AKT1/2 ameliorated this malignant effect, which provides new insight into AML diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and next-step translational investigations.","['Ying, Xiaoyang', 'Zhang, Wanggang', 'Fang, Meiyun', 'Zhang, Weijun', 'Wang, Chenchen', 'Han, Li']","['Ying X', 'Zhang W', 'Fang M', 'Zhang W', 'Wang C', 'Han L']","[""Department of Clinical Hematology, Affiliated No. 2 Hospital School of Medicine, Xi'an Jiaotong University, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital of Dalian University, China.', ""Department of Clinical Hematology, Affiliated No. 2 Hospital School of Medicine, Xi'an Jiaotong University, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital of Dalian University, China.', 'Department of Laboratory, Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital of Dalian University, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital of Dalian University, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital of Dalian University, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20181002,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'leukemia cells proliferation', 'miR-345-5p']",2018/10/03 06:00,2018/10/03 06:00,['2018/10/03 06:00'],"['2018/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.27461 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Cell Biochem. 2018 Oct 2. doi: 10.1002/jcb.27461.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0358-2408'],,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is now well established that migratory birds have the capacity to detect the Earth's magnetic field; it has been reported that power lines are associated with childhood leukemia and that pulsed magnetic fields increase the production of reactive oxidative species (ROS) in cellular systems. Justifiably, studies in this field have been viewed with skepticism, as the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. In the accompanying paper, Sherrard and colleagues report that low-flux pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs) result in aversive behavior in Drosophila larvae and ROS production in cell culture. They further report that these responses require the presence of cryptochrome, a putative magnetoreceptor. If correct, it is conceivable that carcinogenesis associated with power lines, PEMF-induced ROS generation, and animal magnetoreception share a common mechanistic basis.","['Landler, Lukas', 'Keays, David A']","['Landler L', 'Keays DA']","['Research Institute of Molecular Pathology, Vienna Biocentre, Vienna, Austria.', 'Research Institute of Molecular Pathology, Vienna Biocentre, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Comment']",20181002,United States,PLoS Biol,PLoS biology,101183755,"['0 (Cryptochromes)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Child', '*Cryptochromes', '*Electromagnetic Fields', 'Humans', 'Light', 'Magnetic Fields', 'Reactive Oxygen Species']",PMC6168117,,,2018/10/03 06:00,2019/05/02 06:00,['2018/10/03 06:00'],"['2018/10/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pbio.3000018 [doi]', 'PBIOLOGY-D-18-00283 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Biol. 2018 Oct 2;16(10):e3000018. doi: 10.1371/journal.pbio.3000018. eCollection 2018 Oct.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-8343-8002'],['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,['PLoS Biol. 2018 Oct 2;16(10):e2006229.

The effects of ATRA are mediated by nuclear retinoid receptors as well as non-genomic signal pathway, such as MAPK and PKA. The great success of differentiation therapy with ATRA in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) not only improved the prognosis of APL but also spurred the studies of ATRA in the treatment of other tumors. Since the genetic and physiopathological simplicity of APL is not common in human malignancies, the combination of ATRA with other agents (chemotherapy, epigenetic modifiers, and arsenic trioxide, etc) had been extensively investigated in a variety of tumors. In this review, we will discuss in details about ATRA and its role in cancer treatment.","['Ni, Xiaoling', 'Hu, Guohua', 'Cai, Xun']","['Ni X', 'Hu G', 'Cai X']","['a Department of General Surgery , Zhongshan Hospital, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University , Shanghai , China.', 'a Department of General Surgery , Zhongshan Hospital, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University , Shanghai , China.', 'b Shanghai Institute of Hematology and State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics , Rui-jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine , Shanghai , China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20181002,United States,Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,8914818,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",,['NOTNLM'],"['All-trans retinoic acid', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'chemotherapy', 'differentiation', 'epigenetic modifiers', 'retinoic acid receptors']",2018/10/03 06:00,2019/12/04 06:00,['2018/10/03 06:00'],"['2018/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/04 06:00 [medline]', '2018/10/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10408398.2018.1509201 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr. 2019;59(sup1):S71-S80. doi: 10.1080/10408398.2018.1509201.
