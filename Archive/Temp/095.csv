Identification and further targeting of specific junction sites within the sequence of genomic amplicons (amplicon fusion sites, AFS) by PCR (AFS-PCR) is suitable for quantification of minimal residual disease (MRD). This approach has recently been developed and described for MYCN amplified neuroblastomas. To compare AFS-PCR directly to routinely used MRD diagnostic strategies, we mapped the amplified genomic regions (ampGR) of an iAMP21-amplicon in high resolution of a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Successfully, we established AFS-PCR covering junction sites between ampGR within the iAMP21-amplicon. Quantification of MRD by AFS-PCR was directly comparable to IgH/TCR based real time quantitative PCR and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis in consecutive bone marrow (BM) specimens. Our data give an additional proof of concept of AFS-PCR for quantification of MRD. The method could be taken into account for ALL patients with genomic amplifications as alternative MRD diagnostic, if no or qualitatively poor Ig/TCR-PCRs are available.","['Weber, Axel', 'Taube, Sylvia', 'Zur Stadt, Udo', 'Horstmann, Martin', 'Krohn, Knut', 'Bradtke, Jutta', 'Teigler-Schlegel, Andrea', 'Leiblein, Sabine', 'Christiansen, Holger']","['Weber A', 'Taube S', 'Zur Stadt U', 'Horstmann M', 'Krohn K', 'Bradtke J', 'Teigler-Schlegel A', 'Leiblein S', 'Christiansen H']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Hemostaseology, Children's Hospital, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany. axel.weber@humangenetik.med.uni-giessen.de.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121109,England,Exp Hematol Oncol,Experimental hematology & oncology,101590676,PMC3518178,2012/12/06 06:00,2012/12/06 06:01,['2012/12/06 06:00'],"['2012/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/06 06:01 [medline]']","['2162-3619-1-33 [pii]', '10.1186/2162-3619-1-33 [doi]']",epublish,Exp Hematol Oncol. 2012 Nov 9;1(1):33. doi: 10.1186/2162-3619-1-33.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current study is intended to find other gene mutations that collaborate with JAK2V617F to cause leukemic transformation. METHODS: Total RNA and genomic DNA were isolated from two JAK2V617F-positive cell lines, namely, erythroleukemic HEL and megakaryoblastic leukemic SET-2 cells. Candidate genes were amplified by PCR and further sequenced. RESULTS: Homozygous mutations of the TP53 gene which encodes tumor suppressor p53 were found in HEL and SET-2 cells. While HEL cells, which have homozygous JAK2V617F, contain a rare M133K p53 mutation, SET-2 cells, which have a heterozygous JAK2V617F mutation, contain a common R248W p53 alteration. Western blot analyses revealed high levels of p53 expression in both cells. M133K and R248W are located in the DNA binding domain of p53. Structural analyses revealed that they potentially disrupt the interaction of p53 with DNA, thereby causing loss of p53 function. CONCLUSIONS: JAK2V617F and p53 mutations coexist in leukemia cells. We believe that JAK2V617F is able to drive leukemic transformation when the function of tumor suppressor p53 is lost. The interplay of JAK2V617F with p53 may affect the progression of MPNs.","['Zhao, Wanke', 'Du, Yanhong', 'Ho, Wanting Tina', 'Fu, Xueqi', 'Zhao, Zhizhuang Joe']","['Zhao W', 'Du Y', 'Ho WT', 'Fu X', 'Zhao ZJ']","['Department of Pathology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, 73104, USA.

We conducted a retrospective study to analyse how treatment affects male fertility and a perspective study to assess pre-treatment sperm quality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 28 patients, treated in our center or referred to our Medically Assisted Procreation Center, from 2002 to 2011, were selected for the retrospective study and asked if interested in their fertility assessment. Semen samples were taken from 11 patients (mean age 31.55: range 20-45); other possible causes of impaired fertility were excluded. We analyzed pretreatment semen samples of 61 patients (mean age 29.08 +/- 9.5) affected by leukaemia or lymphoma that were selected for the perspective study and referred to the Sperm Bank of Pordenone. All semen samples were analysed accordingly to 1999 World Health Organization guidelines. RESULTS: In the retrospective study all semen samples of the 11 patients selected were altered. Six patients treated with high dose alkylating agents and abdominal/pelvic radiotherapy were found azoospermic, 3 with severe oligoasthenozoospermic, 1 oligoteratozoospermic and 1 asthenozoospermic. In the perspective study pretreatment semen quality was poor in most of the samples of the 61 patients selected. Normozoospermia was observed in 14% of patients affected by Hodgkin lymphoma and in 25% affected by non-Hodgkin lymphoma. CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy, radiotherapy or their combination are followed by a temporary but sometimes irreversible reduction of fertility potential. Pre-treatment semen quality is acceptable to proceed with cyopreservation techniques. Sperm cryopreservation should be offered to all post puberal male patients who have not yet conceived before treatment with gonado-toxic agents.","['de Luyk, Nicolo', 'Pozzato, Gabriele', 'Ricci, Giuseppe', 'Tamaro, Paolo', 'Manno, Massimo', 'Tomei, Francesco', 'Trombetta, Carlo']","['de Luyk N', 'Pozzato G', 'Ricci G', 'Tamaro P', 'Manno M', 'Tomei F', 'Trombetta C']","['Department of Internal Medicine and Haematology, Maggiore General Hospital, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy. ndeluyk@gmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Italy,Arch Ital Urol Androl,"Archivio italiano di urologia, andrologia : organo ufficiale [di] Societa italiana di ecografia urologica e nefrologica",9308247,,2012/12/06 06:00,2013/01/08 06:00,['2012/12/06 06:00'],"['2012/12/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/08 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Arch Ital Urol Androl. 2012 Sep;84(3):141-5.,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Hodgkin Disease/*complications/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Male/*etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*complications/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to poor cellular uptake these effects cannot be studied in live cells, even at millimolar toxin concentrations, nor can phalloidin be used for the elimination of tumor cells. Uptake is greatly enhanced by conjugation of phallotoxins to either lipophilic or polycationic moieties, such as oleic acid, polylysine, or Tat-peptide. These conjugates were lethally toxic for cells, e.g., mouse fibroblasts or Jurkat leukemia cells, in the micromolar range. Uptake into cells starts with the attachment of the toxin conjugates to the plasma membrane, followed by endocytosis and, in most cases, cleavage of the toxin from the carrier. Interestingly, the internalization rate of phalloidin into cells was also significantly increased by the fluorescent moiety tetramethylrhodaminyl, as well as by high molecular weight methoxy-polyethyleneglycol, two compounds unknown so far for their uptake-mediating activity. Conjugation to carriers as investigated in this work will allow the use of phallotoxins in experimental cell biology and possibly in tumor therapy. The findings obtained with phallotoxins could be applied also to the family of amatoxins, where alpha-amanitin, for example, when conjugated to oleic acid was more than 100-fold more toxic for cells than the native toxin. This suggests the possibility of a more general use of the moieties examined here to enhance the uptake of hydrophilic peptides, or drugs, into live cells.","['Anderl, Jan', 'Echner, Hartmut', 'Faulstich, Heinz']","['Anderl J', 'Echner H', 'Faulstich H']","['Heidelberg Pharma GmbH, Schriesheimer Str. 101, 68526 Ladenburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121127,Germany,Beilstein J Org Chem,Beilstein journal of organic chemistry,101250746,PMC3511042,2012/12/05 06:00,2012/12/05 06:01,['2012/12/05 06:00'],"['2012/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3762/bjoc.8.233 [doi]'],ppublish,Beilstein J Org Chem. 2012;8:2072-84. doi: 10.3762/bjoc.8.233.

The identification of factors regulating the early steps of Th1 cell polarization can provide important insight in the development of therapeutics for many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The serine/threonine-specific proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus (PIM) kinases PIM1 and PIM2 have been implicated in the cytokine-dependent proliferation and survival of lymphocytes. We have established that the third member of this family, PIM3, is also expressed in human primary Th cells and identified a new function for the entire PIM kinase family in T lymphocytes. Although PIM kinases are expressed more in Th1 than Th2 cells, we demonstrate here that these kinases positively influence Th1 cell differentiation. Our RNA interference results from human primary Th cells also suggest that PIM kinases promote the production of IFNgamma, the hallmark cytokine produced by Th1 cells. Consistent with this, they also seem to be important for the up-regulation of the critical Th1-driving factor, T box expressed in T cells (T-BET), and the IL-12/STAT4 signaling pathway during the early Th1 differentiation process. In summary, we have identified PIM kinases as new regulators of human primary Th1 cell differentiation, thus providing new insights into the mechanisms controlling the selective development of human Th cell subsets.","['Tahvanainen, Johanna', 'Kylaniemi, Minna K', 'Kanduri, Kartiek', 'Gupta, Bhawna', 'Lahteenmaki, Hanna', 'Kallonen, Teemu', 'Rajavuori, Anna', 'Rasool, Omid', 'Koskinen, Paivi J', 'Rao, Kanury V S', 'Lahdesmaki, Harri', 'Lahesmaa, Riitta']","['Tahvanainen J', 'Kylaniemi MK', 'Kanduri K', 'Gupta B', 'Lahteenmaki H', 'Kallonen T', 'Rajavuori A', 'Rasool O', 'Koskinen PJ', 'Rao KV', 'Lahdesmaki H', 'Lahesmaa R']","['Turku Centre for Biotechnology, University of Turku and Abo Akademi, 20520 Turku, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121203,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,PMC3561529,2012/12/05 06:00,2013/03/30 06:00,['2012/12/05 06:00'],"['2012/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)46424-5 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M112.361709 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2013 Feb 1;288(5):3048-58. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M112.361709.

Herein, we developed novel milatuzumab-conjugated liposomes as a targeted dexamethasone carrier for therapeutic delivery in CD74(+) B-cell malignancies and explored its effect against the disease. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The targeting efficiency of milatuzumab-targeted liposomes to CD74(+) cells was evaluated in vitro. The effect of CD74-targeted liposomal dexamethasone was compared with free dexamethasone in primary CLL cells and cell lines in vitro. The therapeutic efficacy of CD74-targeted liposomal dexamethasone was evaluated in a Raji-severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) xenograft model in vivo. RESULTS: Milatuzumab-targeted liposomes promoted selective incorporation of carrier molecules into transformed CD74-positive B cells as compared with CD74-negative T-cells. The CD74-dexamethasone-targeted liposomes (CD74-IL-DEX) promoted and increased killing in CD74-positive tumor cells and primary CLL cells. Furthermore, the targeted drug liposomes showed enhanced therapeutic efficacy against a CD74-positive B-cell model as compared with free, or non-targeted, liposomal dexamethasone in SCID mice engrafted with Raji cells in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: These studies provide evidence and support for a potential use of CD74-targeted liposomal dexamethasone as a new therapy for B-cell malignancies.","['Mao, Yicheng', 'Triantafillou, Georgia', 'Hertlein, Erin', 'Towns, William', 'Stefanovski, Matthew', 'Mo, Xiaokui', 'Jarjoura, David', 'Phelps, Mitch', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Lee, Ly James', 'Goldenberg, David M', 'Lee, Robert J', 'Byrd, John C', 'Muthusamy, Natarajan']","['Mao Y', 'Triantafillou G', 'Hertlein E', 'Towns W', 'Stefanovski M', 'Mo X', 'Jarjoura D', 'Phelps M', 'Marcucci G', 'Lee LJ', 'Goldenberg DM', 'Lee RJ', 'Byrd JC', 'Muthusamy N']","['Division of Hematology, The Comprehensive Cancer Center, Division of Pharmaceutics and Medicinal Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121203,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,PMC3793126,2012/12/05 06:00,2013/07/05 06:00,['2012/12/05 06:00'],"['2012/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-12-2046 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-2046 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2013 Jan 15;19(2):347-56. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-2046.

The chemotactic drug targeting (CDT) represents a new way for drug delivery approach based on selective chemoattractant guided targeting. The major goal of the present work was to develop and investigate various GnRH-III derivatives as potential targeting moieties for CDT. The cell physiological effects (chemotaxis, adhesion, and signaling) induced by three native GnRHs (hGnRH-I, cGnRH-II, and lGnRH-III) and nine GnRH-III derivatives were evaluated in two model cells (Tetrahymena pyriformis and Mono Mac 6 human monocytes). According to our results, the native GnRH-III elicited the highest chemoattractant and adhesion inducer activities of all synthesized peptides in micromolar concentrations in monocytes. With respect to chemoattraction, dimeric derivatives linked by a disulfide bridge ([GnRH-III(C)](2) ) proved to be efficient in both model cells; furthermore, acetylation of the linker region ([GnRH-III(Ac-C)](2) ) could slightly improve the chemotactic and adhesion effects in monocytes. The length of the peptide and the type of N-terminal amino acid could also determine the chemotactic and adhesion modulation potency of each fragment. The application of the chemoattractant GnRH-III derivatives was accompanied by a significant activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in both model cells. In summary, our work on low-level differentiated model cells of tumors has proved that GnRH-III and some of its synthetic derivatives are promising candidates to be applied in CDT: these compounds might act both as carrier, delivery unit, and antitumor agents.","['Lajko, Eszter', 'Szabo, Ildiko', 'Andody, Katalin', 'Pungor, Andras', 'Mezo, Gabor', 'Kohidai, Laszlo']","['Lajko E', 'Szabo I', 'Andody K', 'Pungor A', 'Mezo G', 'Kohidai L']","['Department of Genetics Cell and Immunobiology, Semmelweis University, Nagyvarad ter. 4, H-1089, Budapest, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121204,England,J Pept Sci,Journal of peptide science : an official publication of the European Peptide Society,9506309,,2012/12/05 06:00,2013/06/06 06:00,['2012/12/05 06:00'],"['2012/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/24 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/psc.2472 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pept Sci. 2013 Jan;19(1):46-58. doi: 10.1002/psc.2472.

DESIGN: Retrospective medical record review. SETTING: Academic medical center. PATIENTS: Seventy-eight patients aged 18 years or older in whom H/IDAC consolidation chemotherapy was initiated for consolidation of AML between November 2004 and November 2010. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patient demographic data, information on the hospitalization for consolidation, data on G-CSF use after H/IDAC chemotherapy, and details on any readmissions were collected. Patients were deemed to have received G-CSF prophylaxis if there was documentation of the intent for use of either filgrastim or pegfilgrastim. Outcome data also were collected, including dates of relapse or second induction treatment course, and death or last follow-up visit. We compared data based on patient receipt of G-CSF (G-CSF vs no G-CSF) after each chemotherapy cycle. We assessed differences in the duration of hospitalization, fever, intravenous antibiotic use, and neutropenia, as well as rate of documented infections, time to disease recurrence, and overall survival. Compared with no G-CSF, use of G-CSF after cycle 1 of H/IDAC significantly reduced the rate of hospitalization for febrile neutropenia (p=0.039); however, no significant differences were noted for subsequent cycles. No significant differences were seen in duration of hospitalization, rate of documented infections, or time to treatment failure between groups. Overall survival was longer for patients who received G-CSF during their first cycle (p=0.018) and for those who received G-CSF during any of their cycles (p=0.04). CONCLUSION: Use of G-CSF prophylaxis after cycle 1 of H/IDAC consolidation for AML appears to reduce the frequency of hospitalization for febrile neutropenia and to increase overall survival compared with no G-CSF use. Prospective, controlled studies are needed to support our findings.","['Bradley, Amber M', 'Deal, Allison M', 'Buie, Larry W', 'van Deventer, Hendrik']","['Bradley AM', 'Deal AM', 'Buie LW', 'van Deventer H']","['Department of Clinical and Administrative Pharmacy, University of Georgia College of Pharmacy, Augusta, GA 30912, USA. abradley@georgiahealth.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,8111305,,2012/12/05 06:00,2013/05/11 06:00,['2012/12/05 06:00'],"['2012/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/phar.1150 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacotherapy. 2012 Dec;32(12):1070-7. doi: 10.1002/phar.1150.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '3A58010674 (pegfilgrastim)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)']",IM,,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Fever/chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Filgrastim', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*prevention & control', 'Polyethylene Glycols', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,,"['(c) 2012 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.']",,,['Expert Rev Hematol. 2013 Apr;6(2):131-3.

In APL cells with PML/RARA fusions, arsenic trioxide and all-trans retinoic acid treatments specifically target the fusion protein for proteasome-dependent degradation, thereby promoting cellular differentiation and clinical remission of disease. In contrast, APL cells expressing PLZF/RARA fusion proteins are largely resistant to similar treatments and prognosis for patients with this translocation is poor. Understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating PLZF/RARA protein stability would provide novel therapeutic targets for PLZF/RARA-associated APL. Toward this end, we have performed an RNAi-based screen to identify factors affecting PLZF/RARA stability. Among the factors identified was the ubiquitin-specific peptidase 37 (USP37). We showed that USP37 interacted with PLZF/RARA through the PLZF moiety and sustained PLZF/RARA steady state levels. Domain mapping study revealed that N-terminal domain of USP37 is required for the PLZF/RARA interaction and protein regulation. Furthermore, overexpression or depletion of USP37 caused an increase or decrease of PLZF/RARA protein half-life, correlating with down- or upregulation of PLZF/RARA poly-ubiquitination, respectively. By PLZF/RARA-transduced primary mouse hematopoietic progenitor cells, we demonstrated that Usp37 knockdown alleviated PLZF/RARA-mediated target gene suppression and cell transformation potential. Altogether, our findings of USP37-modulating PLZF/RARA stability and cell transformation suggest that USP37 is a potential therapeutic target for PLZF/RARA-associated APL.","['Yang, W-C', 'Shih, H-M']","['Yang WC', 'Shih HM']","['1] Molecular Medicine Program, Taiwan International Graduate Program (TIGP), Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan [2] Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Life Science, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan [3] Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121203,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,2012/12/05 06:00,2014/01/01 06:00,['2012/12/05 06:00'],"['2012/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/03 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2012537 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2012.537 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2013 Oct 24;32(43):5167-75. doi: 10.1038/onc.2012.537.

Here we report a novel BCR (breakpoint cluster region)-ABL (c-abl oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase)/GATA1/microRNA-138 (miR-138) circuitry in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). miR-138 expression is downregulated in K562 cells and primary CML samples, which is restored after imatinib treatment. The tumor suppressor activity of miR-138 is demonstrated by the induction of cell cycle arrest at G0/G1, inhibition of cell proliferation and colony forming unit granulocyte-macrophage colony formation and enhanced imatinib-induced apoptosis in K562 and Ku812 cells overexpressing miR-138. Moreover, overexpression of miR-138 led to the downregulation of BCR-ABL. Based on luciferase assay, ABL and BCR-ABL are shown to be the target genes regulated by miR-138. Furthermore, miR-138 binding to ABL was shown to localize to the coding region instead of 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTR) of ABL mRNA. In addition, CCND3 is another target of miR-138, which represses CCND3 expression by binding to its 3'-UTR. Finally, upregulation of miR-138 upon imatinib treatment is associated with the enhancement of GATA1 activity, which binds to the miR-138 promoter. In conclusion, miR-138 is a tumor suppressor miRNA underexpressed in CML. miR-138 represses expression of both BCR-ABL and CCND3 via binding to the coding region and 3'-UTR, respectively. miR-138 expression is activated by GATA1, which in turn is repressed by BCR-ABL. Therefore, miR-138, by virtue of a BCR-ABL/GATA1/miR-138 circuitry, is a tumor suppressor miRNA implicated in the pathogenesis of CML and its clinical response to imatinib.","['Xu, C', 'Fu, H', 'Gao, L', 'Wang, L', 'Wang, W', 'Li, J', 'Li, Y', 'Dou, L', 'Gao, X', 'Luo, X', 'Jing, Y', 'Chim, C-S', 'Zheng, X', 'Yu, L']","['Xu C', 'Fu H', 'Gao L', 'Wang L', 'Wang W', 'Li J', 'Li Y', 'Dou L', 'Gao X', 'Luo X', 'Jing Y', 'Chim CS', 'Zheng X', 'Yu L']","['Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121203,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,2012/12/05 06:00,2014/03/04 06:00,['2012/12/05 06:00'],"['2012/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/03 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/04 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2012557 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2012.557 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2014 Jan 2;33(1):44-54. doi: 10.1038/onc.2012.557.

We evaluated five patients allografted as consolidative treatment with an unrelated donor in first or subsequent remission. Four patients received a reduced intensity-conditioning regimen because of age or co-morbidities. As the stem cell sources, two umbilical cord blood-(UCB), two PBSC- and one BM graft were used. No GVHD was observed in the patients who received a UCB graft. However, both developed a post-transplant-associated lymphoproliferative disease. So far, only one patient has experienced relapse and was consecutively treated by escalated donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI). A potent graft-versus-leukaemia (GVL) effect was induced leading to a 17-month-long CR. Four patients are still in ongoing CR with median disease-free and overall survivals of 17 and 21 months. Thus, allogeneic SCT in BPDCN offers a potential curative option for patients with a compatible donor. UCB is an attractive alternative as a stem cell source.

The study group included 8 patients (3 AML and 5 MDS) and array-based karyotyping was done using whole-genome SNP-A (SNP 6.0 and SNP 2.7M). By SNP-A, additional genomic aberrations not detected by MC were identified in 2 patients: 1 AML patient exhibited a copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH) of 3q21.1-q29 and 11q13.1-q25 and the other patient with MDS (refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia) had CN-LOH of 2p25.3-p15. In particular, the latter patient progressed to AML 18 months after the diagnosis. In 3 patients, aberrations in addition to trisomy 8 were not identified by SNP-A. In the remaining 3 patients, SNP-A could not detect trisomy 8, while trisomy 8 was found in 25-67% of metaphase cells by MC. This study suggests that additional genomic aberrations may in fact be present even in cases of trisomy 8 as sole abnormality by MC, and SNP-A could be a useful karyotyping tool to identify hidden aberrations such as CN-LOH.","['Hahm, Chorong', 'Mun, Yeung Chul', 'Seong, Chu Myong', 'Han, Sung-Hee', 'Chung, Wha Soon', 'Huh, Jungwon']","['Hahm C', 'Mun YC', 'Seong CM', 'Han SH', 'Chung WS', 'Huh J']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Ewha Womans University School of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121130,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,,2012/12/05 06:00,2013/05/25 06:00,['2012/12/05 06:00'],"['2012/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['000343420 [pii]', '10.1159/000343420 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2013;129(3):154-8. doi: 10.1159/000343420.

METHODS: We revised 182 chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia patients treated with frontline imatinib (IM) at two institutions from June 2002 to June 2011. RESULTS: After 3 months of treatment, 138 patients (75.8%) achieved CCyR/MET- while 44 patients (24.2%) still presented Ph+ metaphases (MET+) (<33%, 24 patients; >/=33%, 20 patients). On univariate analysis, palpable spleen enlargement (p < 0.001), WBC count >100.0 x 10(9)/l at onset (p < 0.001), and male gender (p = 0.019) had a negative impact on achievement of CCyR/MET- at 3 months.

The 5-year overall survival was 97.0% in patients CCyR/MET- at 3 months and 91.8% in patients MET+ at 3 months (p = 0.277); the 5-year progression-free survival was 88.2% in patients CCyR/MET- at 3 months and 48.4% in patients MET+ at 3 months (p < 0.001).

Normal individuals harboring XPD polymorphisms are at increased risk for developing acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). CASE REPORT: A 33-year-old male XP patient was diagnosed with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia with a complex karyotype. He received standard induction chemotherapy with cytarabine and daunorubicin. After the first cycle of chemotherapy, persistence of blasts was seen and a re-induction cycle with cytarabine, fludarabine, and idarubicin was administered resulting in complete remission. Due to the high-risk profile of his AML, allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) was performed. Following a conditioning regimen with busulfan and cyclophosphamide, the patient received a matched related SCT from his HLA-identical sister. Despite the existence of his DNA repair gene mutation, chemotherapy was normally tolerated by the patient. Unfortunately, he died due to severe sepsis and relapse of AML 45 days after SCT. CONCLUSION: The XPD mutation in our patient may have contributed to the emergence of his high-risk AML. Despite the existence of a DNA repair gene mutation, our XP patient could be treated with full doses of AML-type chemotherapy including allogeneic SCT without encountering unusual toxicity.","['Janjetovic, Snjezana', 'Bacher, Ulrike', 'Haalck, Thomas', 'Janning, Melanie', 'Bokemeyer, Carsten', 'Fiedler, Walter']","['Janjetovic S', 'Bacher U', 'Haalck T', 'Janning M', 'Bokemeyer C', 'Fiedler W']","['Department of Oncology and Hematology, BMT with Section of Pneumology, Hubertus Wald Tumorzentrum, University Cancer Center Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany. s.janjetovic@uke.de']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20121128,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,,2012/12/05 06:00,2013/04/11 06:00,['2012/12/05 06:00'],"['2012/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/11 06:00 [medline]']","['000342897 [pii]', '10.1159/000342897 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2013;129(2):121-5. doi: 10.1159/000342897.

In the current study, we have compared the transforming activity of p190 BCR/ABL, p210 BCR/ABL and a mutant that lacks GEF activity (p210 BCR/ABL(S509A)). In cell-based, ex vivo, and murine bone marrow transplantation (BMT) assays the transforming activity of p210 BCR/ABL(S509A) mimics p190 BCR/ABL, and is distinct from p210 BCR/ABL. Thus, in the BMT assay, the p190 BCR/ABL- and p210 BCR/ABL(S509A)-transplanted mice exhibit a more rapid onset of disease than mice transplanted with p210 BCR/ABL. The reduced disease latency is associated with erythroid hyperplasia in the absence of anemia, and expansion of the megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitor (MEP), common myeloid progenitor (CMP) and granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP) populations, producing a phenotype that is similar to acute myeloid leukemia (AML-M6). The disease phenotype is readily transplantable into secondary recipients. This is consistent with ex vivo clonogenicity assays, where p210 BCR/ABL preferentially supports the growth of colony forming unit (CFU)-granulocyte-macrophage (GM), whereas p190 BCR/ABL and the mutant preferentially support the growth of burst forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E). These results suggest that the GEF activity that distinguishes p210 BCR/ABL from p190 BCR/ABL actively regulates disease progression.","['Tala, I', 'Chen, R', 'Hu, T', 'Fitzpatrick, E R', 'Williams, D A', 'Whitehead, I P']","['Tala I', 'Chen R', 'Hu T', 'Fitzpatrick ER', 'Williams DA', 'Whitehead IP']","['New Jersey Medical School-University Hospital Cancer Center, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Newark, NJ, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20121204,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC3931524,2012/12/05 06:00,2013/07/20 06:00,['2012/12/05 06:00'],"['2012/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012351 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.351 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Apr;27(5):1080-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.351.

The structure of new compound 2 was elucidated based on the extensive spectroscopic and chemical methods. Among the isolated compounds, three structurally related coumarins 3, 4, and 5 showed significant antiproliferative activities against human leukemia and stomach cancer cell lines. However, these compounds did not affect the cell viabilities of colon cancer, hepatoma, and normal skin fibroblast cell lines. Further analysis demonstrated that the morphological features of apoptosis including DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation were observed in human leukemia HL-60 cells treated with compounds 3, 4, and 5. In addition, compound 3 led to caspase-3 activation and cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and compound 3-induced DNA fragmentation was inhibited by caspase-specific inhibitors.

However, recent evidence has shown that leukemia, like many other tumors displaying pronounced genomic instability, is frequently able to evade this potent graft-versus-leukemia effect by undergoing de novo genomic mutations, which result in the permanent loss of only those HLA molecules targeted by haploidentical donor T-cell alloreactivity.

The minus strand of the HTLV genomes encode the regulatory proteins HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ) for HTLV-1 and antisense protein of HTLV-2 (APH-2) for HTLV-2. Unlike the viral proteins Tax1 and Tax2, both HBZ and APH-2 are constitutively expressed in infected cells suggesting that they may play important roles in the pathogenesis of these viruses. To date, very little is known about the function of APH-2 except that it inhibits Tax2-mediated transcription of HTLV-2 genes. In the present study, we investigated the role of APH-2 in basal and Tax2B-mediated activation of the AP-1 pathway. RESULTS: We demonstrate that, unlike HBZ, APH-2 stimulates basal AP-1 transcription by interacting with c-Jun and JunB through its non-conventional bZIP domain. In addition, when Tax2 and APH-2 are co-expressed, they physically interact in vivo and in vitro and APH-2 acts as an inhibitor of Tax2-mediated activation of AP-1 transcription. CONCLUSIONS: This report is the first to document that HTLV-2 can modulate the AP-1 pathway. Altogether our results reveal that, in contrast with HBZ, APH-2 regulates AP-1 activity in a Tax2-dependant manner. As the AP-1 pathway is involved in numerous cellular functions susceptible to affect the life cycle of the virus, these distinct biological properties between HBZ and APH-2 may contribute to the differential pathogenic potential of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2.","['Marban, Celine', 'McCabe, Aine', 'Bukong, Terence N', 'Hall, William W', 'Sheehy, Noreen']","['Marban C', 'McCabe A', 'Bukong TN', 'Hall WW', 'Sheehy N']","['Centre for Research in Infectious Diseases, School of Medicine and Medical Science, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland. cmarban@unistra.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121203,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,PMC3531308,2012/12/05 06:00,2013/06/12 06:00,['2012/12/05 06:00'],"['2012/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-9-98 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-9-98 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2012 Dec 3;9:98. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-9-98.,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (nicastrin protein)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 2)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Collagenases)']",IM,,"['Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/*metabolism', 'Collagenases/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Protein Transport', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/genetics/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This development has resulted in higher response rates and more profound levels of immunosuppression than with previously used treatments. With the intrinsic immune defect of CLL, the degree and quality of immunosuppression is thus substantially different from that observed during the treatment of other indolent lymphomas and warrants special consideration. Infection with or reactivation of viral diseases such as herpes simplex, varicella zoster, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), hepatitis B and C or JC virus has become a more frequent problem in the management of these patients. However, most data are derived from observational studies, and only a few interventional trials have been planned and reported.

The dog had several enlarged lymph nodes and moderate lymphocytosis. Aspirates of an enlarged inguinal lymph node contained a bimorphic population of large immature lymphocytes and smaller cells with plasmacytoid features. Both cell types often contained a single large cytoplasmic inclusion that varied from clear to pale pink to sky blue. Cytologic changes were interpreted as most consistent with lymphoid neoplasia. Based on the predominantly mature cell morphology and some morphologic heterogeneity, the peripheral lymphocytosis was interpreted as most likely reactive in nature. However, the immunophenotype of the cells (CD20+, CD21+, CD79a+, MUM-1+, and MHCII+) and clonality assays showed that tissue and blood lymphocytes were neoplastic B cells with clonal identity despite their different morphologic appearances. The cytoplasmic inclusions were positive with periodic acid-Schiff and were immunoreactive for IgM and IgG. By transmission electron microscopy, inclusions consisted of aberrant rough endoplasmic reticulum; a few small Russell bodies were also noted. A final diagnosis of high-grade B-cell lymphoma with plasmacytoid differentiation, atypical cytoplasmic inclusions, and secondary leukemia was made. Chemotherapy was initiated, but the dog was euthanized due to severe and uncontrolled seizures 9 months after the initial diagnosis. This case extends the morphologic repertoire of canine plasmacytoid neoplasms and emphasizes their continuum with multicentric lymphoma. This case also demonstrates the need for advanced diagnostic techniques in establishing blood involvement in lymphoma in some instances.","['Kol, A', 'Christopher, M M', 'Skorupski, K A', 'Tokarz, D', 'Vernau, W']","['Kol A', 'Christopher MM', 'Skorupski KA', 'Tokarz D', 'Vernau W']","['Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California-Davis, Davis, CA 95616, USA. akol@ucdavis.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20121203,United States,Vet Clin Pathol,Veterinary clinical pathology,9880575,,2012/12/05 06:00,2013/08/29 06:00,['2012/12/05 06:00'],"['2012/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/vcp.12003 [doi]'],ppublish,Vet Clin Pathol. 2013 Mar;42(1):40-6. doi: 10.1111/vcp.12003.

When LIF is withdrawn, mESCs tend to differentiate; this differentiation process can be enhanced by the introduction of exogenous fibroblast growth factor (FGF). Here, we show that even in the presence of exogenous FGF1, mESCs can maintain self-renewal and expression of pluripotency markers in the presence of LIF. To elucidate the mechanism in which LIF dominates over the FGF1, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) signaling of mESCs cultured in a medium containing FGF1 or LIF/FGF1 was examined. The results demonstrate that Erk1/2 was activated by FGF1 in the absence of LIF; however, the FGF1-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation was suppressed when LIF was introduced. Moreover, FGF1-Erk1/2 downregulation was inhibited by a signal transducer and activator of the transcription 3 (Stat3) inhibitor WP1066, suggesting that LIF-induced Stat3 activation plays an important role in the FGF1-Erk1/2 inhibition in mESCs. We further demonstrate that the binding affinity of phospho-Erk1/2 and Sprouty2 was increased via Stat3 activation. Binding of phospho-Erk1/2 and Sprouty2 blocks the activation of Erk1/2 signaling, thus inhibiting the downstream differentiation process in mESCs. Our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that LIF-induced Stat3 phosphorylation plays an important role in promoting the binding of phospho-Erk1/2 and Sprouty2, and thus inhibiting FGF-induced differentiation.","['Liu, Jen-Wei', 'Hsu, Yi-Chao', 'Kao, Chien-Yu', 'Su, Hong-Lin', 'Chiu, Ing-Ming']","['Liu JW', 'Hsu YC', 'Kao CY', 'Su HL', 'Chiu IM']","['Institute of Cellular and System Medicine , National Health Research Institutes, Miaoli, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20130130,United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,,2012/12/05 06:00,2013/11/01 06:00,['2012/12/05 06:00'],"['2012/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/scd.2012.0229 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2013 Apr 15;22(8):1190-7. doi: 10.1089/scd.2012.0229.

The identity of these aberrantly-expressed miRNAs has been thoroughly investigated in all but a few types of lymphomas, however their functional role in lymphomagenesis much less so. This review focuses on those miRNAs that have an experimentally confirmed functional role in the pathogenesis of the most frequent forms of lymphoma. In particular, the MIR15A/16-1 cluster, MIR21, MIR155, MIR17HG (MIR17-92 cluster), MIR34A and MIR125B, which have in vivo animal model evidence for their involvement in lymphomagenesis, are highlighted.","['Lawrie, Charles H']",['Lawrie CH'],"['Biodonostia Research Institute, San Sebastian, Spain. charles.lawrie@biodonostia.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20121204,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,2012/12/05 06:00,2013/04/13 06:00,['2012/12/05 06:00'],"['2012/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.12157 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2013 Mar;160(5):571-81. doi: 10.1111/bjh.12157.

Understand the genetic basis of CLL may help in clarifying the molecular bases of this clinical heterogeneity. Recurrent chromosomal aberrations at 13q14, 12q, 11q22-q23 and 17p13, and TP53 mutations are the first genetic lesions identified as drivers of the disease. While some of these lesions are associated with poor outcome (17p13 deletion, TP53 mutations and, to a lesser extent, 11q22-q23 deletion) others are linked to a favorable course (13q14 deletion as sole aberration). Recently, next generation sequencing has revealed additional recurrent alterations in CLL targeting the NOTCH1, SF3B1, and BIRC3 genes. NOTCH1, SF3B1, and BIRC3 lesions provide: I) new insights on the mechanisms of leukemogenesis, tumor progression and chemoresistance in this leukemia; II) new biomarkers for the identification of poor risk patients, having individually shown correlations with survival in CLL; and III) new therapeutic targets, especially in the setting of high risk disease. This review will summarize the most important genetic aberrations in CLL and how our improved knowledge of the genome of leukemic cells may translate into improved patients' management.","['Rossi, Davide', 'Fangazio, Marco', 'Gaidano, Gianluca']","['Rossi D', 'Fangazio M', 'Gaidano G']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Amedeo Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121113,Italy,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis,Mediterranean journal of hematology and infectious diseases,101530512,PMC3507527,2012/12/04 06:00,2012/12/04 06:01,['2012/12/04 06:00'],"['2012/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4084/MJHID.2012.076 [doi]', 'mjhid-4-1-e2012076 [pii]']",ppublish,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis. 2012;4(1):e2012076. doi: 10.4084/MJHID.2012.076.

In the early nineties of the last century, long before the advent of fludarabine or antibody-based strategies, there was realistic hope that myeloablative therapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (autoSCT) might be an effective and potentially curative front-line treatment option for suitable patients with CLL. Since then, several prospective trials have disenthralled this hope: although autoSCT can prolong event and progression-free survival if used as part of early front-line treatment, it does not improve overall survival, while it is associated with an increased risk of late adverse events such as secondary malignancies. In addition, autoSCT lacks the potential to overcome the negative impact of biomarkers that confer resistance to chemotherapy or early relapse. The role of autoSCT has also been explored in the context of FCR, and it was demonstrated that its effect is inferior to the currently established optimal treatment regimen. In view of ongoing attempts to improve on FCR, promising clinical activity of new substances even in relapsed/ refractory CLL patients, exciting novel cell therapy approaches and advantages in the understanding of the disease and detection of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD), autoSCT has lost its place as a standard treatment option for CLL.","['McClanahan, Fabienne', 'Dreger, Peter']","['McClanahan F', 'Dreger P']","['Department of Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany ; Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary, University of London, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121106,Italy,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis,Mediterranean journal of hematology and infectious diseases,101530512,PMC3507531,2012/12/04 06:00,2012/12/04 06:01,['2012/12/04 06:00'],"['2012/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4084/MJHID.2012.071 [doi]', 'mjhid-4-1-e2012071 [pii]']",ppublish,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis. 2012;4(1):e2012071. doi: 10.4084/MJHID.2012.071.

The immunodeficiency and natural infectious history of alkylator-resistant, corticosteroid-treated patients appears to have changed with the administration of purine analogs, which has been complicated by very severe and unusual infections and also more viral infections due to sustained reduction of CD4-positive T lymphocytes.

In this study, we examined the effects of 5-FU treatment on cell growth in HCC cells with or without Bmi-1 depletion. The IC(50) values of 5-FU were significantly decreased to a greater extent in cells with Bmi-1 knockdown. Depletion of Bmi-1 increased sensitivity of the cells to 5-FU and increased apoptosis. Knockdown of endogenous Bmi-1 led to a substantial reduction in the levels of phospho-AKT and Bcl-2 with a concomitant increase in the levels of Bax. Additionally, 5-FU induced the conversion/turnover of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3). Knockdown of endogenous Bmi-1 led to an increase in the levels of Beclin-1 and the accumulation of LC3-II. Together, these findings reveal that Bmi-1 depletion enhanced the chemosensitivity of HCC cells by inducing apoptosis and autophagy, which is associated with the PI3K/AKT and Bcl-2/Beclin-1 pathways.","['Wu, Jing', 'Hu, Dong', 'Zhang, Rongbo']","['Wu J', 'Hu D', 'Zhang R']","['Department of Medical Immunology, School of Medicine, Anhui University of Science and Technology, Huainan, Anhui 232001, P.R.

These advances affect treatment guidelines for CML and inform CML clinical trial protocols.Guidelines developed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and European LeukemiaNet (ELN) synthesize the best available evidence to support decision-making in the management of CML patients. Both guidelines recognize specific milestones for treatment response. At each time point, the ELN guidelines define overall response benchmarks, and the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) provide an algorithm that specifies the timing for evaluations of cytogenetic and molecular parameters during therapy. The NCCN Guidelines also include strategies for providing supportive care and for managing toxicities. Molecular monitoring now plays a greater role in CML management. Molecular response as a milestone is currently recommended by the ELN but has not yet been adopted by the NCCN.

In this review, we outline the causes of this revolution, including the identification of a critical driving molecular aberration, BCR-ABL, and the development of a potent and specific inhibitor, imatinib. Equally important was the timing of the targeted therapy, specifically its administration to patients with newly diagnosed disease. In solid tumors, targeted therapies are often both developed and used in metastatic malignancies after conventional approaches have failed. We postulate that this strategy is similar to using imatinib in blast-crisis CML, in which response rates are less than 15%, all patients relapse, and median survival remains only about 1 year. We hypothesize that the imatinib-led revolution in CML, including the critically important factor of timing, may be applicable to other cancers as well. Therefore, it will be important to use promising targeted therapies in the earliest phases of biomarker-defined solid tumors, before metastatic progression, to determine if outcomes can be significantly improved and, thus, establish if the success of imatinib in CML is an anomaly or a paradigm.","['Westin, Jason R', 'Kurzrock, Razelle']","['Westin JR', 'Kurzrock R']","['Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston TX 77030, USA. jwestin@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20121130,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,PMC4107422,2012/12/04 06:00,2013/08/29 06:00,['2012/12/04 06:00'],"['2012/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-12-0473 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-12-0473 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2012 Dec;11(12):2549-55. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-12-0473.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A GWAS of paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity was conducted in 247 LCLs from the HapMap Project and compared with a GWAS of sensory peripheral neuropathy in patients with breast cancer (n = 855) treated with paclitaxel in the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 40101 trial. Significant enrichment was assessed by permutation resampling analysis. RESULTS: We observed an enrichment of LCL cytotoxicity-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the sensory peripheral neuropathy-associated SNPs from the clinical trial with concordant allelic directions of effect (empirical P = 0.007). Of the 24 SNPs that overlap between the clinical trial (P < 0.05) and the preclinical cytotoxicity study (P < 0.001), 19 of them are expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), which is a significant enrichment of this functional class (empirical P = 0.0447). One of these eQTLs is located in RFX2, which encodes a member of the DNA-binding regulatory factor X family. Decreased expression of this gene by siRNA resulted in increased sensitivity of Neuroscreen-1(NS-1; rat pheochromocytoma) cells to paclitaxel as measured by reduced neurite outgrowth and increased cytotoxicity, functionally validating the involvement of RFX2 in nerve cell response to paclitaxel. CONCLUSIONS: The enrichment results and functional example imply that cellular models of chemotherapeutic toxicity may capture components of the underlying polygenic architecture of related traits in patients.","['Wheeler, Heather E', 'Gamazon, Eric R', 'Wing, Claudia', 'Njiaju, Uchenna O', 'Njoku, Chidiamara', 'Baldwin, Robert Michael', 'Owzar, Kouros', 'Jiang, Chen', 'Watson, Dorothy', 'Shterev, Ivo', 'Kubo, Michiaki', 'Zembutsu, Hitoshi', 'Winer, Eric P', 'Hudis, Clifford A', 'Shulman, Lawrence N', 'Nakamura, Yusuke', 'Ratain, Mark J', 'Kroetz, Deanna L', 'Cox, Nancy J', 'Dolan, Mary Eileen']","['Wheeler HE', 'Gamazon ER', 'Wing C', 'Njiaju UO', 'Njoku C', 'Baldwin RM', 'Owzar K', 'Jiang C', 'Watson D', 'Shterev I', 'Kubo M', 'Zembutsu H', 'Winer EP', 'Hudis CA', 'Shulman LN', 'Nakamura Y', 'Ratain MJ', 'Kroetz DL', 'Cox NJ', 'Dolan ME']","['Sections of Hematology/Oncology and Genetic Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121130,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,PMC3549006,2012/12/04 06:00,2013/07/05 06:00,['2012/12/04 06:00'],"['2012/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-12-2618 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-2618 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2013 Jan 15;19(2):491-9. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-2618.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: K562 and LAMA84 cells sensitive or resistant to imatinib mesylate and primary CML cells were exposed to BI2536 and vorinostat. Effects on cell viability and signaling pathways were determined using flow cytometry, Western blotting, and gene transfection. K562 and BV173/E255K animal models were used to test in vivo efficacy. RESULTS: Cotreatment with BI2536 and vorinostat synergistically induced cell death in parental or imatinib mesylate-resistant BCR/ABL(+) cells and primary CD34(+) bone marrow cells but was minimally toxic to normal cells. BI2536/vorinostat cotreatment triggered pronounced mitochondrial dysfunction, inhibition of p-BCR/ABL, caspase activation, PARP cleavage, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and DNA damage (manifest by increased expression of gammaH2A.X, p-ATM, p-ATR), events attenuated by the antioxidant TBAP. PLK1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown significantly increased HDACI lethality, whereas HDAC1-3 shRNA knockdown reciprocally increased BI2536-induced apoptosis. Genetic interruption of the DNA damage linker H1.2 partially but significantly reduced PLK1/HDAC inhibitor-mediated cell death, suggesting a functional role for DNA damage in lethality. Finally, BI2536/vorinostat cotreatment dramatically reduced tumor growth in both subcutaneous and systemic BCR/ABL(+) leukemia xenograft models and significantly enhanced animal survival. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that concomitant PLK1 and HDAC inhibition is active against imatinib mesylate-sensitive or refractory CML and ALL cells both in vitro and in vivo and that this strategy warrants further evaluation in the setting of BCR/ABL(+) leukemias.","['Dasmahapatra, Girija', 'Patel, Hiral', 'Nguyen, Tri', 'Attkisson, Elisa', 'Grant, Steven']","['Dasmahapatra G', 'Patel H', 'Nguyen T', 'Attkisson E', 'Grant S']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20121130,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,PMC3548959,2012/12/04 06:00,2013/07/05 06:00,['2012/12/04 06:00'],"['2012/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-12-2799 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-2799 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2013 Jan 15;19(2):404-14. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-2799.

To study whether this separation was possible in an MHC-matched murine BMT model (B10.BR-->CBA) with a CBA-derived myeloid leukemia line, MMC6, we used TCR Vbeta CDR3-size spectratype analysis to first show that the Vbeta13 family was highly skewed in the B10.BR anti-MMC6 CD8(+) T cell response but not in the alloresponse against recipient cells alone. Transplantation of CD8(+)Vbeta13(+) T cells at the dose equivalent of their constituency in 1 x 10(7) CD8(+) T cells, a dose that had been shown to mediate lethal GVHD in recipient mice, induced a slight GVL response with no concomitant GVHD. Increasing doses of CD8(+)Vbeta13(+) T cells led to more significant GVL responses but also increased GVHD symptoms and associated mortality. Subsequent spectratype analysis of GVHD target tissues revealed involvement of gut-infiltrating CD8(+)Vbeta13(+) T cells accounting for the observed in vivo effects. When BMT recipients were given MMC6-presensitized CD8(+)Vbeta13(+) T cells, they displayed a significant GVL response with minimal GVHD. Spectratype analysis of tumor-presensitized, gut-infiltrating CD8(+)Vbeta13(+) T cells showed preferential usage of tumor-reactive CDR3-size lengths, and these cells expressed increased effector memory phenotype (CD44(+)CD62L(-/lo)). Thus, Vbeta spectratyping can identify T cells involved in antihost and antitumor reactivity and tumor presensitization can aid in the separation of GVHD and GVL responses.","['Fanning, Stacey L', 'Zilberberg, Jenny', 'Stein, Johann', 'Vazzana, Kristin', 'Berger, Stephanie A', 'Korngold, Robert', 'Friedman, Thea M']","['Fanning SL', 'Zilberberg J', 'Stein J', 'Vazzana K', 'Berger SA', 'Korngold R', 'Friedman TM']","['John Theurer Cancer Center, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ 07601, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20121130,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,PMC3529851,2012/12/04 06:00,2013/03/13 06:00,['2012/12/04 06:00'],"['2012/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1201641 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1201641 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2013 Jan 1;190(1):447-57. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1201641.

In the present study, we retrospectively analyzed the outcome of patients with BPDCN who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) or autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT). A total of 39 patients (allo-SCT, n = 34; auto-SCT, n = 5) were identified in the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry. The 34 allo-SCT patients had a median age of 41 years (range, 10-70) and received transplantations from sibling (n = 11) or unrelated donors (n = 23) between 2003 and 2009. MAC was used in 74% of patients. Nineteen allo-SCT patients (56%) received transplantations in first complete remission. The 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse, disease-free survival, and overall survival was 32%, 33%, and 41%, respectively.

We examined the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a home-based, computerized working memory training program, CogmedRM, with survivors of childhood cancer. METHODS: Survivors of brain tumors or ALL (n = 20) with identified deficits in attention and/or working memory were randomized to either the success-adapted computer intervention or a non-adaptive, active control condition. Specifically, children in the adaptive condition completed exercises that became more challenging with each correct trial, whereas those in the non-adaptive version trained with exercises that never increased in difficulty. All participants were asked to complete 25 training sessions at home, with weekly, phone-based coaching support. Brief assessments were completed pre-intervention and post-intervention; outcome measures included both performance-based and parent-report measures of working memory and attention. RESULTS: Eighty-five percent of survivors were compliant with the intervention, with no adverse events reported. After controlling for baseline intellectual functioning, survivors who completed the intervention program evidenced significant post-training improvements in their visual working memory and in parent-rated learning problems compared with those in the active control group. No differences in verbal working memory functioning were evident between groups, however. CONCLUSIONS: Home-based, computerized cognitive training demonstrates good feasibility and acceptability in our sample. Children with higher intellectual functioning at baseline appeared to benefit more from the training, although further study is needed to clarify the strength, scope, and particularly the generalizability of potential treatment effects.","['Hardy, Kristina K', 'Willard, Victoria W', 'Allen, Taryn M', 'Bonner, Melanie J']","['Hardy KK', 'Willard VW', 'Allen TM', 'Bonner MJ']","[""Center for Neuroscience and Behavioral Medicine, Neuropsychology Division, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC 20010, USA. khardy@childrensnational.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20121202,England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,PMC4131851,2012/12/04 06:00,2014/07/30 06:00,['2012/12/04 06:00'],"['2012/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/08 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pon.3222 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2013 Aug;22(8):1856-65. doi: 10.1002/pon.3222.

In this study, we investigated its activity on human K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cells. Mere15 inhibited the growth of K562 cells with IC(5)(0) values of 38.2 mug/mL. Mere15 also caused concentration dependent induction of apoptosis, with overproduction of reactive oxygen species and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Moreover, Mere15 arrested cell cycle progression at G(0)/G(1) phase of K562 cells in a concentration dependent manner. In addition, Mere15 caused the disassembly of the microtubule cytoskeleton in K562 cells and inhibited the polymerization of tubulin in a cell free system via interaction with tubulin. We concluded that Mere15 was cytotoxic to K562 leukemia cells and the cytotoxicity was related to the apoptosis induction, cell cycle arrest and microtubule disassembly.

In our experiments, P-gp was expressed in L1210 mice leukemia cells (S cells) by selection with vincristine (R cells) or transfection with the gene encoding human P-gp (T cells). Remodeling of cell surface sugars is associated with P-gp expression in L1210 cells as a secondary cellular response. In this study, we monitored the alteration of cell surface saccharides by Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA), wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and Maackia amurensis agglutinin (MAA). Sialic acid is predominantly linked to the surface of S, R and T cells via alpha-2,6 branched sugars that tightly bind SNA. The presence of sialic acid linked to the cell surface via alpha-2,3 branched sugars was negligible, and the binding of MAA (recognizing this branch) was much less pronounced than SNA. WGA induced greater cell death than SNA, which was bound to the cell surface and agglutinated all three L1210 cell-variants more effectively than WGA. Thus, the ability of lectins to induce cell death did not correlate with their binding efficiency and agglutination potency. Compared to S cells, P-gp positive R and T cells contain a higher amount of N-acetyl-glucosamine on their cell surface, which is associated with improved WGA binding. Both P-gp positive variants of L1210 cells are strongly resistant to vincristine as P-gp prototypical drug. This resistance could not be altered by liberalization of terminal sialyl residues from the cell surface by sialidase.","['Bubencikova, Tatiana', 'Cholujova, Dana', 'Messingerova, Lucia', 'Mislovicova, Danica', 'Seres, Mario', 'Breier, Albert', 'Sulova, Zdena']","['Bubencikova T', 'Cholujova D', 'Messingerova L', 'Mislovicova D', 'Seres M', 'Breier A', 'Sulova Z']","['Institute of Molecular Physiology and Genetics, Center of Excellence of the Slovak Research and Development Agency ""BIOMEMBRANES2008"", Slovak Academy of Sciences, Vlarska 5, Bratislava 83334, Slovakia. tatiana.kurucova@savba.sk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121116,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,PMC3509634,2012/12/04 06:00,2012/12/04 06:01,['2012/12/04 06:00'],"['2012/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/09 00:00 [revised]', '2012/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/04 06:01 [medline]']","['ijms131115177 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms131115177 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2012 Nov 16;13(11):15177-92. doi: 10.3390/ijms131115177.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Agglutinins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Immunoglobulin-like Lectins)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Agglutination', 'Agglutinins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate/metabolism', '*Gene Expression', '*Glycomics', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Neuraminidase/chemistry/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Sialic Acid Binding Immunoglobulin-like Lectins/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,['NLM: Original DateCompleted: 20121204'],,,,,,,,,,,

The last decade has witnessed great research interest in biological activities of phenolic compounds that include anticancer, anti-oxidation and anti-inflammation, among other things. A large number of anticancer agents combat cancer through cell cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis and differentiation, as well as through inhibition of cell growth and proliferation, or a combination of two or more of these mechanisms. Various phenolic compounds from different sources have been reported to be promising anticancer agents by acting through one of these mechanisms. Honey, which has a long history of human consumption both for medicinal and nutritional uses, contains a variety of phenolic compounds such as flavonoids, phenolic acids, coumarins and tannins. This paper presents a review on the molecular mechanisms of the anti-leukemic activity of various phenolic compounds on cell cycle, cell growth and proliferation and apoptosis, and it advocates that more studies should be conducted to determine the potential role of honey in both chemoprevention and chemotherapy in leukemia.","['Abubakar, Murtala B', 'Abdullah, Wan Zaidah', 'Sulaiman, Siti Amrah', 'Suen, Ang Boon']","['Abubakar MB', 'Abdullah WZ', 'Sulaiman SA', 'Suen AB']","['Department of Physiology, School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, 16150 Kubang Kerian, Kelantan, Malaysia. murtalababubakar@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20121115,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,PMC3509627,2012/12/04 06:00,2012/12/04 06:01,['2012/12/04 06:00'],"['2012/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/10 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/04 06:01 [medline]']","['ijms131115054 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms131115054 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2012 Nov 15;13(11):15054-73. doi: 10.3390/ijms131115054.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phenols)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Honey/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism', 'Phenols/chemistry/*pharmacology']",,,,,,,,,,,,['NLM: Original DateCompleted: 20121204'],,,,,,,,,,,

Today, growing evidence supports the fact that intracellular drivers of tumor progression do not flow in a single linear pathway, but disseminate into multiple intracellular pathways. An improved understanding of the complexity of cancer depends on the elucidation of the underlying regulatory networks at the cellular and intercellular levels and in their temporal dimension. The high complexity of the intracellular cascades causes the complete inhibition of the growth of one tumor cell to be very unlikely, except in cases in which the so-called &ldquo;oncogene addiction&rdquo; is known to be a clear trigger for tumor catastrophe, such as in the case of gastrointestinal stromal tumors or chronic myeloid leukemia. In other words, the separation and isolation of the driver from the passengers is required to improve accuracy in cancer treatment. This review will summarize the signaling pathway crossroads that govern renal cell carcinoma proliferation and the emerging understanding of how these pathways facilitate tumor escape. We outline the available evidence supporting the putative links between different signaling pathways and how they may influence tumor proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, metabolism and invasiveness. The conclusion is that tumor cells may generate their own crossroads/crosstalk among signaling pathways, thereby reducing their dependence on stimulation of their physiologic pathways.","['Gallego, Guadalupe Aparicio', 'Villaamil, Vanessa Medina', 'Grande, Enrique', 'Cainzos, Isabel Santamarina', 'Aparicio, Luis M Anton']","['Gallego GA', 'Villaamil VM', 'Grande E', 'Cainzos IS', 'Aparicio LM']","['Biomedical Research Institute (INIBIC), CHU A Coruna, Xubias de Abaixo s/n, PC 15006, A Coruna, Spain. vanessa.medina.villaamil@sergas.es.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20121005,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,PMC3497295,2012/12/04 06:00,2012/12/04 06:01,['2012/12/04 06:00'],"['2012/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/11 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/04 06:01 [medline]']","['ijms131012710 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms131012710 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2012 Oct 5;13(10):12710-33. doi: 10.3390/ijms131012710.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/*pathology', 'ErbB Receptors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1/metabolism', 'Kidney Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Receptors, Notch/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,['NLM: Original DateCompleted: 20121204'],,,,,,,,,,,

Conversely, CDX2 acts as a tumor suppressor in colonic epithelium. The effectors mediating the leukemogenic activity of CDX2 and the mechanism underlying its context-dependent properties are poorly characterized, and strategies for interfering with CDX2 function in AML remain elusive. We report data implicating repression of the transcription factor KLF4 as important for the oncogenic activity of CDX2, and demonstrate that CDX2 differentially regulates KLF4 in AML versus colon cancer cells through a mechanism that involves tissue-specific patterns of promoter binding and epigenetic modifications. Furthermore, we identified deregulation of the PPARgamma signaling pathway as a feature of CDX2-associated AML and observed that PPARgamma agonists derepressed KLF4 and were preferentially toxic to CDX2+ leukemic cells. These data delineate transcriptional programs associated with CDX2 expression in hematopoietic cells, provide insight into the antagonistic duality of CDX2 function in AML versus colon cancer, and suggest reactivation of KLF4 expression, through modulation of PPARgamma signaling, as a therapeutic modality in a large proportion of AML patients.","['Faber, Katrin', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Ragu, Christine', 'Garding, Angela', 'Mertens, Daniel', 'Miller, Christina', 'Martin, Daniela', 'Walcher, Daniel', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Claus, Rainer', 'Plass, Christoph', 'Sykes, Stephen M', 'Lane, Steven W', 'Scholl, Claudia', 'Frohling, Stefan']","['Faber K', 'Bullinger L', 'Ragu C', 'Garding A', 'Mertens D', 'Miller C', 'Martin D', 'Walcher D', 'Dohner K', 'Dohner H', 'Claus R', 'Plass C', 'Sykes SM', 'Lane SW', 'Scholl C', 'Frohling S']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121203,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,PMC3533294,2012/12/04 06:00,2013/03/12 06:00,['2012/12/04 06:00'],"['2012/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['64745 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI64745 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2013 Jan;123(1):299-314. doi: 10.1172/JCI64745.

To identify new therapeutic strategies for AML, we screened a library of on- and off-patent drugs and identified the antimalarial agent mefloquine as a compound that selectively kills AML cells and AML stem cells in a panel of leukemia cell lines and in mice. Using a yeast genome-wide functional screen for mefloquine sensitizers, we identified genes associated with the yeast vacuole, the homolog of the mammalian lysosome. Consistent with this, we determined that mefloquine disrupts lysosomes, directly permeabilizes the lysosome membrane, and releases cathepsins into the cytosol. Knockdown of the lysosomal membrane proteins LAMP1 and LAMP2 resulted in decreased cell viability, as did treatment of AML cells with known lysosome disrupters. Highlighting a potential therapeutic rationale for this strategy, leukemic cells had significantly larger lysosomes compared with normal cells, and leukemia-initiating cells overexpressed lysosomal biogenesis genes. These results demonstrate that lysosomal disruption preferentially targets AML cells and AML progenitor cells, providing a rationale for testing lysosomal disruption as a novel therapeutic strategy for AML.","['Sukhai, Mahadeo A', 'Prabha, Swayam', 'Hurren, Rose', 'Rutledge, Angela C', 'Lee, Anna Y', 'Sriskanthadevan, Shrivani', 'Sun, Hong', 'Wang, Xiaoming', 'Skrtic, Marko', 'Seneviratne, Ayesh', 'Cusimano, Maria', 'Jhas, Bozhena', 'Gronda, Marcela', 'MacLean, Neil', 'Cho, Eunice E', 'Spagnuolo, Paul A', 'Sharmeen, Sumaiya', 'Gebbia, Marinella', 'Urbanus, Malene', 'Eppert, Kolja', 'Dissanayake, Dilan', 'Jonet, Alexia', 'Dassonville-Klimpt, Alexandra', 'Li, Xiaoming', 'Datti, Alessandro', 'Ohashi, Pamela S', 'Wrana, Jeff', 'Rogers, Ian', 'Sonnet, Pascal', 'Ellis, William Y', 'Corey, Seth J', 'Eaves, Connie', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Wang, Jean C Y', 'Dick, John E', 'Nislow, Corey', 'Giaever, Guri', 'Schimmer, Aaron D']","['Sukhai MA', 'Prabha S', 'Hurren R', 'Rutledge AC', 'Lee AY', 'Sriskanthadevan S', 'Sun H', 'Wang X', 'Skrtic M', 'Seneviratne A', 'Cusimano M', 'Jhas B', 'Gronda M', 'MacLean N', 'Cho EE', 'Spagnuolo PA', 'Sharmeen S', 'Gebbia M', 'Urbanus M', 'Eppert K', 'Dissanayake D', 'Jonet A', 'Dassonville-Klimpt A', 'Li X', 'Datti A', 'Ohashi PS', 'Wrana J', 'Rogers I', 'Sonnet P', 'Ellis WY', 'Corey SJ', 'Eaves C', 'Minden MD', 'Wang JC', 'Dick JE', 'Nislow C', 'Giaever G', 'Schimmer AD']","['Princess Margaret Hospital/the Ontario Cancer Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121203,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,PMC3533286,2012/12/04 06:00,2013/03/12 06:00,['2012/12/04 06:00'],"['2012/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['64180 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI64180 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2013 Jan;123(1):315-28. doi: 10.1172/JCI64180.

The two viruses differ in their potential to cause disease. FeLV is more pathogenic, and was long considered to be responsible for more clinical syndromes than any other agent in cats. FeLV can cause tumors (mainly lymphoma), bone marrow suppression syndromes (mainly anemia), and lead to secondary infectious diseases caused by suppressive effects of the virus on bone marrow and the immune system. Today, FeLV is less commonly diagnosed than in the previous 20 years; prevalence has been decreasing in most countries. However, FeLV importance may be underestimated as it has been shown that regressively infected cats (that are negative in routinely used FeLV tests) also can develop clinical signs. FIV can cause an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome that increases the risk of opportunistic infections, neurological diseases, and tumors. In most naturally infected cats, however, FIV itself does not cause severe clinical signs, and FIV-infected cats may live many years without any health problems. This article provides a review of clinical syndromes in progressively and regressively FeLV-infected cats as well as in FIV-infected cats.","['Hartmann, Katrin']",['Hartmann K'],"['Medizinische Kleintierklinik, LMU University of Munich, Germany, Veterinaerstrasse 13, 80539 Munich, Germany. hartmann@uni-muenchen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20121031,Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,PMC3509668,2012/12/04 06:00,2013/05/17 06:00,['2012/12/04 06:00'],"['2012/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/24 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/17 06:00 [medline]']","['v4112684 [pii]', '10.3390/v4112684 [doi]']",epublish,Viruses. 2012 Oct 31;4(11):2684-710. doi: 10.3390/v4112684.,,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cats', 'Disease Progression', 'Feline Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/diagnosis/*virology', 'Humans', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/*physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*physiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A retrospective study focused on the response, prognostic factors and side-effects of INF-alpha. RESULTS: 118 patients (67 males and 51 females, median age 50 years; range 18-71) were analyzed. The median follow-up was 82.6 months (12.4-212.6). Thirty-six patients (30.5%) achieved major cytogenetic response (CyR) in median of 18.3 months (3.7-47.3) and maintained it for a median of 64.0 months (7.0-176.0). Sixty-one patients treated with INF-alpha for more than 12 months had an overall survival (OS) of 137.0 months (95% CI 117.6-156.4). Eighteen (29.5%) achieved complete CyR (CCyR). 109 patients discontinued the treatment with INF-alpha because of hematologic or cytogenetic resistance in 53 (48.7%), progression of CML in 31 (28.4%) and intolerance to INF-alpha in 17 (15.6%) patients. The percentage of peripheral blasts, leukocyte count (>50x10(9)/L), splenomegaly, anemia (Hgb</=110 g/L) and Sokal score had statistical impact on the OS in univariate assessment but only the Sokal score remained significant in multivariate analysis. Additional cytogenetic abnormalities at diagnosis were associated with poor prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: In most patients, treatment with INF-alpha had to be stopped because of a failure to induce response, progression of CML or side-effects but nearly one third of patients treated at least for one year had a long-term benefit from INF-alpha. The best prognosis was associated with achievement of CCyR and negativity of BCR-ABL in nested RT-PCR.","['Faber, Edgar', 'Kuba, Adam', 'Zapletalova, Jana', 'Divoka, Martina', 'Rohon, Peter', 'Holzerova, Milena', 'Jarosova, Marie', 'Indrak, Karel']","['Faber E', 'Kuba A', 'Zapletalova J', 'Divoka M', 'Rohon P', 'Holzerova M', 'Jarosova M', 'Indrak K']","['Department of Hemato-Oncology, University Hospital Olomouc, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121127,Czech Republic,Biomed Pap Med Fac Univ Palacky Olomouc Czech Repub,"Biomedical papers of the Medical Faculty of the University Palacky, Olomouc, Czechoslovakia",101140142,,2012/12/04 06:00,2014/03/13 06:00,['2012/12/04 06:00'],"['2012/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5507/bp.2012.068 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Pap Med Fac Univ Palacky Olomouc Czech Repub. 2013 Sep;157(3):248-56. doi: 10.5507/bp.2012.068.

The cost effectiveness of treating childhood cancers in these settings is unknown. The objective of the present work was to determine cost-effectiveness thresholds for common paediatric cancers using acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in Brazil and Burkitt lymphoma (BL) in Malawi as examples. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) prevented by treatment were compared to the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of each country to define cost-effectiveness thresholds using WHO-CHOICE ('CHOosing Interventions that are Cost-Effective') guidelines. The case examples were selected due to the data available and because ALL and BL both have the potential to yield significant health gains at a low cost per patient treated. The key findings were as follows: the 3:1 cost/DALY prevented to GDP/capita ratio for ALL in Brazil was US $771,225; expenditures below this threshold were cost effective. Costs below US $257,075 (1:1 ratio) were considered very cost effective. Analogous thresholds for BL in Malawi were US $42,729 and US $14,243. Actual costs were far less. In Brazil, US $16,700 was spent to treat each patient while in Malawi total drug costs were less than US $50 per child. In summary, treatment of certain paediatric cancers in LMIC is very cost effective. Future research should evaluate actual treatment and infrastructure expenditures to help guide policymakers.","['Bhakta, Nickhill', 'Martiniuk, Alexandra L C', 'Gupta, Sumit', 'Howard, Scott C']","['Bhakta N', 'Martiniuk AL', 'Gupta S', 'Howard SC']","[""Children's Hospital Los Angeles, 4650 Sunset Blvd, Los Angeles, California 90027, USA. nbhakta@alumni.brown.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121130,England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,,2012/12/04 06:00,2013/03/08 06:00,['2012/12/04 06:00'],"['2012/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [medline]']","['archdischild-2011-301419 [pii]', '10.1136/archdischild-2011-301419 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 2013 Feb;98(2):155-60. doi: 10.1136/archdischild-2011-301419.

Overexpression of SALL4 has been found in several cancers. The present study was aimed to investigate the methylation status of SALL4 promoter region in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). DESIGNS AND METHODS: The methylation status of SALL4 promoter was analyzed in 84 patients with AML using methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and its clinical significance was evaluated. RESULTS: Aberrant hypomethylation of SALL4 gene, which was correlated with SALL4 expression, was found in 17.8% (15/84) cases. The patients with SALL4 hypomethylation had significantly older age and higher WBCs than those without SALL4 hypomethylation. The incidence of SALL4 hypomethylation was higher in M1 subtype than in M2 and other subtypes (50%, 26% and 6%, respectively, P=0.001). SALL4 hypomethylation was associated with cytogenetically intermediate and poor groups. Although survival time of the SALL4-hypomethylated AML was shorter than that of SALL4-methylated group (4 months vs 9 months), the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.356). CONCLUSIONS: Hypomethylation of SALL4 promoter is a common event and is associated with the intermediate and poor karyotypes in AML.","['Ma, Ji-chun', 'Qian, Jun', 'Lin, Jiang', 'Qian, Wei', 'Yang, Jing', 'Wang, Cui-zhu', 'Chai, Hai-yan', 'Li, Yun', 'Chen, Qin', 'Qian, Zhen']","['Ma JC', 'Qian J', 'Lin J', 'Qian W', 'Yang J', 'Wang CZ', 'Chai HY', 'Li Y', 'Chen Q', 'Qian Z']","[""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu 212002, PR China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121130,United States,Clin Biochem,Clinical biochemistry,0133660,,2012/12/04 06:00,2013/07/31 06:00,['2012/12/04 06:00'],"['2012/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/17 00:00 [revised]', '2012/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-9120(12)00653-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2012.11.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Biochem. 2013 Mar;46(4-5):304-7. doi: 10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2012.11.018.

Autophagy and apoptosis play important roles in the process of cardiac remodeling. This study was designed to explore changes in cell autophagy and apoptosis during age-related left ventricular remodeling and to determine whether the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is an underlying mechanism. Eight 5-month-old (adult group) and eight 24-month-old male C57bl/6 mice (aged group) were studied. The heart mass index, left ventricular mass index and hydroxyproline content of both groups were compared. Western Blotting was used to quantitate the protein expression of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), Beclin-1, caspase-3, B-cell leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) and MAPKs in the left ventricles of adult and aged mice. Our results showed that the heart mass index, left ventricular mass index and hydroxyproline content in the left ventricles of the aged mice were increased significantly compared with the adult mice, indicating that left ventricular remodeling occurs with aging. The expression of LC3 and Beclin-1 in the left ventricles of aged mice were decreased significantly compared to adult mice. Meanwhile, the level of myocardial caspase-3 in adult mice remained the same in aged mice, and the level of myocardial Bcl-2 increased significantly in aged mice. There were no differences in the expression level of myocardial extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), activated/phospho-ERK1/2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1/2 (JNK1/2) and p38 between aged and adult mice. However, the expression of myocardial activated/phospho-JNK1/2 increased significantly in aged mice, while activated/phospho-p38 decreased significantly. These findings indicate that autophagy decreases without a concurrent change in apoptosis during age-related left ventricular remodeling in mice. The MAPK pathway may be involved in the regulation of age-related left ventricular remodeling by modulating autophagy.","['Peng, Longyun', 'Zhuang, Xiaodong', 'Liao, Lizhen', 'He, Xuyu', 'Li, Jiaxiang', 'Chen, Xuanlan', 'Lu, Guihua', 'Ma, Hong', 'Gao, Xiuren']","['Peng L', 'Zhuang X', 'Liao L', 'He X', 'Li J', 'Chen X', 'Lu G', 'Ma H', 'Gao X']","['Department of Cardiology, First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, 58 Zhongshan Road II, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510080, China. penglongyun@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121129,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,,2012/12/04 06:00,2013/06/26 06:00,['2012/12/04 06:00'],"['2012/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(12)02237-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.11.062 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2013 Jan 11;430(2):822-6. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.11.062.

However, limited evidence indicated its function in tumor cells. To elucidate the precise roles and underlying molecular mechanism of FoxP3 in gastric cancer (GC), we examined the expression of FoxP3 and the consequences of interfering with FoxP3 gene in human GC cell lines, AGS and MKN45, by multiple cellular and molecular approaches, such as immunofluorescence, gene transfection, CCK-8 assay, clone formation assay, TUNEL assay, Flow cytometry, immunoassay and quantities polymerase chain reaction (PCR). As a result, FoxP3 was expressed both in nucleus and cytoplasm of GC cells. Up-regulation of FoxP3 inhibited cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis. Overexpression of FoxP3 increased the protein and mRNA levels of proapoptotic molecules, such as poly ADP-ribose polymerase1 (PARP), caspase-3 and caspase-9, and repressed the expression of antiapoptotic molecules, such as cellular inhibitor of apoptosis-1 (c-IAP1) and the long isoform of B cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2). Furthermore, silencing of FoxP3 by siRNA in GC cells reduced the expression of proapoptotic genes, such as PARP, caspase-3 and caspase-9. Collectively, our findings identify the novel roles of FoxP3 in inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis in GC cells by regulating apoptotic signaling, which could be a promising therapeutic approach for gastric cancer.","['Ma, Gui-Fen', 'Chen, Shi-Yao', 'Sun, Zhi-Rong', 'Miao, Qing', 'Liu, Yi-Mei', 'Zeng, Xiao-Qing', 'Luo, Tian-Cheng', 'Ma, Li-Li', 'Lian, Jing-Jing', 'Song, Dong-Li']","['Ma GF', 'Chen SY', 'Sun ZR', 'Miao Q', 'Liu YM', 'Zeng XQ', 'Luo TC', 'Ma LL', 'Lian JJ', 'Song DL']","['Department of Gastroenterology, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121129,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,,2012/12/04 06:00,2013/06/26 06:00,['2012/12/04 06:00'],"['2012/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(12)02240-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.11.065 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2013 Jan 11;430(2):804-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.11.065.

It stimulated the search for novel molecules for treatment of imatinib-resistance CML. Inhibiting the amplification of Bcr/Abl oncogene is believed to be a new effective strategy to override the imatinib resistance on CML cells. In present research, we demonstrated that dihydroartemisinin (DHA), a safe and effective antimalarial analog of artemisinin, could significantly inhibit the Bcr/Abl fusion gene at the mRNA level in CML cells sensitive or resistant to imatinib (including the primary CML cells with T315I mutation) and induce cell death. Moreover, dihydroartemisinin could also lead to the inhibition of the Bcr/Abl protein expression and tyrosine kinase activity, and strongly suppress on the downstream signals of Bcr/Abl, which included inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity of AKT and ERK, promotion of cytochrome c release from the mitochondria and the consequential activation of caspase-9/3 in imatinib-resistant CML cells. These results suggest for the first time that Dihydroartemisinin might be a potential novel drug candidate for treatment of imatinib-resistant CML and worthy of further study.","['Lee, Jun', 'Shen, Peiqiang', 'Zhang, Guobing', 'Wu, Xiuhua', 'Zhang, Xingguo']","['Lee J', 'Shen P', 'Zhang G', 'Wu X', 'Zhang X']","['Department of clinical pharmacology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79# Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310000, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121119,France,Biomed Pharmacother,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,,2012/12/04 06:00,2014/01/15 06:00,['2012/12/04 06:00'],"['2012/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0753-3322(12)00109-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biopha.2012.10.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomed Pharmacother. 2013 Mar;67(2):157-63. doi: 10.1016/j.biopha.2012.10.017.

The effect of 6r on expressions of GST P1-1 and apoptosis-related proteins were measured by western blotting and the effect on cell apoptosis was analysed by Hoechst 33258 nuclear staining as well as by cell surface staining of annexin V/propidium iodide. The effect on cell cycle was assessed by flow cytometry. Results showed that 6r inhibit proliferation of a range of human cancer cells in vitro and growth of SW620 tumor xenografts in vivo. The anti-proliferative effect of 6r is associated with cell apoptosis as a result of increased ratio of cellular Bax/bcl-2 expression and subsequent cytochrome-c and caspase-3 activation. Unlike EA, 6r did not show any influence on cellular GST P1-1 expression and its anti-proliferative action was associated with cell cycle arrest in G1/S-phase.

Regulatory T cells (Tregs) (CD4+CD25(high) Foxp3+) are believed to maintain tolerance and to inhibit acute GVHD (aGVHD) after allogeneic PBSCT. Nevertheless, when looking at post-allotransplantation patient outcomes, although the impact of aGVHD on survival is amply documented, so far there is no evidence that the donor graft CD3/Tregs ratio may affect overall survival (OS), nonrelapse mortality (NRM), disease-free survival (DFS), and relapse rates. Our aim was to study the possible impact of the gCD3/Tregs ratio on survival after myeloablative allogeneic PBSCT. We analyzed 74 consecutive patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (n = 62), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 10), and chronic myeloid leukemia (n = 2) who underwent transplantation with unmanipulated PBSCs from a human leukocyte antigen-identical related donor (n = 48) or a human leukocyte antigen-identical unrelated donor (n = 26). Patients were subdivided into a high gCD3/Tregs ratio (>/=36) group (HR group, n = 30) and a low gCD3/Tregs ratio (<36) group (LR group, n = 44). The OS, DFS, NRM, and relapse rates at 3 years were 53%, 51%, 29%, and 34%, respectively. Comparing the LR and HR groups, a statistically significant difference was demonstrated for the 3-year OS, DFS, and NRM rates (65% vs 31%, P = .0001; 67 versus 26%, P = .0001; 5% versus 71%, P < .0001, respectively) but not for relapse (30% vs 25%, P = ns). By multivariate analysis, LR significantly predicted better OS (P = .019), DFS (P = .003), and NRM (P = .05), whereas there was no statistically significant association between LR and relapse (P = .155). Overall, our data may suggest that LR preserves GVL effects but is also protective against aGVHD in allotransplantation patients.","['Delia, Mario', 'Pastore, Domenico', 'Mestice, Anna', 'Carluccio, Paola', 'Perrone, Tommasina', 'Gaudio, Francesco', 'Ricco, Alessandra', 'Sgherza, Nicola', 'Albano, Francesco', 'Specchia, Giorgina']","['Delia M', 'Pastore D', 'Mestice A', 'Carluccio P', 'Perrone T', 'Gaudio F', 'Ricco A', 'Sgherza N', 'Albano F', 'Specchia G']","['Hematology Section, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation, University of Bari, Piazza Giulio Cesare 11,Bari, Italy. mario.delia@tiscali.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121127,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,2012/12/04 06:00,2013/07/31 06:00,['2012/12/04 06:00'],"['2012/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(12)00523-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2012.11.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2013 Mar;19(3):495-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2012.11.015.

Inhibition of mTOR by RAD001 reduces proliferation but fails to dephosphorylate 4EBP1 and to induce cell death in either DLBCL subtype. In contrast, concurrent inhibition of PI3K and mTOR with NVP-BEZ235 inhibits proliferation, dephosphorylates 4EBP1, and induces cells death, notably more pronounced in CGB cells. Small RNA interference identifies Mcl-1 as a crucial cell death mediator of both DLBCL subtypes. Inhibition of the PI3K/mTOR/4EBP1 by NVP-BEZ235 results in suppression of the cap-dependent translation initiation complex and concomitant downregulation of Mcl-1 in GCB cell lines. In ABC cell lines, this suppression is possibly compensated by NF-kappaB- or Pim kinase-mediated signaling.","['Zang, Chuanbing', 'Eucker, Jan', 'Liu, Hongyu', 'Muller, Anja', 'Possinger, Kurt', 'Scholz, Christian Wilfried']","['Zang C', 'Eucker J', 'Liu H', 'Muller A', 'Possinger K', 'Scholz CW']","['Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Department of Oncology and Hematology, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121127,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,,2012/12/04 06:00,2013/11/10 06:00,['2012/12/04 06:00'],"['2012/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/05 00:00 [revised]', '2012/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0304-3835(12)00660-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2012.11.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2013 Oct 10;339(2):288-97. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2012.11.013.

Ernest Beutler was the pivotal influence in my introduction to academic life, and his contribution to hematology in the last 5 decades was unsurpassed. Taking a cue from Ernie's example, I have elected in the keynote speech and this brief treatise, to start with an unconventional introduction and to expand on some discoveries made in my laboratory. Then I will extend these findings to the focus of the Acute Leukemia Forum to address potentially new approaches to therapies of acute leukemias. Somatic and germline mutations of acute leukemias are unfortunately caused by arrays of somatic and germline mutations. Simultaneous targeting of so many mutations makes it not possible to efficiently target all for cure. Albeit we should be aware that we should not in the near future ignore targeted therapy of those functionally important genetic and epigenetic events that are either initiating or contributing to aggressivity of acute leukemia, as these may be ameliorated by targeted intervention against one, or even a few together, of these defined molecular lesions. Yet, leukemic cells, like other cancer cells, have the unique metabolic feature to generate energy, referred as the Warburg effect, which can potentially be targeted to suppress or even eradicate cancer.","['Prchal, Josef T']",['Prchal JT'],"['Pathology, and Genetics, Division of Hematology, University of Utah School of Medicine, 30 North 1900 East, 5C402, Salt Lake City, UT 8413, USA. josef.prchal@hsc.utah.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20121025,Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

There are two commercially available biomarker assays useful for detection of the IFIs most commonly seen in patients with hematologic malignancies, the galactomannan and beta glucan assays. The former is specific for aspergillosis, the latter positive for not only Aspergillus and Candida species, but several other clinically relevant fungal pathogens as well. Both have good assay performance characteristics, provide rapid test results, are widely available, can be assayed non-invasively, and are positive early in the course of infection, often before onset of signs and symptoms of infection. Adoption of these assays into clinical practice has led to reduced need to perform invasive procedures to obtain deep tissue to establish the diagnosis of invasive fungal infections. Improved survival rates from aspergillosis are, in part, due to earlier detection of infection and earlier therapy.","['Wingard, John R']",['Wingard JR'],"['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Florida College of Medicine, P.O.

However, since the publication of this schema, application of various high throughout technologies including whole genome and exome sequencing of AML cases has revealed a plethora of recurrent mutational targets, including a number of genes encoding transcriptional regulators, not previously implicated in leukaemogenesis. Deciphering the combinations of mutations that cooperate to induce AML and determining which particular alterations (or combinations) confer independent prognostic information represent major ongoing challenges, which will necessitate analysis of large cohort sizes involving international cooperation. However, the uncertainty concerning optimal risk-stratification of AML based on the rapidly evolving picture emerging from molecular genetic profiling provides a strong rationale for evaluation of minimal residual disease (MRD) detection as a tool to refine outcome prediction. This modality may not only capture differences in treatment response that reflect the underlying molecular heterogeneity, but also inter-patient variability in drug availability and metabolism, which may also significantly influence outcome. Developments in leukaemia diagnostics coupled with the possibility that MRD may be tracked using molecular and/or flow cytometry-based methods in the majority of patients hold considerable promise to inform more personalized approaches to therapy.","['Grimwade, David']",['Grimwade D'],"[""Department of Medical & Molecular Genetics, King's College London School of Medicine, UK. david.grimwade@genetics.kcl.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20121104,Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

To date, the tumor genome has been sequenced in nearly 40 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). On average, each AML genome contains approximately 400 mutations, including 6-26 coding mutations. The majority of these mutations are 'background' mutations that were acquired during normal aging of hematopoietic stem cells. Though comprehensively identifying 'driver' mutations remains a challenge, a number of novel driver mutations in AML have been identified through whole-genome sequencing. The digital nature of next-generation sequencing has revealed clonal heterogeneity in the majority of AML at diagnosis. Importantly, in some cases, a minor subclone contributed to relapse, suggesting the strategies to assess clonal heterogeneity are needed to optimize therapy. As sequencing technologies improve and costs decrease, it is likely that whole-genome sequencing of cancer cells will become commonplace in the diagnostic work-up of patients with AML and other cancers.","['Link, Daniel C']",['Link DC'],"['Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, 660 S.

Activation of the energy stress sensor, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has been shown to contribute to the protective effects of ischaemic and mitochondrial uncoupling-induced preconditioning in neurons, however, the molecular basis of AMPK-mediated preconditioning has been less well characterized. We investigated the effect of AMPK preconditioning using 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside (AICAR) in a model of NMDA-mediated excitotoxic injury in primary mouse cortical neurons. Activation of AMPK with low concentrations of AICAR (0.1 mM for 2 h) induced a transient increase in AMPK phosphorylation, protecting neurons against NMDA-induced excitotoxicity. Analysing potential targets of AMPK activation, demonstrated a marked increase in mRNA expression and protein levels of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family protein myeloid cell leukaemia sequence 1 (MCL-1) in AICAR-preconditioned neurons. Interestingly, over-expression of MCL-1 protected neurons against NMDA-induced excitotoxicity while MCL-1 gene silencing abolished the effect of AICAR preconditioning. Monitored intracellular Ca(2)(+) levels during NMDA excitation revealed that MCL-1 over-expressing neurons exhibited improved bioenergetics and markedly reduced Ca(2)(+) elevations, suggesting a potential mechanism through which MCL-1 confers neuroprotection. This study identifies MCL-1 as a key effector of AMPK-induced preconditioning in neurons.","['Anilkumar, Ujval', 'Weisova, Petronela', 'Dussmann, Heiko', 'Concannon, Caoimhin G', 'Konig, Hans-Georg', 'Prehn, Jochen H M']","['Anilkumar U', 'Weisova P', 'Dussmann H', 'Concannon CG', 'Konig HG', 'Prehn JH']","['Department of Physiology and Medical Physics, Centre for the Study of Neurological Disorders, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121226,England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,,2012/12/04 06:00,2013/04/23 06:00,['2012/12/04 06:00'],"['2012/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/23 00:00 [revised]', '2012/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jnc.12108 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurochem. 2013 Mar;124(5):721-34. doi: 10.1111/jnc.12108.

OBJECTIVES: This study was performed to describe the clinical impact of CMV infection with UL97 mutation in pediatric transplant recipients. METHODS: Quantitative surveillance data for CMV infection in pediatric patients between October 2001 and February 2007 at the University of Washington were analyzed. Testing for UL97 mutation was performed in selected patients with prolonged CMV viremia despite therapy. Data associated with the detection of UL97 mutations were reviewed. RESULTS: CMV was detected in 89 pediatric transplant recipients. Among these, 39 had undergone HCT and 50 SOT (12 heart, 22 kidney, 15 liver, and 1 bilateral lung transplants). CMV with at least one UL97 sequence variation was detected in 5 patients: 4 HCT recipients (4/39, 10%) and 1 heart transplant recipient (1/50, 2%). All 5 pediatric patients were CMV seropositive before transplantation. Underlying conditions included chronic myelogenous leukemia, primary immunodeficiency disorders, and hypoplastic left heart syndrome. One known GCV drug-resistant mutation was detected in 2 HCT recipients (A594V). Three strain variants with mutations considered to have no significant impact on UL97 function (H469Y, N510S, and D605E) were detected. Two of these 5 patients died, 1 because of uncontrolled CMV infection and 1 with other complications. CONCLUSIONS: UL97 drug-resistant mutations occur in pediatric transplant recipients with CMV viremia and can cause serious disease. Screening for mutations conferring resistance to CMV antivirals should be considered for patients with persistent viremia during therapy and the sequences of UL97 mutations evaluated.","['Kim, Y-J', 'Boeckh, M', 'Cook, L', 'Stempel, H', 'Jerome, K R', 'Boucek, R Jr', 'Burroughs, L', 'Englund, J A']","['Kim YJ', 'Boeckh M', 'Cook L', 'Stempel H', 'Jerome KR', 'Boucek R Jr', 'Burroughs L', 'Englund JA']","[""Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA; Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, Washington, USA; Sungkyungkwan University, School of Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Denmark,Transpl Infect Dis,Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,100883688,,2012/12/04 06:00,2013/05/28 06:00,['2012/12/04 06:00'],"['2011/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/19 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/19 00:00 [revised]', '2012/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1399-3062.2012.00760.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transpl Infect Dis. 2012 Dec;14(6):611-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-3062.2012.00760.x.,"['EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.- (ganciclovir kinase)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",IM,,"['Cytomegalovirus/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/*etiology/virology', 'Ganciclovir/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Heart Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Mutation', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Viral Load']",,,,['(c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],['P30 CA015704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['Transpl Infect Dis. 2013 Jun;15(3):E122-3.

All clinically used proteasome inhibitors, including the chemotherapeutic drug bortezomib, target the catalytic active sites of the proteasome and inhibit protein proteolysis by competing with substrate binding. However, nearly all (~97%) patients become intolerant or resistant to treatments within a few years, after which the average survival time is less than 1 year. We describe herein the inhibition of the human proteasome via a noncompetitive mechanism by the imidazoline scaffold, TCH-13. Consistent with a mechanism distinct from that of competitive inhibitors, TCH-013 acts additively with and overcomes resistance to bortezomib. Importantly, TCH-013 induces apoptosis in a panel of myeloma and leukemia cell lines, but in contrast, normal lymphocytes, primary bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSC), and macrophages are resistant to its cytotoxic effects.

METHODS: This is a retrospective case-note review of biological features, treatment outcome and survival in Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children with a malignancy who were treated at the Women's and Children's Hospital, a tertiary referral hospital, from January 1997 through March 2011. Two separate analyses were performed: firstly, for each Aboriginal patient comparisons were made with two age, sex and diagnosis-matched control patients; then secondly, results for the Aboriginal group of patients were compared with the whole non-Aboriginal group of patients. RESULTS: In the first analysis, Aboriginal children had a significantly higher 'remoteness index' (6.14 vs. 0.95; P < 0.001) and were less likely to be enrolled on clinical trials. Survival analysis of the Aboriginal patients and their matched controls showed a trend towards inferior overall survival for the Indigenous children (P = 0.066). In the second analysis, Aboriginal children tended to have a higher proportion of leukaemias and lymphomas and had an overrepresentation of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) (P = 0.009). The mean age among Aboriginal children with AML and lymphoma was lower (AML: 3.5 vs. 8 years, P = 0.065; lymphoma: 7.5 vs. 11.9 years, P = 0.01). A higher proportion of Aboriginal children died (P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Aboriginal children present with a somewhat different pattern of cancer, are less likely to be enrolled on studies and seem to have increased mortality. There is a need for improvement in study enrolment, treatment delivery, care coordination and suitably supported residential facilities.","['Rotte, Laura', 'Hansford, Jordan', 'Kirby, Maria', 'Osborn, Michael', 'Suppiah, Ram', 'Ritchie, Petra', 'Tapp, Heather', 'Rice, Michael', 'Revesz, Tamas']","['Rotte L', 'Hansford J', 'Kirby M', 'Osborn M', 'Suppiah R', 'Ritchie P', 'Tapp H', 'Rice M', 'Revesz T']","['Paediatric Haematology, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",20121202,Australia,J Paediatr Child Health,Journal of paediatrics and child health,9005421,,2012/12/04 06:00,2013/07/03 06:00,['2012/12/04 06:00'],"['2012/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jpc.12026 [doi]'],ppublish,J Paediatr Child Health. 2013 Jan;49(1):27-32. doi: 10.1111/jpc.12026.

The chemotherapy regimen of docetaxel/cyclophosphamide has a more favorable therapeutic index compared to anthracycline-based regimens due to a significantly lower incidence of heart failure and leukemia. Consequently, docetaxel/cyclophosphamide is the preferred adjuvant chemotherapy of choice in older women or in women where anthracyclines may be contraindicated. Pulmonary complications in patients with breast cancer receiving taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy in the absence of radiation are distinctly uncommon. Here, we report the case of a patient receiving adjuvant docetaxel/cyclophosphamide who developed rapid-onset, biopsy-proven interstitial pneumonitis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 72-year-old Hispanic woman was diagnosed as having stage 3 hormone-receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2/neu negative, invasive breast cancer. Due to the estimated 10-year risk of recurrence of approximately 80 percent, a decision was made to treat our patient with adjuvant chemotherapy. Due to her age and increased risk of cardiac toxicity with anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens, our patient was treated with docetaxel/cyclophosphamide chemotherapy for a total of four planned cycles. However, approximately two weeks after receiving the third cycle of chemotherapy, our patient developed rapidly progressive dyspnea, and a non-productive cough and went to the emergency room at an outside medical facility. She was found to have mild hypoxemia, and new onset of peripheral, subpleural fibrotic changes not present on pre-treatment scans. A thorascopic-guided wedge biopsy of the lung tissue revealed subacute interstitial pneumonitis. Our patient made a rapid clinical recovery after treatment with corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS: Interstitial pneumonitis is a rare complication of docetaxel/cyclophosphamide chemotherapy that carries a high mortality rate. The only way to make a definitive diagnosis is with a wedge biopsy of the lung, which should be performed when feasible. Our patient's case illustrates that no therapeutic intervention is without its intrinsic and unanticipated risks, and interstitial pneumonitis should be discussed as a potential side effect with all patients prior to administering docetaxel/cyclophosphamide chemotherapy.","['Ochoa, Roberto', 'Bejarano, Pablo A', 'Gluck, Stefan', 'Montero, Alberto J']","['Ochoa R', 'Bejarano PA', 'Gluck S', 'Montero AJ']","['Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, Leonard M, Miller School of Medicine, 1475 N,W, 12th Avenue Suite 3410, Miami, FL 33136, USA. amontero2@med.miami.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121130,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,PMC3533898,2012/12/04 06:00,2012/12/04 06:01,['2012/12/04 06:00'],"['2012/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/04 06:01 [medline]']","['1752-1947-6-413 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-1947-6-413 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2012 Nov 30;6:413. doi: 10.1186/1752-1947-6-413.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is no standard laboratory procedure for leukemia genetic testing. Therefore, this genetic testing has some problems related to precision management. To minimize analytical error factors, normalization by an internal control gene is necessary. Additionally, it is important to choose a gene suitable for leukemia gene expression analysis because the expression of an internal standard gene changes due to various factors. In this study, we examined analytical error factors (RNA extraction efficiency, reverse transcription reaction efficiency) and evaluated an internal control gene. As a result, in RNA extraction, the extraction efficiency of the acid-guanidium-phenol-chloroform (AGPC) method was high compared to the silica method. The reverse transcription reaction efficiency was significantly different with each reaction reagent. Furthermore, since three kinds of gene (18s rRNA, GUS, beta-actin) had few differences between samples, they were considered to be suitable as internal standards.","['Satoh, Yumiko', 'Yokota, Hiromitsu', 'Takai, Daiya', 'Yatomi, Yutaka']","['Satoh Y', 'Yokota H', 'Takai D', 'Yatomi Y']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory, The University of Tokyo Hospital, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan. satoy-lab@h.u-tokyo.ac.jp']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Japan,Rinsho Byori,Rinsho byori.

HAM/TSP is a chronic progressive myelopathy characterized by spastic paraparesis, sphincter dysfunction, and mild sensory disturbance in the lower extremities. Although the factors that cause these different manifestations of HTLV-1 infection are not fully understood, accumulating evidence from host population genetics, viral genetics, DNA expression microarrays, and assays of lymphocyte function suggests that complex virus-host interactions and the host immune response play an important role in the pathogenesis of HAM/TSP. Especially, the efficiency of an individual's cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) response to HTLV-1 limits the HTLV-1 proviral load and the risk of HAM/TSP.

Previous studies have revealed many possible molecular and cellular mechanisms of HTLV-1-induced leukemogenesis, but it still remains unknown how HTLV-1 transforms peripheral CD4 T cells in infected individuals. Given the fact that only 2-5% of infected individuals develop ATL, HTLV-1 infection alone is not sufficient for the transformation of infected cells. Host genetic and epigenetic abnormalities and host immunological status should be considered in attempting to understand the mechanism of the oncogenesis of ATL. Nonetheless, it is obvious that HTLV-1 infection dramatically increases the risk of leukemia generation from peripheral CD4 T-cells, in which the incidence of leukemia is quite low. Furthermore, the evidence that all ATL cases retain the HTLV-1 provirus, especially the 3' region, indicates that HTLV-1-encoded genes play a critical role in leukemogenesis. Since increasing evidence indicates that the HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ) gene plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of HTLV-1, we will discuss the cellular and molecular mechanism of ATL generation from the virological point of view, particularly focusing on HBZ.","['Satou, Yorifumi', 'Matsuoka, Masao']","['Satou Y', 'Matsuoka M']","['Immunology Section, Division of Infectious Diseases, Imperial College, Wright-Fleming Institute, Norfolk Place, London W2 1PG, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20111124,United States,Leuk Res Treatment,Leukemia research and treatment,101591812,PMC3504235,2012/12/01 06:00,2012/12/01 06:01,['2012/12/01 06:00'],"['2011/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/01 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2012/213653 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res Treatment. 2012;2012:213653. doi: 10.1155/2012/213653.

This is a review of published clinical experience regarding the use of Vitamin D and its analogs, either alone or in combination with other agents, to treat AML.

This review documents heterogeneity in selection criteria for patients treated in these studies, the spectrum of Vitamin D analogs used in various studies, and the differing dosing strategies employed by investigators. Despite examples of occasional clinical efficacy, barriers remain to the successful application of Vitamin D in the treatment of MDS and AML.

Impaired neurocognitive functions in both humans and rodents are associated with inflammation, demyelination, and neural stem cell dysfunction. Here we evaluated the utility of lithium and a synthetic retinoid receptor agonist in reducing damage in a model of brain-focused irradiation in juvenile mice. We found that lithium stimulated brain progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation following cranial irradiation while also preventing oligodendrocyte loss in the dentate gyrus of juvenile mice. In response to inflammation induced by radiation, which may have encumbered the optimal reparative action of lithium, we used the anti-inflammatory synthetic retinoid Am80 that is in clinical use in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia. Although Am80 reduced the number of cyclooxygenase-2-positive microglial cells following radiation treatment, it did not enhance lithium-induced neurogenesis recovery, and this alone was not significantly different from the effect of lithium on this proinflammatory response. Similarly, lithium was superior to Am80 in supporting the restoration of new doublecortin-positive neurons following irradiation. These data suggest that lithium is superior in its restorative effects to blocking inflammation alone, at least in the case of Am80. Because lithium has been in routine clinical practice for 60 years, these preclinical studies indicate that this drug might be beneficial in reducing post-therapy late effects in patients receiving cranial radiotherapy and that blocking inflammation in this context may not be as advantageous as previously suggested.","['Malaterre, Jordane', 'McPherson, Cameron S', 'Denoyer, Delphine', 'Lai, Emily', 'Hagekyriakou, Jim', 'Lightowler, Sally', 'Shudo, Koishi', 'Ernst, Matthias', 'Ashley, David M', 'Short, Jennifer L', 'Wheeler, Greg', 'Ramsay, Robert G']","['Malaterre J', 'McPherson CS', 'Denoyer D', 'Lai E', 'Hagekyriakou J', 'Lightowler S', 'Shudo K', 'Ernst M', 'Ashley DM', 'Short JL', 'Wheeler G', 'Ramsay RG']","['Differentiation and Transcription Laboratory, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120530,United States,Stem Cells Transl Med,Stem cells translational medicine,101578022,PMC3659714,2012/12/01 06:00,2014/02/28 06:00,['2012/12/01 06:00'],"['2012/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/28 06:00 [medline]']","['sctm.2011-0046 [pii]', '10.5966/sctm.2011-0046 [doi]']",ppublish,Stem Cells Transl Med. 2012 Jun;1(6):469-79. doi: 10.5966/sctm.2011-0046.

Methotrexate (MTX), a tight binding inhibitor of DHFR, is one of the most widely used drugs in cancer treatment and is especially effective in the treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and osteosarcoma. Limitations to its use in cancer include natural resistance and acquired resistance due to decreased cellular uptake and decreased retention due to impaired polyglutamylate formation and toxicity at higher doses. Here, we describe a novel mechanism to induce DHFR degradation through cofactor depletion in neoplastic cells by inhibition of NAD kinase, the only enzyme responsible for generating NADP, which is rapidly converted to NADPH by dehydrogenases/reductases. We identified an inhibitor of NAD kinase, thionicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPS), which led to accelerated degradation of DHFR and to inhibition of cancer cell growth. Of importance, combination treatment of NADPS with MTX displayed significant synergy in a metastatic colon cancer cell line and was effective in a MTX-transport resistant leukemic cell line.

To date, most xeno-free culture systems require human feeder cells and/or highly complicated culture media that contain activators of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) signaling pathways, and none provide for replacement of FGF/TGFbeta ligands with chemical compounds. The Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway plays an important role in mouse embryonic stem cells in leukemia inhibitory factor-independent culture; however, the role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in human pluripotent stem cell is still poorly understood and controversial because of the dual role of Wnts in proliferation and differentiation. Building on our previous investigations of small molecules modulating Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in mouse embryonic stem cells, we identified a compound, ID-8, that could support Wnt-induced human embryonic stem cell proliferation and survival without differentiation. Dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase (DYRK) is the target of the small molecule ID-8. Its role in human pluripotent cell renewal was confirmed by DYRK knockdown in human embryonic stem cells. Using Wnt and the DYRK inhibitor ID-8, we have developed a novel and simple chemically defined xeno-free culture system that allows for long-term expansion of human pluripotent stem cells without FGF or TGFbeta activation. These culture conditions do not include xenobiotic supplements, serum, serum replacement, or albumin. Using this culture system, we have shown that several human pluripotent cell lines maintained pluripotency (>20 passages) and a normal karyotype and still retained the ability to differentiate into derivatives of all three germ layers. This Wnt-dependent culture system should provide a platform for complete replacement of growth factors with chemical compounds.","['Hasegawa, Kouichi', 'Yasuda, Shin-ya', 'Teo, Jia-Ling', 'Nguyen, Cu', 'McMillan, Michael', 'Hsieh, Chih-Lin', 'Suemori, Hirofumi', 'Nakatsuji, Norio', 'Yamamoto, Masashi', 'Miyabayashi, Tomoyuki', 'Lutzko, Carolyn', 'Pera, Martin F', 'Kahn, Michael']","['Hasegawa K', 'Yasuda SY', 'Teo JL', 'Nguyen C', 'McMillan M', 'Hsieh CL', 'Suemori H', 'Nakatsuji N', 'Yamamoto M', 'Miyabayashi T', 'Lutzko C', 'Pera MF', 'Kahn M']","['Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research, California 90033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20111207,United States,Stem Cells Transl Med,Stem cells translational medicine,101578022,PMC3727690,2012/12/01 06:00,2013/01/04 06:00,['2012/12/01 06:00'],"['2012/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/04 06:00 [medline]']","['sctm.2011-0033 [pii]', '10.5966/sctm.2011-0033 [doi]']",ppublish,Stem Cells Transl Med. 2012 Jan;1(1):18-28. doi: 10.5966/sctm.2011-0033.

Low bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) are recognized complications, but it is unknown whether these persist until adulthood. We evaluated skeletal characteristics and their association with ALL therapy in long-term male ALL survivors. DESIGN: This cross-sectional cohort study included 49 long-term male ALL survivors and 55 age-matched healthy males. METHODS: BMD and compression fractures were assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry; blood biochemistry was obtained for parameters of calcium homeostasis. RESULTS: The ALL survivors (median age 29 years, range 25-38 years), assessed 10-38 years after ALL diagnosis, had lower lumbar spine (P<0.001), femoral neck (P<0.001), and whole-body (P=0.017) BMD than expected based on normative values. When compared with the controls (median age 30 years, range 24-36 years), the ALL survivors had lower lumbar spine BMC (P=0.014), lower whole-body BMC (P<0.001), and lower whole-body BMD (P<0.001), but the differences were partly explained by differences in height. Altogether, 20% of the ALL survivors had spinal compression fractures, but these were equally prevalent in the controls. Males diagnosed with ALL before age 5 years had significantly lower BMD values. Other recognized risk factors included untreated hypogonadism, vitamin D deficiency, hypophosphatemia, low IGF-binding protein-3, and low physical activity.

METHODS: Membrane potential changes were evaluated by flow cytometry using fluorescent probe bis-(1,3-dibarbituric acid)-trimethine oxanol staining. Other related changes such as potassium ion efflux and intracellular calcium ion overload were also measured. The plasma membrane integrity was monitored by flow cytometry combined with fluorescein diacetate and propidium iodide double fluorescent dye staining. A cell-counting assay and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide analysis were used to examine the viability of K562 cells after ultrasound exposure. The acoustic cavitation activity in ultrasound fields was assessed by monitoring hydroxyl radical production. RESULTS: As the ultrasonic intensity increased, the hydroxyl radical produced in the medium increased, and cell membrane damage and cell viability loss were enhanced. The ultrasonic intensity at 0.64 W/cm(2) did not cause substantial cell damage, whereas ultrasound exposure at 1 and 2.1 W/cm(2) could induce serious cell death (14.0% and 40.7%, respectively). Moreover, ultrasound at 0.64 W/cm(2) did not cause substantial membrane potential changes, whereas ultrasound exposure at 1 W/cm(2) could induce depolarization, and fast hyperpolarization occurred when the ultrasonic intensity increased to 2.1 W/cm(2). In addition, compared with control cells, in different ultrasound-treated cells, the potassium ion continuously outflowed with a prolonged incubation time, whereas the intracellular calcium ion oscillations became more apparent. CONCLUSIONS: The damaging effects of ultrasound on the cell membrane and cell viability were intensity dependent. The membrane potential changes may be due to acoustic cavitation accompanied by alterations in the balance of ions on opposite sides of the cellular membrane.","['Wang, Pan', 'Li, Yixiang', 'Wang, Xiaobing', 'Guo, Ling', 'Su, Xiaomin', 'Liu, Quanhong']","['Wang P', 'Li Y', 'Wang X', 'Guo L', 'Su X', 'Liu Q']","[""College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, 710062 Shaanxi, Xi'an, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Ultrasound Med,Journal of ultrasound in medicine : official journal of the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine,8211547,,2012/12/01 06:00,2013/05/15 06:00,['2012/12/01 06:00'],"['2012/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['31/12/1977 [pii]', '10.7863/jum.2012.31.12.1977 [doi]']",ppublish,J Ultrasound Med. 2012 Dec;31(12):1977-86. doi: 10.7863/jum.2012.31.12.1977.,,IM,,"['Cell Membrane/*pathology', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Ultrasonography/*adverse effects']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In children impaired longitudinal growth has been reported as side effect exerted by this drug under prolonged therapy. We therefore prospectively evaluated alterations of bone biochemical markers in pediatric patients with CML under ongoing imatinib exposure. MATERIAL/METHODS: Bone metabolic markers (calcium, phosphate, magnesium, parathyroid hormone, vitamin D, procollagen type l N propeptide [PINP], and C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of collagen [CTX-I], osteocalcin [OC]; pyridinoline [PYD], and desoxypyridinoline [DPD]) were determined in 17 patients with CML aged 4-17 years under imatinib treatment in three-month intervals over a 2.5 year period. RESULTS: Hyperparathyroidism developed in 8/17 patients and low 25-hydroxyvitamin-D3 levels were found in 15/17 patients. Increased OC levels were detected in 58% of all specimen showing a linear significant decline of -0.30 microg OC per l per week (p=0.04). Serum PINP was lowered in 25% and serum CTX-I was above the normal range in 57% of the specimen originating exclusively from prepupertal patients. Urine PYD and Urine DPD levels were above the normal range in 10% and 9%, respectively, of all specimen collected and a statistically significant linear decline of -0.16 nmol DPD/mg creatinine/week was calculated (p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Bone remodeling may be dysregulated by imatinib. Data suggest that impaired bone formation exceeds that of decreased bone resorption. Regular evaluation of the skeletal actions during long-term imatinib treatment in childhood CML is warranted.","['Jaeger, Bernadette Anna Sophia', 'Tauer, Josephine Tabea', 'Ulmer, Anna', 'Kuhlisch, Eberhard', 'Roth, Heinz Juergen', 'Suttorp, Meinolf']","['Jaeger BA', 'Tauer JT', 'Ulmer A', 'Kuhlisch E', 'Roth HJ', 'Suttorp M']","['Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technical University, Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,PMC3560809,2012/12/01 06:00,2013/06/28 06:00,['2012/12/01 06:00'],"['2012/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/28 06:00 [medline]']","['883599 [pii]', '10.12659/msm.883599 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Sci Monit. 2012 Dec;18(12):CR721-8. doi: 10.12659/msm.883599.,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '104982-03-8 (Osteocalcin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'P6YZ13C99Q (Calcifediol)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Benzamides/*adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Bone and Bones/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Calcifediol/blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Osteocalcin/blood', 'Piperazines/*adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Reference Values']",,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00445822'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Enhancing neutrophil apoptosis has proresolution and anti-inflammatory effects in preclinical models of inflammation. Here we investigate the ability of the flavones apigenin, luteolin, and wogonin to induce neutrophil apoptosis in vitro and resolve neutrophilic inflammation in vivo. Human neutrophil apoptosis was assessed morphologically and by flow cytometry following incubation with apigenin, luteolin, and wogonin. All three flavones induced time- and concentration-dependent neutrophil apoptosis (apigenin, EC=12.2 muM; luteolin, EC=14.6 muM; and wogonin, EC=28.9 muM). Induction of apoptosis was caspase dependent, as it was blocked by the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh and was associated with both caspase-3 and caspase-9 activation. Flavone-induced apoptosis was preceded by down-regulation of the prosurvival protein Mcl-1, with proteasomal inhibition preventing flavone-induced Mcl-1 down-regulation and apoptosis. The flavones abrogated the survival effects of mediators that prolong neutrophil life span, including lipoteichoic acid, peptidoglycan, dexamethasone, and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, by driving apoptosis. Furthermore, wogonin enhanced resolution of established neutrophilic inflammation in a zebrafish model of sterile tissue injury. Wogonin-induced resolution was dependent on apoptosis in vivo as it was blocked by caspase inhibition. Our data show that the flavones induce neutrophil apoptosis and have potential as neutrophil apoptosis-inducing anti-inflammatory, proresolution agents.","['Lucas, Christopher D', 'Allen, Keith C', 'Dorward, David A', 'Hoodless, Laura J', 'Melrose, Lauren A', 'Marwick, John A', 'Tucker, Carl S', 'Haslett, Christopher', 'Duffin, Rodger', 'Rossi, Adriano G']","['Lucas CD', 'Allen KC', 'Dorward DA', 'Hoodless LJ', 'Melrose LA', 'Marwick JA', 'Tucker CS', 'Haslett C', 'Duffin R', 'Rossi AG']","[""MRC Centre for Inflammation Research, The Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh Medical School, 47 Little France Crescent, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK. clucas@staffmail.ed.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121129,United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,PMC3574292,2012/12/01 06:00,2013/04/27 06:00,['2012/12/01 06:00'],"['2012/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/27 06:00 [medline]']","['fj.12-218990 [pii]', '10.1096/fj.12-218990 [doi]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2013 Mar;27(3):1084-94. doi: 10.1096/fj.12-218990.

Nanoparticle (NP)-based drug delivery approaches are poorly developed for childhood leukemia. Dexamethasone (Dex) is one of the most common chemotherapeutic drugs used in the treatment of childhood leukemia. In this study, we encapsulated Dex in polymeric NPs and validated their antileukemic potential in vitro and in vivo. NPs with an average diameter of 110 nm were assembled from an amphiphilic block copolymer of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) bearing pendant cyclic ketals (ECT2). The blank NPs were nontoxic to cultured cells in vitro and to mice in vivo. Encapsulation of Dex into the NPs (Dex-NP) did not compromise the bioactivity of the drug. Dex-NPs induced glucocorticoid phosphorylation and showed cytotoxicity similar to the free Dex in leukemic cells. Studies using NPs labeled with fluorescent dyes revealed leukemic cell surface binding and internalization.

Human serum TF (hTF) is extensively used as an iron-delivery vehicle in various mammalian cell cultures for production of therapeutic proteins, and is also being explored for use as a drug carrier to treat a number of diseases by employing its unique TFR-mediated endocytosis pathway. With the increasing concerns over the risk of transmission of infectious pathogenic agents of human plasma-derived TF, recombinant hTF is preferred to use for these applications. Here, we carry out comparative studies of the TFR binding, TFR-mediated endocytosis and cellular iron delivery of recombinant hTF from rice (rhTF), and evaluate its suitability for biopharmaceutical applications. RESULT: Through a TFR competition binding affinity assay with HeLa human cervic carcinoma cells (CCL-2) and Caco-2 human colon carcinoma cells (HTB-37), we show that rhTF competes similarly as hTF to bind TFR, and both the TFR binding capacity and dissociation constant of rhTF are comparable to that of hTF. The endocytosis assay confirms that rhTF behaves similarly as hTF in the slow accumulation in enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells and the rapid recycling pathway in HeLa cells. The pulse-chase assay of rhTF in Caco-2 and HeLa cells further illustrates that rice-derived rhTF possesses the similar endocytosis and intracellular processing compared to hTF. The cell culture assays show that rhTF is functionally similar to hTF in the delivery of iron to two diverse mammalian cell lines, HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells (CCL-240) and murine hybridoma cells derived from a Sp2/0-Ag14 myeloma fusion partner (HB-72), for supporting their proliferation, differentiation, and physiological function of antibody production. CONCLUSION: The functional similarity between rice derived rhTF and native hTF in their cellular iron delivery, TFR binding, and TFR-mediated endocytosis and intracellular processing support that rice-derived rhTF can be used as a safe and animal-free alternative to serum hTF for bioprocessing and biopharmaceutical applications.","['Zhang, Deshui', 'Lee, Hsin-Fang', 'Pettit, Steven C', 'Zaro, Jennica L', 'Huang, Ning', 'Shen, Wei-Chiang']","['Zhang D', 'Lee HF', 'Pettit SC', 'Zaro JL', 'Huang N', 'Shen WC']","['Ventria Bioscience, Fort Collins, CO 80524, USA. dzhang@ventria.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20121130,England,BMC Biotechnol,BMC biotechnology,101088663,PMC3521190,2012/12/01 06:00,2013/04/24 06:00,['2012/12/01 06:00'],"['2012/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['1472-6750-12-92 [pii]', '10.1186/1472-6750-12-92 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Biotechnol. 2012 Nov 30;12:92. doi: 10.1186/1472-6750-12-92.,"['0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transferrin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibody Formation', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Endocytosis', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Oryza/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics', 'Transferrin/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism']",,,,,"['R01 GM063647/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R44 GM086916/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most cases improve following the discontinuation of all-trans retinoic acid. There is no published literature on how to manage such patients if severe symptoms of increased intracranial pressure continue after discontinuation of the drug. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 16-year-old Afro-Caribbean woman with aggressive secondary pseudotumor cerebri who presented to our facility with visual failure that persisted despite discontinuation of all-trans retinoic acid. A lumbar drain was inserted for 11 days resulting in symptomatic relief of headaches and objective improvement of visual failure. Pressure settings were titrated regularly to ensure optimal symptomatic relief. CONCLUSIONS: The use of a lumbar drain for continuous drainage of cerebrospinal fluid in patients with all-trans retinoic acid-induced pseudotumor cerebri resistant to all-trans retinoic acid discontinuation is a feasible management option. This method can be used when other less invasive measures have failed to improve signs and symptoms. Permanent drainage of cerebrospinal fluid with a shunt may also provide a long-term viable management strategy but the use of a lumbar drain may be preferable if the cause of pseudotumor cerebri is known to be self-limiting.,"['Rasul, Fahid T', 'Toma, Ahmed K', 'Khan, Akbar A', 'Plant, Gordon T', 'Watkins, Laurence D']","['Rasul FT', 'Toma AK', 'Khan AA', 'Plant GT', 'Watkins LD']","['Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square, London, WC1N 3BG, UK. fahidrasul@doctors.org.uk.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121129,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,PMC3520701,2012/12/01 06:00,2012/12/01 06:01,['2012/12/01 06:00'],"['2012/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/01 06:01 [medline]']","['1752-1947-6-408 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-1947-6-408 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2012 Nov 29;6:408. doi: 10.1186/1752-1947-6-408.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution of KIR genes in HLA-identical sibling and the effect of KIR genes on the outcome of HSCT. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The present study included 74 patients and their HLA-identical sibling donors. KIR genes and HLA ligands typing were determined by polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific primer (PCR-SSP). A retrospective study was carried out to analyze the outcomes of the recipients. RESULTS: There was no effect of KIR gene mismatch and missing ligand on the outcome regarding graft-versus host disease (GVHD), relapse, and overall survival (OS) (p > 0.05). However the presence of donor activating KIR2DS5 was associated with decreased aGVHD (p = 0.01).

Several molecular markers have been described that help to classify AML patients into risk groups. DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) gene mutations have been recently identified in about 22% of AML patients and associated with poor prognosis as an independent risk factor. Our aims were to determine the frequency of somatic mutations in the gene DNMT3A and major chromosomal translocations in a sample of patients with AML. We investigated in 82 samples of bone marrow from patients with AML for somatic mutations in DNMT3A gene by sequencing and sought major fusion transcripts by RT-PCR. We found mutations in the DNMT3A gene in 5 patients (6%); 3 were type R882H [corrected]. We found fusion transcripts in 19 patients, namely, AML1/ETO (n = 5; 6.1%), PML/RARalpha (n = 12; 14.6%), MLL/AF9 (0; 0%), and CBFbeta/MYH11 (n = 2; 2.4%). The identification of recurrent mutations in the DNMT3A gene and their possible prognostic implications can be a valuable tool for making treatment decisions. This is the first study on the presence of somatic mutations of the DNMT3A gene in patients with AML in Brazil. The frequency of these mutations suggests a possible ethnogeographic variation.","['Pezzi, Annelise', 'Moraes, Lauro', 'Valim, Vanessa', 'Amorin, Bruna', 'Melchiades, Gabriela', 'Oliveira, Fernanda', 'da Silva, Maria Aparecida', 'Matte, Ursula', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira, Maria S', 'Bittencourt, Rosane', 'Daudt, Liane', 'Silla, Lucia']","['Pezzi A', 'Moraes L', 'Valim V', 'Amorin B', 'Melchiades G', 'Oliveira F', 'da Silva MA', 'Matte U', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira MS', 'Bittencourt R', 'Daudt L', 'Silla L']","['Cellular Therapy Center, Center for Experimental Research, Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, 90035-903 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil ; Postgraduate Course of Medical Sciences, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, 90035-903 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121108,United States,Adv Hematol,Advances in hematology,101504271,PMC3502761,2012/11/30 06:00,2012/11/30 06:01,['2012/11/30 06:00'],"['2012/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/01 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/30 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2012/697691 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Hematol. 2012;2012:697691. doi: 10.1155/2012/697691.

With its binding partner S100A10 (p11), A2 forms a cell surface complex that regulates generation of the primary fibrinolytic protease, plasmin, and is dynamically regulated in settings of hemostasis and thrombosis. In addition, the complex is transcriptionally upregulated in hypoxia and promotes pathologic neoangiogenesis in the tissues such as the retina. Dysregulation of both A2 and p11 has been reported in examples of rodent and human cancer. Intracellularly, A2 plays a critical role in endosomal repair in postarthroplastic osteolysis, and intracellular p11 regulates serotonin receptor activity in psychiatric mood disorders. In human studies, the A2 system contributes to the coagulopathy of acute promyelocytic leukemia, and is a target of high-titer autoantibodies in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome, cerebral thrombosis, and possibly preeclampsia. Polymorphisms in the human ANXA2 gene have been associated with stroke and avascular osteonecrosis of bone, two severe complications of sickle cell disease. Together, these new findings suggest that manipulation of the annexin A2/S100A10 system may offer promising new avenues for treatment of a spectrum of human disorders.","['Hedhli, Nadia', 'Falcone, Domenick J', 'Huang, Bihui', 'Cesarman-Maus, Gabriela', 'Kraemer, Rosemary', 'Zhai, Haiyan', 'Tsirka, Stella E', 'Santambrogio, Laura', 'Hajjar, Katherine A']","['Hedhli N', 'Falcone DJ', 'Huang B', 'Cesarman-Maus G', 'Kraemer R', 'Zhai H', 'Tsirka SE', 'Santambrogio L', 'Hajjar KA']","['Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10065, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20121014,United States,J Biomed Biotechnol,Journal of biomedicine & biotechnology,101135740,PMC3496855,2012/11/30 06:00,2013/04/12 06:00,['2012/11/30 06:00'],"['2012/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2012/406273 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biomed Biotechnol. 2012;2012:406273. doi: 10.1155/2012/406273.

Epidemiological studies have shown how the incidence of various diseases, including certain cancers, is relatively low in the Mediterranean basin compared to that of other European or North America countries. Current knowledge indicates that the phenolic fraction of olive oil has antitumor effects. In addition to the ability to be chemopreventive, with its high antioxidant activity, the antitumor effects of olive oil phenols (OO-phenols) has been studied because of their capacity to inhibit proliferation and promote apoptosis in several tumor cell lines, by diverse mechanisms. This review will summarize and discuss the most recent relevant results on the antitumor effect of OO-phenols on leukemia tumor cells, colorectal carcinoma cells, and breast cancer (BC) cells. In particular, very recent data will be reported and discussed showing the molecular signaling pathways activated by OO-phenols in different histopathological BC cell types, suggesting the potential use of OO-phenols as adjuvant treatment against several subsets of BC. Data summarized here represent a good starting point for more extensive studies for better insight into the molecular mechanisms induced by OO-phenols and to increase the availability of chemopreventive or therapeutic drugs to fight cancer.","['Casaburi, Ivan', 'Puoci, Francesco', 'Chimento, Adele', 'Sirianni, Rosa', 'Ruggiero, Carmen', 'Avena, Paola', 'Pezzi, Vincenzo']","['Casaburi I', 'Puoci F', 'Chimento A', 'Sirianni R', 'Ruggiero C', 'Avena P', 'Pezzi V']","['Department of Pharmaco-Biology and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Calabria, Cosenza, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20121127,Germany,Mol Nutr Food Res,Molecular nutrition & food research,101231818,,2012/11/30 06:00,2013/06/19 06:00,['2012/11/30 06:00'],"['2012/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/15 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/mnfr.201200503 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Nutr Food Res. 2013 Jan;57(1):71-83. doi: 10.1002/mnfr.201200503.

We demonstrated that human SR-B1 is transcriptionally activated by 17beta-estradiol (E2) in HEPG2 and JAR cells. SR-B1 promoter contains multiple estrogen response elements (ERE half-sites) along with some Sp1 binding sites. Knockdown of estrogen receptor (ER)alpha and ERbeta down-regulated E2-induced SR-B1 expression. ERs were bound to SR-B1 promoter EREs in an E2-dependent manner. Along with ERs, mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) histone methylases, especially MLL1 and MLL2, play key roles in E2-mediated SR-B1 activation. MLL1 and MLL2 bind to SR-B1 promoter in an E2-dependent manner and control the assembly of transcription pre-initiation complex and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) recruitment. ERs and MLLs play critical roles in determining the cholesterol uptake by steroidogenic tissues/cells, and their knockdown suppressed the E2-induced cholesterol uptake efficiencies of the cells. Intriguingly, MLL2 knockdown in mice resulted in a 33% increase in plasma cholesterol level and also reduced SR-B1 expression in mice liver, demonstrating its crucial functions in controlling plasma cholesterol in vivo.","['Ansari, Khairul I', 'Kasiri, Sahba', 'Hussain, Imran', 'Bobzean, Samara A Morris', 'Perrotti, Linda I', 'Mandal, Subhrangsu S']","['Ansari KI', 'Kasiri S', 'Hussain I', 'Bobzean SA', 'Perrotti LI', 'Mandal SS']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, The University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, Texas 76019, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121128,United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,PMC3545218,2012/11/30 06:00,2013/06/08 06:00,['2012/11/30 06:00'],"['2012/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/08 06:00 [medline]']","['me.2012-1147 [pii]', '10.1210/me.2012-1147 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 2013 Jan;27(1):92-105. doi: 10.1210/me.2012-1147.

Our aim was to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for 25-OH D insufficiency in a large, diverse population of cancer survivors being followed in a childhood cancer survivor clinic. PROCEDURE: Retrospective chart review in survivors seen for routine long-term follow-up, who underwent routine screening blood studies including 25-OH D levels. Vitamin D insufficiency was defined as 25-OH D <20 ng/ml. RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-four subjects (234 males) were evaluable for this analysis. Median age at 25-OH D testing was 12.3 years (2.05-36.4) and median age at cancer diagnosis was 3.9 years (0-18). Diagnoses included brain tumors (23.6%), neuroblastoma (21%), and leukemia (17.6%). Mean 25-OH D level was 25.2 ng/ml (SD = 10.37); 29% of subjects were 25-OH D insufficient. In univariate analysis, race, pubertal status, and age at cancer diagnosis were associated with 25-OH D insufficiency (P < 0.05). In multivariate analysis, a model including race and pubertal status provided a good fit for the data. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of 25-OH D insufficiency in these cancer survivors was high but similar to what has been described in the general population. No cancer specific variables were associated with 25-OH D insufficiency. Since cancer survivors are at a higher risk for subsequent malignancies, cardiovascular disease, and low bone mineral density, all of which may be affected by 25-OH D levels, interventions to improve 25-OH D status in this vulnerable population are needed.","['Choudhary, Abha', 'Chou, Joanne', 'Heller, Glenn', 'Sklar, Charles']","['Choudhary A', 'Chou J', 'Heller G', 'Sklar C']","['Department of Pediatrics, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121128,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,PMC4006112,2012/11/30 06:00,2013/07/24 06:00,['2012/11/30 06:00'],"['2012/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24403 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2013 Jul;60(7):1237-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24403.

Up to now, however, the effective drugs to treat liver cancers are limited. The aim of this study was to study whether Scutellarin which was widely found in many medicinal plants can exert an inhibitory role in HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, and to explore its molecular mechanisms. The MTT assay showed that Scutellarin markedly inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, Scutellarin-treated cells exhibited typical apoptotic appearance by staining assay. Also, Scutellarin-treated HepG2 cells exhibited the reduction of ROS production, compared with untreated HepG2 cells. Western blot analysis displayed that STAT3 protein was obviously decreased in Scutellarin-treated HepG2 cells. Furthermore, STAT3 transcriptional targets Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 were also downregulated in HepG2 cells treated by Scutellarin. In summary, we found that Scutellarin was able to inhibit the proliferation and induce the apoptosis of HepG2 cells via a STAT3 signal pathway, which provided evident support for developing Scutellarin as an alternative treatment for liver cancer.","['Xu, Haitao', 'Zhang, Songyan']","['Xu H', 'Zhang S']","['Department of Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150086, P.R., China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121128,England,Phytother Res,Phytotherapy research : PTR,8904486,,2012/11/30 06:00,2014/04/15 06:00,['2012/11/30 06:00'],"['2012/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/14 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ptr.4892 [doi]'],ppublish,Phytother Res. 2013 Oct;27(10):1524-8. doi: 10.1002/ptr.4892.

A Dbl homology (DH) domain followed by a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain is a widely adopted GEF-domain architecture. The Xpln structure solely comprises these two domains. Xpln activates RhoA and RhoB, but not RhoC, although their GTPase sequences are highly conserved. The molecular mechanism of the selectivity of Xpln for Rho GTPases is still unclear. In this study, the crystal structure of the tandemly arranged DH-PH domains of mouse Xpln, with a single molecule in the asymmetric unit, was determined at 1.79 A resolution by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method. The DH-PH domains of Xpln share high structural similarity with those from neuroepithelial cell-transforming gene 1 protein, PDZ-RhoGEF, leukaemia-associated RhoGEF and intersectins 1 and 2. The crystal structure indicated that the alpha4-alpha5 loop in the DH domain is flexible and that the DH and PH domains interact with each other intramolecularly, thus suggesting that PH-domain rearrangement occurs upon RhoA binding.","['Murayama, Kazutaka', 'Kato-Murayama, Miyuki', 'Akasaka, Ryogo', 'Terada, Takaho', 'Yokoyama, Shigeyuki', 'Shirouzu, Mikako']","['Murayama K', 'Kato-Murayama M', 'Akasaka R', 'Terada T', 'Yokoyama S', 'Shirouzu M']","['Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Tohoku University, 2-1 Seiryo, Aoba, Sendai 980-8575, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121119,England,Acta Crystallogr Sect F Struct Biol Cryst Commun,"Acta crystallographica.

Using a collection of 55 leukemia patients treated with TKI therapy (chronic myeloid leukemia, n=47; acute lymphoblastic leukemia, n=8), we found that dasatinib, a second-generation broad-spectrum TKI, induced a rapid, dose-dependent and substantial mobilization of non-leukemic lymphocytes and monocytes in blood peaking 1-2 h after an oral intake and the blood counts closely mirrored drug plasma concentration. A preferential mobilization was observed for natural killer (NK), NK T, B and gammadelta+ T cells. Mobilization was coupled with a more effective transmigration of leukocytes through an endothelial cell layer and improved cytotoxicity of NK cells. Platelet numbers decreased markedly after the drug intake in a proportion of patients. Similar effects on blood cell dynamics and function were not observed with any other TKI (imatinib, nilotinib and bosutinib). Thus, dasatinib induces a unique, rapid mobilization and activation of cytotoxic, extravasation-competent lymphocytes, which may not only enhance antileukemia immune responses but can also be causally related to the side-effect profile of the drug (pleural effusions, thrombocytopenia).","['Mustjoki, S', 'Auvinen, K', 'Kreutzman, A', 'Rousselot, P', 'Hernesniemi, S', 'Melo, T', 'Lahesmaa-Korpinen, A-M', 'Hautaniemi, S', 'Bouchet, S', 'Molimard, M', 'Smykla, R', 'Lee, F Y', 'Vakkila, J', 'Jalkanen, S', 'Salmi, M', 'Porkka, K']","['Mustjoki S', 'Auvinen K', 'Kreutzman A', 'Rousselot P', 'Hernesniemi S', 'Melo T', 'Lahesmaa-Korpinen AM', 'Hautaniemi S', 'Bouchet S', 'Molimard M', 'Smykla R', 'Lee FY', 'Vakkila J', 'Jalkanen S', 'Salmi M', 'Porkka K']","['Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Central Hospital (HUCH), Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121129,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2012/11/30 06:00,2013/06/05 06:00,['2012/11/30 06:00'],"['2012/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012348 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.348 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Apr;27(4):914-24. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.348.

METHODS: : We sought to determine prospectively the prevalence of respiratory pathogens in these children, using multiplexed-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: : We enrolled 253 children with upper or lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) during a 1-year period. A respiratory virus was detected in 193 (76%) patients; 156 (81%) patients had upper respiratory tract infection. Human rhinovirus was the most common virus detected in 97 (62%) and 24 (65%) patients with upper respiratory tract infection and LRTI, respectively. Leukemia or lymphoma was the most common underlying diagnosis in 95 (49%) patients followed by solid tumor 47 (24%), posthematopoietic stem cell transplant 28 (15%) and brain tumor in 23 (12%) patients. By multiple logistic regression analysis, human bocavirus was the most commonly detected respiratory virus in patients with LRTI (P = 0.008; odds ratio, 4.52; 95% confidence interval: 1.48-13.79). Coinfection with >1 virus was present in 47 (24%) patients, and did not increase the risk for LRTI. Two (0.7%) patients succumbed to LRTI from parainfluenza virus-3 and respiratory syncytial virus/human rhinovirus infection, respectively. C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae were detected in 4 and 3 patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: : Human rhinovirus was the most common virus detected in children with cancer and posthematopoietic stem cell transplant hospitalized with an acute respiratory illness, and was not associated with increased morbidity. Prospective studies with viral load determination and asymptomatic controls are needed to study the association of these emerging respiratory viruses with LRTI in children with cancer and posthematopoietic stem cell transplant.","['Srinivasan, Ashok', 'Gu, Zhengming', 'Smith, Teresa', 'Morgenstern, Markus', 'Sunkara, Anusha', 'Kang, Guolian', 'Srivastava, Deo K', 'Gaur, Aditya H', 'Leung, Wing', 'Hayden, Randall T']","['Srinivasan A', 'Gu Z', 'Smith T', 'Morgenstern M', 'Sunkara A', 'Kang G', 'Srivastava DK', 'Gaur AH', 'Leung W', 'Hayden RT']","[""Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. ashok.srinivasan@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Infect Dis J,The Pediatric infectious disease journal,8701858,PMC4725698,2012/11/30 06:00,2013/09/21 06:00,['2012/11/30 06:00'],"['2012/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/INF.0b013e31827bd619 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2013 Mar;32(3):e99-e104. doi: 10.1097/INF.0b013e31827bd619.,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Bacteria/classification/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Respiratory Tract Infections/epidemiology/*microbiology/*virology', 'Viruses/classification/genetics/*isolation & purification']",,,,,"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS751073'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, Hsp90 levels showed good correlation with the disease state. Patients with good response to therapy (major molecular response-MMR, molecular remission-CMR) had low expression levels of Hsp90, similar to those in healthy individuals. High Hsp90 levels were found in patients with resistance to therapy (hematological relapse-HR, accelerated phase or blast crisis), and in leukemic cell line K562. The results of the study suggested that not the kinetics but the particular level of Hsp90 at any time point since therapy start is of prognostic value: Hsp90 level above 0.27 significantly predicted poor response to TKI therapy (relapse, progression) and the level below 0.085 good response (MMR, CMR). In conclusion, Hsp90 level in total leukocytes could serve as a risk factor at diagnosis as well as during therapy and might help in clinical decision making especially in cases where BCR-ABL monitoring is of low predictive value. Our data suggest that high expression of HSP90 contributes to the aggressivity of the disease and should be considered as an important target for specialized CML therapy.","['Zackova, Marketa', 'Mouckova, Darina', 'Lopotova, Tereza', 'Ondrackova, Zuzana', 'Klamova, Hana', 'Moravcova, Jana']","['Zackova M', 'Mouckova D', 'Lopotova T', 'Ondrackova Z', 'Klamova H', 'Moravcova J']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Dept. of Cell Biology, U Nemocnice 1, Prague 2, 128 20, Czech Republic. marketa.zackova@uhkt.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121126,United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,,2012/11/30 06:00,2013/07/24 06:00,['2012/11/30 06:00'],"['2012/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/29 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S1079-9796(12)00198-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2012.11.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2013 Mar;50(3):184-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2012.11.002.

METHODS: Thirty-two children with BCP-ALL were investigated for chromosomal rearrangements using interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Eight common translocations and rearrangements, including ETV6-RUNX1, TCF3-PBX1, BCR-ABL1, ETV6, TCF3, MLL, IGH@, and PAX5, were tested for using dual-color DNA probes. RESULTS: ETV6-RUNX1 was the most frequent translocation detected in 11 children (34.4%). Two patients with BCR-ABL1 (6.3%) and one with TCF3-PBX1 (3.1%) translocations were also observed. Using break-apart probes, 11 children (34.4%) had a positive FISH result for ETV6, two patients for IGH@ (6.3%), one patient for MLL (3.1%), and one patient for PAX5 rearrangements (3.1%). All patients with the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion were also identified by split signals for ETV6. Other abnormalities, including extra copies and deletion of genes, were observed within the range of 3.1-34.4%. Cytogenetics analysis showed a single case each of BCR-ABL1 fusion, MLL, and IGH@ rearrangements (3.1% each). ETV6-RUNX1 fusion and ETV6 split-apart rearrangements were not visible by cytogenetics. Likewise, one each of cases with TCF3-PBX1 fusion and with PAX5 split signal seen by FISH was not visible by cytogenetics. CONCLUSION: By using 8 FISH probes in conjunction cytogenetics for the detection of common aberrations, interphase FISH enhanced the detection of chromosomal rearrangements in children with BCP-ALL.","['Hutspardol, S', 'Pakakasama, S', 'Kanta, K', 'Nuntakarn, L', 'Anurathapan, U', 'Sirachainan, N', 'Songdej, D', 'Sawangpanich, R', 'Tiyasirichokchai, R', 'Rerkamnuaychoke, B', 'Hongeng, S']","['Hutspardol S', 'Pakakasama S', 'Kanta K', 'Nuntakarn L', 'Anurathapan U', 'Sirachainan N', 'Songdej D', 'Sawangpanich R', 'Tiyasirichokchai R', 'Rerkamnuaychoke B', 'Hongeng S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Srinakharinwirot University, Nakorn Nayok, Thailand.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121128,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,2012/11/30 06:00,2014/01/28 06:00,['2012/11/30 06:00'],"['2011/12/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12031 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2013 Aug;35(4):406-15. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12031.

Here, we present the 1.1 A resolution crystal structure of human USB1, defining it as a member of the LigT-like superfamily of 2H phosphoesterases. We show that human USB1 is a distributive 3'-5' exoribonuclease that posttranscriptionally removes uridine and adenosine nucleosides from the 3' end of spliceosomal U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA), directly catalyzing terminal 2', 3' cyclic phosphate formation. USB1 measures the appropriate length of the U6 oligo(U) tail by reading the position of a key adenine nucleotide (A102) and pausing 5 uridine residues downstream.We show that the 3' ends of U6 snRNA in PN patient lymphoblasts are elongated and unexpectedly carry nontemplated 3' oligo(A) tails that are characteristic of nuclear RNA surveillance targets. Thus, our study reveals a novel quality control pathway in which posttranscriptional 3'-end processing by USB1 protects U6 snRNA from targeting and destruction by the nuclear exosome. Our data implicate aberrant oligoadenylation of U6 snRNA in the pathogenesis of the leukemia predisposition disorder PN.","['Hilcenko, Christine', 'Simpson, Paul J', 'Finch, Andrew J', 'Bowler, Frank R', 'Churcher, Mark J', 'Jin, Li', 'Packman, Len C', 'Shlien, Adam', 'Campbell, Peter', 'Kirwan, Michael', 'Dokal, Inderjeet', 'Warren, Alan J']","['Hilcenko C', 'Simpson PJ', 'Finch AJ', 'Bowler FR', 'Churcher MJ', 'Jin L', 'Packman LC', 'Shlien A', 'Campbell P', 'Kirwan M', 'Dokal I', 'Warren AJ']","['MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121127,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2012/11/30 06:00,2013/04/06 06:00,['2012/11/30 06:00'],"['2012/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)42153-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-10-461491 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Feb 7;121(6):1028-38. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-10-461491.

This study evaluated the safety and tolerability of the thrombopoietin mimetic romiplostim and its effects on the incidence of clinically significant thrombocytopenic events (CSTEs) in lower risk MDS patients receiving lenalidomide. METHODS: Patients were assigned to weekly placebo (n = 12) or romiplostim 500 mug (n = 14) or 750 mug (n = 13) for four 28-day lenalidomide cycles. RESULTS: The treatment groups were generally similar with respect to baseline disease characteristics. Del(5q) abnormalities were noted in 1 (8%) patient in the placebo group, 3 (21%) in the romiplostim 500 mug group, and two (15%) in the 750 mug group. CSTEs were noted in 8 (67%) patients in the placebo group, 4 (29%) in the romiplostim 500 mug group, and 8 (62%) in the romiplostim 750 mug group. Throughout the study, median platelet counts trended lower in placebo-treated than in romiplostim-treated patients. Thrombocytopenia-related adjustments in lenalidomide occurred in 6 (50%) patients in the placebo group, 5 (36%) in the romiplostim 500 mug group, and 2 (15%) in the 750 mug group. Although the percentages of patients who received platelet transfusions were similar across treatment groups, there was a trend toward lower numbers of transfusions in both romiplostim groups during each treatment cycle. There were two serious treatment-related adverse events during the treatment period (cerebrovascular accident, placebo; worsening thrombocytopenia, romiplostim 500 mug). Two patients (romiplostim 500 and 750 mug, respectively) had an increase in bone marrow blasts to >20% during treatment, but had no post-treatment biopsy to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of progression to AML. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that romiplostim administered to MDS patients during lenalidomide treatment may decrease the frequency of dose reductions/delays due to thrombocytopenia. Additional study is needed to confirm the results of this preliminary trial.

Here, we demonstrate that vertical silicon nanowires (NWs) enable gene-specific manipulation of diverse murine and human immune cells with negligible toxicity. To illustrate the power of the technique, we then apply NW-mediated gene silencing to investigate the role of the Wnt signaling pathway in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Remarkably, CLL-B cells from different patients exhibit tremendous heterogeneity in their response to the knockdown of a single gene, LEF1. This functional heterogeneity defines three distinct patient groups not discernible by conventional CLL cytogenetic markers and provides a prognostic indicator for patients' time to first therapy. Analyses of gene expression signatures associated with these functional patient subgroups reveal unique insights into the underlying molecular basis for disease heterogeneity. Overall, our findings suggest a functional classification that can potentially guide the selection of patient-specific therapies in CLL and highlight the opportunities for nanotechnology to drive biological inquiry.","['Shalek, Alex K', 'Gaublomme, Jellert T', 'Wang, Lili', 'Yosef, Nir', 'Chevrier, Nicolas', 'Andersen, Mette S', 'Robinson, Jacob T', 'Pochet, Nathalie', 'Neuberg, Donna', 'Gertner, Rona S', 'Amit, Ido', 'Brown, Jennifer R', 'Hacohen, Nir', 'Regev, Aviv', 'Wu, Catherine J', 'Park, Hongkun']","['Shalek AK', 'Gaublomme JT', 'Wang L', 'Yosef N', 'Chevrier N', 'Andersen MS', 'Robinson JT', 'Pochet N', 'Neuberg D', 'Gertner RS', 'Amit I', 'Brown JR', 'Hacohen N', 'Regev A', 'Wu CJ', 'Park H']","['Department of Chemistry, Harvard University, 12 Oxford Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121203,United States,Nano Lett,Nano letters,101088070,PMC3573729,2012/11/30 06:00,2014/02/06 06:00,['2012/11/30 06:00'],"['2012/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/nl3042917 [doi]'],ppublish,Nano Lett. 2012 Dec 12;12(12):6498-504. doi: 10.1021/nl3042917.

Ponatinib (AP24534) is a potent oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks native and mutated BCR-ABL, including the gatekeeper mutant T315I, which is uniformly resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. METHODS: In this phase 1 dose-escalation study, we enrolled 81 patients with resistant hematologic cancers, including 60 with CML and 5 with Ph-positive ALL. Ponatinib was administered once daily at doses ranging from 2 to 60 mg. Median follow-up was 56 weeks (range, 2 to 140). RESULTS: Dose-limiting toxic effects included elevated lipase or amylase levels and pancreatitis. Common adverse events were rash, myelosuppression, and constitutional symptoms. Among Ph-positive patients, 91% had received two or more approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and 51% had received all three approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Of 43 patients with chronic-phase CML, 98% had a complete hematologic response, 72% had a major cytogenetic response, and 44% had a major molecular response. Of 12 patients who had chronic-phase CML with the T315I mutation, 100% had a complete hematologic response and 92% had a major cytogenetic response. Of 13 patients with chronic-phase CML without detectable mutations, 100% had a complete hematologic response and 62% had a major cytogenetic response. Responses among patients with chronic-phase CML were durable. Of 22 patients with accelerated-phase or blast-phase CML or Ph-positive ALL, 36% had a major hematologic response and 32% had a major cytogenetic response. CONCLUSIONS: Ponatinib was highly active in heavily pretreated patients with Ph-positive leukemias with resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including patients with the BCR-ABL T315I mutation, other mutations, or no mutations.

Chi-square analysis for heterogeneity and multiple Poisson regression using parametric harmonic modelling and bootstrap testing were used to detect possible monthly variation. Months of peak diagnoses were December and January, although some variation was present by sex and age. Heterogeneity across months was statistically significant (P < 0.001). In stratified analyses, monthly variation was detected only among males (P = 0.009) and in cases aged 65 years and older (P = 0.031). Poisson regression found no seasonal effect among all cases when fit to the sinusoidal model (P = 0.110). However, similar variation among males (P = 0.009) and cases aged 65 years and older (P = 0.018) was present. There is growing evidence of seasonality in AML diagnosis, particularly among older persons and men. Investigation of specific seasonal risk factors would be informative in explaining the aetiology behind the observed variation.","['Calip, Gregory S', 'McDougall, Jean A', 'Wheldon, Mark C', 'Li, Christopher I', 'De Roos, Anneclaire J']","['Calip GS', 'McDougall JA', 'Wheldon MC', 'Li CI', 'De Roos AJ']","['Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98109, USA. gcalip@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20121128,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,PMC3552069,2012/11/30 06:00,2013/06/15 06:00,['2012/11/30 06:00'],"['2012/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.12137 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2013 Feb;160(3):343-50. doi: 10.1111/bjh.12137.

MZB1 is important for B cell function as a key regulator of antibody secretion, calcium homeostasis and adhesion. Therefore, we analyzed the role of MZB1 expression levels in 139 patients with CLL using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and microarray data sets in CLL, follicular lymphoma (FL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), multiple myeloma (MM) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). High MZB1 expression was associated with inferior survival in CLL (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.63 [confidence interval (CI): 1.14-2.33], p = 0.007), FL (221286_s_at HR: 1.16 [CI: 0.98-1.37], p = 0.086; 223565_at: HR: 1.3 [CI: 1.1-1.61], p = 0.015) and DLBCL (221286_s_at: HR: 1.17 [CI: 1.06-1.3], p = 0.003; 223565_at: HR: 1.21 [CI: 1.08-1.35], p = 0.001). In DLBCL MZB1 expression was an additive prognostic marker in a multivariate model including activated B-cell like (ABC) versus germinal center (GCB) subtype. Additionally, MZB1 expression correlated with a unique gene expression pattern.

Mounting evidence indicates that viruses use these miRNAs to manipulate both cellular and viral gene expression. Viral infection also can exert a profound impact on the cellular miRNA expression profile. Some studies have demonstrated that some deregulations of miRNA are involved in the pathogenesis of HTLV-1. Furthermore, global analyses of ATL patient samples have provided a conceptual progress that Polycomb family induces miR-31 silencing, resulting in overexpression of NF- kappaB inducing kinase (NIK) following NF-kappaB activation. Given that miRNAs act as pleiotropic molecules essential in all cellular events, deregulation of miRNA signature caused by HTLV-1 infection strongly involves the imbalance of molecular network of lymphocytes. Recognition and understanding of the widespread molecular applicability of miRNAs will increasingly have much effect on the development of novel strategies to treat the HTLV-1-associated diseases.

In recent years, a number of genetic polymorphisms have been identified that can play a significant role in modifying the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these drugs. The best example is that of the TPMT gene, whose genotyping is being incorporated to clinical practice in order to individualize doses of mercaptopurine. However, there are additional genes that are relevant for the metabolism, activity, and/or transport of other chemotherapy drugs that are widely use in ALL, such as methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, L-asparaginase, etoposide, cytarabine, or cytotoxic antibiotics. These genes can also be affected by genetic alterations that could therefore have clinical consequences. In this review we will discuss recent data on this field, with special focus on those polymorphisms that could be used in clinical practice to tailor chemotherapy for ALL in order to reduce the occurrence of serious adverse effects.","['Gervasini, Guillermo', 'Vagace, Jose M']","['Gervasini G', 'Vagace JM']","['Department of Medical and Surgical Therapeutics, Division of Pharmacology, Medical School, University of Extremadura Badajoz, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121122,Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,PMC3504364,2012/11/29 06:00,2012/11/29 06:01,['2012/11/29 06:00'],"['2012/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/29 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fgene.2012.00249 [doi]'],epublish,Front Genet. 2012 Nov 22;3:249. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2012.00249. eCollection 2012.,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'chemotherapy', 'genetic polymorphisms', 'pharmacogenetics', 'toxicity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumor stem cells are able to self-propagate in vitro (self-renewal), giving rise both to other tumor stem cells and most advanced cells in the line of differentiation (asymmetric division). A final characteristic is tumorigenicity, a fundamental property, which outlines the tumor stem cell as the only cell able to initiate the formation of a tumor when implanted in immune-deficient mice. The hypothesis of a hierarchical organization of tumor cells dates back more than 40 years, but only in 1997, thanks to the work of John Dick and Dominique Bonnet, was there the formal proof of such an organization in acute myeloid leukemia. Following this, many other research groups were able to isolate CSCs, by appropriate selection markers, in various malignancies, such as breast, brain, colon, pancreas, and liver cancers and in melanoma. To date, however, it is not possible to isolate stem cells from all types of neoplasia, particularly in solid tumors. From a therapeutic point of view, the concept of tumor stem cells implies a complete revision of conventional antineoplastic treatment. Conventional cytotoxic agents are designed to target actively proliferating cells. In the majority of cases, this is not sufficient to eliminate the CSCs, which thanks to their reduced proliferative activity and/or the presence of proteins capable of extruding chemotherapeutics from the cell are not targeted. Therefore, the theory of cancer stem cells can pose new paradigms in terms of cancer treatment. Potential approaches, even in the very early experimental stages, relate to the selective inhibition of pathways connected with self-renewal, or more specifically based on the presence of specific surface markers for selective cytotoxic agent vehicles. Finally, some research groups are trying to induce these cells to differentiate, thus making them easier to remove. For all these reasons, we have collected existing literature on head and neck cancer stem cells that correlate the biological characteristics of this subpopulation of cancer cells with the clinical behavior of tumors.","['Allegra, Eugenia', 'Trapasso, Serena']","['Allegra E', 'Trapasso S']","['Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121121,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,PMC3507319,2012/11/29 06:00,2012/11/29 06:01,['2012/11/29 06:00'],"['2012/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/29 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S38694 [doi]', 'ott-5-375 [pii]']",ppublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2012;5:375-83. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S38694.

These mechanisms blunt adoptive immunotherapy with infused T-cells due to a complex array of signals that determine T-cell tolerance, survival, or deletion. Ligation of the negative regulatory receptors CTLA4, PD-1(PDCD1), or LAG3 on T-cells normally hinders their response to antigen through nonredundant biochemical processes that interfere with stimulatory pathways. In this study, we used an established mouse model of T-cell tolerance to define the roles of these inhibitory receptors in regulating CD8(+) T-cell tolerance during adoptive immunotherapy to treat leukemia. Blocking CTLA4 and PD-1 in vivo combined to promote survival of transferred T-cells despite powerful deletional signals that mediate Bim (BCL2L11)-dependent apoptosis. However, this dual blockade was not optimal for stimulating effector function by responding T-cells, which required the additional blockade of LAG3 to induce full expansion and allow the acquisition of robust cytolytic activity. Thus, the cooperation of multiple distinct regulatory pathways was needed for the survival and effector differentiation of adoptively transferred tumor-reactive CD8(+) T-cells. Our work defines the immune escape pathways in which simultaneous blockade could yield durable immunotherapeutic responses that can eradicate disseminated leukemia.","['Berrien-Elliott, Melissa M', 'Jackson, Stephanie R', 'Meyer, Jennifer M', 'Rouskey, Craig J', 'Nguyen, Thanh-Long M', 'Yagita, Hideo', 'Greenberg, Philip D', 'DiPaolo, Richard J', 'Teague, Ryan M']","['Berrien-Elliott MM', 'Jackson SR', 'Meyer JM', 'Rouskey CJ', 'Nguyen TL', 'Yagita H', 'Greenberg PD', 'DiPaolo RJ', 'Teague RM']","['Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20121127,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,PMC3548961,2012/11/29 06:00,2013/03/27 06:00,['2012/11/29 06:00'],"['2012/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-12-2179 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-2179 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2013 Jan 15;73(2):605-16. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-2179.

Hypercalcemia may determine acute pancreatitis, its causes being multiple: primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism, metabolic diseases of the bone, metastatic bone neoplasm, as well as lymphoproliferative syndromes caused by the HTLV-1 virus-adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). ATLL is a malignant and aggressive lymphoproliferation with the T-cell, associated with the infection caused by the HTLV-1 retrovirus. Organomegaly, cutaneous conditions, and hypercalcemia represent the main characteristics of the disease. From a hematologic point of view, we can notice the atypical lymphocytes (also known as flower cells, due to the shape of their nucleus), with a distinct CD4+ CD25+ phenotype. There have been reported few cases of patients who showed acute pancreatitis in the onset of the disease. We will describe the case of a patient whose diagnosis has not been an easy one, as it showed multiple complications from a very early stage. CONCLUSIONS: The atypical onset of ATLL with acute pancreatitis is rarely reported. Its etiology seems to be hypercalcemia but pancreatic infiltration with ATLL cells cannot be ruled out. An attentive investigation of the peripheral blood sample and flow-cytometric tests of peripheral and medullar blood smear are very important for diagnosis. The patient showed from the very beginning severe neurological manifestations which developed to a coma. Causes could have been metabolic as well as CNS infiltration (as shown by the CT examination).","['Popescu, M', 'Popov, Viola', 'Popescu, G', 'Dobrea, Camelia', 'Sandu, Aurelia', 'Grigorean, V T', 'Strambu, V', 'Plesea, I E']","['Popescu M', 'Popov V', 'Popescu G', 'Dobrea C', 'Sandu A', 'Grigorean VT', 'Strambu V', 'Plesea IE']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Emergency County Hospital, Pitesti, Romania.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Romania,Rom J Morphol Embryol,Romanian journal of morphology and embryology = Revue roumaine de morphologie et embryologie,9112454,,2012/12/05 06:00,2014/05/03 06:00,['2012/11/29 06:00'],"['2012/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [medline]']",['531312847850 [pii]'],ppublish,Rom J Morphol Embryol. 2012;53(3 Suppl):847-50.,,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*complications/pathology', 'Pancreatitis/*etiology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We surveyed 117 adult survivors of childhood ALL using the Harvard Food Frequency Questionnaire. Physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) was measured with the SenseWear Pro2 Armband. Insulin resistance was estimated using the Homeostasis Model for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR). Visceral and subcutaneous adiposity were measured by abdominal CT. Adherence to a Mediterranean diet pattern was calculated using the index developed by Trichopoulou. Subjects were compared using multivariate analysis adjusted for age and gender. RESULTS: Greater adherence to a Mediterranean diet pattern was associated with lower visceral adiposity (p = 0.07), subcutaneous adiposity (p < 0.001), waist circumference (p = 0.005), and body mass index (p = 0.04). For each point higher on the Mediterranean Diet Score, the odds of having the metabolic syndrome fell by 31 % (OR 0.69; 95 % CI 0.50, 0.94; p = 0.019). Higher dairy intake was associated with higher HOMA-IR (p = 0.014), but other individual components of the Mediterranean diet, such as low intake of meat or high intake of fruits and vegetables, were not significant. PAEE was not independently associated with metabolic outcomes, although higher PAEE was associated with lower body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to a Mediterranean diet pattern was associated with better metabolic and anthropometric parameters in this cross-sectional study of ALL survivors.","['Tonorezos, Emily S', 'Robien, Kim', 'Eshelman-Kent, Debra', 'Moskowitz, Chaya S', 'Church, Timothy S', 'Ross, Robert', 'Oeffinger, Kevin C']","['Tonorezos ES', 'Robien K', 'Eshelman-Kent D', 'Moskowitz CS', 'Church TS', 'Ross R', 'Oeffinger KC']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121128,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,PMC3557541,2012/11/29 06:00,2013/10/31 06:00,['2012/11/29 06:00'],"['2012/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/10/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10552-012-0116-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2013 Feb;24(2):313-21. doi: 10.1007/s10552-012-0116-6.

These agents have dramatically changed the treatment landscape for CML, shifting the use of allogeneic stem cell transplantation to selected patients in the salvage setting. Four BCR-ABL TKIs are now commercially available for the treatment of CML: the first-generation TKI imatinib, and the second-generation TKIs dasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib. Continuous treatment with these agents induces durable responses in a high proportion of patients with chronic-phase CML. Research is focused on identifying which patients can discontinue therapy without a recurrence of disease. For the group of patients with resistance to TKIs, multiple alternative therapies are being evaluated. The third-generation TKI ponatinib is a BCR-ABL inhibitor that has demonstrated significant activity, including in patients with the TKI resistance mutation T315I. The homoharringtonine derivative omacetaxine mepesuccinate, which inhibits protein synthesis, has also demonstrated clinical activity in CML, including in patients with TKI resistance due to T315I and in patients who have TKI resistance despite no evidence of ABL mutations.

These targeted carrier-drug conjugates are also capable of reversing drug resistance in cancer cells. Although many targeted drug delivery approaches are being tested, the linkage of several and different drugs to a single carrier molecule might further enhance their therapeutic efficacy, particularly if the drugs are engineered for variable time release. This report shows that murine B-cell leukemic cells previously resistant to a chemotherapeutic drug can be made sensitive to that drug as long as it is conjugated to a targeting peptide and, in particular, when the conjugate contains multiple copies of the drug. Using a 13mer peptide (VHFFKNIVTPRTP) derived from the myelin basic protein (p-MBP), dendrimer-based peptide conjugates containing one, two, or four molecules of chlorambucil were synthesized. Although murine hybridomas expressing antibodies to either p-MBP (MBP cells) or a nonrelevant antigen (BCL-1 cells) were both resistant to free chlorambucil, exposure of the cells to the p-MBP-chlorambucil conjugate completely reversed the drug resistance in MBP, but not BCL-1 cells or normal spleen cells. Moreover, at equivalent drug doses, there was significant enhancement in the cytotoxic activity of multidrug versus single-drug copy conjugates. On the basis of these results, the use of multifunctional dendrone linkers bearing several covalently bound cytotoxic agents allows the development of more effective targeted drug systems and enhances the efficacy of currently approved drugs for B-cell leukemia.","['Gellerman, Gary', 'Baskin, Sophia', 'Galia, Luboshits', 'Gilad, Yosef', 'Firer, Michael A']","['Gellerman G', 'Baskin S', 'Galia L', 'Gilad Y', 'Firer MA']","['Department of Biological Chemistry, Ariel University Center, Ariel, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,,2012/11/29 06:00,2013/05/25 06:00,['2012/11/29 06:00'],"['2012/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CAD.0b013e32835bb17a [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2013 Feb;24(2):112-9. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0b013e32835bb17a.,"['0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Peptides)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chlorambucil/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Drug Carriers/chemistry', 'Drug Delivery Systems/methods', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Peptides/chemistry/*pharmacology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall, 65 children were treated with 5 g/m2/24 h MTX and 88 children were treated with 2 g/m2/24 h MTX according to ALL-BFM 95 and ALL IC-BFM 2002 protocols (mean age: 6.4 years, range 1.0-17.9 years). A total of 583 HD-MTX courses were analyzed. Serum MTX and 7-OH-MTX levels were measured at 24, 36, and 48 h, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) MTX levels were determined 24 h after the initiation of the infusion. The area under the concentration-time curve was calculated. Hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and bone marrow toxicity were estimated by routine laboratory tests. We investigated pharmacokinetics and toxicity in distinct age groups (< 6 and > 14 years). 5 g/m2/24 h treatments resulted in higher serum and CSF MTX and 7-OH-MTX levels (P < 0.05). The CSF penetration rate of MTX was independent of the MTX dose [2.3% (95% confidence interval: 1.7-2.5%) vs. 2.8% (95% confidence interval: 2.4-3%)]. The CSF MTX concentration was correlated with the 24 h MTX serum level (r = 0.38, P < 0.0001). Repeated treatments did not alter MTX or 7-OH-MTX levels. 7-OH-MTX levels were correlated with nephrotoxicity (r = 0.36, P < 0.0001). Higher MTX levels and toxicity occurred more frequently in children aged older than 14 years (P < 0.05). Therapeutic serum and CSF MTX concentrations can be achieved more reliably with 5 g/m2/24 h treatments. To predict the development of toxicity, monitoring of the level of the 7-OH-MTX is useful. Monitoring of pharmacokinetics is essential to prevent the development of severe adverse events in adolescents.","['Csordas, Katalin', 'Hegyi, Marta', 'Eipel, Oliver T', 'Muller, Judit', 'Erdelyi, Daniel J', 'Kovacs, Gabor T']","['Csordas K', 'Hegyi M', 'Eipel OT', 'Muller J', 'Erdelyi DJ', 'Kovacs GT']","['2nd Department of Pediatrics, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary. csordaskatalin@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,,2012/11/29 06:00,2013/05/25 06:00,['2012/11/29 06:00'],"['2012/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CAD.0b013e32835b8662 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2013 Feb;24(2):189-97. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0b013e32835b8662.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'X019Z9S1DL (7-hydroxymethotrexate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects/blood/cerebrospinal fluid/*pharmacokinetics', 'Area Under Curve', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/blood/cerebrospinal fluid/*pharmacokinetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/cerebrospinal fluid/*drug therapy/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was previously shown that Flvcr1-null mice died in utero due to a failure of erythropoiesis. Here, we identify Flvcr1b, a mitochondrial Flvcr1 isoform that promotes heme efflux into the cytoplasm. Flvcr1b overexpression promoted heme synthesis and in vitro erythroid differentiation, whereas silencing of Flvcr1b caused mitochondrial heme accumulation and termination of erythroid differentiation. Furthermore, mice lacking the plasma membrane isoform (Flvcr1a) but expressing Flvcr1b had normal erythropoiesis, but exhibited hemorrhages, edema, and skeletal abnormalities. Thus, FLVCR1b regulates erythropoiesis by controlling mitochondrial heme efflux, whereas FLVCR1a expression is required to prevent hemorrhages and edema. The aberrant expression of Flvcr1 isoforms may play a role in the pathogenesis of disorders characterized by an imbalance between heme and globin synthesis.","['Chiabrando, Deborah', 'Marro, Samuele', 'Mercurio, Sonia', 'Giorgi, Carlotta', 'Petrillo, Sara', 'Vinchi, Francesca', 'Fiorito, Veronica', 'Fagoonee, Sharmila', 'Camporeale, Annalisa', 'Turco, Emilia', 'Merlo, Giorgio R', 'Silengo, Lorenzo', 'Altruda, Fiorella', 'Pinton, Paolo', 'Tolosano, Emanuela']","['Chiabrando D', 'Marro S', 'Mercurio S', 'Giorgi C', 'Petrillo S', 'Vinchi F', 'Fiorito V', 'Fagoonee S', 'Camporeale A', 'Turco E', 'Merlo GR', 'Silengo L', 'Altruda F', 'Pinton P', 'Tolosano E']","['Molecular Biotechnology Centre, Department of Genetics, Biology and Biochemistry, University of Torino, Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121126,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,PMC3533534,2012/11/29 06:00,2013/02/05 06:00,['2012/11/29 06:00'],"['2011/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['62422 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI62422 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2012 Dec;122(12):4569-79. doi: 10.1172/JCI62422.

METHODS: Fasting plasma glucose, insulin, free fatty acids (FFAs), leptin, adiponectin, resistin, TNFalpha, and IL-6 were measured in each case and in 8 healthy women; Case 1 was also assessed after initiating pioglitazone. Coding regions and splice junctions of PPARG, LMNA, and AKT2 were sequenced in Case 1 and of PPARG in Case 2 to evaluate for familial partial lipodystrophies. Genotyping of APOE was performed in Case 1 to rule out type III hyperlipoproteinemia. RESULTS: Both cases had elevated plasma levels of insulin, leptin, resistin, and IL-6, high-normal to elevated TNFalpha, and low to low-normal adiponectin in keeping with post-receptor insulin resistance and adipose tissue inflammation. Case 1 experienced a biochemical response to pioglitazone. No causative mutations for partial lipodystrophies or type III hyperlipoproteinemia were identified. CONCLUSION: Though metabolic derangements have previously been reported in association with TBI, few cases have described insulin resistance and hypertriglyceridemia as severe as that seen in our patients. We speculate that early childhood TBI may impede adipose tissue development leading to metabolic complications from an attenuated ability of adipose tissue to accommodate caloric excess, and propose that this extreme metabolic syndrome be evaluated for as a late complication of TBI.","['Mayson, Sarah E', 'Parker, Victoria E R', 'Schutta, Mark H', 'Semple, Robert K', 'Rickels, Michael R']","['Mayson SE', 'Parker VE', 'Schutta MH', 'Semple RK', 'Rickels MR']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA. sarah.mayson@uphs.upenn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Endocr Pract,Endocrine practice : official journal of the American College of Endocrinology and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists,9607439,PMC4569090,2012/11/29 06:00,2013/08/16 06:00,['2012/11/29 06:00'],"['2012/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S1530-891X(20)41215-7 [pii]', '10.4158/EP12115.OR [doi]']",ppublish,Endocr Pract. 2013 Jan-Feb;19(1):51-8. doi: 10.4158/EP12115.OR.,"['0 (Blood Glucose)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leptin)', '0 (Resistin)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Blood Glucose', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/etiology/*metabolism', 'Fatty Liver/etiology/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypertriglyceridemia/etiology/*metabolism', 'Insulin/blood', 'Insulin Resistance/*physiology', 'Interleukin-6/blood', 'Leptin/blood', 'Neuroblastoma/radiotherapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/radiotherapy', 'Resistin/blood', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/blood', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Young Adult']",,,,,"['G0600717/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'P30 DK019525/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-DK19525/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', '080952/Z/06/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",['NIHMS720074'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Selective Abl kinase inhibitors have been successfully established for the treatment of Ph (+) leukemias. Despite high rates of clinical response, Ph (+) patients can develop resistance against these kinase inhibitors mainly due to point mutations within the Abl protein. Of special interest is the 'gatekeeper' T315I mutation, which confers complete resistance to Abl kinase inhibitors. Recently, GNF-2, Abl allosteric kinase inhibitor, was demonstrated to possess cellular activity against Bcr-Abl transformed cells. Similarly to Abl kinase inhibitors (AKIs), GNF-2 failed to inhibit activity of mutated Bcr-Abl carrying the T315I mutation. METHODS: Ba/F3 cells harboring native or T315I mutated Bcr-Abl constructs were treated with GNF-2 and AKIs. We monitored the effect of GNF-2 with AKIs on the proliferation and clonigenicity of the different Ba/F3 cells. In addition, we monitored the auto-phosphorylation activity of Bcr-Abl and JAK2 in cells treated with GNF-2 and AKIs. RESULTS: In this study, we report a cooperation between AKIs and GNF-2 in inhibiting proliferation and clonigenicity of Ba/F3 cells carrying T315I mutated Bcr-Abl. Interestingly, cooperation was most evident between Dasatinib and GNF-2. Furthermore, we showed that GNF-2 was moderately active in inhibiting the activity of JAK2 kinase, and presence of AKIs augmented GNF-2 activity. CONCLUSIONS: Our data illustrated the ability of allosteric inhibitors such as GNF-2 to cooperate with AKIs to overcome T315I mutation by Bcr-Abl-independent mechanisms, providing a possibility of enhancing AKIs efficacy and overcoming resistance in Ph+ leukemia cells.","['Khateb, Mamduh', 'Ruimi, Nili', 'Khamisie, Hazem', 'Najajreh, Yousef', 'Mian, Afsar', 'Metodieva, Anna', 'Ruthardt, Martin', 'Mahajna, Jamal']","['Khateb M', 'Ruimi N', 'Khamisie H', 'Najajreh Y', 'Mian A', 'Metodieva A', 'Ruthardt M', 'Mahajna J']","['Cancer Drug Discovery Program, Galilee Technology Center, Migal, P.O.Box 831, Kiryat Shmona 11016, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121127,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,PMC3561207,2012/11/29 06:00,2013/07/03 06:00,['2012/11/29 06:00'],"['2012/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-12-563 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-12-563 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2012 Nov 27;12:563. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-12-563.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (GNF-2 compound)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/methods', 'Drug Therapy, Combination/methods', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Mutation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The major hurdles are its signal sequence, strong hydrophobic regions and heavy glycosylation. While it has not been possible to express full length recombinant (r)-gp160 in E. coli, it can be expressed in insect and mammalian cells, but at relatively higher cost. In this work, we report E. coli-based over-expression of r-gp160 variant and evaluate its performance in diagnostic immunoassays for the detection of anti-HIV-1 antibodies. METHODS: A deletion variant of r-gp160 lacking hydrophobic regions of the parent full length molecule was expressed in E. coli and purified to near homogeneity using single-step Ni(II)-affinity chromatography. Biotinylated and europium(III) chelate-labeled versions of this antigen were used to set up one- and two-step time-resolved fluorometric double antigen sandwich assays. The performance of these assays was evaluated against a collection of well-characterized human sera (n=131), that included an in-house panel and four commercially procured panels. RESULTS: In-frame deletion of three hydrophobic regions, spanning amino acid residues 1-43, 519-538 and 676-706, of full length HIV-1 gp160 resulted in its expression in E. coli. Both the one- and two-step assays manifested high sensitivity unambiguously identifying 75/77 and 77/77 HIV-1 positive sera, respectively. Both assays also identified all 52 HIV-seronegative sera correctly. Between the two assays, the mean signal-to-cutoff value of the two-step assay was an order of magnitude greater than that of the one-step assay. Both assays were highly specific manifesting no cross-reactivity towards antibodies specific to other viruses like hepatitis B, C, and human T cell leukemia viruses. CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated the expression of r-gp160 variant in E. coli, by deletion of hydrophobic regions, and its purification in reasonable yields. This underscores the potential for cost saving in antigen production. Evaluation of this antigen in a double antigen sandwich two-step assay showed it to be a highly sensitive and specific HIV-1 diagnostic reagent. The amenability of this assay to the one-step format suggests its potential utility in developing a rapid point-of-care HIV-1 diagnostic test.","['Talha, Sheikh M', 'Nemani, Satish Kumar', 'Salminen, Teppo', 'Kumar, Sushil', 'Swaminathan, Sathyamangalam', 'Soukka, Tero', 'Pettersson, Kim', 'Khanna, Navin']","['Talha SM', 'Nemani SK', 'Salminen T', 'Kumar S', 'Swaminathan S', 'Soukka T', 'Pettersson K', 'Khanna N']","['Department of Biotechnology, University of Turku, 20520 Turku, Finland. talshe@utu.fi']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121127,England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,PMC3519745,2012/11/29 06:00,2013/04/30 06:00,['2012/11/29 06:00'],"['2012/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2334-12-325 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2334-12-325 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2012 Nov 27;12:325. doi: 10.1186/1471-2334-12-325.,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (HIV Antibodies)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp160)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (gp160 protein, Human immunodeficiency virus 1)']",IM,,"['*Antigens, Viral/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Clinical Laboratory Techniques/*methods', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'HIV Antibodies/*blood', '*HIV Envelope Protein gp160/genetics/isolation & purification', 'HIV Infections/*diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Immunoassay/methods', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sequence Deletion']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism causing apoptosis, however, is still controversial. Since the glucocorticoid receptor is a transcription factor, some of its target genes are expected to be implicated in apoptosis. In this study, using a GC-sensitive human pre-B leukemia cell line, Nalm-6, the FK506 binding protein 51 (FKBP5) and regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1) genes were disrupted by homologous recombination, since the expression of both is up-regulated by GC in GC-sensitive but not in GC-resistant leukemic cell lines. While the disruption of FKBP5 had a marginal effect on GC-induced apoptosis, that of RCAN1 resulted in marked resistance to GC. In addition, overexpression of RCAN1 rendered cells more sensitive to DEX. In RCAN1-disrupted cells, levels of some pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins were decreased and increased, respectively. Finally, phosphorylation of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) and up-regulation of CREB target genes by GC were inhibited by RCAN1 disruption, and treatment with a cAMP-inducing agent, forskolin, restored the sensitivity to GC in RCAN1-disrupted Nalm-6 cells. These findings suggest that up-regulation of RCAN1 expression followed by activation of the CREB pathway is required in GC-induced apoptosis.","['Nagao, Kazuaki', 'Iwai, Yujiro', 'Miyashita, Toshiyuki']","['Nagao K', 'Iwai Y', 'Miyashita T']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kitasato University, Sagamihara, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121121,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC3503877,2012/11/28 06:00,2013/06/01 06:00,['2012/11/28 06:00'],"['2012/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0049926 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-23465 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(11):e49926. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0049926.

Tcf1(-/-) mice have previously been characterized and show developmental blocks at the CD4-CD8- double negative (DN) to CD4+CD8+ double positive transition. Due to the blocks in T-cell development, Tcf1(-/-) mice normally have a very small thymus. Unexpectedly, a large proportion of Tcf1(-/-) mice spontaneously develop thymic lymphomas with 50% of mice developing a thymic lymphoma/leukemia at the age of 16 wk. These lymphomas are clonal, highly metastatic, and paradoxically show high Wnt signaling when crossed with Wnt reporter mice and have high expression of Wnt target genes Lef1 and Axin2. In wild-type thymocytes, Tcf1 is higher expressed than Lef1, with a predominance of Wnt inhibitory isoforms. Loss of Tcf1 as repressor of Lef1 leads to high Wnt activity and is the initiating event in lymphoma development, which is exacerbated by activating Notch1 mutations. Thus, Notch1 and loss of Tcf1 functionally act as collaborating oncogenic events. Tcf1 deficiency predisposes to the development of thymic lymphomas by ectopic up-regulation of Lef1 due to lack of Tcf1 repressive isoforms and frequently by cooperating activating mutations in Notch1. Tcf1 therefore functions as a T-cell-specific tumor suppressor gene, besides its established role as a Wnt responsive transcription factor. Thus, Tcf1 acts as a molecular switch between proliferative and repressive signals during T-lymphocyte development in the thymus.","['Tiemessen, Machteld M', 'Baert, Miranda R M', 'Schonewille, Tom', 'Brugman, Martijn H', 'Famili, Farbod', 'Salvatori, Daniela C F', 'Meijerink, Jules P P', 'Ozbek, Ugur', 'Clevers, Hans', 'van Dongen, Jacques J M', 'Staal, Frank J T']","['Tiemessen MM', 'Baert MR', 'Schonewille T', 'Brugman MH', 'Famili F', 'Salvatori DC', 'Meijerink JP', 'Ozbek U', 'Clevers H', 'van Dongen JJ', 'Staal FJ']","['Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121120,United States,PLoS Biol,PLoS biology,101183755,PMC3502537,2012/11/28 06:00,2013/04/20 06:00,['2012/11/28 06:00'],"['2012/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pbio.1001430 [doi]', 'PBIOLOGY-D-12-00489 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS Biol. 2012;10(11):e1001430. doi: 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001430.

Abl kinase inhibitors (protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors) represent standard treatment for CML and induce remission in the majority of patients with early disease, however these drugs do not target leukaemic stem cells (LSCs) effectively, thus preventing cure. Previously, we identified the farnesyl transferase inhibitor BMS-214662 as a selective inducer of apoptosis in LSCs of CML patients relative to normal controls; however, the mechanism underlying LSC-specific apoptosis remains unclear. To identify pathways involved in the favourable effects of BMS-214662 in CML, we employed a proteomic approach (based on iTRAQ) to analyse changes in protein expression in response to drug treatment in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of CD34(+) CML cells. The study identified 88 proteins as altered after drug treatment, which included proteins known to be involved in nucleic acid metabolism, oncogenesis, developmental processes and intracellular protein trafficking. We found that expression of Ebp1, a negative regulator of proliferation, was upregulated in the nucleus of BMS-214662-treated cells. Furthermore, proteins showing altered levels in the cytosol, such as histones, were predominantly derived from the nucleus and BMS-214662 affected expression levels of nuclear pore complex proteins. Validation of key facets of these observations suggests that drug-induced alterations in protein localisation, potentially via loss of nuclear membrane integrity, contributes to the LSC specificity of BMS-214662, possibly via Ran proteins as targets.","['Balabanov, Stefan', 'Evans, Caroline A', 'Abraham, Sheela A', 'Pellicano, Francesca', 'Copland, Mhairi', 'Walker, Michael J', 'Whetton, Anthony D', 'Holyoake, Tessa L']","['Balabanov S', 'Evans CA', 'Abraham SA', 'Pellicano F', 'Copland M', 'Walker MJ', 'Whetton AD', 'Holyoake TL']","['Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Proteomics,Proteomics,101092707,,2012/11/28 06:00,2013/06/20 06:00,['2012/11/28 06:00'],"['2012/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/16 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pmic.201200022 [doi]'],ppublish,Proteomics. 2013 Jan;13(1):153-68. doi: 10.1002/pmic.201200022.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (PA2G4 protein, human)', '0 (Proteome)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '12794-10-4 (Benzodiazepines)', 'EC 2.5.1.29 (Farnesyltranstransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ran GTP-Binding Protein)', 'L2U9GFD244', '(7-cyano-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1-(1H-imidazol-4-ylmethyl)-3-(phenylmethyl)-4-(2-thie', 'nylsulfonyl)-1H-1,4-benzodiazepine)']",IM,,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/metabolism', '*Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzodiazepines/*administration & dosage', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Farnesyltranstransferase/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Imidazoles/*administration & dosage', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Proteome/analysis', '*RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'ran GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism']",,,,"['(c) 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This heterogeneity is exemplified by the variable clinical outcomes that are observed in patients with AML, and it is largely the result of diverse mutations within the leukemic cells. These mutations range from relatively large genetic alterations, such as gains, losses, and translocations of chromosomes, to single nucleotide changes. Detection of many of these mutations is required for accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of patients with AML. As such, many testing modalities have been developed and are currently employed in clinical laboratories to ascertain mutational status at prognostically and therapeutically critical loci. The assays include those that specifically identify large chromosomal alterations, such as conventional metaphase analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization, and methods that are geared more toward analysis of small mutations, such as PCR with allele-specific oligonucleotide primers. Furthermore, newer tests, including array analysis and next-generation sequencing, which can simultaneously probe numerous molecular aberrancies within tumor cells, are likely to become commonplace in AML diagnostics. Each testing method clearly has advantages and disadvantages, an understanding of which should influence the choice of test in various clinical circumstances. To aid such understanding, this review discusses both genetic mutations in AML and the clinical tests-including their pros and cons-that may be used to probe these abnormalities. Additionally, we highlight the significance of genetic testing by describing cases in which results of genetic testing significantly influence clinical management of patients with AML.","['Wertheim, Gerald B W', 'Hexner, Elizabeth', 'Bagg, Adam']","['Wertheim GB', 'Hexner E', 'Bagg A']","[""Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,New Zealand,Mol Diagn Ther,Molecular diagnosis & therapy,101264260,,2012/11/28 06:00,2013/05/25 06:00,['2012/11/28 06:00'],"['2012/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s40291-012-0009-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Diagn Ther. 2012 Dec;16(6):357-69. doi: 10.1007/s40291-012-0009-0.,,IM,,"['Cell Proliferation', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Genetic Testing/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*classification/*diagnosis/genetics/*therapy', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques/*methods', 'Precision Medicine/*methods/trends', 'Prognosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In our study, we investigated the effect of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors IM and nilotinib (NI) on antigen presentation and processing by analyzing the proteasomal activity in CML cell lines and patient samples. We used a biotinylated active site-directed probe, which covalently binds to the proteasomally active beta-subunits in an activity-dependent fashion. Additionally, we analyzed the cleavage and processing of HLA-A3/11- and HLA-B8-binding peptides derived from BCR-ABL by IM- or NI-treated isolated 20S immunoproteasomes using mass spectrometry. We found that IM treatment leads to a reduction in MHC-class I expression which is in line with the inhibition of proteasomal activity. This process is independent of BCR-ABL or apoptosis induction. In vitro digestion experiments using purified proteasomes showed that generation of epitope-precursor peptides was significantly altered in the presence of NI and IM. Treatment of the immunoproteasome with these compounds resulted in an almost complete reduction in the generation of long precursor peptides for the HLA-A3/A11 and -B8 epitopes while processing of the short peptide sequences increased. Treatment of isolated 20S proteasomes with serine-/threonine- and tyrosine-specific phosphatases induced a significant downregulation of the proteasomal activity further indicating that phosphorylation of the proteasome regulates its function and antigen processing. Our results demonstrate that IM and NI can affect the immunogenicity of malignant cells by modulating proteasomal degradation and the repertoire of processed T cell epitopes.","['Held, Stefanie Andrea Erika', 'Duchardt, Katharina Maria', 'Tenzer, Stefan', 'Ruckrich, Thomas', 'von Schwarzenberg, Karin', 'Bringmann, Anita', 'Kurts, Christian', 'Schild, Hansjorg', 'Driessen, Christoph', 'Brossart, Peter', 'Heine, Annkristin']","['Held SA', 'Duchardt KM', 'Tenzer S', 'Ruckrich T', 'von Schwarzenberg K', 'Bringmann A', 'Kurts C', 'Schild H', 'Driessen C', 'Brossart P', 'Heine A']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany. stefanie.held@ukb.uni-bonn.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121125,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,,2012/11/28 06:00,2013/06/08 06:00,['2012/11/28 06:00'],"['2012/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-012-1373-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2013 Apr;62(4):715-26. doi: 10.1007/s00262-012-1373-7.

The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (reference SNP no. rs11554137:C>T) located on IDH1 codon 105 has been associated with a poor outcome in patients with acute myeloid leukemia but has not been investigated in patients with gliomas. METHODS: The IDH1 codon 105 SNP was genotyped first in a series of 952 patients with grade 2 through 4 gliomas and was correlated with outcomes and tumor genomic profile. Then, it was genotyped in 2 validations sets of 306 patients with glioblastoma (GBM) and 591 patients with glioma. RESULTS: The minor allele codon 105 glycine (GGT) SNP (IDH1(105GGT) ) was identified in 98 of 952 patients (10.3%) and was not associated with the codon 132 (IDH1(132) ) mutation. Patients who had GMB with the IDH1(105GGT) variant had a poorer outcome than patients without the variant (median overall survival [OS], 10.7 months vs 15.5 months; P = .001; median progression-free survival [PFS], 6.4 months vs 8.5 months; P = .003). The prognostic impact was confirmed in an independent validation set of 306 GBMs from the same center (median PFS, 6.8 months vs 9.7 months; P = .006; median OS, 13.9 months vs 18.8 months; P = .0187). In the second validation cohort (591 grade 2-4 gliomas), a significant association was observed between IDH1(105GGT) and an adverse prognosis for the overall series and for patients with World Health Organization grade 3 gliomas, but the difference did not reach significance in patients with GBM. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the current data strongly suggested an association between the SNP rs11554137:C>T polymorphism and adverse outcomes in patients with malignant glioma. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located on codon 105 of the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) gene (reference SNP rs11554137) is analyzed in 3 independent series of patients with gliomas. The SNP rs11554137 is independent of the occurrence of somatic mutation on IDH1 codon 132, but, per se, has a prognostic impact in malignant gliomas.","['Wang, Xiao-Wei', 'Boisselier, Blandine', 'Rossetto, Marta', 'Marie, Yannick', 'Idbaih, Ahmed', 'Mokhtari, Karima', 'Gousias, Konstantinos', 'Hoang-Xuan, Khe', 'Delattre, Jean-Yves', 'Simon, Matthias', 'Labussiere, Marianne', 'Sanson, Marc']","['Wang XW', 'Boisselier B', 'Rossetto M', 'Marie Y', 'Idbaih A', 'Mokhtari K', 'Gousias K', 'Hoang-Xuan K', 'Delattre JY', 'Simon M', 'Labussiere M', 'Sanson M']","['CRICM, Pierre and Marie Curie University, Paris, France; INSERM U 975, Paris, France; UMR 7225, CNRS, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121126,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,2012/11/28 06:00,2013/04/26 06:00,['2012/11/28 06:00'],"['2012/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/13 00:00 [revised]', '2012/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.27798 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2013 Feb 15;119(4):806-13. doi: 10.1002/cncr.27798.

It causes rapid and prolonged lymphocyte depletion; the consequent homeostatic reconstitution leads to a radically reformed lymphocyte pool with a relative increase in regulatory T cells and expansion of autoreactive T cells. Although previously licensed for the treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, it is now been considered for licensing in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). From a disappointing experience with alemtuzumab in progressive MS, Alastair Compston and I argued that immunotherapies should be given early in the course of the disease. In a unique program of drug development in MS, alemtuzumab has been compared in 1 phase 2 trial and 2 phase 3 trials with the active comparator interferon beta-1a. In all trials, alemtuzumab was more effective in suppressing relapses than interferon beta-1a. In one phase 2 and one phase 3 trial, alemtuzumab also reduced the risk of accumulating disability compared with interferon beta-1a. Indeed, alemtuzumab treatment led to an improvement in disability and a reduction in cerebral atrophy. The safety issues are infusion-associated reactions largely controlled by methylprednisolone, antihistamines, and antipyretics; mild-to-moderate infections (with 3 opportunistic infections from the open-label experience: 1 case each of spirochaetal gingivitis, pyogenic granuloma, and Listeria meningitis); and autoimmunity. Usually autoimmunity is directed against the thyroid gland, but causes (1 %) immune thrombocytopenia, and in a few cases antiglomerular basement membrane syndrome. Alemtuzumab is an effective therapy for early relapsing-remitting MS, offering disability improvement at least to 5 years after treatment. Its use requires careful monitoring so that potentially serious side effects can be treated early and effectively.","['Coles, Alasdair J']",['Coles AJ'],"[""Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, CB2 0QQ, UK.

Food, water, and treatment in the home, yard, and school are all potential sources of children's exposure. Exposures to pesticides may be overt or subacute, and effects range from acute to chronic toxicity. In 2008, pesticides were the ninth most common substance reported to poison control centers, and approximately 45% of all reports of pesticide poisoning were for children. Organophosphate and carbamate poisoning are perhaps the most widely known acute poisoning syndromes, can be diagnosed by depressed red blood cell cholinesterase levels, and have available antidotal therapy. However, numerous other pesticides that may cause acute toxicity, such as pyrethroid and neonicotinoid insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and rodenticides, also have specific toxic effects; recognition of these effects may help identify acute exposures. Evidence is increasingly emerging about chronic health implications from both acute and chronic exposure. A growing body of epidemiological evidence demonstrates associations between parental use of pesticides, particularly insecticides, with acute lymphocytic leukemia and brain tumors. Prenatal, household, and occupational exposures (maternal and paternal) appear to be the largest risks. Prospective cohort studies link early-life exposure to organophosphates and organochlorine pesticides (primarily DDT) with adverse effects on neurodevelopment and behavior. Among the findings associated with increased pesticide levels are poorer mental development by using the Bayley index and increased scores on measures assessing pervasive developmental disorder, inattention, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Related animal toxicology studies provide supportive biological plausibility for these findings. Additional data suggest that there may also be an association between parental pesticide use and adverse birth outcomes including physical birth defects, low birth weight, and fetal death, although the data are less robust than for cancer and neurodevelopmental effects. Children's exposures to pesticides should be limited as much as possible.","['Roberts, James R', 'Karr, Catherine J']","['Roberts JR', 'Karr CJ']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Technical Report']",20121126,United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,PMC5813803,2012/11/28 06:00,2013/02/05 06:00,['2012/11/28 06:00'],"['2012/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['peds.2012-2758 [pii]', '10.1542/peds.2012-2758 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 2012 Dec;130(6):e1765-88. doi: 10.1542/peds.2012-2758.

Imatinib is highly bound to alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AGP) in the plasma. We determined the unbound plasma fraction of both imatinib and its main active metabolite (N-desmethyl-imatinib) in plasma from 44 patients. The objective was to quantify the inter-individual variability of the protein binding of imatinib in order to discuss the potential benefits and limits of TDM of free plasma concentrations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The quantification of unbound fraction of imatinib and N-desmethyl-imatinib was performed using plasma ultrafiltration coupled with LC-MS/MS measurement. 60 pre-dose plasma samples were obtained at steady state within TDM in 44 chronic myeloid leukemia patients. RESULTS: The mean unbound fractions of imatinib and N-desmethyl-imatinib were 2.94 and 5.10 %, respectively, with inter-individual variability (CV in %) of 57 % for imatinib and 71 % for the metabolite. For 11 patients, repeated blood sampling gave a mean intra-individual variability of 28 % for imatinib and 34 % for N-desmethyl-imatinib. No correlation was observed between these measured individual imatinib unbound fraction values and those obtained using an equation based on AGP levels previously proposed by Widmer et al. The mean N-desmethyl-imatinib/imatinib ratio was determined for both total (0.69) and unbound (1.10) concentrations, with inter-individual variabilities of 71 and 86 %, respectively. CONCLUSION: The large inter-individual variability for the unbound fraction of both imatinib and N-desmethyl-imatinib warrants further evaluation of the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship as a potential relevant marker of imatinib therapeutic outcomes.","['Gandia, Peggy', 'Arellano, Cecile', 'Lafont, Thierry', 'Huguet, Francoise', 'Malard, Laurence', 'Chatelut, Etienne']","['Gandia P', 'Arellano C', 'Lafont T', 'Huguet F', 'Malard L', 'Chatelut E']","['EA4553 Laboratoire de Pharmacocinetique, Institut Claudius-Regaud, Universite de Toulouse, 31052 Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121127,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,,2012/11/28 06:00,2013/03/30 06:00,['2012/11/28 06:00'],"['2012/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-012-2035-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2013 Feb;71(2):531-6. doi: 10.1007/s00280-012-2035-3.

We used gene expression profiling of human monocyte and DC subpopulations sorted directly from blood and skin to define the lineage relationships. We also compared these with monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs) and MUTZ3 Langerhans cells (LCs) to investigate their relevance as model skin DCs. Hierarchical clustering analysis showed that myeloid DCs clustered according to anatomical origin rather than putative lineage. Plasmacytoid DCs formed the most discrete cluster, but ex vivo myeloid cells formed separate clusters of cells both in blood and in skin. Separate and specific DC populations could be determined within skin, and the proportion of CD14(+) dermal DCs (DDCs) was reduced and CD1a(+) DDCs increased during culture, suggesting conversion to CD1a(+)-expressing cells in situ. This is consistent with origin of the CD1a(+) DDCs from a local precursor rather than directly from circulating blood DCs or monocyte precursors. Consistent with their use as model skin DCs, the in vitro-derived MDDC and MUTZ3 LC populations grouped within the skin DC cluster. MDDCs clustered most closely to CD14(+) DDCs; furthermore, common unique patterns of C-type lectin receptor expression were identified between these two cell types. MUTZ3 LCs, however, did not cluster closely with ex vivo-derived LCs. We identified differential expression of novel genes in monocyte and DC subsets including genes related to DC surface receptors (including C-type lectin receptors, TLRs, and galectins).","['Harman, Andrew N', 'Bye, Chris R', 'Nasr, Najla', 'Sandgren, Kerrie J', 'Kim, Min', 'Mercier, Sarah K', 'Botting, Rachel A', 'Lewin, Sharon R', 'Cunningham, Anthony L', 'Cameron, Paul U']","['Harman AN', 'Bye CR', 'Nasr N', 'Sandgren KJ', 'Kim M', 'Mercier SK', 'Botting RA', 'Lewin SR', 'Cunningham AL', 'Cameron PU']","['Westmead Millennium Institute, Westmead, New South Wales 2145, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121126,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,,2012/11/28 06:00,2013/03/13 06:00,['2012/11/28 06:00'],"['2012/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1200779 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1200779 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2013 Jan 1;190(1):66-79. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1200779.

Abnormal marrow signal of magnetic resonance imaging of the spine was associated with a significant risk of progression (median 15 months, P=0.001).

A serum involved/uninvolved FLC ratio >/= 100 was used to define high-risk SMM, which included 15% (n=90) of the total cohort. Receiver operating characteristics analysis determined the optimal FLC ratio cut-point to predict progression to symptomatic multiple myeloma (MM) within 2 years of diagnosis, which resulted in a specificity of 97% and sensitivity of 16%. Fifty-six percent of patients developed progressive disease during median follow-up of 52 months, but this increased to 98% in the subgroup of patients with FLC ratio >/= 100. The median time to progression in the FLC ratio >/= 100 group was 15 months versus 55 months in the FLC <100 group (P<0.0001). The risk of progression to MM within the first 2 years in patients with an FLC ratio >/= 100 was 72%; the risk of progression to MM or light chain amyloidosis in 2 years was 79%.

PTEN nuclear exclusion has been associated with tumorigenesis. Nucleophosmin (NPM1) is frequently mutated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and displays Cy localization in mutated nucleophosmin (NPMc+) AML. Here we show that NPM1 directly interacts with herpes virus-associated ubiquitin specific protease (HAUSP), which is known as a PTEN deubiquitinating enzyme. Strikingly, PTEN is aberrantly localized in AML carrying NPMc+. Mechanistically, NPM1 in the nucleus opposes HAUSP-mediated deubiquitination and this promotes the shuttle of PTEN to the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, NPMc+ prevents HAUSP from deubiquitinating PTEN, causing the latter to stay in the cytoplasm where it is polyubiquitinated and degraded. Our findings delineate a new NPM1-HAUSP molecular interaction controlling PTEN deubiquitination and trafficking.","['Noguera, N I', 'Song, M S', 'Divona, M', 'Catalano, G', 'Calvo, K L', 'Garcia, F', 'Ottone, T', 'Florenzano, F', 'Faraoni, I', 'Battistini, L', 'Colombo, E', 'Amadori, S', 'Pandolfi, P P', 'Lo-Coco, F']","['Noguera NI', 'Song MS', 'Divona M', 'Catalano G', 'Calvo KL', 'Garcia F', 'Ottone T', 'Florenzano F', 'Faraoni I', 'Battistini L', 'Colombo E', 'Amadori S', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Lo-Coco F']","['Neuro-Oncoematology Unit, Santa Lucia Foundation, Rome, Italy. n.noguera@hsantalucia.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121107,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2012/11/28 06:00,2013/07/20 06:00,['2012/11/28 06:00'],"['2012/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012314 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.314 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Apr;27(5):1037-43. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.314.

Conditional survival takes into account the changing probability of survival with time survived, but this is not known for aHCT populations. We determined disease- and cause-specific conditional survival for 2388 patients treated with aHCT over a period of 20 years at a single institution. A total of 1054 deaths (44% of the cohort) were observed: 78% attributed to recurrent disease; 9% to subsequent malignancies and 6% to cardiopulmonary disease. Estimated probability of relative survival was 62% at 5 years and 50% at 10 years from aHCT. On the other hand, the 5-year relative survival was 70, 75, 81 and 88% after having survived 1, 2, 5 and 10 years after aHCT, respectively. The cohort was at a 13.9-fold increased risk of death compared with the general population (95% confidence interval (CI)=13.1-14.8). The risk of death approached that of the general population for 10-year survivors (standardized mortality ratio (SMR)=1.4, 95% CI=0.9-1.9), with the exception of female Hodgkin's lymphoma patients transplanted before 1995 at age </=40 years (SMR=6.0, 95% CI=1.9-14.0).

One of the cornerstones for diagnosing T-PLL includes cytogenetic studies. Most cases of T-PLL will harbor characteristic chromosomal abnormalities involving 14q11. 2 (TCR alpha/delta), 14q32 (TCL1 gene) or Xq28 (MTCP-1 gene), abnormalities of chromosome 8, 12p, and deletions of the long arm of chromosomes 5, 6, 11, and 13. In searching for new T-PLL target genes, recent studies have used techniques such as comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), 50k single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays with gene expression analysis. More recently, SNP arrays with higher resolution analysis have frequently provided more precise information about submicroscopic gene and genomic lesions as well as breakpoints involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. Herein, we summarize a review of the current literature of cytogenetic findings in T-PLL emphasizing those that may relate to the underlying mechanisms of leukemogenesis in T-PLL. Additionally, we stress the importance of karyotype characterization to accurately diagnose this disease because it usually carries a dismal prognosis that requires aggressive treatment strategies as it is poorly responsive to conventional chemotherapy used for other mature T-cell malignancies.","['Delgado, Paul', 'Starshak, Phillip', 'Rao, Nagesh', 'Tirado, Carlos A']","['Delgado P', 'Starshak P', 'Rao N', 'Tirado CA']","['Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90095.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Assoc Genet Technol,Journal of the Association of Genetic Technologists,9807282,,2012/11/28 06:00,2012/11/28 06:01,['2012/11/28 06:00'],"['2012/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/28 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Assoc Genet Technol. 2012;38(4):193-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two polymorphisms, C677T and A1298C, were described leading to reduced enzyme activity. Methotrexate (MTX) is an antifolate agent of consolidation and maintenance therapy of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Despite its clinical success, MTX can be associated with serious toxicities resulting in treatment interruption or discontinuation, impacting disease outcome. There is evidence that MTX toxicity can be affected by polymorphisms in genes encoding for drug-metabolizing enzymes such as MTHFR. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the influence of MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms on the frequency of MTX-related toxicity, disease outcome and patients' survival. MTHFR polymorphisms were assessed in 50 adult patients with de novo ALL using real-time PCR. Patients were followed-up for the development of haematologic and/or nonhaematologic toxicity and assessment of clinical outcome. Frequency of C677T polymorphisms was 42% for TT, 24% for CT and 34% for CC; A1298C polymorphisms were 28, 6 and 66% for CC, AC and AA, respectively. MTX therapy was significantly associated with neutropaenia, hepatic and gastrointestinal toxicities, unfavourable response at day 14 of induction therapy, increased relapse and mortality rates and shorter survival in patients with 677 TT genotype than in those with CC and CT, whereas 1298 CC genotype patients had lower frequency of neutropaenia, hepatic toxicity and relapse than in those with AA and AC. Our study suggests MTHFR polymorphism as an attractive predictor of MTX-related toxicity in adult ALL, considering it a potential prognostic factor influencing disease outcome.","['Eissa, Deena Samir', 'Ahmed, Tamer Mohamed']","['Eissa DS', 'Ahmed TM']","['Clinical Pathology Department, Haematology Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt. dr.deena_samir@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis,Blood coagulation & fibrinolysis : an international journal in haemostasis and thrombosis,9102551,,2012/11/28 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2012/11/28 06:00'],"['2012/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MBC.0b013e32835b249d [doi]'],ppublish,Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis. 2013 Mar;24(2):181-8. doi: 10.1097/MBC.0b013e32835b249d.,"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics', 'Prospective Studies', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,,,,,,['Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis. 2013 Oct;24(7):784-6.

A key step before applying these guidelines to pediatric oncology is to evaluate how much families and clinicians value these standards. We aimed to determine which elements of palliative care are considered important according to bereaved parents and pediatric oncology clinicians and to determine accessibility of these elements. METHODS: We administered questionnaires to 75 bereaved parents (response rate, 54%) and 48 pediatric oncology clinicians (response rate, 91%) at a large teaching hospital. Outcome measures included importance ratings and accessibility of core elements of palliative care delivery. RESULTS: Fifteen of 20 core elements were highly valued by both parents and clinicians (defined as > 60% of parents and clinicians reporting the item as important). Compared with clinicians, parents gave higher ratings to receiving cancer-directed therapy during the last month of life (P < .01) and involvement of a spiritual mentor (P = .03). Of the valued elements, only three were accessible more than 60% of the time according to clinicians and parents. Valued elements least likely to be accessible included a direct admission policy to hospital, sibling support, and parent preparation for medical aspects surrounding death. CONCLUSION: Parents and clinicians highly value a majority of palliative care elements described in the NCP framework. Children with advanced cancer may not be receiving key elements of palliative care despite parents and clinicians recognizing them as important. Evaluation of barriers to provision of quality palliative care and strategies for overcoming them are critical.","['Kassam, Alisha', 'Skiadaresis, Julia', 'Habib, Sharifa', 'Alexander, Sarah', 'Wolfe, Joanne']","['Kassam A', 'Skiadaresis J', 'Habib S', 'Alexander S', 'Wolfe J']","['Hospital for Sick Children, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121126,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,2012/11/28 06:00,2013/04/13 06:00,['2012/11/28 06:00'],"['2012/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/13 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2012.44.8936 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2012.44.8936 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2013 Mar 1;31(7):910-5. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2012.44.8936.

Our aim was to determine if failure-free survival was superior in patients treated with the Stanford V regimen compared with ABVD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, along with the Cancer and Leukemia Group B, the Southwest Oncology Group, and the Canadian NCIC Clinical Trials Group, conducted this randomized phase III trial in patients with advanced Hodgkin lymphoma. Stratification factors included extent of disease (localized v extensive) and International Prognostic Factors Project Score (0 to 2 v 3 to 7). The primary end point was failure-free survival (FFS), defined as the time from random assignment to progression, relapse, or death, whichever occurred first. Overall survival, a secondary end point, was measured from random assignment to death as a result of any cause. This design provided 87% power to detect a 33% reduction in FFS hazard rate, or a difference in 5-year FFS of 64% versus 74% at two-sided .05 significance level. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the overall response rate between the two arms, with complete remission and clinical complete remission rates of 73% for ABVD and 69% for Stanford V. At a median follow-up of 6.4 years, there was no difference in FFS: 74% for ABVD and 71% for Stanford V at 5 years (P = .32). CONCLUSION: ABVD remains the standard of care for patients with advanced Hodgkin lymphoma.","['Gordon, Leo I', 'Hong, Fangxin', 'Fisher, Richard I', 'Bartlett, Nancy L', 'Connors, Joseph M', 'Gascoyne, Randy D', 'Wagner, Henry', 'Stiff, Patrick J', 'Cheson, Bruce D', 'Gospodarowicz, Mary', 'Advani, Ranjana', 'Kahl, Brad S', 'Friedberg, Jonathan W', 'Blum, Kristie A', 'Habermann, Thomas M', 'Tuscano, Joseph M', 'Hoppe, Richard T', 'Horning, Sandra J']","['Gordon LI', 'Hong F', 'Fisher RI', 'Bartlett NL', 'Connors JM', 'Gascoyne RD', 'Wagner H', 'Stiff PJ', 'Cheson BD', 'Gospodarowicz M', 'Advani R', 'Kahl BS', 'Friedberg JW', 'Blum KA', 'Habermann TM', 'Tuscano JM', 'Hoppe RT', 'Horning SJ']","['Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and Robert H.

Surprisingly, ER stress was identified as an effect rather than a cause of UA-induced autophagy. Autophagy-dependent ER stress protected the cells from UA-induced apoptosis through EIF2AK3-mediated upregulation of MCL1. Activation of MAPK1/3 but not inhibition of MTOR pathway contributed to UA-induced cytoprotective autophagy in MCF-7 cells.

Plaque formation is initiated by recruitment of monocytes and T-cells into the intima, mediated by adhesion molecules and chemokines expressed by activated endothelial cells. AIM: To assess markers of inflammatory activity, endothelial activation as well as monocyte heterogeneity in adult survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who had been treated with chemotherapy without cranial irradiation. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 27 (age: 18-28 years) healthy survivors of childhood ALL and 20 controls (age: 20-31 years). Flow cytometry was used to identify monocyte subsets: classical CD14(++)CD16(-), intermediate CD14(++)CD16(+) and nonclassical CD14(+)CD16(++) monocytes which were further characterized by their expression of HLA-DR and beta2-integrins CD11b/CD18 and CD11c/CD18. In ALL survivors we found increased levels of pentraxin-3 (median [interquartile range]: 0.63 [0.36-0.94] vs. 0.40 [0.32-0.57] ng/ml; p = 0.03), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (687 [597-761] vs. 558 [534-702]ng/ml; p = 0.02), osteoprotegerin (mean +/- SD: 5.24 +/- 1.00 vs. 4.42 +/- 1.34 pmol/l; p = 0.02) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (107.0 +/- 23.6 vs. 89.5 +/- 18.9 pg/ml; p = 0.01), whereas C-reactive protein, interleukin 6 and 18, TNF-alpha, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 were unchanged. Former ALL patients exhibited elevated counts of intermediate monocytes (6.3 +/- 4.0 vs. 4.3 +/- 1.5% of blood monocytes; p = 0.03). CD11b/CD18 and CD11c/CD18 expression on intermediate monocytes tended to be higher in ALL survivors (1917 +/- 993 vs. 1396 +/- 673 MFI [median fluorescence intensity]; p = 0.06 and 3883 +/- 1445 vs. 3185 +/- 645 MFI; p = 0.05, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest chronic inflammatory activation and immune dysregulation in adult survivors of childhood ALL, which can translate into late cardiovascular morbidity.","['Sulicka, Joanna', 'Surdacki, Andrzej', 'Mikolajczyk, Tomasz', 'Strach, Magdalena', 'Gryglewska, Barbara', 'Cwiklinska, Magdalena', 'Balwierz, Walentyna', 'Guzik, Tomasz', 'Grodzicki, Tomasz K']","['Sulicka J', 'Surdacki A', 'Mikolajczyk T', 'Strach M', 'Gryglewska B', 'Cwiklinska M', 'Balwierz W', 'Guzik T', 'Grodzicki TK']","['Department of Internal Medicine and Gerontology, Jagiellonian University/University Hospital, Cracow, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121004,Netherlands,Immunobiology,Immunobiology,8002742,,2012/11/28 06:00,2013/09/06 06:00,['2012/11/28 06:00'],"['2012/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/24 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0171-2985(12)00500-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.imbio.2012.09.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunobiology. 2013 May;218(5):810-6. doi: 10.1016/j.imbio.2012.09.003.

To investigate therapeutic and preventive effects of passive immunization with allergen-specific IgG antibodies on allergy in mouse models we used clinically relevant pollen allergens. In a treatment model, mice were sensitized to the major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1 and to the major grass pollen allergens, Phl p 1 and Phl p 5 and then received passive immunization with rabbit IgG antibodies specific for the sensitizing or an unrelated allergen. In a prevention model, mice obtained passive immunization with allergen-specific rabbit IgG before sensitization. Kinetics of the levels of administered IgG antibodies, effects of administered allergen-specific IgG on allergen-specific IgE reactivity, the development of IgE and IgG responses and on immediate allergic reactions were studied by ELISA, rat basophil leukaemia degranulation assays and skin testing, respectively. Treated mice showed an approximately 80% reduction of allergen-specific IgE binding and basophil degranulation which was associated with the levels of administered allergen-specific IgG antibodies. Preventive administration of allergen-specific IgG antibodies suppressed the development of allergen-specific IgE and IgG1 antibody responses as well as allergen-induced basophil degranulation and skin reactivity. Our results show that passive immunization with allergen-specific IgG antibodies is effective for treatment and prevention of allergy to clinically important pollen allergens in a mouse model and thus may pave the road for the clinical application of allergen-specific antibodies in humans.","['Flicker, Sabine', 'Linhart, Birgit', 'Wild, Carmen', 'Wiedermann, Ursula', 'Valenta, Rudolf']","['Flicker S', 'Linhart B', 'Wild C', 'Wiedermann U', 'Valenta R']","['Division of Immunopathology, Department of Pathophysiology and Allergy Research, Center for Pathophysiology, Infectiology and Immunology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.

It has been described to play a role in diverse functions of hematopoietic cells such as phagocytosis of macrophages as well as polarization and cytotoxicity of T cells. However, the specific role of FMNL1 in these processes has not been clarified yet and regulation by interaction partners in primary hematopoietic cells has never been investigated. We performed a proteomic screen for investigation of the interactome of FMNL1 in primary hematopoietic cells resulting in the identification of a number of interaction partners. Bioinformatic analysis considering semantic similarity suggested the giant protein AHNAK1 to be an essential interaction partner of FMNL1. We confirmed AHNAK1 as a general binding partner for FMNL1 in diverse hematopoietic cells and demonstrate that the N-terminal part of FMNL1 binds to the C-terminus of AHNAK1. Moreover, we show that the constitutively activated form of FMNL1 (FMNL1gamma) induces localization of AHNAK1 to the cell membrane. Finally, we provide evidence that overexpression or knock down of FMNL1 has an impact on the capacitative calcium influx after ionomycin-mediated activation of diverse cell lines and primary cells.","['Han, Yanan', 'Yu, Guangchuang', 'Sarioglu, Hakan', 'Caballero-Martinez, Amelia', 'Schlott, Fabian', 'Ueffing, Marius', 'Haase, Hannelore', 'Peschel, Christian', 'Krackhardt, Angela M']","['Han Y', 'Yu G', 'Sarioglu H', 'Caballero-Martinez A', 'Schlott F', 'Ueffing M', 'Haase H', 'Peschel C', 'Krackhardt AM']","['Medizinische Klinik III, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121124,Netherlands,J Proteomics,Journal of proteomics,101475056,,2012/11/28 06:00,2013/07/05 06:00,['2012/11/28 06:00'],"['2012/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S1874-3919(12)00756-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jprot.2012.11.015 [doi]']",ppublish,J Proteomics. 2013 Jan 14;78:72-82. doi: 10.1016/j.jprot.2012.11.015.

Since this association was hotly debated at that time, I suggested at the Meeting that it was wrong and most likely due to the identification of the wrong virus culprit. Today, 20 months after the Meeting, the first part of our prediction has turned out to be correct, as Xenotropic Murine Related Virus was shown to be a laboratory-created artefact. Still, the potential association of fatigue-syndromes with an infection (most likely viral) is sustained by a plethora of evidence and this overview will initially summarize data suggesting prior viral infection(s). The principal hypothesized mechanisms for both peripheral and central Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Cancer Related Fatigue will be then summarized, also indicating plausible associations and triggering factors. All evidence accrued so far suggests that further research work should be performed in this interesting area and in order to identify an infectious agent for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Cancer Related Fatigue.

METHODS: Clinical information for the variables of interest was available for 252 out of 292 cases of childhood (0-14 years) ALL, newly diagnosed across Greece over a 4.5 year period as well as for 294 hospital controls. Allergen-specific-IgEs, as markers of allergic predisposition, against 24 most prevalent respiratory and food allergens, were determined, using an enzyme immunoassay procedure for 199 children with ALL and 113 controls. Cases were compared with controls through frequency distributions and unconditional multiple logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence-intervals (CIs) regarding associations of allergy with childhood ALL. RESULTS: Self-reported-allergic history overall (OR: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.34-0.72) and practically each one of its main components (respiratory, food, any other clinical allergy) were strongly and inversely associated with ALL.

As cell cycle deregulation and tumor growth are intimately linked, the discovery of new substances targeting events in this biochemical pathway would be of great value. The anti-leukemic effect of an ethanolic extract of Pterodon pubescens seeds (EEPp) has been previously demonstrated and now we show that a terpenic subfraction (SF5) of EEPp containing farnesol, geranylgeraniol and vouacapan derivatives induces apoptosis in the human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562. This work addresses SF5's antiproliferative mechanisms in these cells since they are still unclear. METHODS: DNA synthesis in K562 cells was assessed by [3H]-methyl-thymidine incorporation and cell cycle status by flow cytometry. The expression of cyclins D1 and E2, of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 and of the proto-oncogene c-myc was evaluated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Extracellular-signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2 and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation was evaluated by western blotting. RESULTS: In K562 cells, SF5 treatment induced a higher inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell growth than the original EEPp hexanic fraction from which SF5 originated, and also arrested the cell cycle in G1. Exposure of these cells to SF5 led to a decrease in cyclin E2 and c-myc expression while p21 mRNA levels were increased. Furthermore, SF5 inhibited the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) ERK 1/2 and NF-kappaB. CONCLUSIONS: This work suggests that the anti-leukemic action of SF5 is linked to the inhibition of ERKs, NF-kappaB and c-myc signaling pathways resulting in reduced cyclin E2 mRNA expression and cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase.","['Pereira, Monica Farah', 'Martino, Thiago', 'Dalmau, Sergio Ranto', 'Paes, Marcia Cristina', 'Barja-Fidalgo, Christina', 'Albano, Rodolpho Mattos', 'Coelho, Marsen Garcia Pinto', 'Sabino, Katia Costa de Carvalho']","['Pereira MF', 'Martino T', 'Dalmau SR', 'Paes MC', 'Barja-Fidalgo C', 'Albano RM', 'Coelho MG', 'Sabino KC']","['Departamento de Bioquimica, Instituto de Biologia Roberto Alcantara Gomes, Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Av, 28 de Setembro 87, fds, PAPC, Vila Isabel, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, CEP 20551-030, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121127,England,BMC Complement Altern Med,BMC complementary and alternative medicine,101088661,PMC3538048,2012/11/28 06:00,2013/05/29 06:00,['2012/11/28 06:00'],"['2012/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1472-6882-12-231 [pii]', '10.1186/1472-6882-12-231 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Complement Altern Med. 2012 Nov 27;12:231. doi: 10.1186/1472-6882-12-231.,"['0 (CCNE2 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",IM,,"['Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cyclins/genetics/metabolism', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Fabaceae/*chemistry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently no effective treatment exists, thus providing a need for identification of novel therapeutics. Lipidomic studies revealed a dysregulated sphingolipid metabolism as evidenced by decreased levels of overall ceramide species and increased levels of cerebrosides in leukemic NK cells, concomitant with increased glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) expression. GCS, a key enzyme of this pathway, neutralizes pro-apoptotic ceramide by transfer of a uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose. Thus, we treated both rat and human leukemic NK cells in combination with: (1) exogenous C6-ceramide nanoliposomes in order to target mitochondria and increase physiological pro-apoptotic levels of long chain ceramide, and (2) 1-phenyl-2-palmitoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PPMP), an inhibitor of GCS. Co-administration of C6-ceramide nanoliposomes and PPMP elicited an increase in endogenous long-chain ceramide species, which led to cellular apoptosis in a synergistic manner via the mitochondrial intrinsic cell death pathway in leukemic NK cells.","['Watters, Rebecca J', 'Fox, Todd E', 'Tan, Su-Fern', 'Shanmugavelandy, Sriram', 'Choby, Jacob E', 'Broeg, Kathleen', 'Liao, Jason', 'Kester, Mark', 'Cabot, Myles C', 'Loughran, Thomas P', 'Liu, Xin']","['Watters RJ', 'Fox TE', 'Tan SF', 'Shanmugavelandy S', 'Choby JE', 'Broeg K', 'Liao J', 'Kester M', 'Cabot MC', 'Loughran TP', 'Liu X']","['Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, Pennsylvania State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA 17033-0850, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121231,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,PMC4296321,2012/11/28 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2012/11/28 06:00'],"['2012/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2012.752485 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2013 Jun;54(6):1288-96. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2012.752485.

The tyrosine kinase KIT has been shown to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of SM and has been a focal point in the development of targeted therapy. Mutations within various domains of the KIT receptor that lead to constitutive activation have been identified in patients, and those involving the activation loop of the KIT receptor are the mutations most frequently detected in patients with mastocytosis. Aberrant activation of the KIT receptor results in increased production of mast cells in extracutaneous organs that may lead to organ failure or early death. This review discusses the diagnosis and management of patients with advanced SM, including the relevance of KIT in this disease, potential therapies targeting this kinase, and criteria for measuring responses to these therapies.","['Verstovsek, Srdan']",['Verstovsek S'],"['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. sverstov@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,PMC3761194,2012/11/28 06:00,2013/03/12 06:00,['2012/11/28 06:00'],"['2012/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12043 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2013 Feb;90(2):89-98. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12043.,['EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)'],IM,,"['Drug Delivery Systems', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/*diagnosis/enzymology/*genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Mast Cells/enzymology/pathology', '*Mutation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics/metabolism']",,,,['(c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER*Stat) database to compare survival rates in CML among Caucasians, African-Americans (AA), and other races, and also within each race to see survival differences from the pre-imatinib (1973-2000) to post-imatinib eras (2002-2008). We used Z-tests in SEER*Stat to compare relative survival rates categorized by race, gender, and age groups (all ages, < 50, 50+ years). RESULTS: The three-year relative survival rates among Caucasians, AA, and other races in the pre-imatinib era were 44.9 +/- 0.6%, 46.8 +/- 1.8%, and 48.0 +/- 2.2%, respectively, and in the post-imatinib era 64.4 +/- 0.8%, 67.3 +/- 2.4%, and 69.6 +/- 1.6%, respectively. The relative survival increased from the pre-to post-imatinib era for all ethnic groups. In the post-imatinib era, three-year relative survival rates among young AA women were significantly lower (Z-value = -2.54, p = 0.011) than young Caucasian women, 80.5 +/- 4.5% (n = 105) vs. 90.3 +/- 1.4% (n = 589). CONCLUSIONS: The relative survival rates of CML patients have improved in the post-imatinib era. However, the improvement in survival rates has been modest in this population-based data compared to those reported from randomized trials. Improvement in survival among older patients is lower than in younger patients. Young (<50 years) AA women with CML had lower relative survival rates compared to young Caucasian women in the post-imatinib era.","['Mandal, Rakesh', 'Bolt, Daniel M', 'Shah, Binay K']","['Mandal R', 'Bolt DM', 'Shah BK']","['Waisman Center, University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121126,England,Acta Oncol,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",8709065,,2012/11/28 06:00,2013/11/01 06:00,['2012/11/28 06:00'],"['2012/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/0284186X.2012.707784 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Oncol. 2013 May;52(4):837-41. doi: 10.3109/0284186X.2012.707784.

In the present study, mRNA expression levels of typical human ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in these human blood cancer cell lines were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Based on the results, the expression level of multidrug resistance-associated protein 4 (MRP4) was found to be extremely high in KU812 cells compared with those of other transporters. Additionally, MRP4 expression levels were found to be relatively high in U937, KG-1 and a blood cell line derived from a healthy subject (RPMI 1788). In addition, to elucidate the contribution of MRP4 to the methotrexate (MTX) distribution in normal blood cells and tissues, [(3)H]MTX was intravenously (i.v.) administered to two groups of rats. Animals in one group received [(3)H]MTX only; the other group was concomitantly administered i.v. MK-571, a typical inhibitor of MRP transporters.

Although the detection of Notch1 protein in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells using immunoblot analysis has been previously reported, the expression patterns of Notch1 and Jagged1 detected by flow cytometry (FCM) in normal blood cells and various leukemia cells have not been well-characterised. In the present study, we examined the expression patterns of Notch1 and Jagged1 in 10 normal blood samples, 8 bone marrow samples, 11 leukemia/lymphoma cell lines and leukemia cells from 22 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), mature T-cell neoplasms or B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) using FCM. The results showed that Notch1 expression is relatively strong in monocytes and granulocytes but weak in lymphocytes. The expression of Notch1 is stronger in bone marrow cells than in the equivalent cells in blood. All the cell lines examined strongly expressed Notch1, and eight cell lines expressed Jagged1. In leukemia cells from patients, four AML samples expressed Notch1 and/or Jagged1. However, three samples expressed neither Notch1 and/or Jagged1 and none of the mature T-cell neoplasm samples expressed either protein.

We previously showed that the recombinant A254-GMCSF fusion protein selectively kills acute myeloblastic leukemia cells which harbor a large number of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GMCSF) receptors. Since further in vitro and preclinical studies require large amounts of this fusion protein free from any troublesome material like lipopolysacharide, we selected the insect cell expression system. Thus, the coding sequences of the A254-GMCSF and its truncated form, A247-GMCSF, were cloned and expressed by Sf9 cells. Subsequently, specific cytotoxicity of the purified proteins was evaluated on GMCSF receptor positive cell lines. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of the expressed A254GMCSF and A247GMCSF fragments revealed bands of about 60 kD which were larger than the theoretically predicted size of about 47 kD. Deglycosylation analysis showed that these proteins are N-glycosylated by the insect cells. However, any other post-translation modification of the proteins by insect cells could be the reason for higher molecular weight of the fragments. Cytotoxicity assays showed specific killing activity of these proteins on HL60 and U937 cell lines with IC(50)s ranging 2-2.5 mug/ml. These IC(50) values are much higher than those obtained from bacterially expressed A254-GMCSF (80 ng/ml) which could be due to any modification performed by insect cells on the fusion proteins.","['Jahanian-Najafabadi, A', 'Bouzari, S', 'Oloomi, M', 'Roudkenar, M Habibi', 'Shokrgozar, M A']","['Jahanian-Najafabadi A', 'Bouzari S', 'Oloomi M', 'Roudkenar MH', 'Shokrgozar MA']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Pasteur Institute of Iran, Tehran, I.R.Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Res Pharm Sci,Research in pharmaceutical sciences,101516968,PMC3501922,2012/11/28 06:00,2012/11/28 06:01,['2012/11/28 06:00'],"['2012/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/28 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Res Pharm Sci. 2012 Jul;7(3):133-40.,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor', 'Immunotoxin', 'Insect cell', 'Shiga toxin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Synthetic steroid hormones glucocorticoids (GCs) are widely used as part of the ALL treatment regimens due to their apoptotic function, but their use also brings about various side effects and drug resistance. The identification of the molecular differences between the GCs responsive and resistant cells therefore are essential to decipher such complexity and can be used to improve therapy. However, the emerging picture is complicated as the activities of genes and proteins involved are controlled by multiple factors. By adopting the systems biology framework to address this issue, we here integrated the available knowledge together with experimental data by building a series of mathematical models. This rationale enabled us to unravel molecular interactions involving c-Jun in GC induced apoptosis and identify Ets-related gene (Erg) as potential biomarker of GC resistance. The results revealed an alternative possible mechanism where c-Jun may be an indirect GR target that is controlled via an upstream repressor protein. The models also highlight the importance of Erg for GR function, particularly in GC sensitive C7 cells where Erg directly regulates GR in agreement with our previous experimental results. Our models describe potential GR-controlled molecular mechanisms of c-Jun/Bim and Erg regulation. We also demonstrate the importance of using a systematic approach to translate human disease processes into computational models in order to derive information-driven new hypotheses.","['Chen, Daphne Wei-Chen', 'Krstic-Demonacos, Marija', 'Schwartz, Jean-Marc']","['Chen DW', 'Krstic-Demonacos M', 'Schwartz JM']","['Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester Manchester, UK ; Faculty of Life Sciences, Manchester Institute of Biotechnology, University of Manchester Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121119,Switzerland,Front Physiol,Frontiers in physiology,101549006,PMC3500877,2012/11/28 06:00,2012/11/28 06:01,['2012/11/28 06:00'],"['2012/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphys.2012.00410 [doi]'],epublish,Front Physiol. 2012 Nov 19;3:410. doi: 10.3389/fphys.2012.00410. eCollection 2012.,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['dynamic model', 'gene expression', 'glucocorticoid receptor', 'kinetic simulation', 'systems biology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imatinib emerged as the first successful example of a TKI used for the treatment of chronic-phase CML patients and resulted in significant improvements in response rate and overall survival compared with previous treatments. However, a significant portion of patients failed to respond to the therapy and developed resistance against imatinib. Second-generation TKIs nilotinib and dasatinib were to have higher efficiency in clinical trials in imatinib- resistant or intolerant CML patients compared with imatinib. Identification of novel strategies such as dose escalation, drug combination therapy, and use of novel BCR-ABL inhibitors may eventually overcome resistance against BCR-ABL TKIs.

Sunitinib is an orally active inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinase receptors approved for renal cell carcinoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumour that has also been studied for AML in several clinical trials. However, the precise mechanism of sunitinib action against AML remains unclear and requires further investigation. For this purpose, this study was conducted using human AML cell lines (HL60 and KG-1) and AML patients' mononucleated cells. Sunitinib induced G1 phase arrest associated with decreased cyclin D1, cyclin D3, and cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)2 and increased p27(Kip1), pRb1, and p130/Rb2 expression and phosphorylated activation of protein kinase C alpha and beta (PKCalpha/beta). Selective PKCalpha/beta inhibitor treatment abolished sunitinib-elicited AML differentiation, suggesting that PKCalpha/beta may underlie sunitinib-induced monocytic differentiation. Furthermore, sunitinib increased pro-apoptotic molecule expression (Bax, Bak, PUMA, Fas, FasL, DR4, and DR5) and decreased anti-apoptotic molecule expression (Bcl-2 and Mcl-1), resulting in caspase-2, caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 activation and both death receptor and mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that sunitinib targets AML cells through both differentiation and apoptosis pathways. More clinical studies are urgently needed to demonstrate its optimal clinical applications in AML.","['Teng, Chieh-Lin Jerry', 'Yu, Chang-Tze Ricky', 'Hwang, Wen-Li', 'Tsai, Jia-Rong', 'Liu, Hsiang-Chun', 'Hwang, Guang-Yuh', 'Hsu, Shih-Lan']","['Teng CL', 'Yu CT', 'Hwang WL', 'Tsai JR', 'Liu HC', 'Hwang GY', 'Hsu SL']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121120,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,2012/11/28 06:00,2013/03/30 06:00,['2012/11/27 06:00'],"['2011/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-012-1627-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2013 Mar;92(3):301-13. doi: 10.1007/s00277-012-1627-7.

Acute leukemia is the most common etiology in pediatric practice. Hyperleukocytosis is a medical emergency. The increased blood viscosity, secondary to high white cell count and leukocyte aggregates, results in stasis in the smaller blood vessels. This predisposes to neurological, pulmonary or gastrointestinal complications. In addition, patients are at risk for tumor lysis syndrome due to the increased tumor burden. Initial management includes aggressive hydration, prevention of tumor lysis syndrome, and correction of metabolic abnormalities. A red cell transfusion is not indicated in a hemodynamically stable child, as it adversely affects the blood viscosity. Leukapheresis is the treatment of choice for a very high count, or in patients with symptomatic hyperleukocytosis. The technical expertise required, a relative difficult venous access in younger children, risk of anticoagulation and possible non-availability of the procedure in emergency hours are limitations of leukapheresis. However, it is a rewarding procedure and performed with relative ease in centers that perform the procedure frequently. An exchange transfusion is often a practical option when hyperleukocytosis is complicated with severe anemia. The partial exchange aids in correcting both, without the risk of volume overload or hyperviscosity, which are the limitations of hydration and blood transfusion, respectively. Etiology and management of hyperleukocytosis in relevance to the pediatric emergency room is outlined.","['Jain, Richa', 'Bansal, Deepak', 'Marwaha, R K']","['Jain R', 'Bansal D', 'Marwaha RK']","['Hematology/Oncology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Advanced Pediatrics Center, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, 160012, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121124,India,Indian J Pediatr,Indian journal of pediatrics,0417442,,2012/11/28 06:00,2013/12/18 06:00,['2012/11/27 06:00'],"['2012/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12098-012-0917-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Indian J Pediatr. 2013 Feb;80(2):144-8. doi: 10.1007/s12098-012-0917-3.

Following cellular uptake, DAC is activated to DAC-triphosphate (TP) and incorporated into DNA. Once incorporated into the DNA, DAC-TP binds and inactivates DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), thereby leading to hypomethylation and re-expression of epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes and ultimately antileukemia activity. However, direct evidence of in vivo DAC-TP occurrence in DAC-treated patients has been difficult to demonstrate due to a lack of suitable validated analytical methodology. Thus, we developed and validated a nonradioactive sensitive and specific LC-MS/MS assay for quantification of DAC-TP. The assay is linear from 50 to 1,000 nM and from 1 to 10 muM and has a lower limit of quantitation of 50 nM and a coefficient of variation for both within- and between-day precision <20%. Following DAC treatment, we detected DAC-TP in parental and DAC-resistant AML cells (in vitro) and bone marrow (BM) and spleen of normal and leukemic mice (in vivo). Downregulation of DNMTs and correlation of DAC-TP concentration with proteins involved in mechanisms of DAC resistance were also demonstrated. The clinical applicability of this method was proven by measuring DAC-TP level in BM and blood mononuclear cells from DAC-treated AML patients. Higher levels are seemingly associated with clinical response. Monitoring the DAC-TP intracellular level may serve as a novel pharmacological endpoint for designing more effective DAC-based regimens.","['Wang, Hongyan', 'Chen, Ping', 'Wang, Jiang', 'Santhanam, Ramasamy', 'Aimiuwu, Josephine', 'Saradhi, U V Vijaya', 'Liu, Zhongfa', 'Schwind, Sebastian', 'Mims, Alice', 'Byrd, John C', 'Grever, Michael R', 'Villalona-Calero, Miguel A', 'Klisovic, Rebecca', 'Walker, Alison', 'Garzon, Ramiro', 'Blum, William', 'Chan, Kenneth K', 'Marcucci, Guido']","['Wang H', 'Chen P', 'Wang J', 'Santhanam R', 'Aimiuwu J', 'Saradhi UV', 'Liu Z', 'Schwind S', 'Mims A', 'Byrd JC', 'Grever MR', 'Villalona-Calero MA', 'Klisovic R', 'Walker A', 'Garzon R', 'Blum W', 'Chan KK', 'Marcucci G']","['Division of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20121122,United States,AAPS J,The AAPS journal,101223209,PMC3535094,2012/11/28 06:00,2013/08/03 06:00,['2012/11/27 06:00'],"['2012/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1208/s12248-012-9427-5 [doi]'],ppublish,AAPS J. 2013 Jan;15(1):242-9. doi: 10.1208/s12248-012-9427-5.

Transfer via excess relative risks (ERR) or excess absolute risks (EAR) or a mixture of both (i.e., from the life span study (LSS) of Japanese atomic bomb survivors) has been done in the past based on qualitative weighting. Consequently, the values of the weights applied and the method of application of the weights (i.e., as additive or geometric weighted means) have varied both between reports produced at different times by the same regulatory body and also between reports produced at similar times by different regulatory bodies. Since the gender and age patterns are often markedly different between EAR and ERR models, it is useful to have an evidence-based method for determining the relative goodness of fit of such models to the data. This paper identifies a method, using Akaike model weights, which could aid expert judgment and be applied to help to achieve consistency of approach and quantitative evidence-based results in future health risk assessments. The results of applying this method to recent LSS cancer incidence models are that the relative EAR weighting by cancer solid cancer site, on a scale of 0-1, is zero for breast and colon, 0.02 for all solid, 0.03 for lung, 0.08 for liver, 0.15 for thyroid, 0.18 for bladder and 0.93 for stomach. The EAR weighting for female breast cancer increases from 0 to 0.3, if a generally observed change in the trend between female age-specific breast cancer incidence rates and attained age, associated with menopause, is accounted for in the EAR model. Application of this method to preferred models from a study of multi-model inference from many models fitted to the LSS leukemia mortality data, results in an EAR weighting of 0. From these results it can be seen that lifetime risk transfer is most highly weighted by EAR only for stomach cancer. However, the generalization and interpretation of radiation effect estimates based on the LSS cancer data, when projected to other populations, are particularly uncertain if considerable differences exist between site-specific baseline rates in the LSS and the other populations of interest. Definitive conclusions, regarding the appropriate method for transporting cancer risks, are limited by a lack of knowledge in several areas including unknown factors and uncertainties in biological mechanisms and genetic and environmental risk factors for carcinogenesis; uncertainties in radiation dosimetry; and insufficient statistical power and/or incomplete follow-up in data from radio-epidemiological studies.","['Walsh, Linda', 'Schneider, Uwe']","['Walsh L', 'Schneider U']","['Federal Office for Radiation Protection, Department of Radiation Protection and Health, Ingolstadter Landstr. 1, 85764 Oberschleissheim, Germany. lwalsh@bfs.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121120,Germany,Radiat Environ Biophys,Radiation and environmental biophysics,0415677,,2012/11/28 06:00,2014/01/30 06:00,['2012/11/27 06:00'],"['2012/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00411-012-0441-x [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Environ Biophys. 2013 Mar;52(1):135-45. doi: 10.1007/s00411-012-0441-x.

Development of specific therapies targeted at CSCs holds hope for the improvement of survival and quality of life of cancer patients, especially for sufferers of metastatic disease. This is particularly true in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). METHODS: In this study, we isolated fetal liver kinase-1-positive (Flk1(+)) cells carrying the BCR/ABL fusion gene from the bone marrow of Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph(+)) patients with stem cells property. We examined their biological characteristics as well as immunological function and further detected the possible molecular mechanism involved in the leukemia genesis. RESULTS: We showed that CML patient-derived Flk1(+)CD31(-)CD34(-) MSCs had normal morphology, phenotype and karyotype but appeared impaired immunomodulatory function. The capacity of Flk1(+)CD31(-)CD34(-) MSCs from CML patients to inhibit T lymphocyte activation and proliferation was impaired in vitro. CML patient-derived MSCs have dampening immunomodulatory functions, suggesting that the dysregulation of hematopoiesis and immune response might originate from MSCs rather than HSCs. These Ph(+) putative CML hemangioblast upregulated TGF-beta1 and resultantly activated matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) to enhance s-KitL and s-ICAM-1 secretion, which activated c-kit(+) HSCs from the quiescent state to proliferative state. Further studies showed that phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt/nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB signaling pathway was involved in CML pathogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: Flk1(+)CD31(-)CD34(-) MSCs that express BCR/ABL leukemia oncogene are CSCs of CML and they play a critical role in the progression of CML through PI3K/Akt/NF-kappaB/MMP-9/s-ICAM-1/s-KitL signaling pathway beyond HSCs.","['Xishan, Zhu', 'Xinna, Zhou', 'Baoxin, He', 'Jun, Ren']","['Xishan Z', 'Xinna Z', 'Baoxin H', 'Jun R']","[""Department of Internal Oncology, Institute of Medical Oncology, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100038, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121121,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,,2012/11/28 06:00,2013/06/08 06:00,['2012/11/27 06:00'],"['2012/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-012-1367-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2013 Apr;62(4):689-703. doi: 10.1007/s00262-012-1367-5.

Often CLL is clinically occult and first detected during pathologic evaluation of the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). We reviewed our experience of patients with the coexisting diagnosis of melanoma and CLL. METHODS: An institutional review board-approved review was performed on patients with CLL and melanoma treated from 1995 to 2009 at Moffitt Cancer Center and compared with the incidence of melanoma and CLL in our tumor registry patients with breast, prostate, lung, and colon cancer. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients (44 males; median age, 71 years [range, 46-88]) were identified with concurrent diagnoses of melanoma and CLL. Twenty-two patients (42 %) had CLL on SLNB for their melanoma. Thirty-two patients (62 %) were diagnosed with melanoma before CLL. Concomitant or prior cancer diagnoses included nonmelanoma skin cancers (N = 29), prostate (N = 6), colorectal (N = 2), and Merkel cell carcinoma (N = 2). Five of 20 patients (25 %) had metastatic melanoma found at the time of SLNB. Patients with melanoma had a tenfold increase of CLL diagnosis compared with colorectal cancer patients, an eightfold increase compared to prostate cancer patients, and a fourfold increase compared with breast cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: We have confirmed an increased association of CLL and melanoma. This may be related to an underlying immunologic defect; however, there has been scant investigation into this phenomenon. Surgeons and pathologists should understand this occurrence and recognize that not all grossly enlarged or abnormal sentinel lymph nodes in melanoma patients represent melanoma.","['Farma, Jeffrey M', 'Zager, Jonathan S', 'Barnica-Elvir, Victor', 'Puleo, Christopher A', 'Marzban, Suroosh S', 'Rollison, Dana E', 'Messina, Jane L', 'Sondak, Vernon K']","['Farma JM', 'Zager JS', 'Barnica-Elvir V', 'Puleo CA', 'Marzban SS', 'Rollison DE', 'Messina JL', 'Sondak VK']","['Department of Surgical Oncology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, USA. jeffrey.farma@fccc.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121120,United States,Ann Surg Oncol,Annals of surgical oncology,9420840,PMC4606461,2012/11/28 06:00,2013/09/11 06:00,['2012/11/27 06:00'],"['2012/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1245/s10434-012-2740-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Surg Oncol. 2013 Apr;20(4):1360-4. doi: 10.1245/s10434-012-2740-5.

Various stimuli, including iron load and interleukin-6, are involved in the regulation of hepcidin expression. We previously reported that serum hepcidin levels were high in patients with end-stage renal disease, compared with healthy subjects. Since metabolic acidosis is commonly observed in these patients, we hypothesized that acidic milieu might augment hepcidin expression. In this study, we investigated the effect of changes in the pH of the microenvironment on hepcidin expression in human hepatoma and leukemia cell lines. We found that hepcidin expression in these cells was augmented by the acidic milieu created with lactic acid, hydrochloric acid and excess carbon dioxide. Acidic milieu did not clearly enhance hepcidin promoter activity, but rather stabilized hepcidin transcript in the hepatoma cells. We speculate that metabolic acidosis may contribute in part to the elevation of serum hepcidin levels in patients with end-stage chronic kidney disease. Further studies are needed to elucidate the association between acidosis and hepcidin expression in various clinical settings.","['Mizumoto, Chisaki', 'Kawabata, Hiroshi', 'Uchiyama, Tatsuki', 'Sakamoto, Soichiro', 'Kanda, Junya', 'Tomosugi, Naohisa', 'Takaori-Kondo, Akifumi']","['Mizumoto C', 'Kawabata H', 'Uchiyama T', 'Sakamoto S', 'Kanda J', 'Tomosugi N', 'Takaori-Kondo A']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 54 Shogoin, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121123,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,2012/11/28 06:00,2013/03/22 06:00,['2012/11/27 06:00'],"['2012/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/08 00:00 [revised]', '2012/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-012-1223-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2012 Dec;96(6):701-9. doi: 10.1007/s12185-012-1223-6.

We first considered second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the treatment of this patient, as they elicit a superior response compared with imatinib. We next selected nilotinib, rather than dasatinib, since the increased risk of bleeding associated with dasatinib represented a greater risk of fatality than aggravation of T2D with nilotinib. After improvement of hemorrhagic gastric ulcers and T2D with exogenous insulin therapy, we began nilotinib administration; insulin dose was increased to maintain her glucose levels whereas urine C-peptide level decreased. Conversely, when nilotinib was discontinued due to liver dysfunction, the dosage of injected insulin was decreased and urine C-peptide levels increased. After re-starting nilotinib, the required dose of insulin gradually increased again, and urine C-peptide level decreased, indicating that nilotinib may have impaired secretion of endogenous insulin. The patient obtained a complete cytogenetic response after 3 months of nilotinib treatment. Her T2D has since been well controlled by insulin therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first report that nilotinib treatment for patients with severe T2D may induce a reversible decrease in endogenous insulin secretion, although the precise underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We highly recommend sufficient screening and early intervention with exogenous insulin therapy for diabetic CML patients who receive nilotinib.","['Ito, Yoshikiyo', 'Miyamoto, Toshihiro', 'Chong, Yong', 'Maki, Toshinobu', 'Akashi, Koichi', 'Kamimura, Tomohiko']","['Ito Y', 'Miyamoto T', 'Chong Y', 'Maki T', 'Akashi K', 'Kamimura T']","['Department of Hematology, Harasanshin Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121123,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,2012/11/28 06:00,2013/11/20 06:00,['2012/11/27 06:00'],"['2012/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/06 00:00 [revised]', '2012/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-012-1222-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2013 Jan;97(1):135-8. doi: 10.1007/s12185-012-1222-7.

This case-control study investigates the association of childhood leukemia with food groups, macronutrient consumption, total energy intake and adherence to Mediterranean diet among children aged 5-14 years in Greece. METHODS: A total of 139 consecutive, incident leukemia cases out of which 121 were acute lymphoblastic leukemia were derived from the Nationwide Registry for Childhood Hematological Malignancies along with one : one age- and gender-matched hospital controls. Information on socio-demographic, maternal and child variables and dietary habits was obtained through in-person interviews with the guardians/children. Multiple logistic regression was performed with adjustment for birth weight and possible confounding variables. RESULTS: Higher consumption of added lipids was associated with an increased risk of childhood leukemia, whereas consumption of milk and dairy products with reduced risk. From the macronutrient analysis, a borderline trend linking high protein intake with reduced childhood leukemia risk was observed. CONCLUSION: Consumption of milk and dairy products in the first year of life may protect against childhood leukemia possibly through vitamin D actions, while added lipids may increase the risk through various mechanisms. These results offer a holistic evaluation of children's nutrition and suggest that dietary habits in the early years of life may contribute to the prevention of childhood leukemia.","['Diamantaras, Andreas-Antonios', 'Dessypris, Nick', 'Sergentanis, Theodoros N', 'Ntouvelis, Evangelos', 'Athanasiadou-Piperopoulou, Fani', 'Baka, Margarita', 'Fragandrea, Ioanna', 'Moschovi, Maria', 'Polychronopoulou, Sofia', 'Stiakaki, Eftichia', 'Panagiotakos, Demosthenes', 'Petridou, Eleni']","['Diamantaras AA', 'Dessypris N', 'Sergentanis TN', 'Ntouvelis E', 'Athanasiadou-Piperopoulou F', 'Baka M', 'Fragandrea I', 'Moschovi M', 'Polychronopoulou S', 'Stiakaki E', 'Panagiotakos D', 'Petridou E']","['Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, School of Medicine, University of Athens, 75 M.

RESULTS: Compared to controls (n = 62), CML patients (n = 62) taking a TKI (imatinib 55 %, nilotinib 31 %, and dasatinib 14 %) reported significantly worse fatigue severity (p < .001), fatigue interference (p < .001), depression (p = .007), symptom burden (p < .001), and physical QOL (p < .001).

Several potentially functional polymorphisms of the CYP3A4 gene have been implicated in cancer risk, but individually published studies have shown inconclusive results. The aim of this Human Genome Epidemiology (HuGE) review and meta-analysis was to investigate the association between CYP3A4*1B (rs2740574 A > G) polymorphism and cancer risk. Eleven studies were included with a total of 3,810 cancer patients and 3,173 healthy controls. We found that the G allele and GG genotype of CYP3A4*1B polymorphism were associated with increased risk of cancers using the fixed effects model (allele model: odds ratio (OR) = 1.24, 95 %CI: 1.09-1.42, P = 0.001; recessive model: OR = 1.77, 95 %CI: 1.30-2.41, P < 0.001; homozygous model: OR = 1.72, 95 %CI: 1.19-2.47, P = 0.004). Subgroup analyses by cancer type showed that the G allele and G carrier (AG + GG) of CYP3A4*1B polymorphism had significant associations with increased risk of prostate cancer, but not with breast cancer, leukemia, or other cancers. With further subgroup analysis based on different ethnicities, the results indicated that the GG genotype of CYP3A4*1B polymorphism might increase the risk of cancer among African populations. However, similar associations were not observed among Caucasian and Asian populations. Results from the current meta-analysis indicate that the G allele and GG genotype of CYP3A4*1B polymorphism might be associated with increased cancer risk, especially for prostate cancer among African populations.","['Zhou, Li-Ping', 'Yao, Fan', 'Luan, Hong', 'Wang, Yin-Ling', 'Dong, Xi-Hua', 'Zhou, Wen-Wen', 'Wang, Qi-Hui']","['Zhou LP', 'Yao F', 'Luan H', 'Wang YL', 'Dong XH', 'Zhou WW', 'Wang QH']","[""Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, 110001, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20121120,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,,2012/11/28 06:00,2013/05/08 06:00,['2012/11/27 06:00'],"['2012/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-012-0592-z [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2013 Apr;34(2):649-60. doi: 10.1007/s13277-012-0592-z.

The expression of APP and its prognostic significance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have not been studied. Our study shows that AML/ETO(+) leukemia patients that overexpress APP easily get EMI and that their long-term survival rate is lower than patients without overexpression of APP. In an in vitro study, we knocked down APP in Kasumi-1 cells using small interfering RNA (siRNA). Transwell data show that siRNA/APP substantially impairs cell migration, but it does not inhibit cell proliferation. Furthermore, by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, we found that siRNA/APP decreases MMP-2 expression in vitro. Our study provides a novel clue that APP is involved in the extramedullary infiltration of leukemia by MMP-2.","['Jiang, Ling', 'Yu, Guopan', 'Meng, Wei', 'Wang, Zhixiang', 'Meng, Fanyi', 'Ma, Wenli']","['Jiang L', 'Yu G', 'Meng W', 'Wang Z', 'Meng F', 'Ma W']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121123,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,,2012/11/28 06:00,2013/05/08 06:00,['2012/11/27 06:00'],"['2012/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-012-0589-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2013 Apr;34(2):629-36. doi: 10.1007/s13277-012-0589-7.

CD200, as an immunosuppressive molecule, is overexpressed in some hematological malignancies and it has also been shown to be an independent prognostic factor in AML. In the current study, simultaneous CD200 expression and Foxp3(+) regulatory T cell levels were investigated in Iranian patients with AML by flow cytometry. We also assessed the effect of CD200-CD200R blockade on Th1 and T-reg cytokine production and T cell proliferation in autologous AML- and monocyte-DC mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLRs). ELISA assay was performed to detect IL-2, IL-12, IFN-gamma, IL-10, and TGF-beta production in MLR supernatants. Expression of Foxp3, IL-10, and TGF-beta mRNAs in MLRs were detected by real-time PCR. Our results demonstrated significant overexpression of CD200 (P = 0.001) in association with higher frequencies of Foxp3(+) T cells in AML patients (r = 0.8, P < 0.001). Blocking of CD200-CD200R interaction demonstrated a significant decrease in TGF-beta and IL-10 expression in AML-DC MLRs and a significant increase in IL-12 and IFN-gamma expression in monocyte-DC MLRs. Elevated T cell levels with lower Foxp3 intensity was also shown in CD200-CD200R-blocked MLRs. Expression of IL-10 mRNA declined significantly only in AML-DC MLRs where CD200-CD200R interaction was blocked and the same result was observed for TGF-beta and Foxp3 mRNA in both AML- and monocyte-DC MLRs. These data present a significant role for CD200 in suppressing anti-tumor immune response through stimulation of regulatory mechanisms in AML patients and suggest that CD200 may have a prognostic value in this malignancy and its blockade may be used as a target for AML immunotherapy.","['Memarian, Ali', 'Nourizadeh, Maryam', 'Masoumi, Farimah', 'Tabrizi, Mina', 'Emami, Amir Hossein', 'Alimoghaddam, Kamran', 'Hadjati, Jamshid', 'Mirahmadian, Mahroo', 'Jeddi-Tehrani, Mahmood']","['Memarian A', 'Nourizadeh M', 'Masoumi F', 'Tabrizi M', 'Emami AH', 'Alimoghaddam K', 'Hadjati J', 'Mirahmadian M', 'Jeddi-Tehrani M']","['Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, 14155.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121118,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,,2012/11/28 06:00,2013/03/30 06:00,['2012/11/27 06:00'],"['2012/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-012-0578-x [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2013 Feb;34(1):531-42. doi: 10.1007/s13277-012-0578-x.

Besides moderate antibacterial and antifungal activity, camalexin was reported to also exhibit antiproliferative and cancer chemopreventive effects in breast cancer and leukemia. We studied the cytotoxic effects of camalexin treatment on prostate cancer cell lines and whether this was mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. As models, we utilized LNCaP and its aggressive subline, C4-2, as well as ARCaP cells stably transfected with empty vector (Neo) control or constitutively active Snail cDNA that represents an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) model and displays increased cell migration and tumorigenicity. We confirmed previous studies showing that C4-2 and ARCaP-Snail cells express more ROS than LNCaP and ARCaP-Neo, respectively. Camalexin increased ROS, decreased cell proliferation, and increased apoptosis more significantly in C4-2 and ARCaP-Snail cells as compared to LNCaP and ARCaP-Neo cells, respectively, while normal prostate epithelial cells (PrEC) were unaffected. Increased caspase-3/7 activity and increased cleaved PARP protein shown by Western blot analysis was suggestive of increased apoptosis. The ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) antagonized the effects of camalexin, whereas the addition of exogenous hydrogen peroxide potentiated the effects of camalexin, showing that camalexin is mediating its effects through ROS. In conclusion, camalexin is more potent in aggressive prostate cancer cells that express high ROS levels, and this phytoalexin has a strong potential as a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of especially metastatic prostate cancer.","['Smith, Basil A', 'Neal, Corey L', 'Chetram, Mahandranauth', 'Vo, BaoHan', 'Mezencev, Roman', 'Hinton, Cimona', 'Odero-Marah, Valerie A']","['Smith BA', 'Neal CL', 'Chetram M', 'Vo B', 'Mezencev R', 'Hinton C', 'Odero-Marah VA']","['The Department of Biological Sciences, Center for Cancer Research and Therapeutic Development, Clark Atlanta University, 223 James P.

RESULTS: We included 322 patients. 254 received a port and 68 received an external CVC. There were 102 CVC complications that required removal of the CVC prior to the completion of chemotherapy (65 in patients with ports, 37 in patients with external CVCs). Overall complications requiring CVC removal were significantly less likely to occur in the patient's with ports (p < 0.001). Ports were significantly less likely to require removal prior to the end of treatment overall (p < 0.001) and for specific complications such as infection (p < 0.001) and dislodgement (p = 0.001).

To determine if there is a causal relationship between G1 phase restriction and pluripotency, we made use of the Fluorescence Ubiquitination Cell Cycle Indicator (FUCCI) reporter system to FACS-sort ESCs in the different cell cycle phases. Hence, the G1 phase cells appeared to be more susceptible to differentiation, particularly when ESCs self-renewed in the naive state of pluripotency. Transitions from ground to naive, then from naive to primed states of pluripotency were associated with increased durations of the G1 phase, and cyclin E-mediated alteration of the G1/S transition altered the balance between self-renewal and differentiation. LIF withdrawal resulted in a lengthening of the G1 phase in naive ESCs, which occurred prior to the appearance of early lineage-specific markers, and could be reversed upon LIF supplementation. We concluded that the short G1 phase observed in murine ESCs was a determinant of naive pluripotency and was partially under the control of LIF signaling.","['Coronado, Diana', 'Godet, Murielle', 'Bourillot, Pierre-Yves', 'Tapponnier, Yann', 'Bernat, Agnieszka', 'Petit, Maxime', 'Afanassieff, Marielle', 'Markossian, Suzy', 'Malashicheva, Anna', 'Iacone, Roberto', 'Anastassiadis, Konstantinos', 'Savatier, Pierre']","['Coronado D', 'Godet M', 'Bourillot PY', 'Tapponnier Y', 'Bernat A', 'Petit M', 'Afanassieff M', 'Markossian S', 'Malashicheva A', 'Iacone R', 'Anastassiadis K', 'Savatier P']","['Stem Cell and Brain Research Institute, Bron, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121029,England,Stem Cell Res,Stem cell research,101316957,,2012/11/28 06:00,2013/06/01 06:00,['2012/11/27 06:00'],"['2012/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/13 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S1873-5061(12)00106-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.scr.2012.10.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Stem Cell Res. 2013 Jan;10(1):118-31. doi: 10.1016/j.scr.2012.10.004.

Previously, we demonstrated that AML patients with higher miR (microRNA)-29b expression had better response to the hypomethylating agent decitabine. Therefore, an increase in miR-29b expression preceding decitabine treatment may provide a therapeutic advantage. We previously showed that miR-29b expression is suppressed by a repressor complex that includes HDACs. Thus, HDAC inhibition may increase miR-29b expression. We hypothesized that priming AML cells with the novel HDAC inhibitor (HDACI) AR-42 would result in increased response to decitabine treatment via upregulation of miR-29b. Here, we show that AR-42 is a potent HDACI in AML, increasing miR-29b levels and leading to downregulation of known miR-29b targets (that is, SP1, DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B). We then demonstrated that the sequential administration of AR-42 followed by decitabine resulted in a stronger anti-leukemic activity in vitro and in vivo than decitabine followed by AR-42 or either drug alone. These preclinical results with AR-42 priming before decitabine administration represent a promising, novel treatment approach and a paradigm shift with regard to the combination of epigenetic-targeting compounds in AML, where decitabine has been traditionally given before HDACIs.","['Mims, A', 'Walker, A R', 'Huang, X', 'Sun, J', 'Wang, H', 'Santhanam, R', 'Dorrance, A M', 'Walker, C', 'Hoellerbauer, P', 'Tarighat, S S', 'Chan, K K', 'Klisovic, R B', 'Perrotti, D', 'Caligiuri, M A', 'Byrd, J C', 'Chen, C-S', 'James Lee, L', 'Jacob, S', 'Mrozek, K', 'Bloomfield, C D', 'Blum, W', 'Garzon, R', 'Schwind, S', 'Marcucci, G']","['Mims A', 'Walker AR', 'Huang X', 'Sun J', 'Wang H', 'Santhanam R', 'Dorrance AM', 'Walker C', 'Hoellerbauer P', 'Tarighat SS', 'Chan KK', 'Klisovic RB', 'Perrotti D', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Byrd JC', 'Chen CS', 'James Lee L', 'Jacob S', 'Mrozek K', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Blum W', 'Garzon R', 'Schwind S', 'Marcucci G']","['Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University and The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121126,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC3764604,2012/11/28 06:00,2013/06/05 06:00,['2012/11/27 06:00'],"['2012/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012342 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.342 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Apr;27(4):871-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.342.

These observations suggest that differences exist between fetal and adult tissues in terms of the 'cell of origin' from which the leukemia develops. Here we show that depending on extrinsic cues, human neonatal CD34(+) cells are readily immortalized along either the myeloid or lymphoid lineage upon MLL-AF9 expression and give rise to mainly lymphoid leukemia in immunocompromised mice. In contrast, immortalization of adult bone marrow CD34(+) cells is more difficult to achieve and is myeloid-biased, even when MLL-AF9 is expressed in purified hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Transcriptome analysis identified enrichment of HSC but not progenitor gene signatures in MLL-AF9-expressing cells. Although not observed in adult cells, neonatal cells expressing MLL-AF9 were enriched for gene signatures associated with poor prognosis, resistance to chemotherapeutic agents and MYC signaling. These results indicate that neonatal cells are inherently more prone to MLL-AF9-mediated immortalization than adult cells and suggest that intrinsic properties of the cell of origin, in addition to extrinsic cues, dictate lineage of the immortalized cell.","['Horton, S J', 'Jaques, J', 'Woolthuis, C', 'van Dijk, J', 'Mesuraca, M', 'Huls, G', 'Morrone, G', 'Vellenga, E', 'Schuringa, J J']","['Horton SJ', 'Jaques J', 'Woolthuis C', 'van Dijk J', 'Mesuraca M', 'Huls G', 'Morrone G', 'Vellenga E', 'Schuringa JJ']","['Department of Experimental Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121126,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2012/11/28 06:00,2013/07/20 06:00,['2012/11/27 06:00'],"['2012/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012343 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.343 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Apr;27(5):1116-26. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.343.

Here we explored the ex vivo activity of AMG330, a novel T-cell-engaging BiTE (bi-specific T-cell engagers) antibody (Ab) construct, that is bispecific for the myeloid differentiation antigen, CD33 and CD3, in primary samples from AML patients (N=23) and AML cell lines. KG-1 and U937 cells were lysed in co-culture with healthy donor T-cells at AMG330 concentrations as low as 0.1 ng/ml (1.8 pM). T-cells derived from AML patient samples were found to be as active in redirected lysis by AMG330 as T-cells from healthy donors. In an autologous setting, AMG330 could activate and expand T-cells in primary AML patient samples, and effectively mediated the redirected lysis of AML blasts and normal myeloid cells. A deficiency in target-cell lysis was only observed in samples with very low initial effector-to-target (E:T) ratio. However, this could be overcome if previously stimulated autologous T-cells were tested in patient samples at a higher E:T ratio.

These molds are capable of producing life-threatening diseases in immunocompromised hosts, especially in those suffering from leukemia. It has also been described in immunocompetent patients, where it usually causes non-invasive localized lesions. Fusariosis in immunocompromised individuals has a high morbidity and mortality mainly because of the low sensitivity of these fungi to the antifungal drugs available. CASE REPORT: We describe here the case of a patient with acute mieloblastic leukemia who developed fusariosis by a species of the Fusarium dimerum species complex. The early diagnosis was made on the basis of microscopic observation of samples from cutaneous lesions, and voriconazole treatment was prescribed. A subsequent complete study of the fungal isolate by culture and molecular methods allowed the identification of F. dimerum, a species rarely described as a human pathogen. The sensitivity of the strain was tested using the Sensititre YeastOne((R)) commercial system, which showed sensitivity to voriconazole and posaconazole, as well as to amphotericin B. The patient died after 7 days at hospital due to an hemodynamic failure. CONCLUSIONS: Complete identification of new isolates of Fusarium and their antifungal susceptibility patterns is of high interest to improve our knowledge about the epidemiology of the disease and how to best manage patients.","['Collado, Carmen', 'Medina, Laura', 'Zorraquino, Alfredo', 'Baeza, Teresa', 'Ferrer, Consuelo', 'Plazas, Joaquin', 'Colom, Maria Francisca']","['Collado C', 'Medina L', 'Zorraquino A', 'Baeza T', 'Ferrer C', 'Plazas J', 'Colom MF']","['Servicio de Microbiologia, Hospital General Universitario de Alicante, Alicante, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20121120,Spain,Rev Iberoam Micol,Revista iberoamericana de micologia,9425531,,2012/11/28 06:00,2013/12/18 06:00,['2012/11/27 06:00'],"['2012/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/26 00:00 [revised]', '2012/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S1130-1406(12)00109-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.riam.2012.11.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Iberoam Micol. 2013 Apr-Jun;30(2):119-21. doi: 10.1016/j.riam.2012.11.001.

We decided to retrospectively analyze the impact of stem cell source on the OS of CML patients who relapsed after either matched related donor PBSCT (N=168) or BMT (N=216) and were treated with donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI). Univariate analysis revealed a lower probability of OS after DLI in patients relapsing after PBSCT vs BMT (66% vs 79% at 5 years, P=0.013). However, a multivariate Cox analysis did not reveal any significant impact of PBSCT as a risk factor for decreased OS for patients transplanted in first chronic phase (CP1; hazard ratio (HR) 1.036, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.619-1.734). A statistical interaction term suggested that the impact of stem cell source on OS after DLI was different for those transplanted in advanced phases (negative impact of previous PBSCT-HR 2.176, 95% CI 0.930-5.091). In summary, the stem cell source does not affect the OS of CML patients who underwent PBSCT in CP1, relapsed and were treated with DLI. However, when the patients were transplanted in advanced phases, previous PBSCT seems to negatively affect OS after DLI compared with BMT.","['Basak, G W', 'de Wreede, L C', 'van Biezen, A', 'Wiktor-Jedrzejczak, W', 'Halaburda, K', 'Schmid, C', 'Schaap, N', 'Dazzi, F', 'von dem Borne, P A', 'Petersen, E', 'Beelen, D', 'Abayomi, A', 'Volin, L', 'Buzyn, A', 'Gurman, G', 'Bunjes, D', 'Guglielmi, C', 'Olavarria, E', 'de Witte, T']","['Basak GW', 'de Wreede LC', 'van Biezen A', 'Wiktor-Jedrzejczak W', 'Halaburda K', 'Schmid C', 'Schaap N', 'Dazzi F', 'von dem Borne PA', 'Petersen E', 'Beelen D', 'Abayomi A', 'Volin L', 'Buzyn A', 'Gurman G', 'Bunjes D', 'Guglielmi C', 'Olavarria E', 'de Witte T']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Internal Diseases, The Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland. gbasak@ib.amwaw.edu.pl']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20121126,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,2012/11/28 06:00,2014/01/01 06:00,['2012/11/27 06:00'],"['2012/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt2012234 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2012.234 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2013 Jun;48(6):837-42. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2012.234.

Their use however is limited due to serious adverse effects and there is a great need for analogues with better safety profile. In the present work, the effect of N(1),N(12)-bis(all-trans-retinoyl)spermine (RASP), a conjugate of all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) with spermine, on angiogenesis in vivo and viability of human endothelial and prostate cancer cells in vitro were studied. Both atRA and RASP dose-dependently inhibited angiogenesis in the chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane model. RASP was more effective and could be used in a wider dose range due to lower toxicity compared with atRA. Both retinoids decreased the number of human umbilical vein endothelial and prostate cancer LNCaP and PC3 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. RASP was more effective and potent compared with atRA, spermine, their combination, or conjugates of spermine with other acidic retinoids and/or psoralens in prostate cancer cells. The inhibitory effect of both atRA and RASP seems to be related to an increase of the tumour repressing gene retinoic acid receptor beta mRNA, was mediated by retinoic acid receptor alpha, and was proportional to endogenous retinoic acid receptor beta expression. These data suggest that RASP is more effective than atRA in decreasing angiogenesis and prostate cancer cell growth and identify retinoic acid receptor alpha as the receptor through which it causes retinoic acid receptor beta up-regulation and decrease of prostate cancer cell growth.","['Vourtsis, Dionissios', 'Lamprou, Margarita', 'Sadikoglou, Eldem', 'Giannou, Anastassios', 'Theodorakopoulou, Olga', 'Sarrou, Eliana', 'Magoulas, George E', 'Bariamis, Stavros E', 'Athanassopoulos, Constantinos M', 'Drainas, Dennis', 'Papaioannou, Dionissios', 'Papadimitriou, Evangelia']","['Vourtsis D', 'Lamprou M', 'Sadikoglou E', 'Giannou A', 'Theodorakopoulou O', 'Sarrou E', 'Magoulas GE', 'Bariamis SE', 'Athanassopoulos CM', 'Drainas D', 'Papaioannou D', 'Papadimitriou E']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, Department of Pharmacy, School of Health Sciences, University of Patras, University Campus, Patras GR-26504, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121121,Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,,2012/11/28 06:00,2013/06/12 06:00,['2012/11/27 06:00'],"['2012/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/24 00:00 [revised]', '2012/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-2999(12)00938-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.11.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2013 Jan 5;698(1-3):122-30. doi: 10.1016/j.ejphar.2012.11.007.

The present study aimed to establish a rapid, sensitive, and reliable method using high-resolution melting analysis (HRMA) to detect MYD88 L265P mutation in DLBCL. DESIGNS AND METHODS: The sensitivity of HRMA in the detection of MYD88 L265P mutation was evaluated. MYD88 L265P mutation was further screened in 120 patients with DLBCL. The results of HRMA were validated by direct DNA sequencing. RESULTS: For the detection of MYD88 L265P mutation, the reproducible maximal sensitivity of HRMA was 5% higher than that obtained by direct DNA sequencing (25%). Heterozygous MYD88 L265P mutations were identified in 11 (9.2%) DLBCL cases, all of which were diagnosed as non-germinal-center B cell (non-GCB) DLBCL. CONCLUSIONS: The HRMA assay is a rapid, sensitive, reliable, and high-throughput method to screen MYD88 L265P mutation and could be used in clinical diagnostic laboratories.","['Wang, Cui-Zhu', 'Lin, Jiang', 'Qian, Jun', 'Shao, Rui', 'Xue, Di', 'Qian, Wei', 'Xiao, Gao-Fei', 'Deng, Zhao-Qun', 'Yang, Jing', 'Li, Yun', 'Chen, Xing-Xing']","['Wang CZ', 'Lin J', 'Qian J', 'Shao R', 'Xue D', 'Qian W', 'Xiao GF', 'Deng ZQ', 'Yang J', 'Li Y', 'Chen XX']","[""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu 212002, PR China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121121,United States,Clin Biochem,Clinical biochemistry,0133660,,2012/11/28 06:00,2013/07/31 06:00,['2012/11/27 06:00'],"['2012/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/31 00:00 [revised]', '2012/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-9120(12)00625-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2012.11.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Biochem. 2013 Mar;46(4-5):385-7. doi: 10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2012.11.007.

The aim of this study was to determine cancer risks in nontransplanted and transplanted CF patients. METHODS: From 1990 to 2009, we followed 41,188 patients who received care at one of the 250 CF care center programs in the United States and compared the observed number of cancers in nontransplanted and transplanted patients with that expected in the general US population. RESULTS: In 344,114 patient-years of observation of nontransplanted patients, the overall cancer risk was similar to the background risk (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] = 1.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.0 to 1.3). However, we observed an elevated risk of digestive tract cancer (SIR = 3.5, 95% CI = 2.6 to 4.7) involving the esophago-gastric junction, biliary tract, small bowel, and colon. There was also an increased risk of testicular cancer (SIR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.02 to 2.7) and lymphoid leukemia (SIR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.2 to 3.1) and a decreased risk of malignant melanoma (SIR = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.2 to 0.9). In 8235 patient-years of observation of transplanted patients, 26 tumors were observed compared with 9.6 expected (SIR = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.8 to 3.9). The increased risk was particularly high for digestive tract cancers (SIR = 17.3, 95% CI = 10.7 to 26.5), with most cases arising in the bowel. CONCLUSIONS: The overall burden of cancer in CF patients remains low; however they have an increased risk of digestive tract cancer, particularly following transplantation. They also have increased risk of lymphoid leukemia and testicular cancer, and decreased risk of melanoma.","['Maisonneuve, Patrick', 'Marshall, Bruce C', 'Knapp, Emily A', 'Lowenfels, Albert B']","['Maisonneuve P', 'Marshall BC', 'Knapp EA', 'Lowenfels AB']","['Eng, Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, European Institute of Oncology, via Ripamonti 435, I-20141 Milan, Italy. patrick.maisonneuve@ieo.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121124,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,2012/11/28 06:00,2013/03/02 06:00,['2012/11/27 06:00'],"['2012/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/02 06:00 [medline]']","['djs481 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djs481 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2013 Jan 16;105(2):122-9. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djs481.

AMD3100 similarly induces the mobilization of human acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells into the blood in mice. In this study, the temporal response of pre-B ALL cells to AMD3100 was compared with that of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) using an NOD/SCID xenograft model of ALL and BALB/c mice, respectively. ALL cells remained in the circulation up to 6 hours after AMD3100 administration, by which time normal HPCs were no longer detectable. AMD3100 also increased the proportion of actively cycling ALL cells in the peripheral blood. Together, these data suggest that ALL cells are more sensitive to the effects of bone marrow disruption than normal progenitors. Using the NOD/SCID xenograft model, we demonstrated that AMD3100 increased the efficacy of the cell cycle specific drug vincristine, resulting in reduced disease levels in the blood and spleens of animals over 3 weeks and extended the survival of NOD/SCID mice with ALL. These data demonstrate that mobilizing agents can increase the therapeutic effect of cell cycle dependent chemotherapeutic agents.","['Welschinger, Robert', 'Liedtke, Florian', 'Basnett, Jordan', 'Dela Pena, Aileen', 'Juarez, Julius G', 'Bradstock, Kenneth F', 'Bendall, Linda J']","['Welschinger R', 'Liedtke F', 'Basnett J', 'Dela Pena A', 'Juarez JG', 'Bradstock KF', 'Bendall LJ']","['Westmead Institute for Cancer Research, Westmead Millennium Institute, University of Sydney, Westmead, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121123,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,2012/11/28 06:00,2013/05/22 06:00,['2012/11/27 06:00'],"['2012/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/08 00:00 [revised]', '2012/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(12)00541-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2012.11.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2013 Mar;41(3):293-302.e1. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2012.11.004.

In a murine model of T-ALL induced by the intracellular domain of Notch1 (ICN1), the genetic interaction between ICN1 signaling and Arf inactivation is developmentally stage-specific, with a more pronounced requirement for Arf deletion in thymocytes than in bone marrow precursors targeted for transformation. In the thymus, the target cell for transformation is a CD4 and CD8 double-negative progenitor that undergoes T cell receptor beta-chain rearrangement, a cell type in which polycomb silencing of Ink4a-Arf is normally requisite. Epigenetic remodeling during tumor progression licenses Arf as a tumor suppressor and in turn provides the selective pressure for Ink4a-Arf deletion in clonal T-ALLs that emerge.","['Volanakis, Emmanuel J', 'Boothby, Mark R', 'Sherr, Charles J']","['Volanakis EJ', 'Boothby MR', 'Sherr CJ']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA. emmanuel.volanakis@vanderbilt.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121123,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,PMC3860824,2012/11/28 06:00,2013/07/03 06:00,['2012/11/27 06:00'],"['2012/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/02 00:00 [revised]', '2012/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(12)00543-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2012.11.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2013 Apr;41(4):377-86. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2012.11.006.

In this study, we discovered that nanos3 3'UTR, a common method used to label PGCs, not only directed PGC-specific expression of DsRed but also prolonged this expression up to 26 days post fertilization (dpf) when DsRed-nanos3 3'UTR hybrid mRNAs were introduced into 1- to 2-cell-stage embryos. As such, we employed this knowledge to express zebrafish leukemia inhibitory factor (Lif), basic fibroblast growth factor (Fgf2) and bone morphogenetic protein 4 (Bmp4) in the PGCs and evaluate their effects on PGC development in vivo for over a period of 3 weeks. The results show that expression of Fgf2 significantly increased PGC number at 14- and 21-dpf while Bmp4 resulted in severe ventralization and death of the embryos by 3 days. Expression of Lif resulted in a significant disruption of PGC migration. Mopholino knockdown experiments indicated that Lif illicited its effect on PGC migration through Lif receptor a (Lifra) but not Lifrb. The general approach described in this study could be used to achieve prolonged PGC-specific expression of other proteins to investigate their roles in germ cell and gonad development. The results also indicate that zebrafish PGCs have a mechanism to stabilize and prolong the expression of mRNA that carries nanos3 3'UTR. Understanding this mechanism may make it possible to achieve prolonged RNA expression in other cell types.","['Wong, Ten-Tsao', 'Collodi, Paul']","['Wong TT', 'Collodi P']","['Department of Animal Sciences, Purdue University, 901 W.

Thermal transfer from NS was higher than that displayed by HGNPs, owing to a differential interaction of the nanomaterial with the biological environment. Under sublethal photothermal conditions, NS and HGNPs effectively modulated the expression levels of a DsRed-monomer reporter gene controlled by the highly heat-inducible human HSP70B promoter, as a function of nanomaterial concentration and length of laser exposure. Hyperthermia treatments at doses that do not promote cell death generated a lethal outcome in HeLa cells harboring the fusogenic GALV-FMG transgene under the control of the HSP70B promoter. Combination of lethal photothermia with the triggering of the cytotoxic transgene resulted in a dramatic increase of the cell-ablation area as a result of the synergistic activity established.

In addition, the C282Y SNP has been previously suggested to confer susceptibility to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We have aimed to assess the diagnosis utility of these polymorphisms in a population of Spanish subjects with suspicion of hereditary iron overload and to evaluate the effect of their associations with HLA-A alleles on the susceptibility to ALL. Both the 63DD [OR=4.31 (1.7-11.2)] and 282YY (p for trend=0.02) genotypes were more frequently found among subjects with suspicion of iron overload than among controls. 282YY carriers displayed significantly higher transferrin saturation index (TSI) values (p<0.001) as well as serum iron (p=0.01) and ferritin (p=0.01) levels. In addition, transferrin levels were lower in these subjects (p=0.01). Likewise, patients who were carriers of the compound heterozygous diplotype (282CY/63HD) showed significantly higher TSI and serum iron and ferritin concentrations. The H63D SNP did not significantly affect the analytical parameters measured. All 282YY carriers and 69.2% of compound heterozygotes showed an altered biochemical index. The frequencies of the HFE SNPs in ALL pediatric patients were lower than those found in controls, whereas the HLA-A*24 allele was significantly overrepresented in the patients group [OR=3.76 (1.9-7.3)]. No HFE-HLA-A associations were found to modulate the ALL risk. These results suggest that it may be useful to test for both HFE H63D and C282Y polymorphisms in patients with iron overload, as opposed to just genotyping for the C282Y SNP, which is customary in some healthcare centers.

Four studies reported HRQOL data on patients treated with imatinib only. The most solid data in this area indicate that CML patients receiving TKIs have a worse HRQOL profile when compared to their peers, without cancer, in the general population and interventions to improve HRQOL outcomes are thus needed. Our review revealed the paucity of evidence-based data in this area. However, HRQOL assessment in these studies emphasize the unique information provided by the patient's perspective.

Recent studies have focused on the potential antitumor activity of lycorine. In our previous study, we found that lycorine decrease the cell viability of leukemia HL-60 cells and multiple myeloma KM3 cells and induces cell apoptosis. However, the effect and molecular mechanism of lycorine on human chronic myelocytic leukemia cells has yet to be determined. METHODS: Human chronic myelocytic leukemia cells K562 were treated with lycorine. Cell viability was monitored using the method of CCK-8. The histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymatic activity was detected by HDAC colorimetric assay, and the cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry. The expression of cell-cycle related proteins were identified using Western blot. RESULTS: In the present study, we further revealed that lycorine can inhibit the proliferation of K562 cells. Analysis of HDAC activity showed that lycroine decreases HDAC enzymatic activities in K562 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of HDAC activity has been associated with cell-cycle arrest and growth inhibition. We evaluated the cell cycle distribution after lycorine treatment and found that lycorine causes cell-cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase. To investigate the mechanism behind this cell cycle arrest, G1-related proteins were assayed by Western blot. After lycorine treatment, cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 expressions were inhibited and retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation was reduced. Lycorine treatment also significantly upregulated the expression of p53 and its target gene product, p21. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that inhibition of HDAC activity is responsible for at least part of the induction of cell-cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase by lycorine and provide a mechanistic framework for further exploring the use of lycorine as a novel antitumor agent.","['Li, Lv', 'Dai, Hong-Juan', 'Ye, Mao', 'Wang, Shu-Ling', 'Xiao, Xiao-Juan', 'Zheng, Jie', 'Chen, Hui-Yong', 'Luo, Yu-Hao', 'Liu, Jing']","['Li L', 'Dai HJ', 'Ye M', 'Wang SL', 'Xiao XJ', 'Zheng J', 'Chen HY', 'Luo YH', 'Liu J']","['Molecular Biology Research Center, School of Biological Science and Technology, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410078, China. yemaocsu@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121123,England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,PMC3537594,2012/11/28 06:00,2012/11/28 06:01,['2012/11/27 06:00'],"['2012/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/28 06:01 [medline]']","['1475-2867-12-49 [pii]', '10.1186/1475-2867-12-49 [doi]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2012 Nov 23;12(1):49. doi: 10.1186/1475-2867-12-49.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the last decade, several recurrent genetic abnormalities and gene mutations with prognostic implications have been identified. This has led to improved informed treatment decisions. However, there has been limited change in the use of nonspecific cytotoxic chemotherapy and mortality rates continue to be unacceptably high, with 5 year overall survival rates of older AML patients at 30% or less. Whole-genome sequencing offers hope for greater diagnostic accuracy and is likely to lead to further characterization of disease subsets with differential outcome and response to treatment. The holy grail of personalized targeted therapy for the individual AML patient, while minimizing toxicity and prolonging survival, appears closer than ever.","['Borate, Uma', 'Absher, Devin', 'Erba, Harry P', 'Pasche, Boris']","['Borate U', 'Absher D', 'Erba HP', 'Pasche B']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham and UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center, Birmingham, AL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,England,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,Expert review of anticancer therapy,101123358,PMC3636990,2012/11/28 06:00,2013/05/01 06:00,['2012/11/27 06:00'],"['2012/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1586/era.12.116 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 2012 Oct;12(10):1289-97. doi: 10.1586/era.12.116.,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Genome, Human', 'Genome-Wide Association Study/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/*therapy', 'Pathology, Molecular/*methods', 'Precision Medicine/*methods', 'Risk Factors', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods']",,,,,"['R01 CA137000/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA108741/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P60 AR048098/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA012197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA112520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS436067'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although cure rates have improved in recent decades, approximately one in five children relapse, and survival rates post-relapse remain low. Therefore, more effective and innovative therapeutic strategies are needed in order to improve the outcome in these children. Aurora kinases, a family of serine/threonine kinases essential for regulated mitosis, are overexpressed in many forms of cancer, and have been identified as potential targets for cancer therapeutics. Based on this premise, we evaluated the activity of the Aurora-A/B inhibitor AT9283 against pediatric leukemia cells. It was found that AT9283 significantly inhibited the growth and survival of cell lines derived from patients with pediatric leukemia. Specifically, AT9283 promoted Flt-3 dephosphorylation, inhibiting the activity of downstream effectors such as Erk and Mek. In addition, apoptotic markers were also identified, providing a panel of markers for biological correlative analysis for drug activity. Lastly, drug combination studies demonstrated the potential of several novel and conventional agents to synergize with AT9283, including apicidin, 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) and doxorubicin. These data provide a rationale for further studies and the formulation of a clinical trial of AT9283 for the treatment of refractory pediatric ALL.","['Jayanthan, Aarthi', 'Cooper, Todd M', 'Hoeksema, Kimberley A', 'Lotfi, Shamim', 'Woldum, Evan', 'Lewis, Victor A', 'Narendran, Aru']","['Jayanthan A', 'Cooper TM', 'Hoeksema KA', 'Lotfi S', 'Woldum E', 'Lewis VA', 'Narendran A']","['Pediatric Oncology Experimental Therapeutics Investigators Consortium (POETIC) Laboratory for Pre-Clinical and Drug Discovery Studies, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121229,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,2012/11/28 06:00,2014/02/11 06:00,['2012/11/27 06:00'],"['2012/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2012.752079 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2013 Jul;54(7):1505-16. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2012.752079.

The more recently available TKIs, namely nilotinib (Tasigna) and dasatinib (Sprycel), produce more rapid responses but have not yet shown any overall survival advantage compared with long-term administration of imatinib. They are, however, useful in treating imatinib intolerance or resistance. There are currently two choices for initial treatment of CML-CP: (1) starting all new patients on imatinib and changing to a second-generation TKI in those who fail or who are predicted to fare badly, or (2) starting all new patients on a second-generation TKI.

We analyzed 28 AML sample pairs from patients who achieved complete remission with chemotherapy and subsequently relapsed and 11 sample pairs from patients with persistent disease after induction chemotherapy. Through review of aCNA/cnLOH and gene mutation profiles in informative cases, we demonstrate that relapsed AML invariably represents re-emergence or evolution of a founder clone. Furthermore, all individual aCNA or cnLOH detected at presentation persisted at relapse indicating that this lesion type is proximally involved in AML evolution. Analysis of informative paired persistent AML disease samples uncovered cases with 2 coexisting dominant clones of which at least one was chemotherapy sensitive and one resistant, respectively. These data support the conclusion that incomplete eradication of AML founder clones rather than stochastic emergence of fully unrelated novel clones underlies AML relapse and persistence with direct implications for clinical AML research.","['Parkin, Brian', 'Ouillette, Peter', 'Li, Yifeng', 'Keller, Jennifer', 'Lam, Cindy', 'Roulston, Diane', 'Li, Cheng', 'Shedden, Kerby', 'Malek, Sami N']","['Parkin B', 'Ouillette P', 'Li Y', 'Keller J', 'Lam C', 'Roulston D', 'Li C', 'Shedden K', 'Malek SN']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121121,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC3653567,2012/11/24 06:00,2013/03/30 06:00,['2012/11/24 06:00'],"['2012/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47420-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-04-427039 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Jan 10;121(2):369-77. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-04-427039.

We analyzed this interindividual heterogeneity and provide a predictive mathematical model to prognosticate the long-term response and the individual risk of molecular relapse on treatment cessation. The parameters of the model were determined using 7-year follow-up data from a randomized clinical trial and validated by an independent dataset. Our model predicts that a subset of patients (14%) achieve complete leukemia eradication within less than 15 years and could therefore benefit from discontinuation of treatment. Furthermore, the model prognosticates that 31% of the patients will remain in deep molecular remission (MR(5.0)) after treatment cessation after a fixed period of 2 years in MR(5.0), whereas 69% are expected to relapse.

Intriguingly, the expression of the most potent costimulatory molecules B7-2 (CD86) and B7-H2 (ICOS Ligand) on AML cells has been associated with poor prognosis and disease severity. Here, this phenomenon was modeled in vitro with the myeloid leukemia cell line HL-60, which is capable of differentiating through the FAB M2/M3 and M4/M5 immunophenotypes. These derivatives of HL-60 harbored a B7-2(+) subpopulation and recapitulated the distribution of B7 ligands previously reported in primary AML cases. B7-2(+) AML cells significantly contributed to T-cell responses. This costimulatory activity enabled helper (Th)-cell activation, proliferation, and production of Th1-associated cytokines. Conversely, even a short-term incubation with stimulated T cells resulted in upregulation of inhibitory B7-H1 (PD-L1) and B7-DC (PD-L2), and downregulation of stimulatory B7-H2 molecules on leukemia cells. Purified from iHL-60-T-cell co-cultures, these myeloid leukemia cells severely suppressed Th-cell responses specifically through the PD-1 pathway. In conclusion, Th-cell responses can be directly supported by B7-2(+) leukemia subpopulations. However, this interaction can facilitate the acquisition of a suppressive character that may contribute to immune evasion in myeloid leukemia.","['Dolen, Yusuf', 'Esendagli, Gunes']","['Dolen Y', 'Esendagli G']","['Department of Basic Oncology, Hacettepe University Cancer Institute, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130131,Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,,2012/11/24 06:00,2013/05/03 06:00,['2012/11/24 06:00'],"['2012/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/28 00:00 [revised]', '2012/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/eji.201242814 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2013 Mar;43(3):747-57. doi: 10.1002/eji.201242814.

MLL1 is a structurally complex protein composed of several functional domains. These domains play pivotal roles for the recruitment of regulatory proteins.

The role of autophagy in human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) replication has, however, been uncharacterized. Here, we report that HTLV-1 infection increases the accumulation of autophagosomes and that this accumulation increases HTLV-1 production. We found that the HTLV-1 Tax protein increases cellular autophagosome accumulation by acting to block the fusion of autophagosomes to lysosomes, preventing the degradation of the former by the latter. Interestingly, the inhibition of cellular autophagosome-lysosome fusion using bafilomycin A increased the stability of the Tax protein, suggesting that cellular degradation of Tax occurs in part through autophagy. Our current findings indicate that by interrupting the cell's autophagic process, Tax exerts a positive feedback on its own stability.","['Tang, Sai-Wen', 'Chen, Chia-Yen', 'Klase, Zachary', 'Zane, Linda', 'Jeang, Kuan-Teh']","['Tang SW', 'Chen CY', 'Klase Z', 'Zane L', 'Jeang KT']","['Molecular Virology Section, Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20121121,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,PMC3554132,2012/11/24 06:00,2013/03/06 06:00,['2012/11/24 06:00'],"['2012/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02147-12 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02147-12 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2013 Feb;87(3):1699-707. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02147-12.

METHODS: The influence of fetal calf serum (FCS), patients' autologous serum (AS) and human AB-serum (ABS), used alone and in combinations consisting of two of them (v/v-1:1), on RIT-dependent cytotoxicity, apoptosis, detection of active forms of caspases-3,-9,-8 and disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) were assessed by flow cytometry. RIT was used at the concentration of 10 microg/ml. The spontaneous apoptosis was assessed in culture without RIT. RESULTS: AS revealed the protective action on CLL cells, however this serum added in vitro to the culture either alone or in combination with FCS was the only one to allow RIT to exert its cytotoxic action against CLL cells. RIT-induced apoptosis involved changes in DeltaPsim and activation of caspases-3,-8,-9 when AS+FCS was applicated. Drug induced apoptosis (DIA) was 6.02 and 0.34, when FCS+AS and FCS alone were used, respectively (p<0.01). The RIT-dependent cytotoxic effect decreased when FCS+AS or FCS+ABS were used, as compared to effect of AS used separately. The cytotoxic effect of RIT did not depend on drug concentration, but on the type of serum added to the culture. CONCLUSIONS: The strongest cytotoxic effect of RIT in the presence of AS suggests that this drug activity towards CLL cells is enhanced by known cytotoxic mechanisms, caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway and possible influence of other extracellular factors present in the patients' sera.","['Ziolkowska, Ewelina', 'Franiak-Pietryga, Ida', 'Cebula-Obrzut, Barbara', 'Blonsk, Jerzy Z', 'Robak, Tadeusz', 'Smolewski, Piotr', 'Korycka-Wolowiec, Anna']","['Ziolkowska E', 'Franiak-Pietryga I', 'Cebula-Obrzut B', 'Blonsk JZ', 'Robak T', 'Smolewski P', 'Korycka-Wolowiec A']","['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz 93-510, Ciolkowskiego 2, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121022,Poland,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online),Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej (Online),101206517,,2012/11/24 06:00,2013/09/06 06:00,['2012/11/24 06:00'],"['2012/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1015036 [pii]', '10.5604/17322693.1015036 [doi]']",epublish,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online). 2012 Oct 22;66:730-8. doi: 10.5604/17322693.1015036.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Culture Media)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/immunology', 'Caspase 3/analysis', 'Caspase 8/analysis', 'Caspase 9/analysis', '*Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Survival', '*Culture Media', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/enzymology/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'Middle Aged', 'Rituximab', 'Serum/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The entire pathogenesis of CLL is not clear now, but defective regulation of apoptosis seems to be more important than uncontrolled cell proliferation in CLL. There are two main pathways of apoptosis: the extrinsic pathway and the intrinsic pathway. It is worth noting that the intrinsic pathway, rather than the extrinsic pathway, appears to be the key mediator of impaired apoptosis in CLL as a result of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) upregulation. One subclass of pro-apoptotic members within the Bcl-2 family are Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3)-only proteins. They can regulate directly and/or indirectly the remaining Bcl-2 proteins to endanger mitochondria and induce apoptosis. We chose three molecules from the BH3-only family, Puma, Noxa and Bim, respectively, which had shown an exciting antitumor potential in previous reports, to explore their characters and functions in tumorigenesis, therapy and drug resistance of CLL.","['Zhang, L-N', 'Li, J-Y', 'Xu, W']","['Zhang LN', 'Li JY', 'Xu W']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20121123,England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,,2012/11/24 06:00,2013/05/29 06:00,['2012/11/24 06:00'],"['2012/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/29 06:00 [medline]']","['cgt201284 [pii]', '10.1038/cgt.2012.84 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2013 Jan;20(1):1-7. doi: 10.1038/cgt.2012.84.

In this study, we comprehensively analyzed 10 miRNAs that are consistently upregulated during TPA-induced differentiation of various leukemia cell lines by employing microarray technology. The upregulation of these miRNAs was further verified by quantitative RT-PCR, and, markedly, a subset of the miRNAs was found to be induced via the MEK/ERK signaling pathway using TPA and specific pharmacological inhibitors. Moreover, immunoblotting and quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the expression levels of key miRNA processing machineries (i.e., Drosha, Dicer, Ago1 and Ago2) were not induced in this context, but the transcription of the miRNA products was triggered by MEK/ERK activation. Therefore, we identified the unique miRNAs that respond to TPA treatment in leukemia cells and demonstrated the essential role of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway in the induction of these miRNA transcripts.","['Wang, Jing', 'Liu, Lijun', 'Xie, Lan', 'Xiang, Guangxin', 'Zhou, Yuxiang']","['Wang J', 'Liu L', 'Xie L', 'Xiang G', 'Zhou Y']","['Medical Systems Biology Research Center, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, PR China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121121,Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,,2012/11/24 06:00,2013/05/04 06:00,['2012/11/24 06:00'],"['2012/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijmm.2012.1191 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2013 Jan;31(1):59-66. doi: 10.3892/ijmm.2012.1191.

We compared the micro RNA (miRNA) expression profiles of these two groups and we identified 16 miRNAs that were downregulated in the h-MM group, relative to the nh-MM group. We found that target genes of the most differentially expressed miRNAs are directly involved in the pathogenesis of MM; specifically, the inhibition of hsa-miR-425, hsa-miR-152 and hsa-miR-24, which are all downregulated in h-MM, leads to the overexpression of CCND1, TACC3, MAFB, FGFR3 and MYC, which are the also the oncogenes upregulated by the most frequent IgH chromosomal translocations occurring in nh-MM. Importantly, we showed that the downregulation of these specific miRNAs and the upregulation of their targets also occur simultaneously in primary cases of h-MM. These data provide further evidence on the unifying role of cyclin D pathways deregulation as the key mechanism involved in the development of both groups of MM. Finally, they establish the importance of miRNA deregulation in the context of MM, thereby opening up the potential for future therapeutic approaches based on this molecular mechanism.","['Rio-Machin, A', 'Ferreira, B I', 'Henry, T', 'Gomez-Lopez, G', 'Agirre, X', 'Alvarez, S', 'Rodriguez-Perales, S', 'Prosper, F', 'Calasanz, M J', 'Martinez, J', 'Fonseca, R', 'Cigudosa, J C']","['Rio-Machin A', 'Ferreira BI', 'Henry T', 'Gomez-Lopez G', 'Agirre X', 'Alvarez S', 'Rodriguez-Perales S', 'Prosper F', 'Calasanz MJ', 'Martinez J', 'Fonseca R', 'Cigudosa JC']","['Molecular Cytogenetics Group, Human Cancer Genetics Program, Centro Nacional Investigaciones Oncologicas (CNIO), Calle Melchor Fernandez Almagro 3, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121022,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2012/11/24 06:00,2013/06/05 06:00,['2012/11/24 06:00'],"['2012/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012302 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.302 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Apr;27(4):925-31. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.302.

The factors causing this 'reprogramming' of HRS cells are only partly understood. As early B-cell factor 1 (EBF1), a major B-cell transcription factor, is downregulated in HRS cells, we analyzed whether this downregulation contributes to the lost B-cell phenotype and tested the consequences of EBF1 re-expression in cHL cell lines. EBF1 re-expression caused an upregulation of B-cell genes, such as CD19, CD79A and CD79B, although the B-cell genes FOXO1 and PAX5 remained lowly expressed. The re-expression of CD19, CD79A and CD79B occurred largely without demethylation of promoter CpG motifs of these genes. In the cHL cell line L-1236 fitness decreased after EBF1 re-expression. These data show that EBF1 has the ability to reintroduce part of the B-cell signature in cHL cell lines. Loss of EBF1 expression in HRS cells therefore contributes to their lost B-cell phenotype. Notably, in the cHL cell line KM-H2 destructive mutations were found in one allele of EBF1, indicating that genetic lesions may sometimes have a role in impairing EBF1 expression.","['Bohle, V', 'Doring, C', 'Hansmann, M-L', 'Kuppers, R']","['Bohle V', 'Doring C', 'Hansmann ML', 'Kuppers R']","['University of Duisburg-Essen, Medical School, Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121001,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2012/11/24 06:00,2013/05/01 06:00,['2012/11/24 06:00'],"['2012/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012280 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.280 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Mar;27(3):671-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.280.

Our main objective was to assess the efficacy of imatinib in CML patients, measured by their survival. METHODS: Over a six-year period (June 2003 through May 2009), 25 patients were seen regularly for CML at the Lome Campus teaching hospital. Patients received imatinib after diagnosis and underwent regular laboratory monitoring (quantification of BCR-ABL ratio by RT-PCR). Patients' survival and treatment response were evaluated. RESULTS: Patients' mean age at diagnosis was 40 years (range: 9 to 72 years). Men predominated (17 compared with 7 women). Splenomegaly was found in 80% of cases. The mean leukocyte level was 188.71 g/L (24.4-350). Six patients (24%) had thrombocytosis with a mean platelet count of 491.15 g/L (108-2000). Six patients (24%) died after developing accelerated-phase CML or blast crisis. Estimated overall survival of patients at 6 years was 60%. Molecular biology monitoring detected a secondary G250E mutation with resistance to imatinib in one patient. Standard hematological side effects led to reduction in imatinib doses. The principal nonhematological side effects were weight gain and transient digestible disorders. CONCLUSIONS: At six years after diagnosis, imatinib was effective in treating patients with CML, even in sub-Saharan Africa. Mutation-induced resistance required regular molecular biological monitoring to determine the need to switch to later-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","['Segbena, A Y', 'Kueviakoe, I M D', 'Agbetiafa, K', 'Padaro, E', 'Layibo, Y', 'Dorkenoo, A', 'Agbo, Y M', 'Bories, D']","['Segbena AY', 'Kueviakoe IM', 'Agbetiafa K', 'Padaro E', 'Layibo Y', 'Dorkenoo A', 'Agbo YM', 'Bories D']","[""Faculte de medecine de l'universite de Lome,, Unite d'hematologie CHU Campus de Lome, Lome, Togo. asegbena@hotmail.com""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,France,Med Sante Trop,Medecine et sante tropicales,101581406,,2012/11/24 06:00,2013/05/29 06:00,['2012/11/24 06:00'],"['2012/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/29 06:00 [medline]']","['mst.2012.0083 [pii]', '10.1684/mst.2012.0083 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Sante Trop. 2012 Jul-Sep;22(3):307-11. doi: 10.1684/mst.2012.0083.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Togo', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,"Leucemie myeloide chronique et imatinib, experience du CHU Campus de Lome au Togo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although imatinib-associated interstitial lung disease is uncommon, a few cases have been reported so far. However, in all these cases interstitial lung disease developed during the use of imatinib. The present case is the first report of imatinib-induced interstitial lung disease developing after discontinuation of the drug. CASE PRESENTATION: A 51-year-old woman was administered oral imatinib for gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Ten weeks later, imatinib was discontinued because of facial edema. On this occasion, chest radiography showed no abnormal findings. However, 2 weeks after discontinuation of imatinib, she developed fever, dry cough, and dyspnea. Chest radiography and computed tomography showed diffuse interstitial infiltrates in both lungs. Examination of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid showed an increased proportion of lymphocytes. Imatinib-induced interstitial lung disease was suspected, because no other cause was evident. After administration of corticosteroids, her clinical condition and chest radiographic findings improved. CONCLUSION: We report a unique case of imatinib-induced interstitial lung disease that developed 2 weeks after discontinuation of the drug. Physicians should consider occurrence of imatinib-induced interstitial lung disease even after discontinuation of the drug.","['Nakashima, Shota', 'Kakugawa, Tomoyuki', 'Motomura, Hiroko', 'Hirano, Katsuji', 'Sasaki, Eisuke', 'Nagata, Yasuhiro', 'Kinoshita, Akitoshi', 'Sakamoto, Noriho', 'Ishimatsu, Yuji', 'Mukae, Hiroshi', 'Kohno, Shigeru']","['Nakashima S', 'Kakugawa T', 'Motomura H', 'Hirano K', 'Sasaki E', 'Nagata Y', 'Kinoshita A', 'Sakamoto N', 'Ishimatsu Y', 'Mukae H', 'Kohno S']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Nagasaki, Japan. kakugawa@nagasaki-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20121123,Italy,Multidiscip Respir Med,Multidisciplinary respiratory medicine,101477642,PMC3537559,2012/11/24 06:00,2012/11/24 06:01,['2012/11/24 06:00'],"['2012/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/24 06:01 [medline]']","['2049-6958-7-48 [pii]', '10.1186/2049-6958-7-48 [doi]']",epublish,Multidiscip Respir Med. 2012 Nov 23;7(1):48. doi: 10.1186/2049-6958-7-48.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is one of the multiple targets of multi-target kinase inhibitors in clinical uses and trials for the treatment of leukemia and other cancers. These successes and appearances of drug resistance in some patients have raised significant interest and efforts in discovering new Src inhibitors. Various in-silico methods have been used in some of these efforts. It is desirable to explore additional in-silico methods, particularly those capable of searching large compound libraries at high yields and reduced false-hit rates. RESULTS: We evaluated support vector machines (SVM) as virtual screening tools for searching Src inhibitors from large compound libraries. SVM trained and tested by 1,703 inhibitors and 63,318 putative non-inhibitors correctly identified 93.53%~ 95.01% inhibitors and 99.81%~ 99.90% non-inhibitors in 5-fold cross validation studies. SVM trained by 1,703 inhibitors reported before 2011 and 63,318 putative non-inhibitors correctly identified 70.45% of the 44 inhibitors reported since 2011, and predicted as inhibitors 44,843 (0.33%) of 13.56M PubChem, 1,496 (0.89%) of 168 K MDDR, and 719 (7.73%) of 9,305 MDDR compounds similar to the known inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: SVM showed comparable yield and reduced false hit rates in searching large compound libraries compared to the similarity-based and other machine-learning VS methods developed from the same set of training compounds and molecular descriptors. We tested three virtual hits of the same novel scaffold from in-house chemical libraries not reported as Src inhibitor, one of which showed moderate activity. SVM may be potentially explored for searching Src inhibitors from large compound libraries at low false-hit rates.","['Han, Bucong', 'Ma, Xiaohua', 'Zhao, Ruiying', 'Zhang, Jingxian', 'Wei, Xiaona', 'Liu, Xianghui', 'Liu, Xin', 'Zhang, Cunlong', 'Tan, Chunyan', 'Jiang, Yuyang', 'Chen, Yuzong']","['Han B', 'Ma X', 'Zhao R', 'Zhang J', 'Wei X', 'Liu X', 'Liu X', 'Zhang C', 'Tan C', 'Jiang Y', 'Chen Y']","[""The Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology, Guangdong Province, The Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, Guangdong, 518055, People's Republic of China. jiangyy@sz.tsinghua.edu.cn.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121123,England,Chem Cent J,Chemistry Central journal,101314213,PMC3538513,2012/11/24 06:00,2012/11/24 06:01,['2012/11/24 06:00'],"['2012/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/24 06:01 [medline]']","['1752-153X-6-139 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-153X-6-139 [doi]']",epublish,Chem Cent J. 2012 Nov 23;6(1):139. doi: 10.1186/1752-153X-6-139.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we present a patient with rapidly progressive severe hyponatremia as an initial sign and symptom of human herpesvirus-6-associated post-transplantation acute limbic encephalitis (HHV-6 PALE) after allo-SCT. A 45-year-old woman with acute lymphoblastic leukemia received unrelated bone marrow transplantation from a one locus-mismatched donor at the DR locus. On day 21, she developed a generalized seizure and loss of consciousness with severe hyponatremia, elevated serum antidiuretic hormone (ADH), and decreased serum osmolality. A high titer of HHV-6 DNA was detected in cerebrospinal fluid. Treatment with foscarnet sodium and hypertonic saline was started with improvement of neurological condition within several days. Although an elevated serum ADH, low serum osmolality, and high urinary osmolality persisted for 2 months, she had no other recurrent symptoms of encephalitis.

However, this may have serious drawbacks, since apoptotic cells reportedly induce immunological tumor tolerance and activate a tumor repopulation program. The debate on which type of cell death has the most beneficial therapeutic effects in cancer treatment is intense and controversial. Stringently regulated, doxycycline-inducible transgene expression systems trigger cell death in a defined manner, which might help us find answers to these problems. A conditional suicide switch established transiently in Jurkat T-cells was used to test a set of pro-apoptotic proteins for their potency to induce cell death. The activated forms of caspase-3 (revCasp-3) and Bid (tBid) were very effective and, therefore, analyzed after stable integration into human leukemia and murine melanoma cell lines. Expression of either protein resulted in more than 95% cell death, but with strongly different kinetics. 85% cell death was observed if tBid and revCasp-3 were expressed for 4-6 hours and 18-24 hours, respectively. The human cell lines expressing these suicide switches can serve as cancer models in xeno-transplanted mice, the corresponding murine cell lines allow syngeneic and allogeneic murine cancer models to be established.","['Maueroder, Christian', 'Chaurio, Ricardo A', 'Platzer, Stephanie', 'Munoz, Luis E', 'Berens, Christian']","['Maueroder C', 'Chaurio RA', 'Platzer S', 'Munoz LE', 'Berens C']","['Lehrstuhl fur Mikrobiologie, Department Biologie, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130125,England,Autoimmunity,Autoimmunity,8900070,,2012/11/24 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2012/11/24 06:00'],"['2012/11/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08916934.2012.752463 [doi]'],ppublish,Autoimmunity. 2013 Aug;46(5):329-35. doi: 10.3109/08916934.2012.752463.

For example, a large-scale genomic study of a disease may examine thousands of genes without hypothesizing that any specific gene is responsible for the disease. In these studies, the objective is to explore a large number of possible factors (e.g., genes) in order to identify a small number that will be considered in follow-up studies that tend to be more thorough and on smaller scales. A simple, hierarchical, linear regression model with random coefficients is assumed for case-control data that correspond to each gene. The specific model used will be seen to be related to a standard Bayesian variable selection model. Relatively large regression coefficients correspond to potential differences in responses for cases versus controls and thus to genes that might 'matter'. For large-scale studies, and using a Dirichlet process mixture model for the regression coefficients, we are able to find clusters of regression effects of genes with increasing potential effect or 'relevance', in relation to the outcome of interest. One cluster will always correspond to genes whose coefficients are in a neighborhood that is relatively close to zero and will be deemed least relevant. Other clusters will correspond to increasing magnitudes of the random/latent regression coefficients. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that our approach could be quite effective in finding relevant genes compared with several alternative methods. We apply our model to two large-scale studies.

METHODS: Peripheral blood was obtained from 36 patients diagnosed with CLL and 10 HC. CD19 B-lymphocytes were isolated using an antibody coupled magnetic bead isolation system; from these cells the total RNA was isolated and purified. The relative levels of gene expression were examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qReTi-PCR) using primers specific for each isoform. RESULTS: Bcl-2alpha and Baxalpha are expressed at higher levels than their beta-isoforms in CLL and HC. Bcl-2alpha, Bcl-2beta and Baxbeta expression is increased in CLL while Bax-alpha is expressed at similar levels to HC. The Bcl-2alpha/Bcl-2beta ratio is similar in CLL and HC. The Bcl-2alpha/Baxalpha ratio is increased in CLL when compared with HC. CONCLUSION: Bcl-2alpha and Baxalpha appear to be the dominant anti- and pro-apoptotic isoforms in CLL.

Effective therapy is represented by the combination of surgery and amphotericin B administration and early initiation of the therapy is necessary for favorable outcome. The first clinical symptoms are usually non-specific and this can lead to late therapy onset. The objective of this retrospective work was to determine the frequency, risk factors and outcome of invasive mucormycosis in pediatric hematology patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study cohort comprised 399 patients diagnosed with hematologic diseases in the Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (DPHO), University Hospital Motol, Prague between 2005 and 2010. Risk factors for the development of mucormycosis, clinical symptoms and radiology and laboratory results were retrospectively evaluated. So were the therapy used and outcomes. The findings were analyzed using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: During the selected period, mucormycosis was detected in 8 patients diagnosed with hematologic disease. The incidence of mucormycosis was 1.75 %. These conditions accounted for 20.6 % of all mycoses. In five patients, it was found as isolated infection; three cases were associated with other mycoses (one with candidiasis, two with aspergillosis). The most frequent underlying disease was acute leukemia; the most common risk factor was severe prolonged neutropenia (median duration 21.5 days). Three of eight patients survived mucormycosis, a mortality rate of 62.5 %. The effective therapy was amphotericin B administration in three patients (p = 0.02); in two of them, it was combined with radical surgery. CONCLUSION: In the cohort, the proportion of mucormycosis cases was surprisingly high when compared with other fungal diseases. Continuous surveillance of mucormycosis in the DPHO is needed. There was no significant influence of the combination of radical surgery and amphotericin B administration as compared to administration of amphotericin B alone. Nevertheless, according to the published data, we consider this approach as an optimal strategy for the management of mucormycosis at the present time.","['Chrenkova, Vanda', 'Hubacek, Petr', 'Weinbergerova, Barbora', 'Sedlacek, Petr', 'Keslova, Petra', 'Kabickova, Edita', 'Pavlickova, Klara', 'Sramkova, Lucie', 'Snajdauf, Jiri', 'Bebrova, Eliska', 'Nyc, Otakar', 'Stary, Jan', 'Hamal, Petr']","['Chrenkova V', 'Hubacek P', 'Weinbergerova B', 'Sedlacek P', 'Keslova P', 'Kabickova E', 'Pavlickova K', 'Sramkova L', 'Snajdauf J', 'Bebrova E', 'Nyc O', 'Stary J', 'Hamal P']","['Institute of Medical Microbiology, Charles University, 2nd Medical Faculty Prague. vanda.chrenkova@fnmotol.cz']",['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Czech Republic,Klin Mikrobiol Infekc Lek,Klinicka mikrobiologie a infekcni lekarstvi,101189112,,2012/11/23 06:00,2013/01/11 06:00,['2012/11/23 06:00'],"['2012/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/11 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Klin Mikrobiol Infekc Lek. 2012 Aug;18(4):102-8.,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mucormycosis/*diagnosis/microbiology']",,,,,,,,,,Invazivni mukormykoza u detskych hematoonkologickych pacientu: zhusenosti 2005-2010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Combining an SERM with one or more estrogens to form a tissue selective estrogen complex (TSEC) can provide an improved blend of tissue-specific ER agonist and antagonist effects. While both estrogens and SERMs affect the uterine endometrium, not all TSECs reverse the endometrial effects of estrogens preventing endometrial proliferation and hyperplasia. Their action in uterine cells is not completely understood. HOXA 10, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), progesterone receptor (PR), and EMX2 are genes known to regulate endometrial proliferation and differentiation. The expression of these genes was used to assess endometrial effects of SERMs and TSECs. We evaluated the effects of raloxifene (RAL), tamoxifen (TAM), lasofoxifene (LAS), bazedoxifene acetate (BZA), and progesterone (P) alone and in combination with estradiol (E2) in Ishikawa cells. Increased HOXA10, LIF, PR, and EMX2 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was noted in E2-treated cells compared with vehicle-treated controls. All TSECs maintained E2-induced PR expression and all except TAM prevented estrogen-induced LIF expression. The TSEC containing BZA uniquely decreased HOXA10 expression and increased EMX2 expression. The TSECs alter endometrial cell proliferation by selective modulation of estrogen responsive genes, maintaining the antiproliferative effects mediated by PR and inhibiting LIF. The differential effect of TSECs on endometrial gene expression suggests a mechanism by which they manifest differential effects on endometrial safety against the risk of estrogen-induced endometrial hyperplasia.","['Kulak, Jaime Jr', 'Ferriani, Rui A', 'Komm, Barry S', 'Taylor, Hugh S']","['Kulak J Jr', 'Ferriani RA', 'Komm BS', 'Taylor HS']","['Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121120,United States,Reprod Sci,"Reproductive sciences (Thousand Oaks, Calif.)",101291249,PMC3826278,2012/11/23 06:00,2014/05/20 06:00,['2012/11/23 06:00'],"['2012/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['1933719112463251 [pii]', '10.1177/1933719112463251 [doi]']",ppublish,Reprod Sci. 2013 Feb;20(2):129-37. doi: 10.1177/1933719112463251.

Mcl-1 is a critical survival protein in a variety of cell lineages and is critically regulated via ubiquitination. METHODS: The Mcl-1, Bcl-xL and USP9X expression patterns in human lung and colon adenocarcinomas were evaluated via immunohistochemistry. Interaction between USP9X and Mcl-1 was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation-western blotting. The protein expression profiles of Mcl-1, Bcl-xL and USP9X in multiple cancer cell lines were determined by western blotting. Annexin-V staining and cleaved PARP western blotting were used to assay for apoptosis. The cellular toxicities after various treatments were measured via the XTT assay. RESULTS: In our current analysis of colon and lung cancer samples, we demonstrate that Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL are overexpressed and also co-exist in many tumors and that the expression levels of both genes correlate with the clinical staging. The downregulation of Mcl-1 or Bcl-xL via RNAi was found to increase the sensitivity of the tumor cells to chemotherapy. Furthermore, our analyses revealed that USP9X expression correlates with that of Mcl-1 in human cancer tissue samples. We additionally found that the USP9X inhibitor WP1130 promotes Mcl-1 degradation and increases tumor cell sensitivity to chemotherapies. Moreover, the combination of WP1130 and ABT-737, a well-documented Bcl-xL inhibitor, demonstrated a chemotherapeutic synergy and promoted apoptosis in different tumor cells. CONCLUSION: Mcl-1, Bcl-xL and USP9X overexpression are tumor survival mechanisms protective against chemotherapy. USP9X inhibition increases tumor cell sensitivity to various chemotherapeutic agents including Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitors.","['Peddaboina, Chander', 'Jupiter, Daniel', 'Fletcher, Steven', 'Yap, Jeremy L', 'Rai, Arun', 'Tobin, Richard P', 'Jiang, Weihua', 'Rascoe, Philip', 'Rogers, M Karen Newell', 'Smythe, W Roy', 'Cao, Xiaobo']","['Peddaboina C', 'Jupiter D', 'Fletcher S', 'Yap JL', 'Rai A', 'Tobin RP', 'Jiang W', 'Rascoe P', 'Rogers MK', 'Smythe WR', 'Cao X']","['Department of Surgery, Scott & White Memorial Hospital and Clinic, The Texas A&M University System, Health Science Center, College of Medicine, Temple, TX 76504, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121121,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,PMC3543233,2012/11/23 06:00,2013/07/23 06:00,['2012/11/23 06:00'],"['2012/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-12-541 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-12-541 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2012 Nov 21;12:541. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-12-541.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (USP9X protein, human)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)']",IM,,"['Adenocarcinoma/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colonic Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Lung Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'bcl-X Protein/analysis/*biosynthesis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To develop a method for detecting T-cell reactivity against K562 cell-derived antigens in patients, we exploited the dendritic cell (DC)-mediated cross-presentation of proteins generated from apoptotic cells. We used UVB irradiation to consistently induce apoptosis of K562 cells, which were then fed to autologous DCs. These DCs were used to both stimulate and detect antigen-specific CD8(+) T-cell reactivity.

The enhanced leukemogenesis in the absence of an intact Type I IFN signaling is caused by alterations within the tumor environment. Deletion of Ifnar1 in tumor cells (as obtained in Ifnar1(f/f) CD19-Cre mice) failed to impact on disease latency or type. In line with this observation, the initial transformation and proliferative capacity of tumor cells were unaltered irrespective of whether the cells expressed IFNAR1 or not. v-ABL-induced leukemogenesis is mainly subjected to natural killer (NK) cell-mediated tumor surveillance. Thus, we concentrated on NK cell functions in IFNAR1 deficient animals. Ifnar1(-/-) NK cells displayed maturation defects as well as an impaired cytolytic activity. When we deleted Ifnar1 selectively in mature NK cells (by crossing Ncr1-iCre mice to Ifnar1(f/f) animals), maturation was not altered. However, NK cells derived from Ifnar1(f/f) Ncr1-iCre mice showed a significant cytolytic defect in vitro against the hematopoietic cell lines YAC-1 and RMA-S, but not against the melanoma cell line B16F10. Interestingly, this defect was not related to an in vivo phenotype as v-ABL-induced leukemogenesis was unaltered in Ifnar1(f/f )Ncr1-iCre compared with Ifnar1(f/f) control mice. Moreover, the ability of Ifnar1(f/f) Ncr1-iCre NK cells to kill B16F10 melanoma cells was unaltered, both in vitro and in vivo. Our data reveal that despite the necessity for Type I IFN in NK cell maturation the expression of IFNAR1 on mature murine NK cells is not required for efficient tumor surveillance.","['Mizutani, Tatsuaki', 'Neugebauer, Nina', 'Putz, Eva M', 'Moritz, Nadine', 'Simma, Olivia', 'Zebedin-Brandl, Eva', 'Gotthardt, Dagmar', 'Warsch, Wolfgang', 'Eckelhart, Eva', 'Kantner, Hans-Peter', 'Kalinke, Ulrich', 'Lienenklaus, Stefan', 'Weiss, Siegfried', 'Strobl, Birgit', 'Muller, Mathias', 'Sexl, Veronika', 'Stoiber, Dagmar']","['Mizutani T', 'Neugebauer N', 'Putz EM', 'Moritz N', 'Simma O', 'Zebedin-Brandl E', 'Gotthardt D', 'Warsch W', 'Eckelhart E', 'Kantner HP', 'Kalinke U', 'Lienenklaus S', 'Weiss S', 'Strobl B', 'Muller M', 'Sexl V', 'Stoiber D']","['Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research; Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,PMC3494617,2012/11/22 06:00,2012/11/22 06:01,['2012/11/22 06:00'],"['2012/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4161/onci.21284 [doi]', '2012ONCOIMM0109R [pii]']",ppublish,Oncoimmunology. 2012 Oct 1;1(7):1027-1037. doi: 10.4161/onci.21284.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the latter, signals propagated through the BCR are believed to play a key role in leukemia initiation, maintenance and evolution. Drugs that can disrupt these signals have recently emerged as potential therapeutic agents in CLL and several of them are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Particularly promising clinical responses have been obtained with inhibitors of the kinases SYK, BTK, and PI3Kdelta, which function by blocking BCR signal transduction. In addition, recent studies focusing on the phosphatase PTPN22, which is involved in the pathogenesis of multiple autoimmune diseases and is markedly overexpressed in CLL cells, suggest that it may be possible in the future to develop strategies that will selectively reprogram BCR survival signals into signals that induce leukemic cell death. This review focuses on the biological basis behind these strategies and highlights some of the most promising BCR-targeting agents in ongoing preclinical and clinical studies.","['Efremov, Dimitar G', 'Wiestner, Adrian', 'Laurenti, Luca']","['Efremov DG', 'Wiestner A', 'Laurenti L']","['Molecular Hematology, International Centre for Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology, Campus ""A.

Here, we identify a yet undescribed UGT2B17 mRNA overexpression in poor-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In total, 320 CLL patients and 449 healthy donors were analyzed. High (above median) UGT2B17 expression was associated with established CLL poor prognostic factors and resulted in shorter treatment-free and overall survival (hazard ratio ([death] 2.18; 95% CI 1.18-4.01; P = .013). The prognostic impact of mRNA expression was more significant than that of UGT2B17 CNV. UGT2B17 mRNA levels in primary CLL samples directly correlated with functional glucuronidation activity toward androgens and the anticancer drug vorinostat (R > 0.9, P < .001). After treatment with fludarabine containing regimens UGT2B17 was up-regulated particularly in poor responders (P = .030). We observed an exclusive involvement of the 2B17 isoform within the UGT protein family. Gene expression profiling of a stable UGT2B17 knockdown in the CLL cell line MEC-1 demonstrated a significant involvement in key cellular processes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of 69 patients with pathologically proven myeloid sarcoma included 25 patients (16 men, nine women; mean age, 55 years; range, 22-78 years) who underwent pretreatment MRI at our institution from January 2001 to October 2011. A total of 71 MRI examinations were evaluated by two radiologists in consensus. RESULTS: A total of 41 sites of involvement of myeloid sarcoma were noted, most commonly bone (13/25, 52%), muscle (7/25, 28%), CNS (6/25, 24%), and head and neck (6/25, 24%). Nineteen sites were noted on MR images obtained for evaluation of a new sign or symptom, most commonly musculoskeletal (11 sites) and CNS (six sites). Fifteen sites were noted on MR images obtained for further evaluation of a previously detected abnormality, most commonly in the abdomen and pelvis (seven sites). Seven lesions were incidentally found on MR images obtained for other myeloid sarcoma-related indications, most commonly in the head and neck (three lesions) and musculoskeletal system (three lesions). The mean size of measurable lesions was 5.6 cm (range, 1-20 cm). Compared with muscle, the lesions were isointense (31/41, 75.6%) or hypointense (10/41, 24.4%) on T1-weighted images and mildly hyperintense (39/41, 95.1%) on T2-weighted images and had homogeneous enhancement (29/38, 76.3%). CONCLUSION: In our experience, MRI was most often used for evaluation of bone, muscle, the CNS, and the head and neck region. MRI is useful for evaluation of new musculoskeletal and CNS findings and for further evaluation of known abdominopelvic masses. Incidental findings are often musculoskeletal or in the soft tissues of the head and neck.","['Shinagare, Atul B', 'Krajewski, Katherine M', 'Hornick, Jason L', 'Zukotynski, Katherine', 'Kurra, Vikram', 'Jagannathan, Jyothi P', 'Ramaiya, Nikhil H']","['Shinagare AB', 'Krajewski KM', 'Hornick JL', 'Zukotynski K', 'Kurra V', 'Jagannathan JP', 'Ramaiya NH']","['Department of Imaging, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 450 Brookline Ave, Boston, MA 02215, USA. ashinagare@partners.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,AJR Am J Roentgenol,AJR.

The ability of ribosomal proteins L5, L11, L23, L26, or S7 to bind Mdm2 and inhibit its ubiquitin ligase activity has been suggested as a critical step in p53 activation under these conditions. Here, we report that L5 and L11 are particularly important for this response. Whereas several other newly synthesized ribosomal proteins are degraded by proteasomes upon inhibition of Pol I activity by actinomycin D, L5 and L11 accumulate in the ribosome-free fraction where they bind to Mdm2. This selective accumulation of free L5 and L11 is due to their mutual protection from proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, the endogenous, newly synthesized L5 and L11 continue to be imported into nucleoli even after nucleolar disruption and colocalize with Mdm2, p53, and promyelocytic leukemia protein. This suggests that the disrupted nucleoli may provide a platform for L5- and L11-dependent p53 activation, implying a role for the nucleolus in p53 activation by ribosomal biogenesis stress. These findings may have important implications with respect to understanding the pathogenesis of diseases caused by impaired ribosome biogenesis.","['Bursac, Sladana', 'Brdovcak, Maja Cokaric', 'Pfannkuchen, Martin', 'Orsolic, Ines', 'Golomb, Lior', 'Zhu, Yan', 'Katz, Chen', 'Daftuar, Lilyn', 'Grabusic, Kristina', 'Vukelic, Iva', 'Filic, Vedrana', 'Oren, Moshe', 'Prives, Carol', 'Volarevic, Sinisa']","['Bursac S', 'Brdovcak MC', 'Pfannkuchen M', 'Orsolic I', 'Golomb L', 'Zhu Y', 'Katz C', 'Daftuar L', 'Grabusic K', 'Vukelic I', 'Filic V', 'Oren M', 'Prives C', 'Volarevic S']","['Department of Molecular Medicine and Biotechnology, School of Medicine, University of Rijeka, 51000 Rijeka, Croatia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121120,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,PMC3528581,2012/11/22 06:00,2013/03/01 06:00,['2012/11/22 06:00'],"['2012/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1218535109 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1218535109 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Dec 11;109(50):20467-72. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1218535109.

Notably, miR-155 is one of the most overexpressed miRNAs in several solid and hematological malignancies. Ectopic miR-155 expression in mice B cells (Emu-miR-155 transgenic mice) has been shown to induce pre-B-cell proliferation followed by high-grade lymphoma/leukemia. Loss of miR-155 in mice resulted in impaired immunity due to defective T-cell-mediated immune response. Here we provide a mechanistic insight into miR-155-induced leukemogenesis in the Emu-miR-155 mouse model through genome-wide transcriptome analysis of naive B cells and target studies. We found that a key transcriptional repressor and proto-oncogene, Bcl6 is significantly down-regulated in Emu-miR-155 mice. The reduction of Bcl6 subsequently leads to de-repression of some of the known Bcl6 targets like inhibitor of differentiation (Id2), interleukin-6 (IL6), cMyc, Cyclin D1, and Mip1alpha/ccl3, all of which promote cell survival and proliferation. We show that Bcl6 is indirectly regulated by miR-155 through Mxd1/Mad1 up-regulation. Interestingly, we found that miR-155 directly targets HDAC4, a corepressor partner of BCL6. Furthermore, ectopic expression of HDAC4 in human-activated B-cell-type diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cells results in reduced miR-155-induced proliferation, clonogenic potential, and increased apoptosis. Meta-analysis of the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patient microarray data showed that miR-155 expression is inversely correlated with Bcl6 and Hdac4. Hence this study provides a better understanding of how miR-155 causes disruption of the BCL6 transcriptional machinery that leads to up-regulation of the survival and proliferation genes in miR-155-induced leukemias.","['Sandhu, Sukhinder K', 'Volinia, Stefano', 'Costinean, Stefan', 'Galasso, Marco', 'Neinast, Reid', 'Santhanam, Ramasamy', 'Parthun, Mark R', 'Perrotti, Danilo', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Garzon, Ramiro', 'Croce, Carlo M']","['Sandhu SK', 'Volinia S', 'Costinean S', 'Galasso M', 'Neinast R', 'Santhanam R', 'Parthun MR', 'Perrotti D', 'Marcucci G', 'Garzon R', 'Croce CM']","['Department of Molecular Virology, Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20121119,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,PMC3523868,2012/11/22 06:00,2013/02/07 06:00,['2012/11/22 06:00'],"['2012/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/07 06:00 [medline]']","['1213764109 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1213764109 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Dec 4;109(49):20047-52. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1213764109.

Vincristine sulfate liposome injection (VSLI), sphingomyelin and cholesterol nanoparticle vincristine (VCR), facilitates VCR dose-intensification and densification plus enhances target tissue delivery. We evaluated high-dose VSLI monotherapy in adults with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) -negative ALL that was multiply relapsed, relapsed and refractory to reinduction, and/or relapsed after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-five adults with Ph-negative ALL in second or greater relapse or whose disease had progressed following two or more leukemia therapies were treated in this pivotal phase II, multinational trial. Intravenous VSLI 2.25 mg/m(2), without dose capping, was administered once per week until response, progression, toxicity, or pursuit of HCT. The primary end point was achievement of complete response (CR) or CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi). RESULTS: The CR/CRi rate was 20% and overall response rate was 35%. VSLI monotherapy was effective as third-, fourth-, and fifth-line therapy and in patients refractory to other single- and multiagent reinduction therapies. Median CR/CRi duration was 23 weeks (range, 5 to 66 weeks); 12 patients bridged to a post-VSLI HCT, and five patients were long-term survivors. VSLI was generally well tolerated and associated with a low 30-day mortality rate (12%). CONCLUSION: High-dose VSLI monotherapy resulted in meaningful clinical outcomes including durable responses and bridging to HCT in advanced ALL settings. The toxicity profile of VSLI was predictable, manageable, and comparable to standard VCR despite the delivery of large, normally unachievable, individual and cumulative doses of VCR.","[""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Schiller, Gary', 'Lister, John', 'Damon, Lloyd', 'Goldberg, Stuart', 'Aulitzky, Walter', 'Ben-Yehuda, Dina', 'Stock, Wendy', 'Coutre, Steven', 'Douer, Dan', 'Heffner, Leonard T', 'Larson, Melissa', 'Seiter, Karen', 'Smith, Scott', 'Assouline, Sarit', 'Kuriakose, Philip', 'Maness, Lori', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Rowe, Jacob', 'Schaich, Markus', 'Shpilberg, Ofer', 'Yee, Karen', 'Schmieder, Guenter', 'Silverman, Jeffrey A', 'Thomas, Deborah', 'Deitcher, Steven R', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","[""O'Brien S"", 'Schiller G', 'Lister J', 'Damon L', 'Goldberg S', 'Aulitzky W', 'Ben-Yehuda D', 'Stock W', 'Coutre S', 'Douer D', 'Heffner LT', 'Larson M', 'Seiter K', 'Smith S', 'Assouline S', 'Kuriakose P', 'Maness L', 'Nagler A', 'Rowe J', 'Schaich M', 'Shpilberg O', 'Yee K', 'Schmieder G', 'Silverman JA', 'Thomas D', 'Deitcher SR', 'Kantarjian H']","['University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121119,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,PMC4979201,2012/11/22 06:00,2013/04/16 06:00,['2012/11/22 06:00'],"['2012/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/16 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2012.46.2309 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2012.46.2309 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2013 Feb 20;31(6):676-83. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2012.46.2309.

The CAEBV disease entity has the common feature of lymphoproliferation of T or NK cells (primarily), and B cells (rarely), with chronic activation of EBV infection. The disease is rare and seems to be more prevalent in East Asian countries. The CAEBV disease entity encompasses heterogenous disorders, including hydroa vacciniforme (HV), hypersensitivity to mosquito bites, EBV-associated hemophagocytic syndrome, NK/T-cell lymphoma, and NK-cell leukemia. Atypical HV-like eruptions are present on sun-exposed and nonexposed areas with facial edema, fever, and hepatosplenomegaly, unlike classic HV. Recently, it has been suggested that classic HV and atypical HV-like eruptions are variants within the same disease spectrum of EBV-T/NK-LPD. We report a Korean boy with an atypical HV-like eruption and various systemic manifestations, including fever, sore throat, abdominal pain, headaches, seizures, and hematologic abnormalities for 2 years. After the initial mild eruption, which resembled a viral exanthem, ulceronecrotic skin lesions gradually developed and were associated with a high-grade fever and constitutional symptoms. He had a CAEBV infection, which showed a predominant proliferation of NK cells with high EBV DNA levels in the peripheral blood. However, in the skin lesions, there were nonneoplastic CD4 T-cell infiltrations predominantly showing a monoclonal T-cell receptor-gamma gene rearrangement and positive EBV in situ hybridization.","['Lee, Hye Young', 'Baek, Jin Ok', 'Lee, Jong Rok', 'Park, Sang Hui', 'Jeon, In Sang', 'Roh, Joo Young']","['Lee HY', 'Baek JO', 'Lee JR', 'Park SH', 'Jeon IS', 'Roh JY']","['Department of Dermatology, Gachon University of Medicine and Science, Gil Medical Center, Incheon, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Am J Dermatopathol,The American Journal of dermatopathology,7911005,,2012/11/22 06:00,2013/06/28 06:00,['2012/11/22 06:00'],"['2012/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/DAD.0b013e3181c036de [doi]', '00000372-201212000-00021 [pii]']",ppublish,Am J Dermatopathol. 2012 Dec;34(8):e119-24. doi: 10.1097/DAD.0b013e3181c036de.,,IM,,"['Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Hydroa Vacciniforme/*pathology/virology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*pathology/virology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*pathology/physiopathology/virology', 'Male', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology/virology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to determine the presence of HCV-RNA in PBMCs of patients with lymphoproliferative disorders. One hundred and four consecutive patients with lymphoproliferative disorders admitted to Firouzgar Hospital from January 2010 to March 2011 were recruited in this cross-sectional study. A 6-ml sample of whole blood was taken from the patients, the total RNA was extracted from the samples after the separation of plasma and PBMCs. The HCV-RNA of the samples was amplified by reverse transcriptase-nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nested PCR). The HCV genotypes of the positive samples were tested using the INNO-LiPA HCV II kit, and the HCV genotypes were then confirmed by sequencing of the 5'-UTR fragments after the PCR products were cloned into a pJET1.2/blunt cloning vector. The mean age of the patients was 48.3 +/- 1.76 years (range: 16-83). HCV-RNA was found in PBMCs from 2 (1.9%) of the 104 patients. Genotyping showed that the patients were infected with HCV subtype 1a. One patient suffered non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and the other suffered chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Patients with lymphoproliferative disorders with negative anti-HCV antibodies and negative plasma HCV-RNA may have occult HCV infection. Therefore, in the absence of a liver biopsy, the testing of PBMCs for the detection of genomic HCV-RNA may be beneficial.","['Farahani, Maryam', 'Bokharaei-Salim, Farah', 'Ghane, Masood', 'Basi, Ali', 'Meysami, Parisa', 'Keyvani, Hossein']","['Farahani M', 'Bokharaei-Salim F', 'Ghane M', 'Basi A', 'Meysami P', 'Keyvani H']","['Department of Microbiology, Tehran Medical Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121120,United States,J Med Virol,Journal of medical virology,7705876,,2012/11/22 06:00,2013/05/25 06:00,['2012/11/22 06:00'],"['2012/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jmv.23460 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Virol. 2013 Feb;85(2):235-40. doi: 10.1002/jmv.23460.

The use of conjugates containing widely-known and widely-used bioactive substances is one of the ways to solve this problem. Research into drug binding with macromolecular carrier systems has joined the search for new therapeutic strategies. METHODS: The main goal of this paper is the potential offered by the use of fibrinogen derivatives as an antileukemic drug carrier. Physicochemical properties of the obtained conjugate were analyzed, characterizing alterations in relation to the starting carrier and analyzing biological implications. The intraperitoneally (i.p.) inoculated P388 mouse leukemia model for in vivo studies was used. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Conjugates consisting of a fibrinogen derivative with a covalently bound anticancer drug were developed. Carrier preparation and a conjugate synthesis in aqueous solution were formulated, as well as purification of the conjugate was performed. The study showed that the survival of leukemia mice treated with FH-MTX conjugate was indeed significantly longer than survival in both untreated animals (control) and mice treated with unbound MTX. A significant increase in the antileukemic activity of MTX conjugated with hydrolysed fibrinogen was observed as compared with the unconjugated drug. Reported data suggest that hydrolysed fibrinogen can serve as a carrier molecule for the MTX drug with the aim of enhancing its antileukemic activity. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Conjugates consisting of a fibrinogen derivative with a covalently bound anticancer drug seem to be a promising anticancer drug.","['Goszczynski, Tomasz', 'Nevozhay, Dmitry', 'Wietrzyk, Joanna', 'Omar, Mohamed Salah', 'Boratynski, Janusz']","['Goszczynski T', 'Nevozhay D', 'Wietrzyk J', 'Omar MS', 'Boratynski J']","['""Neolek"" Laboratory of Biomedical Chemistry, Department of Experimental Oncology, Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy, PAS, Rudolf Weigl 12, Wroclaw 53-114, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,,2012/11/22 06:00,2013/06/21 06:00,['2012/11/22 06:00'],"['2012/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/07 00:00 [revised]', '2012/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0304-4165(12)00316-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbagen.2012.11.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2013 Mar;1830(3):2526-30. doi: 10.1016/j.bbagen.2012.11.005.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (fibrinogen-methotrexate conjugate)', '9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Carriers/*pharmacology', 'Fibrinogen/*analogs & derivatives/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,,,,,,,['Biochim Biophys Acta. 2013 Aug;1833(8):4147'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is understood about the role of BCL11B in human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated suppression of the BCL11B was shown to induce apoptosis in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. To further characterize the role of BCL11B in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and assess the safety of siRNA-mediated targeted therapy, the in vitro differentiation and proliferation of CD34(+) cells after BCL11B-siRNA935 treatment were studied. CD34(+) cells were sorted from three cases of umbilical cord blood by the magnetic activated cell sorting technique, and the purity was identified by flow cytometry. BCL11B-siRNA935 was delivered into CD34(+) cells by nucleofection and the BCL11B expression level was analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E), granulocyte/macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM), and megakaryocyte colony-forming units (CFU-Meg) were assessed using BCL11B-siRNA935-treated CD34(+) cells by the methylcellulose semi-solid culture method. The BCL11B expression level in CD34(+) cells was significantly lower than that in Molt-4 cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals. An approximate one-fold reduction in the BCL11B mRNA level was observed 24 hours post-transfection with BCL11B-siRNA935. However, there was no significant difference on the colony formation ability of BFU-E, CFU-GM, and CFU-Meg for CD34(+) cells between the BCL11B-siRNA935-treated and mock-transfected groups (P > 0.05). BCL11B suppression by RNA interference had no significant influence on the differentiation and proliferation of CD34(+) cells. In conclusion, the BCL11B-siRNA935 used in this study may be safe, and BCL11B may be considered a new candidate for targeted gene therapy in T-cell malignancies.","['Shen, Qi', 'Huang, Xin', 'Chen, Si', 'Yang, Lijian', 'Chen, Shaohua', 'Li, Bo', 'Wu, Xiuli', 'Grabarczyk, Piotr', 'Przybylski, Grzegorz K', 'Schmidt, Christian A', 'Li, Yangqiu']","['Shen Q', 'Huang X', 'Chen S', 'Yang L', 'Chen S', 'Li B', 'Wu X', 'Grabarczyk P', 'Przybylski GK', 'Schmidt CA', 'Li Y']","['Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,2012/11/22 06:00,2013/04/26 06:00,['2012/11/22 06:00'],"['2012/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/1024533212Z.000000000145 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2012 Nov;17(6):329-33. doi: 10.1179/1024533212Z.000000000145.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (BCL11B protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA Interference', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In this study, 73 newly diagnosed APL subjects were treated with an ATRA and As(2)O(3) combination treatment in remission induction and post remission therapy. Tumor burden was examined with PCR of the PML-RAR fusion transcripts, and side effects were evaluated by means of clinical examination. RESULTS: The results showed that ATRA/As(2)O(3) combination therapy yielded a CR rate of 94.5% (69/73) with a shorter time to enter CR (median: 27 days; range: 21-43 days). Four cases failed to enter CR; three of these died of cerebral hemorrhage and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) within 72 hours of starting induction therapy, one older patient died of severe pulmonary infection. The early death rate was 5.5% (4/73). All 69 cases that obtained CR remained in good clinical remission after a follow-up of 35-74 months (median: 52 months).The drug toxicity profile with the use of As(2)O(3) showed mainly hepatotoxicity. Liver dysfunction was slight in most cases. There were no severe side effects in long term follow-up. CONCLUSION: We conclude that APL patients may benefit from the use of the combination of ATRA and As(2)O(3) in either remission induction or consolidation/maintenance.","['Pei, Renzhi', 'Cao, Junjie', 'Ma, Junxia', 'Zhang, Pisheng', 'Liu, Xuhui', 'Du, Xiaohong', 'Chen, Dong', 'Sha, Keya', 'Chen, Lieguang', 'Li, Shuangyue', 'Wu, Jingyi', 'Fan, Zhen', 'Lin, Li', 'Ye, Peipei', 'Tang, Shanhao', 'Zhang, Bibo']","['Pei R', 'Cao J', 'Ma J', 'Zhang P', 'Liu X', 'Du X', 'Chen D', 'Sha K', 'Chen L', 'Li S', 'Wu J', 'Fan Z', 'Lin L', 'Ye P', 'Tang S', 'Zhang B']","[""Department of Hematology, Yinzhou People's Hospital, 251 Baizhang Road, Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,2012/11/22 06:00,2013/04/26 06:00,['2012/11/22 06:00'],"['2012/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/102453312X13451850327262 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2012 Nov;17(6):311-6. doi: 10.1179/102453312X13451850327262.,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Oxides/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Extremely elevated serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in cancer patients is a poorly understood phenomenon. The authors report three cases of patients with hematologic malignancies and serial N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP) measurements with values in the range of tens to hundred thousands pg/mL. Through matching NT-proBNP results with clinical, laboratory, echocardiographic and radiologic data, the authors found that these patients demonstrated exaggerated responses to fluid overload. Patients with hematologic malignancies may have higher than expected values of NT-proBNP in response to hypervolemic states.

Little is known about insufficiencies of prolactin (PRL) and TSH, but also lactation failure has been reported in this population. OBJECTIVE: To study the long-term outcome of CRT on PRL and thyroid hormone levels in GHD ALL patients and the prevalence of lactation failure. DESIGN: Case-control study. PATIENTS: We examined 40 GHD and 4 GH insufficient ALL patients, in median 20 years (range: 8-27) after ALL diagnosis and 44 matched population controls. MEASUREMENTS: PRL secretion (area under the curve; AUC) after GHRH-arginine test in all patients and matched controls, and PRL and TSH AUC after a TRH-test in 13 patients and 13 controls. And basal PRL and thyroid hormone levels after 5 years with GH therapy and 8 years without GH therapy. RESULTS: Compared with controls, ALL patients had significantly lower basal and AUC PRL after GHRH-Arginine (P = 0.03, P = 0.02), and AUC PRL after TRH (P = 0.001). After 5 and 8 years, PRL levels decreased further (P = 0.01, P = 0.03), but thyroid hormones remained normal at baseline and at follow-up. PRL insufficiency was significantly associated with increased levels of BMI and insulin. Six out of seven pregnant ALL women reported lactation failure. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term ALL survivors treated with CRT have GHD and PRL insufficiency, and a high prevalence of lactation failure, but thyroid hormones remained normal. PRL insufficiency was associated with cardiovascular risk.","['Follin, Cecilia', 'Link, Katarina', 'Wiebe, Thomas', 'Moell, Christian', 'Bjork, Jonas', 'Erfurth, Eva Marie']","['Follin C', 'Link K', 'Wiebe T', 'Moell C', 'Bjork J', 'Erfurth EM']","['Department of Endocrinology, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden. cecilia.follin@med.lu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130427,England,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf),Clinical endocrinology,0346653,,2012/11/22 06:00,2014/01/07 06:00,['2012/11/22 06:00'],"['2012/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/13 00:00 [revised]', '2012/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cen.12111 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 2013 Jul;79(1):71-8. doi: 10.1111/cen.12111.

Even though high-resolution microarray studies have confirmed the importance of the known recurrent aberrations, i.e. del(11q), trisomy 12, del(13q) and del(17p), and have more precisely delineated the genomic borders of these aberrations, only a few novel aberrations, found at a low frequency, have been detected with these techniques. In contrast to this, the application of NGS technology of the coding genome (exome sequencing) or the entire genome (whole-genome sequencing) has unveiled a number of novel recurrent mutations in e.g. the NOTCH1, SF3B1 and BIRC3 genes. Importantly, mutations in these latter genes were reported to be associated with a particularly poor outcome, similar to TP53 aberrations, and may play key roles in tumor development, treatment resistance and prognosis. In this review, we not only summarize the latest achievements using array-based or NGS technologies, but also point to new directions for research aiming to unravel the complex genetic ""map"" in CLL and its prognostic subsets.","['Gunnarsson, Rebeqa', 'Mansouri, Larry', 'Rosenquist, Richard']","['Gunnarsson R', 'Mansouri L', 'Rosenquist R']","['Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20130228,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,2012/11/22 06:00,2014/02/25 06:00,['2012/11/22 06:00'],"['2012/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2012.751530 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2013 Aug;54(8):1583-90. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2012.751530.

The courses of 124 cases of leukemic ovarian tumors were analyzed with survival durations obtained from authors. Local expansive growth and invasion of contiguous organs similar to epithelial ovarian cancer was seen in both acute myeloid (AML) and lymphoid (ALL) leukemias. Overall, 56% survived 1 year. Tumors at other sites were clinically apparent on presentation in over half the cases without simultaneous marrow relapse, and next relapse was as common in extramedullary sites as in marrow. Leukemic ovarian tumors were generally resistant to chemotherapy, and lengthy survivals were seen most often after complete excision together with systemic therapy. This study documents similar behavior in AML and ALL tumors and that they are rarely isolated to a single ovary. It suggests that scanning could improve our ability to find and eradicate occult tumors which, because of chemoresistance, prevent the cure of leukemia for most patients who develop them.","['Cunningham, Isabel']",['Cunningham I'],"['Division of Hematology Oncology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY 10032, USA. isaheme@aol.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",20121224,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,2012/11/22 06:00,2014/02/11 06:00,['2012/11/22 06:00'],"['2012/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2012.745522 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2013 Jul;54(7):1430-6. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2012.745522.

The aim of this article is to undertake a literature-based review of foscarnet in this therapeutic setting and to align current best-published evidence with recent recommendations presented at the European Conference on Infections in Leukaemia. Ganciclovir remains the mainstay of CMV infection/disease antiviral management protocols. However, approximately a third of patients develop severe neutropenia and others become resistant to ganciclovir, and thus, a reasonably large proportion of patients are not able to receive and/or continue with this medication. Foscarnet is a suitable option as both pre-emptive therapy or for the treatment of active disease in these patients. Randomized trials have demonstrated that foscarnet is equally effective when compared with ganciclovir for pre-emptive treatment of CMV infections: the outcome was comparable with ganciclovir in terms of control of antigenemia and survival rates. There is a paucity of information for its use in the prophylaxis of CMV, although preliminary data show that it was effective in some patients at high risk of CMV reactivation. The main adverse events associated with foscarnet are renal impairment, serum electrolyte and hemoglobin disturbances, seizures and local genital irritation/ulceration. Foscarnet is a well-established antiviral option in immunocompromised patients, and it is usually administered as a second-line option to ganciclovir.

In this cross-sectional study, we investigated patients in Sao Paulo, Brazil with leukaemia to determine the molecular frequency of B19 variants and characterize the viral genetic variability by partial and complete sequencing of the coding of non-structural protein 1 (NS1)/viral capsid proteins 1 and 2 (VP1/VP2). The presence of B19V infections was investigated by PCR amplification of the viral NS1 gene fragment and confirmed by sequencing analysis. The NS1/VP1/VP2 and partially larger gene fragments of the NS1-positive samples were determined by overlapping nested PCR and direct sequencing results. The B19V NS1 was detected in 40 (16%) of 249 bone marrow samples including 12/78 (15.4%) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, 25/155 (16.1%) acute myeloid leukaemia and 3/16 (18.7%) chronic myeloid leukaemia samples. Of the 40 participants, 25 (62.5%) were infected with genotype 1a and 15 (37.5%) with genotype 3b. The phylogenetic analysis of other regions revealed that 12/40 (30%) of the patients with leukaemia were co-infected with genotypes 1a and 3b. In addition, a new B19V intergenotypic recombinant (1a/3b) and an NS1 non-recombinant genotype 1a were detected in one patient. Our findings demonstrated a relatively high prevalence of B19V monoinfections and dual infections and provide, for the first time, evidence of inter-genotypic recombination in adults with leukaemia that may contribute to the genetic diversity of B19V and may also be a source of new emerging viral strains with future implications for diagnosis, therapy and efficient vaccine development.","['da Costa, A C', 'Bendit, I', 'de Oliveira, A C S', 'Kallas, E G', 'Sabino, E C', 'Sanabani, S S']","['da Costa AC', 'Bendit I', 'de Oliveira ACS', 'Kallas EG', 'Sabino EC', 'Sanabani SS']","['Sao Paulo Institute of Tropical Medicine, University of Sao Paulo.

Gelsolin has been found to be down-regulated in several types of human cancers, including leukemias. It is, however, expressed in macrophages, which are the final differentiation derivatives for the monocytic myeloid lineage, implicating this protein in the differentiation process of such cells. In order to investigate the role of gelsolin in leukaemic cell differentiation, stable clones over-expressing ectopic gelsolin, and a control clone were established from U937 leukaemia cells. Unlike the control cells, both gelsolin-overexpressing clones displayed retarded growth, improved monocytic morphology, increased NADPH and NSE activities, and enhanced surface expression of the beta-integrin receptor, CD11b, when compared with the parental U937 cells. Interestingly, RT- PCR and western blot analysis also revealed that gelsolin enhanced p21CIP1 mRNA and protein expression in the overexpressing clones. Moreover, transient transfection with siRNA silencing P21CIP1, but not the control siRNA, resulted in a reduction in monocytic differentiation, accompanied by an increase in proliferation. In conclusion, our work demonstrates that gelsolin, by itself, is capable of inducing monocytic differentiation in U937 leukaemia cells, most probably through p21CIP1 activation.","['Shirkoohi, Reza', 'Fujita, Hisakazu', 'Darmanin, Stephanie', 'Takimoto, Masato']","['Shirkoohi R', 'Fujita H', 'Darmanin S', 'Takimoto M']","['Department of Genetics, Cancer Research Center, Cancer Institute of Iran, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Iran. shirkoohi@tums.ac.ir']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,,2012/11/22 06:00,2013/06/12 06:00,['2012/11/22 06:00'],"['2012/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2012.13.9.4827 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2012;13(9):4827-34. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2012.13.9.4827.,"['0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Gelsolin)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '53-59-8 (NADP)', 'EC 3.1.- (Esterases)']",IM,,"['CD11b Antigen/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*genetics/metabolism', 'Esterases/metabolism', 'Gelsolin/genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Monocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'NADP/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'U937 Cells', 'Up-Regulation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identification of potential biomarkers of EC would be helpful for the detection and monitoring of malignancy, improving clinical outcomes. METHODS: The Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis method was used to identify prognostic markers for EC in this study. Moreover, underlying molecular mechanisms were characterized by KEGG pathway enrichment and transcriptional regulation analyses. RESULTS: Seven gene co-expression modules were obtained, but only the turquoise module was positively related with EC stage. Among the genes in the turquoise module, COL5A2 (collagen, type V, alpha 2) could be regulated by PBX (pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 1)1/2 and HOXB1(homeobox B1) transcription factors to be involved in the focal adhesion pathway; CENP-E (centromere protein E, 312kDa) by E2F4 (E2F transcription factor 4, p107/p130-binding); MYCN (v-myc myelocytomatosis viral related oncogene, neuroblastoma derived [avian]) by PAX5 (paired box 5); and BCL-2 (B-cell CLL/ lymphoma 2) and IGFBP-6 (insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6) by GLI1. They were predicted to be associated with EC progression via Hedgehog signaling and other cancer related-pathways.

P53 in its transcriptionally active form is capable of activating distinct target genes that contribute to either apoptosis or growth arrest, like P21. However, the MDM2 gene is a major negative regulator of P53. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in codon Arg72Pro of P53 results in impairment of the tumor suppressor activity of the gene. A similar effect is caused by a SNP in codon 31 of P21. In contrast, a SNP in position 309 of MDM2 results in increased expression due to substitution of thymine by guanine. All three polymorphisms have been associated with increased risk of tumorigenesis. AIM OF THE STUDY: We aimed to study the prevalence of SNPs in the P53 pathway involving the three genes, P53, P21 and MDM2, among acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and to compare it to apparently normal healthy controls for assessment of impact on risk. RESULTS: We found that the P21 ser31arg heterozygous polymorphism increases the risk of AML (P value=0.017, OR=2.946, 95% CI=1.216-7.134). Although the MDM2 309G allele was itself without affect, it showed a synergistic effect with P21 ser/arg polymorphism (P value=0.003, OR= 6.807, 95% CI= 1.909-24.629). However, the MDM2 309T allele abolish risk effect of the P21 polymorphic allele (P value= 0.71). There is no significant association of P53 arg72pro polymorphism on the risk of AML. CONCLUSION: We suggest that SNPs in the P53 pathway, especially the P21 ser31arg polymorphism and combined polymorphisms especially the P21/ MDM2 might be genetic susceptibility factors in the pathogenesis of AML.","['Ebid, Gamal T', 'Sedhom, Iman A', 'El-Gammal, Mosaad M', 'Moneer, Manar M']","['Ebid GT', 'Sedhom IA', 'El-Gammal MM', 'Moneer MM']","['Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University. gamalthabet@gmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,,2012/11/22 06:00,2013/06/12 06:00,['2012/11/22 06:00'],"['2012/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2012.13.9.4315 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2012;13(9):4315-20. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2012.13.9.4315.,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The prognosis is poor in general for many reasons. One is the presence of leukaemia-specific recognition markers such as FLT3 (fms-like tyrosine kinase 3). Another name of FLT3 is stem cell tyrosine kinase-1 (STK1), which is known to take part in proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of hematopoietic cells, usually being present on haemopoietic progenitor cells in the bone marrow. FLT3 act as an independent prognostic factor for AML.

The CFLAR gene is expressed as long and short splice forms encoding the anti-apoptotic proteins c-FLIP(L) and c-FLIP(S) (CFLAR(L) and CFLAR(S) , respectively) that play important roles in drug resistance. In univariate analyses of CFLAR mRNA expression in adult AML patients, those individuals with higher than median mRNA expression of the long splice form CFLAR(L) (but not the short splice form) had significantly lower 3 year overall survival (P = 0.04) compared to those with low expression. In cell line studies, simultaneous down-regulation of c-FLIP(L) and c-FLIP(S) proteins using siRNA induced apoptosis in U937 and NB-4 AML cells, but not K562 or OCI-AML3 cells. However, dual c-FLIP(L/S) downregulation sensitized all four cell lines to apoptosis induced by recombinant tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (rTRAIL). Moreover, specific downregulation of c-FLIP(L) was found to recapitulate the phenotypic effects of dual c-FLIP(L/S) downregulation. The histone deacetylase (HDAC)1/2/3/6 inhibitor Vorinostat was found to potently down-regulate c-FLIP(L) expression by transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms and to sensitize AML cells to rTRAIL. Further analyses using more selective HDAC inhibitors revealed that HDAC6 inhibition was not required for c-FLIP(L) down-regulation. These results suggest that c-FLIP(L) may have clinical relevance both as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for HDAC inhibitors in AML although this requires further study.","['McLornan, Donal', 'Hay, Jodie', 'McLaughlin, Kirsty', 'Holohan, Caitriona', 'Burnett, Alan K', 'Hills, Robert K', 'Johnston, Patrick G', 'Mills, Ken I', 'McMullin, Mary Frances', 'Longley, Daniel B', 'Gilkes, Amanda']","['McLornan D', 'Hay J', 'McLaughlin K', 'Holohan C', 'Burnett AK', 'Hills RK', 'Johnston PG', 'Mills KI', 'McMullin MF', 'Longley DB', 'Gilkes A']","[""Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, Northern Ireland, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121120,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,2012/11/22 06:00,2013/03/21 06:00,['2012/11/22 06:00'],"['2012/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.12108 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2013 Jan;160(2):188-98. doi: 10.1111/bjh.12108.

In this study, we synthesized a series of spirooxindole derivatives (SOID-1 to SOID-12) and evaluated their antitumor effects on melanoma. Among the 12 spirooxindole derivatives, SOID-8 showed the strongest antitumor activity by viability screening. SOID-8 inhibited viability of A2058, A375, SK-MEL-5 and SK-MEL-28 human melanoma cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. SOID-8 also induced apoptosis of these tumor cells, which was confirmed by positive Annexin V staining and an increase of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. The antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1, a member of the Bcl-2 family, was downregulated and correlated with SOID-8 induced apoptosis. In addition, SOID-8 reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of Signal Tansducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) in both dose- and time-dependent manners. This inhibition was associated with decreased levels of phosphorylation of Janus-activated kinase-2 (JAK2), an upstream kinase that mediates STAT3 phosphorylation at Tyr705. Accordingly, SOID-8 inhibited IL-6-induced activation of STAT3 and JAK2 in melanoma cells. Finally, SOID-8 suppressed melanoma tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model, accompanied with a decrease of phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3. Our results indicate that the antitumor activity of SOID-8 is at least partially due to inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 signaling in melanoma cells. These findings suggest that the spirooxindole derivative SOID-8 is a promising lead compound for further development of new preventive and therapeutic agents for melanoma.","['Tian, Yan', 'Nam, Sangkil', 'Liu, Lucy', 'Yakushijin, Fumiko', 'Yakushijin, Kenichi', 'Buettner, Ralf', 'Liang, Wei', 'Yang, Fan', 'Ma, Yuelong', 'Horne, David', 'Jove, Richard']","['Tian Y', 'Nam S', 'Liu L', 'Yakushijin F', 'Yakushijin K', 'Buettner R', 'Liang W', 'Yang F', 'Ma Y', 'Horne D', 'Jove R']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20121116,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC3500295,2012/11/21 06:00,2013/05/07 06:00,['2012/11/21 06:00'],"['2012/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0049306 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-21055 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(11):e49306. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0049306.

Continuous-infusion doxorubicin, compared with bolus-infusion, reduces early cardiotoxicity in adults. Its effectiveness in reducing late cardiotoxicity in children remains uncertain. We determined continuous-infusion doxorubicin cardioprotective efficacy in long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: The Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium Protocol 91-01 enrolled pediatric patients between 1991 and 1995. Newly diagnosed high-risk patients were randomly assigned to receive a total of 360 mg/m(2) of doxorubicin in 30 mg/m(2) doses every 3 weeks, by either continuous (over 48 hours) or bolus-infusion (within 15 minutes). Echocardiograms at baseline, during, and after doxorubicin therapy were blindly remeasured centrally. Primary outcomes were late left ventricular (LV) structure and function. RESULTS: A total of 102 children were randomized to each treatment group. We analyzed 484 serial echocardiograms from 92 patients (n = 49 continuous; n = 43 bolus) with >/=1 echocardiogram >/=3 years after assignment. Both groups had similar demographics and normal baseline LV characteristics. Cardiac follow-up after randomization (median, 8 years) showed changes from baseline within the randomized groups (depressed systolic function, systolic dilation, reduced wall thickness, and reduced mass) at 3, 6, and 8 years; there were no statistically significant differences between randomized groups. Ten-year ALL event-free survival rates did not differ between the 2 groups (continuous-infusion, 83% versus bolus-infusion, 78%; P = .24). CONCLUSIONS: In survivors of childhood high-risk ALL, continuous-infusion doxorubicin, compared with bolus-infusion, provided no long-term cardioprotection or improvement in ALL event-free survival, hence provided no benefit over bolus-infusion.","['Lipshultz, Steven E', 'Miller, Tracie L', 'Lipsitz, Stuart R', 'Neuberg, Donna S', 'Dahlberg, Suzanne E', 'Colan, Steven D', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Henkel, Jacqueline M', 'Franco, Vivian I', 'Cushman, Laura L', 'Asselin, Barbara L', 'Clavell, Luis A', 'Athale, Uma', 'Michon, Bruno', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Schorin, Marshall A', 'Larsen, Eric', 'Usmani, Naheed', 'Sallan, Stephen E']","['Lipshultz SE', 'Miller TL', 'Lipsitz SR', 'Neuberg DS', 'Dahlberg SE', 'Colan SD', 'Silverman LB', 'Henkel JM', 'Franco VI', 'Cushman LL', 'Asselin BL', 'Clavell LA', 'Athale U', 'Michon B', 'Laverdiere C', 'Schorin MA', 'Larsen E', 'Usmani N', 'Sallan SE']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33101. slipshultz@med.miami.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121119,United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,PMC3507254,2012/11/21 06:00,2013/02/05 06:00,['2012/11/21 06:00'],"['2012/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['peds.2012-0727 [pii]', '10.1542/peds.2012-0727 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 2012 Dec;130(6):1003-11. doi: 10.1542/peds.2012-0727.

Specifically, (R)-TEMOSPho induces cell cycle arrest, cell size increase and polyploidization from K562 and HEL cells, which are used extensively to model megakaryocytic differentiation. In addition, megakaryocyte-specific cell surface markers showed a dramatic increase in expression in response to (R)-TEMOSPho treatment. Importantly, we demonstrated that such megakaryocytic differentiation can also be induced from primary human CD34(+) haematopoietic stem cells. Activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway and, to a lesser extent, the MEK-ERK pathway appears to be required for this process, as blocking with specific inhibitors interferes with the differentiation of K562 cells. A subset of (R)-TEMOSPho-treated K562 cells undergoes spontaneous apoptosis and produces platelets that are apparently functional, as they bind to fibrinogen, express P-selectin and aggregate in response to SFLLRN and AYPGFK, the activating peptides for the PAR1 and PAR4 receptors, respectively. Taken together, these results indicate that (R)-TEMOSPho will be useful for dissecting the molecular mechanisms of megakaryocytic differentiation, and that this class of compounds represents potential therapeutic reagents for thrombocytopenia.","['Limb, Jin-Kyung', 'Song, Doona', 'Jeon, Mijeong', 'Han, So-Yeop', 'Han, Gyoonhee', 'Jhon, Gil-Ja', 'Bae, Yun Soo', 'Kim, Jaesang']","['Limb JK', 'Song D', 'Jeon M', 'Han SY', 'Han G', 'Jhon GJ', 'Bae YS', 'Kim J']","['Division of Life and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Centre for Cell Signalling and Drug Discovery Research, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Chemistry and Division of Nano Sciences, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121120,England,J Tissue Eng Regen Med,Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine,101308490,,2012/11/21 06:00,2016/03/11 06:00,['2012/11/21 06:00'],"['2011/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/12 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/term.1628 [doi]'],ppublish,J Tissue Eng Regen Med. 2015 Apr;9(4):435-46. doi: 10.1002/term.1628.

This study examined survival after relapse for children with ALL in Central America. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed and included children with first relapse of ALL in Guatemala, Honduras, or El Salvador between 1990 and 2011. Predictors of subsequent event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were examined. RESULTS: There were 755 children identified with relapsed disease. The median time from diagnosis to relapse was 1.7 years (interquartile range, 0.8-3.1 years). Most relapses occurred during (53.9%) or following (24.9%) maintenance chemotherapy, and the majority occurred in the bone marrow (63.1%). Following the initial relapse, subsequent 3-year EFS (+/- standard error) and OS were 22.0% +/- 1.7%, and 28.2% +/- 1.9%, respectively. In multivariable analysis, worse postrelapse survival was associated with age >/= 10 years, white blood cell count >/= 50 x 10(9) /L, and positive central nervous system status at the original ALL diagnosis, relapse that was not isolated central nervous system or testicular, and relapse < 36 months following diagnosis. Site and time to relapse were used to identify a favorable risk group whose 3-year EFS and OS were 50.0% +/- 8.9% and 68.0% +/- 8.1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Prognosis after relapsed ALL in Central America is poor, but a substantial number of those with favorable risk features have prolonged survival, despite lack of access to stem cell transplantation. Stratification by risk factors can guide therapeutic decision-making. Cancer 2013.

However, their ability to repair the ischemic heart remains unknown. We investigated the therapeutic potential of human pericytes, purified from skeletal muscle, for treating ischemic heart disease and mediating associated repair mechanisms in mice. Echocardiography revealed that pericyte transplantation attenuated left ventricular dilatation and significantly improved cardiac contractility, superior to CD56+ myogenic progenitor transplantation, in acutely infarcted mouse hearts. Pericyte treatment substantially reduced myocardial fibrosis and significantly diminished infiltration of host inflammatory cells at the infarct site. Hypoxic pericyte-conditioned medium suppressed murine fibroblast proliferation and inhibited macrophage proliferation in vitro. High expression by pericytes of immunoregulatory molecules, including interleukin-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, cyclooxygenase-2, and heme oxygenase-1, was sustained under hypoxia, except for monocyte chemotactic protein-1. Host angiogenesis was significantly increased. Pericytes supported microvascular structures in vivo and formed capillary-like networks with/without endothelial cells in three-dimensional cocultures. Under hypoxia, pericytes dramatically increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-A, platelet-derived growth factor-beta, transforming growth factor-beta1 and corresponding receptors while expression of basic fibroblast growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and angiopoietin-1 was repressed. The capacity of pericytes to differentiate into and/or fuse with cardiac cells was revealed by green fluorescence protein labeling, although to a minor extent. In conclusion, intramyocardial transplantation of purified human pericytes promotes functional and structural recovery, attributable to multiple mechanisms involving paracrine effects and cellular interactions.","['Chen, Chien-Wen', 'Okada, Masaho', 'Proto, Jonathan D', 'Gao, Xueqin', 'Sekiya, Naosumi', 'Beckman, Sarah A', 'Corselli, Mirko', 'Crisan, Mihaela', 'Saparov, Arman', 'Tobita, Kimimasa', 'Peault, Bruno', 'Huard, Johnny']","['Chen CW', 'Okada M', 'Proto JD', 'Gao X', 'Sekiya N', 'Beckman SA', 'Corselli M', 'Crisan M', 'Saparov A', 'Tobita K', 'Peault B', 'Huard J']","['Department of Bioengineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,PMC3572307,2012/11/21 06:00,2013/07/19 06:00,['2012/11/21 06:00'],"['2012/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.1285 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2013 Feb;31(2):305-16. doi: 10.1002/stem.1285.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Ccl2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (vascular endothelial growth factor A, mouse)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Hmox1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.14.99.- (Ptgs2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/metabolism', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Chemokine CCL2/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Fibrosis/prevention & control', 'Gene Expression', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myocardial Infarction/diagnostic imaging/genetics/*pathology/*therapy', 'Myocardium/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic', 'Pericytes/physiology/*transplantation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis/genetics/metabolism', 'Regeneration/physiology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Ultrasonography', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/genetics/metabolism']",,,,['Copyright (c) 2012 AlphaMed Press.'],"['P30 AG024827/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'G1000816/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'R01 AR049684/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21HL083057/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 HL083057/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AR49684/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS425698'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As preemptive therapy might be efficacious if administered early post transplant, we set out to determine whether cGVHD can be predicted from the serum level of a biomarker on day 7 or 28. In a discovery cohort of 153 HCT recipients conditioned with BU, fludarabine and rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG), we determined serum levels of B-cell-activating factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, soluble TNF-alpha receptor 1, soluble IL2 receptor alpha, IL5, IL6, IL7, IL15, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, cholinesterase, total protein, urea and ATG. Patients with low levels of IL15 (<30.6 ng/L) on day 7 had 2.7-fold higher likelihood of developing significant cGVHD (needing systemic immunosuppressive therapy) than patients with higher IL15 levels (P<0.001). This was validated in a validation cohort of 105 similarly-treated patients; those with low IL15 levels had 3.7-fold higher likelihood of developing significant cGVHD (P=0.001). Low IL15 was not associated with relapse; it trended to be associated with acute GVHD and was associated with low infection rates. In conclusion, low IL15 levels on day 7 are predictive of cGVHD, and thus could be useful in guiding preemptive therapy.","['Pratt, L M', 'Liu, Y', 'Ugarte-Torres, A', 'Hoegh-Petersen, M', 'Podgorny, P J', 'Lyon, A W', 'Williamson, T S', 'Khan, F M', 'Chaudhry, M A', 'Daly, A', 'Stewart, D A', 'Russell, J A', 'Grigg, A', 'Ritchie, D', 'Storek, J']","['Pratt LM', 'Liu Y', 'Ugarte-Torres A', 'Hoegh-Petersen M', 'Podgorny PJ', 'Lyon AW', 'Williamson TS', 'Khan FM', 'Chaudhry MA', 'Daly A', 'Stewart DA', 'Russell JA', 'Grigg A', 'Ritchie D', 'Storek J']","['Department of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121119,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,2012/11/21 06:00,2014/05/07 06:00,['2012/11/21 06:00'],"['2012/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/07 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt2012210 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2012.210 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2013 May;48(5):722-8. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2012.210.

Data from 13 studies including 2962 patients, excluding Philadelphia chromosome-positive patients, showed a survival benefit for having a matched sibling donor for patients < 35 years of age (OR = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.70-0.90, P = .0003) but not for those >/= 35 years of age (OR = 1.01; 95% CI, 0.85-1.19, P = .9; heterogeneity P = .03) because of the higher absolute risk of nonrelapse mortality for older patients.

The limited success with free antisense ONs in hematologic malignancies in recent clinical trials has been attributed to the CpG motif-mediated, TLR-induced prosurvival effects and inefficient target modulation in desired cells. In an attempt to diminish their off-target prosurvival and proinflammatory effects and specific delivery, as a proof of principle, in the present study, we developed an Ab-targeted liposomal delivery strategy using a clinically relevant CD20 Ab (rituximab)-conjugated lipopolyplex nanoparticle (RIT-INP)- and Bcl-2-targeted antisense G3139 as archetypical antisense therapeutics. The adverse immunostimulatory responses were abrogated by selective B cell-targeted delivery and early endosomal compartmentalization of G3139-encapsulated RIT-INPs, resulting in reduced NF-kappaB activation, robust Bcl-2 down-regulation, and enhanced sensitivity to fludarabine-induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, significant in vivo therapeutic efficacy was noted after RIT-INP-G3139 administration in a disseminated xenograft leukemia model. The results of the present study demonstrate that CD20-targeted delivery overcomes the immunostimulatory properties of CpG-containing ON therapeutics and improves efficient gene silencing and in vivo therapeutic efficacy for B-cell malignancies. The broader implications of similar approaches in overcoming immunostimulatory properties of RNA-directed therapeutics in hematologic malignancies are also discussed.","['Yu, Bo', 'Mao, Yicheng', 'Bai, Li-Yuan', 'Herman, Sarah E M', 'Wang, Xinmei', 'Ramanunni, Asha', 'Jin, Yan', 'Mo, Xiaokui', 'Cheney, Carolyn', 'Chan, Kenneth K', 'Jarjoura, David', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Lee, Robert J', 'Byrd, John C', 'Lee, L James', 'Muthusamy, Natarajan']","['Yu B', 'Mao Y', 'Bai LY', 'Herman SE', 'Wang X', 'Ramanunni A', 'Jin Y', 'Mo X', 'Cheney C', 'Chan KK', 'Jarjoura D', 'Marcucci G', 'Lee RJ', 'Byrd JC', 'Lee LJ', 'Muthusamy N']","['Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20121119,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC3538326,2012/11/21 06:00,2013/02/26 06:00,['2012/11/21 06:00'],"['2012/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47332-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-01-407742 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Jan 3;121(1):136-47. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-01-407742.

Approximately 90% of Ewing sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) have a specific translocation, t(11;22) (q24;q12). The EWS-friend leukemia integration-1 (FLI-1) fusion results in FLI-1 overexpression. EWS/FLI-1 rearrangement has been suggested as a useful tool in the diagnosis of PCES/PNET. In contrast, Merkel cell polyomavirus was found to be an infective agent related to the pathogenesis of MCC. Merkel cell polyomavirus can be immunohistochemically detected with the antibody CM2B4. To the best of our knowledge, there is no case of any cytokeratin (CK)20-/CM2B4+ PNET. The goal of our study was to investigate whether EWS/FLI-1 rearrangement was present in cases of MCC. We have studied 18 cases of MCC. To make sure that the cases investigated by fluorescent in situ hybridization were genuine MCC, we considered only CK20+/CM2B4+ cases. Six cases met this criterion. EWS/FLI-1 rearrangement was not evidenced in any of the 18 cases (including the 6 ""genuine"" cases of MCC).

The purpose of our research is to understand the molecular program of tumor reversion and its clinical application. We first established biological models of reversion, which was done by deriving revertant cells from different tumors. Secondly, the molecular program that could override the malignant phenotype was assessed. Differential gene-expression profiling showed that at least 300 genes are implicated in this reversion process such as SIAH-1, PS1, TSAP6, and, most importantly, translationally controlled tumor protein (TPT1/TCTP). Decreasing TPT1/TCTP is key in reprogramming malignant cells, including cancer stem cells. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent findings indicate that TPT1/TCTP regulates the P53-MDM2-Numb axis. Notably, TPT1/TCTP and p53 are implicated in a reciprocal negative-feedback loop. TPT1/TCTP is a highly significant prognostic factor in breast cancer. Sertraline and thioridazine interfere with this repressive feedback by targeting directly TPT1/TCTP and inhibiting its binding to MDM2, restoring wildtype p53 function. Combining sertraline with classical drugs such as Ara-C in acute myeloid leukemia may be also beneficial. SUMMARY: In this review, we discuss some of these reversion pathways and how this approach could open a new route to cancer treatment.","['Amson, Robert', 'Karp, Judith E', 'Telerman, Adam']","['Amson R', 'Karp JE', 'Telerman A']","['CNRS-UMR 8113, LBPA, Ecole Normale Superieure, Cachan, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,,2012/11/21 06:00,2013/05/11 06:00,['2012/11/21 06:00'],"['2012/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CCO.0b013e32835b7d21 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2013 Jan;25(1):59-65. doi: 10.1097/CCO.0b013e32835b7d21.,"['0 (Antidepressive Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antipsychotic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (TPT1 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Protein, Translationally-Controlled 1)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,,"['Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/therapy', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Tumor Protein, Translationally-Controlled 1', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics/metabolism']",,,,,['2P30 CA06973-47/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this work was to compare the wild-type proviral pX(BLV) region at different stages of BLV natural infected cattle from Argentine Holstein. Pairs of primers were designed to amplify the proviral pX region of 12 cattle by PCR, and products were then sequenced, aligned and compared both with each other and with the reference sequence.

Thus, African swine fever virus (ASFV), as an acute and persistent virus in pigs, is predicted to have evolved multiple genes for the manipulation and evasion of interferon. Although, ASFV is known to interfere with signaling pathways controlling the transcription of cytokines, surprisingly no individual virus gene manipulating the induction or impact of IFN has been described. Since an initial bioinformatics search of the ASFV genome failed to identify potential antagonists of the IFN response, our strategy was to functionally screen early expressed, ""unassigned"" ASFV genes without existing homologies, particularly from MGFs 360 and 530, in luciferase reporter assays for their inhibition of the induction and impact of IFN. Specifically, we used reporter plasmids containing the luciferase gene under the control of: (1) the IFN-beta promoter, to screen for inhibition of induction of type I IFN stimulated by the addition of Poly(I:C); (2) the ISRE DNA elements, to screen for the inhibition of the impact of type I IFN; and (3) the GAS DNA elements to screen for the inhibition of the impact of type II IFN. Our initial experiments revealed six ASFV genes inhibiting one or more of the three luciferase assays. From these, we have selected a total of 3 genes for presentation. The ASFV A276R gene from MGF360 inhibited the induction of IFN-beta via both the TLR3 and the cytosolic pathways, targeting IRF3, but not IRF7 or NF-kappaB. The ASFV A528R inhibited the induction of both NF-kappaB and IRF3 branches of the type I IFN induction signaling pathway and the impact of IFN response via both IFN type I and type II stimulation. The ASFV I329L gene is a functional viral TLR3 homologue inhibiting the induction of IFN at the level of TRIF. Thus, these genes reduce the IFN response by targeting different intracellular signaling intermediates. Their deletion from wild type virus may strengthen the host interferon response and so provide an attenuated form with more restricted virus spread after the initial infection, perhaps ""buying"" sufficient time to allow the development of a protective adaptive immune response. The demonstration of multiple ASFV genes for the evasion of IFN responses will demand technology to construct viruses with multiple gene deletions. An alternative would be a multigene DNA vaccine. Finally, our work clearly demonstrates that unassigned viral genes may be viewed as a repository of host evasion strategies, only identifiable through functional assays. These may be considered to be ""ready-made tools"" for the experimental manipulation of cell biology and immune responses in health and disease and, as proof of concept, we have constructed a T-cell restricted transgenic mouse expressing the ASFV gene A238L, a dual inhibitor of NF-kappaB and NFAT activation. The resulting T cell restricted A238L transgenic mice developed a lymphoma with a phenotype reminiscent of some acute lymphoblastic lymphomas. In contrast, transgenic mice similarly expressing a mutant A238L solely inhibiting transcription mediated by NF-kappaB were indistinguishable from wild type mice, suggesting a transgene-NFAT-dependent transformation. Elucidation of the molecular events associated with the development of this virus host evasion molecule induced tumor may clarify some mechanisms of tumorigenesis in general, and in the development of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in particular.","['Correia, Silvia', 'Ventura, Sonia', 'Parkhouse, Robert Michael']","['Correia S', 'Ventura S', 'Parkhouse RM']","['Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciencia, Oeiras 2781-901, Portugal. scorreia@igc.gulbenkian.pt']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20121116,Netherlands,Virus Res,Virus research,8410979,,2012/11/21 06:00,2013/09/11 06:00,['2012/11/21 06:00'],"['2012/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/09 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0168-1702(12)00402-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virusres.2012.10.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Virus Res. 2013 Apr;173(1):87-100. doi: 10.1016/j.virusres.2012.10.013.

We studied outcome of alloSCT in chromosome 7 abnormal MDS patients as this data are scarce in literature. We specifically focused on the impact of the extra presence of CK and monosomal karyotype (MK). The European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation database contained data on 277 adult MDS patients with a chromosome 7 abnormality treated with alloSCT. Median age at alloSCT was 45 years. Median follow-up of patients alive was 5 years. Five-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 22% and 28%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, statistically significant predictors for worse PFS were higher MDS stages treated, but not in complete remission (CR) (hazards ratio (HR) 1.7), and the presence of CK (HR 1.5) or MK (HR 1.8). Negative predictive factors for OS were higher MDS stages treated, but not in CR (HR 1.8), and the presence of CK (HR 1.6) or MK (HR 1.7). By means of the cross-validated log partial likelihood, MK showed to have a better predictive value than CK.

Little knowledge about the role of SQS in the prevention and treatment of cancer is available. Recent studies have shown that SQS possesses potent anti-tumor activities in human leukemia Jurkat cells and human hepatoma HepG2 cells. However, research on the effects and mechanisms of SQS on the treatment of breast cancer, a major cause of mortality in women worldwide, is not available. In this work, the effects of SQS on cell growth characteristics, including proliferation, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis, in MCF-7 cells were investigated. SQS reduced the viability of MCF-7 cells, induced G1 phase arrest in the cell cycle, and triggered the apoptosis of MCF-7 cells. Stimulation of MCF-7 with SQS induced upregulation of p21 and downregulation of cyclin D1, which can cause G1 cell cycle arrest. Stimulation also induced activation of E2F1 and downregulation of p53, indicating that SQS induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via a p53-independent pathway; p53-independent apoptosis may be mediated by E2F1 activation. Our results demonstrate the potential application of SQS as an anti-breast cancer agent.","['Chen, Linyan', 'Chen, Jing', 'Xu, Hanhong']","['Chen L', 'Chen J', 'Xu H']","['Key Laboratory of Natural Pesticide and Chemical Biology, Ministry of Education, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121116,Netherlands,Fitoterapia,Fitoterapia,16930290R,,2012/11/21 06:00,2013/07/28 06:00,['2012/11/21 06:00'],"['2012/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/09 00:00 [revised]', '2012/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0367-326X(12)00302-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.fitote.2012.11.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Fitoterapia. 2013 Jan;84:123-9. doi: 10.1016/j.fitote.2012.11.009.

Thus, in order to understand how emerging approaches to drug development might aid the creation of new therapeutic combinations, it is critical to understand the defining principles underlying classic combination therapy and the original experimental rationales behind them. One such principle is that the use of combination therapies with independent mechanisms of action can minimize the evolution of drug resistance. Another is that in order to kill sufficient cancer cells to cure a patient, multiple drugs must be delivered at their maximum tolerated dose - a condition that allows for enhanced cancer cell killing with manageable toxicity. In light of these models, we aim to explore recent genomic evidence underlying the mechanisms of resistance to the combination regimens constructed on these principles. Interestingly, we find that emerging genomic evidence contradicts some of the rationales of early practitioners in developing commonly used drug regimens. However, we also find that the addition of recent targeted therapies has yet to change the current principles underlying the construction of anti-cancer combinatorial regimens, nor have they made substantial inroads into the treatment of most cancers. We suggest that emerging systems/network biology approaches have an immense opportunity to impact the rational development of successful drug regimens. Specifically, by examining drug combinations in multivariate ways, next generation combination therapies can be constructed with a clear understanding of how mechanisms of resistance to multi-drug regimens differ from single agent resistance.","['Pritchard, Justin R', 'Lauffenburger, Douglas A', 'Hemann, Michael T']","['Pritchard JR', 'Lauffenburger DA', 'Hemann MT']","['Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20121117,Scotland,Drug Resist Updat,Drug resistance updates : reviews and commentaries in antimicrobial and anticancer chemotherapy,9815369,PMC3975170,2012/11/21 06:00,2013/05/11 06:00,['2012/11/21 06:00'],"['2012/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/01 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S1368-7646(12)00057-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.drup.2012.10.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Drug Resist Updat. 2012 Oct;15(5-6):249-57. doi: 10.1016/j.drup.2012.10.003.

Here we report the interaction of TOP2A with ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and its phosphorylation in an ATM-dependent manner after DNA damage. In vitro kinase assay and site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed that serine 1512 is the target of phosphorylation through ATM. Serine 1512 to Alanine mutation of TOP2A showed increased stability of the protein, retaining TOP2A activity at least with regard to cell survival activity. Ataxia telangiectasia-derived cell lines showed high levels of TOP2A that were associated with hypersensitivity to the TOP2 inhibitor etoposide. These findings suggest that ATM-dependent TOP2A modification is required for proper regulation of TOP2 stability and subsequently of the sensitivity to TOP2 inhibitor. In a lymphoblastoid cell line derived from a patient who developed MLL rearrangement, positive infant leukemia, defective ATM expression, and increased TOP2A expression were shown. It was intriguing that hypersensitivity to TOP2 inhibitor and susceptibility to MLL gene rearrangement were shown by low-dose etoposide exposure in this cell line. Thus, our findings have clinically important implications for the pathogenesis of infantile acute leukemia as well as treatment-associated secondary leukemia following exposure to TOP2 inhibitors.","['Tamaichi, Hiroyuki', 'Sato, Masaki', 'Porter, Andrew C G', 'Shimizu, Toshiaki', 'Mizutani, Shuki', 'Takagi, Masatoshi']","['Tamaichi H', 'Sato M', 'Porter AC', 'Shimizu T', 'Mizutani S', 'Takagi M']","['Department of Pediatrics and Developmental Biology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20130113,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,PMC7657118,2012/11/21 06:00,2013/07/03 06:00,['2012/11/21 06:00'],"['2012/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/14 00:00 [revised]', '2012/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cas.12067 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2013 Feb;104(2):178-84. doi: 10.1111/cas.12067.

It is characterised by a chronic exudative eczematous eruption and persistent infection with Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and beta-haemolytic streptococci (BHS). Prevalence is highest in the Caribbean and Brazil; however, cases have been reported in other HTLV-1 endemic regions. Approximately 20 million people worldwide are infected with HTLV-1 and only 5-10% suffer from disease. Other manifestations include adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (TSP/HAM). HAID may also progress to ATLL or TSP/HAM. Treatment options are limited to prolonged antibiotic therapy. The aim of this paper is to review existing evidence and propose new theories on the pathogenesis of HAID. The current view is that HTLV-1 infection is required and in susceptible individuals leads to immune dysregulation with subsequent immunosuppression and superinfection with SA and BHS. Evidence suggests that host, environment and genetic factors may play a causative role. Genetic factors within ethnic groups determine host immune response and carrier state or disease manifestation of HTLV-1 infection. Increased IgE levels may contribute to the SA and BHS superinfection in HAID.

One of the most often cited examples in this context is thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) polymorphism. TPMT is a phase 2 detoxification enzyme that catalyzes the S-methylation of thiopurine drugs such as thioguanine and 6-mercaptopurine. Approximately 11% of the Caucasian population carry a heterozygous deficiency of this enzyme causing intermediate enzyme activity, whereas 0.3% show a homozygous deficiency. In both cases, severe myelosuppression can develop upon treatment with thiopurines. These are commonly used in the treatment of leukemia. Therefore, genotyping of patients before treatment is absolutely necessary. Development of a fast and reliable real-time PCR application for TPMT genotyping would greatly improve thiopurine treatment regimens and allow the avoidance of adverse drug reactions. METHODS: Blood was obtained from a Caucasian cohort of 143 individuals. After extraction of DNA, all samples were genotyped for TPMT polymorphisms *2, *3A, *3B, and *3C by real-time PCR as well as by PCR-RFLP as the reference method, in order to validate the new method. RESULTS: Four different genotypes were found in the population studied. Of the 143 individuals investigated, 1 was heterozygous for TPMT*2 (0.70%), 2 were heterozygous for TPMT*3B (1.40%), and 8 heterozygous for TPMT-*3C (5.60%). No homozygous genotype could be identified. In total, 7.7% of the individuals carried mutations. Results from the newly developed real-time PCR were 100% concordant with those obtained using standard PCR-RFLP analysis, leading to 100% sensitivity and specificity. The hands-on time is approximately one third of the time needed for standard PCR-RFLP methods. CONCLUSIONS: A new high-throughput genotyping method could be successfully established and optimised for the commonly found mutant alleles TPMT*2 (G238C), TPMT*3A (G460A and A719G), TPMT*3B (G460A), and TPMT*3C (A719G) via real-time PCR on the LightCycler (Roche) instrument and using the standard PCR-RFLP as reference method.","['Lorenz, Marion', 'Weise, Alexander', 'Prause, Stefan', 'Klemm, Marco', 'Eidens, Moritz', 'Luchi, Massimiliano', 'Forst, Thomas', 'Pfutzner, Andreas', 'Weber, Matthias M']","['Lorenz M', 'Weise A', 'Prause S', 'Klemm M', 'Eidens M', 'Luchi M', 'Forst T', 'Pfutzner A', 'Weber MM']","['Institute for Clinical Research and Development (IKFE) GmbH, Mainz, Germany. marion.lorenz@pharmgenomics.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",,Germany,Clin Lab,Clinical laboratory,9705611,,2012/11/21 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/11/21 06:00'],"['2012/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Clin Lab. 2012;58(9-10):959-71.,"['EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)']",IM,,"['Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', '*Genotype', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays/*methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', '*Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between maternal exposure to tobacco smoking during pregnancy and early age (<2 year) leukemia (EAL). METHODS: A hospital-based multicenter case-control study aiming to explore EAL risk factors was carried out in Brazil during 1999-2007. Data were collected by direct interview with the biological mothers using a standardized questionnaire. The present study included 675 children (193 acute lymphoid leukemia - ALL, 59 AML and 423 controls), being the latter age frequency matched and paired by area of residence with the cases. Unconditional logistic regression was performed, and odds ratios (OR) on the association between tobacco smoking (3 months before pregnancy, during pregnancy, and 3 months after delivery) and EAL were ascertained after adjustment for selected variables (maternal age at birth and education, birth weight, infant skin color, and oral contraceptives use during pregnancy). RESULTS: Smoking was reported by 17.5% of case mothers and 20.6% of controls. Among women who reported to have smoked 20 or more cigarettes during the index pregnancy, an adjusted OR = 5.28 (95% CI 1.40-19.95) for ALL was observed. Heavy smoking during breastfeeding yielded an adjusted risk estimate for ALL, OR = 7.78 (95% CI 1.33-45.5).

HSPs surface expression was higher on RH/K34 than RH/K30 cells. Heat treatment of cells increased the expression of HSPs proteins and virus production; HSPs augmentation was stabilized after 12 h and virus production reached a maximum between 8 h-12 h then returned to normal level after 24 h of culture. Incubation of cells only with rabbit anti-HSP 70 antibodies prevented virus production specifically in the leukemogenic cell line.

However, the role of Cxs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the relationship between cell proliferation and expression of connexin 43 (Cx43) and connexin 32 (Cx32) mRNA and proteins in acute myeloid leukemia in vitro. Proliferation was observed using a growth curve and the rate of proliferation was detected by MTT assay in the acute myeloid leukemia cell lines OCI-AML3 and OCIM2. Cell cycle and cell proliferation index were assessed by flow cytometry analysis. The mRNA expression of the gap junction genes Cx43 and Cx32 was detected by RT-PCR. The expression of Cx43 and Cx32 proteins in the cell lines was analyzed by western blot analysis and immunofluorescence. The doubling time of OCI-AML3 and OCIM2 was 48 h and 36 h, respectively. In OCIM2, the percentage of cells in the S phase fraction was 59.47+/-9.6%, and the proliferation rate was 78.12+/-8.9%; however, in OCI-AML3, the percentage of cells in the S phase was 24.95+/-5.8%, and the proliferation rate was 35.21+/-6.7%. At the mRNA level, both cell lines expressed Cx43 and Cx32, and there was no significant difference in the expression of Cx43 and Cx32 mRNA in the two cell lines. At the protein level, there was a significant difference in the expression of Cx43, but not of Cx32. The proliferation ability of OCIM2 was higher than OCI-AML3, and OCIM2 exhibited higher Cx43 western blot and fluorescence intensities compared with OCI-AML3. The results suggest that a higher expression of Cx43 in AML cells may play a significant role in the proliferation ability.","['Yi, Sha', 'Chen, Yan', 'Wen, Lu', 'Yang, Lijing', 'Cui, Guohui']","['Yi S', 'Chen Y', 'Wen L', 'Yang L', 'Cui G']","['Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430022, P.R.

HTLV-1 is present throughout the world, with clusters of high endemicity located often nearby areas where the virus is nearly absent. The main HTLV-1 highly endemic regions are the Southwestern part of Japan, sub-Saharan Africa and South America, the Caribbean area, and foci in Middle East and Australo-Melanesia. The origin of this puzzling geographical or rather ethnic repartition is probably linked to a founder effect in some groups with the persistence of a high viral transmission rate. Despite different socio-economic and cultural environments, the HTLV-1 prevalence increases gradually with age, especially among women in all highly endemic areas. The three modes of HTLV-1 transmission are mother to child, sexual transmission, and transmission with contaminated blood products. Twenty years ago, de The and Bomford estimated the total number of HTLV-1 carriers to be 10-20 millions people. At that time, large regions had not been investigated, few population-based studies were available and the assays used for HTLV-1 serology were not enough specific. Despite the fact that there is still a lot of data lacking in large areas of the world and that most of the HTLV-1 studies concern only blood donors, pregnant women, or different selected patients or high-risk groups, we shall try based on the most recent data, to revisit the world distribution and the estimates of the number of HTLV-1 infected persons. Our best estimates range from 5-10 millions HTLV-1 infected individuals. However, these results were based on only approximately 1.5 billion of individuals originating from known HTLV-1 endemic areas with reliable available epidemiological data. Correct estimates in other highly populated regions, such as China, India, the Maghreb, and East Africa, is currently not possible, thus, the current number of HTLV-1 carriers is very probably much higher.","['Gessain, Antoine', 'Cassar, Olivier']","['Gessain A', 'Cassar O']","[""Departement de Virologie, Unite d'epidemiologie et physiopathologie des virus oncogenes, Institut Pasteur Paris, France ; CNRS, URA3015 Paris, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121115,Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,PMC3498738,2012/11/20 06:00,2012/11/20 06:01,['2012/11/20 06:00'],"['2012/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2012.00388 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2012 Nov 15;3:388. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2012.00388. eCollection 2012.,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['HTLV-1', 'HTLV-1 epidemiology', 'HTLV-1 in Africa', 'HTLV-1 in Asia', 'HTLV-1 in Europe', 'HTLV-1 in Oceania', 'HTLV-1 in the Americas', 'HTLV-1 world distribution']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There were a total of 1,130 cases, of which 139 showed malignant cytology, including 10 with leukemia. Sixteen samples were unsatisfactory and 904 were benign, of which 32 had identifiable microorganisms. In additional to the 10 leukemia cases identified, two more were reviewed after the search criteria. The 12 patients (seven men, five women) ranged from 22 to 75 years old. All patients had previously biopsy-proven leukemia [two acute myelomonocytic leukemia, two acute promyelocytic leukemia, two acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with inv16, two therapy-related AML, one acute monocytic leukemia, one chronic myeloid leukemia in blast face, one AML with maturation, one myelodysplastic syndrome with excess blasts, and one large granular leukemia]. Four had a prior diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome. The time from initial diagnosis of leukemia to BAL ranged from 1 to 233 days, with 8 of 10 occurring within 8 days of diagnosis. Symptoms that prompted BAL included shortness of breath/hypoxia (8), fever (3), chest pain (2), and cough (2). Chest X-rays in all cases revealed opacities or consolidations mimicking an inflammatory process. Seven patients subsequently died, while three were alive, and, in remission, and two were lost to follow-up. The presence of a leukemic infiltrate can mimic infection. BAL is a relatively safe and useful diagnostic tool in this setting for differentiating a leukemic infiltrate from an infection/inflammatory infiltrate. The prognosis of patients with lung involvement of acute leukemia is poor.","[""O'Leary, Michelle"", 'Cantley, Richard L', 'Kluskens, Larry', 'Gattuso, Paolo']","[""O'Leary M"", 'Cantley RL', 'Kluskens L', 'Gattuso P']","['Department of Pathology, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121116,United States,Diagn Cytopathol,Diagnostic cytopathology,8506895,,2012/11/20 06:00,2013/11/08 06:00,['2012/11/20 06:00'],"['2012/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/dc.22920 [doi]'],ppublish,Diagn Cytopathol. 2013 Jul;41(7):613-6. doi: 10.1002/dc.22920.

Complex abnormalities and -5(q)/-7(q) correlated directly with multiple chemotherapeutic regimens, particularly with combined melphalan/cyclophosphamide. Moreover, the features of cytogenetic abnormalities in our series were significantly different from those with concomitant PCM/MN who had significantly lower complex abnormalities. The latency, skewed proportion of MDS, and bias toward complex cytogenetic abnormalities/unbalanced aberrations of chromosomes 5/7 suggested an alkylating mutagenic effect on pathogenesis of secondary MN. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated a median survival of 19 months, which was better than that for therapy-related (t)-MDS/AML. In contrast to t-MDS, the survival in our patients appeared to depend on subtypes of MDS as seen in de novo diseases.","['Reddi, Deepti M', 'Lu, Chuanyi M', 'Fedoriw, George', 'Liu, Yen-Chun', 'Wang, Frances F', 'Ely, Scott', 'Boswell, Elizabeth L', 'Louissaint, Abner Jr', 'Arcasoy, Murat O', 'Goodman, Barbara K', 'Wang, Endi']","['Reddi DM', 'Lu CM', 'Fedoriw G', 'Liu YC', 'Wang FF', 'Ely S', 'Boswell EL', 'Louissaint A Jr', 'Arcasoy MO', 'Goodman BK', 'Wang E']","['Dept of Pathology, Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center,Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,,2012/11/20 06:00,2013/01/29 06:00,['2012/11/20 06:00'],"['2012/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/29 06:00 [medline]']","['138/6/855 [pii]', '10.1309/AJCPOP7APGDT9JIU [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2012 Dec;138(6):855-66. doi: 10.1309/AJCPOP7APGDT9JIU.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*adverse effects', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/genetics', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Melphalan/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*etiology/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Myeloid Cells/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*etiology/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its anti-cancer effect and cytotoxic mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we found that AL-1 could significantly inhibit cell viability of human leukemia K562 cells by inducing G2/M arrest and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Thirty-one AL-1-regulated protein alterations were identified by proteomics analysis. Gene ontology and ingenuity pathway analysis revealed that a cluster of proteins of oxidative redox state and apoptotic cell death-related proteins, such as PRDX2, PRDX3, PRDX6, TXNRD1, and GLRX3, were regulated by AL-1. Functional studies confirmed that AL-1 induced apoptosis of K562 cells through a ROS-dependent mechanism, and anti-oxidant, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, could completely block AL-1-induced cytotoxicity, implicating that ROS generation played a vital role in AL-1 cytotoxicity. Accumulated ROS resulted in oxidative DNA damage and subsequent G2/M arrest and mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. The current work reveals that a novel andrographolide derivative AL-1 exerts its anticancer cytotoxicity through a ROS-dependent DNA damage and mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis mechanism.","['Zhu, Yong-Yang', 'Yu, Guangchuang', 'Zhang, Ye', 'Xu, Zheng', 'Wang, Yu-Qiang', 'Yan, Guang-Rong', 'He, Qing-Yu']","['Zhu YY', 'Yu G', 'Zhang Y', 'Xu Z', 'Wang YQ', 'Yan GR', 'He QY']","['Institute of Life and Health Engineering, and Key Laboratory of Functional Protein Research of Guangdong Higher Education Institutes, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121211,Germany,Proteomics,Proteomics,101092707,,2012/11/20 06:00,2013/06/20 06:00,['2012/11/20 06:00'],"['2012/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/23 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pmic.201200273 [doi]'],ppublish,Proteomics. 2013 Jan;13(1):169-78. doi: 10.1002/pmic.201200273.

In mouse models, these mutations generally fail to induce leukemia. This observation suggests that NOTCH1 activation must collaborate with other genetic events. Mutagenesis screens previously implicated ZMIZ1 as a possible NOTCH1 collaborator in leukemia. ZMIZ1 is a transcriptional coactivator of the protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS)-like family. Its role in oncogenesis is unknown. Here, we show that activated NOTCH1 and ZMIZ1 collaborate to induce T-ALL in mice. ZMIZ1 and activated NOTCH1 are coexpressed in a subset of human T-ALL patients and cell lines. ZMIZ1 inhibition slowed growth and sensitized leukemic cells to corticosteroids and NOTCH inhibitors. Gene expression profiling identified C-MYC, but not other NOTCH-regulated genes, as an essential downstream target of ZMIZ1. ZMIZ1 functionally interacts with NOTCH1 to promote C-MYC transcription and activity. The mechanism does not involve the NOTCH pathway and appears to be indirect and mediated independently of canonical PIAS functions through a novel N-terminal domain. Our study shows the importance of identifying genetic collaborations between parallel leukemic pathways that may be therapeutically targeted. They also raise new inquiries into potential NOTCH-ZMIZ1 collaboration in a variety of C-MYC-driven cancers.","['Rakowski, Lesley A', 'Garagiola, Derek D', 'Li, Choi M', 'Decker, Margaret', 'Caruso, Sarah', 'Jones, Morgan', 'Kuick, Rork', 'Cierpicki, Tomasz', 'Maillard, Ivan', 'Chiang, Mark Y']","['Rakowski LA', 'Garagiola DD', 'Li CM', 'Decker M', 'Caruso S', 'Jones M', 'Kuick R', 'Cierpicki T', 'Maillard I', 'Chiang MY']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Michigan School of Medicine, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121116,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,PMC3549029,2012/11/20 06:00,2013/03/27 06:00,['2012/11/20 06:00'],"['2012/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-12-1389 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-1389 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2013 Jan 15;73(2):930-41. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-1389.

Rapid screening for NPM1 mutations should be available shortly after diagnosis. Several methods for detecting NPM1 mutations have been described, most of which are technically challenging and require additional laboratory equipment. We developed and validated an assay that allows specific, rapid, and simple screening for NPM1 mutations. FAST PCR spanning exons 8 to 12 of the NPM1 gene was performed on 284 diagnostic AML samples. PCR products were visualized on a 2 % agarose E-gel and verified by direct sequencing. The FAST PCR screening method showed a specificity and sensitivity of 100 %, i.e., all mutated cases were detected, and none of negative cases carried mutations. The limit of detection was at 5-10 % of mutant alleles. We conclude that the FAST PCR assay is a highly specific, rapid (less than 2 h), and sensitive screening method for the detection of NPM1 mutations. Moreover, this method is inexpensive and can easily be integrated in the routine molecular diagnostic work-up of established risk factors in AML using standard laboratory equipment.","['Oppliger Leibundgut, Elisabeth', 'Porret, Naomi A', 'Bienz Muggli, Marianne', 'Baumgartner, Heidi', 'Dahlhaus, Meike', 'Baerlocher, Gabriela M']","['Oppliger Leibundgut E', 'Porret NA', 'Bienz Muggli M', 'Baumgartner H', 'Dahlhaus M', 'Baerlocher GM']","['Laboratory of Molecular Diagnostics, Department of Hematology, University Hospital Bern and University of Bern, Freiburgstrasse 4, Bern, Switzerland. elisabeth.oppliger@insel.ch']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20121117,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,2012/11/20 06:00,2013/03/08 06:00,['2012/11/20 06:00'],"['2012/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-012-1617-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2013 Jan;92(2):173-7. doi: 10.1007/s00277-012-1617-9.

Although its cytotoxic activity against different cancer cell lines has been tested, its effect on human acute leukemia cell lines has scarcely been investigated, and only a few in vitro studies were performed using human breast epithelial cell lines. Due to its potential value for human health, demand for trans-R has rapidly increased, and new biotechnological strategies to obtain it from natural edible sources have been developed. Thus, grapevine cell cultures represent a reliable system of trans-R production since they biosynthesize trans-R constitutively or in response to elicitation. In addition, there are no studies deepen on the inhibitory effect of trans-R, produced by elicited grapevine cell cultures, on growth of human tumor cell lines. In this work, the effect of trans-R extracted from the culture medium, after elicitation of grapevine cell cultures, was tested on two human acute lymphocytic and monocytic leukemia cell lines, and one human breast cancer cell line. The effect of trans-R on cell proliferation was not only dose- and time-dependent but also cell type-dependent, as seen from the different degrees of susceptibility of cancer cell lines tested. As regards the effect of trans-R on cell cycle distribution, low trans-R concentrations increased cells in the S phase whereas a high trans-R concentration increased G(0)/G(1) phase in all cell lines. Perturbation of the cell cycle at low trans-R concentrations did not correlate with the induction of cell death, whereas a high trans-R concentration, cell proliferation decreased as a result of increasing apoptosis in the three cell lines. In leukemia cells, trans-R up-regulated the expression of caspase-3 while trans-R-induced apoptosis in breast cells occur through a caspase-3-independent mechanism mediated by a down-regulation of Bcl-2.","['Fernandez-Perez, Francisco', 'Belchi-Navarro, Sarai', 'Almagro, Lorena', 'Bru, Roque', 'Pedreno, Maria A', 'Gomez-Ros, Laura V']","['Fernandez-Perez F', 'Belchi-Navarro S', 'Almagro L', 'Bru R', 'Pedreno MA', 'Gomez-Ros LV']","['Department of Plant Biology, Faculty of Biology, University of Murcia, Campus Universitario de Espinardo, Murcia, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Plant Foods Hum Nutr,"Plant foods for human nutrition (Dordrecht, Netherlands)",8803554,,2012/11/20 06:00,2014/11/14 06:00,['2012/11/20 06:00'],"['2012/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11130-012-0327-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Plant Foods Hum Nutr. 2012 Dec;67(4):422-9. doi: 10.1007/s11130-012-0327-8.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Cyclodextrins)', '0 (Stilbenes)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cyclodextrins/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Genes, bcl-2/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Resveratrol', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Stilbenes/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'Vitis/*chemistry/drug effects']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined three members of the mouse formyl peptide receptor subfamily (mFprs) and found that they differ in agonist preference and cellular distributions. When stably expressed in transfected rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells, mFpr1 was readily activated by N-formylated peptides derived from Listeria monocytogenes (fMIVTLF), Staphylococcus aureus (fMIFL), and mitochondria (fMMYALF). In contrast, the Escherichia coli-derived fMLF was 1000-fold less potent. The aforementioned peptides were much less efficacious at mFpr2, which responded better to the synthetic hexapeptide WKYMVm, the synthetic agonists Quin-C1 (a substituted quinazolinone), and compound 43 (a nitrosylated pyrazolone derivative). Saturation binding assays showed that mFpr1 and mFpr2 were expressed at similar levels on the cell surface, although their affinity for N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-Ile-Ile-Lys-fluorescein isothiocyanate varied by more than 1000-fold [dissociation constant (K(d)) values of 2.8 nM for mFpr1 and 4.8 muM for mFpr2]). Contrary to these receptors, mFpr-rs1 responded poorly to all the previously mentioned peptides that were tested. Fluorescent microscopy revealed an intracellular distribution pattern of mFpr-rs1. On the basis of these results, we conclude that mFpr1 is an ortholog of human FPR1 with certain pharmacologic properties of human FPR2/ALX, whereas mFpr2 has much lower affinity for formyl peptides. The intracellular distribution of mFpr-rs1 suggests an evolutionary correlation with human FPR3.","['He, Hui-Qiong', 'Liao, Dan', 'Wang, Zhen-Guo', 'Wang, Zhong-Li', 'Zhou, Hu-Chen', 'Wang, Ming-Wei', 'Ye, Richard D']","['He HQ', 'Liao D', 'Wang ZG', 'Wang ZL', 'Zhou HC', 'Wang MW', 'Ye RD']","['School of Pharmacy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200240, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121115,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,PMC4170117,2012/11/20 06:00,2013/06/01 06:00,['2012/11/20 06:00'],"['2012/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/01 06:00 [medline]']","['mol.112.081315 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.112.081315 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2013 Feb;83(2):389-98. doi: 10.1124/mol.112.081315.

The surface topography of the RBCs and the three cancer cells was mapped with a conventional AFM probe, while mechanical properties were investigated with a micro-sphere glued onto a tip-less cantilever.

Aggressive cancer cells have a lower Young's modulus than that of indolent cancer cells, which may improve our understanding of metastasis.","['Li, Mi', 'Liu, Lianqing', 'Xi, Ning', 'Wang, Yuechao', 'Dong, Zaili', 'Xiao, Xiubin', 'Zhang, Weijing']","['Li M', 'Liu L', 'Xi N', 'Wang Y', 'Dong Z', 'Xiao X', 'Zhang W']","['State Key Laboratory of Robotics, Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenyang 110016, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121120,China,Sci China Life Sci,Science China.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The isolated compounds were identified with spectroscopic analysis and through comparison to literature values. Cytotoxic activity towards human tumor and normal cells was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method. Nitric oxide (NO) was determined by the Griess method. Radical scavenging activity was determined by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. Osteoclastogenesis was monitored by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity. RESULTS: The compounds had slightly higher cytotoxicity towards human oral squamous cell carcinoma and leukemia cell lines as compared with human normal oral cells, yielding a tumor specificity value of 1.1-2.7. Among these four compounds, 1 most potently inhibited the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated NO production and the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL)-stimulated osteoclastogenesis by mouse macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells. Micromolar concentrations of 1 scavenged the NO radical produced from 1-hydroxy-2-oxo-3-(N-3-methyl-3-aminopropyl)-3-methyl-1-triazene. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated, for the first time, that 1 inhibited both macrophage activation and osteoclast differentiation, suggesting its possible anti-inflammatory action.","['Suzuki, Ryuichiro', 'Tanaka, Tomohiro', 'Yamamoto, Miki', 'Sakagami, Hiroshi', 'Tomomura, Mineko', 'Tomomura, Akito', 'Satoh, Kazue', 'Shirataki, Yoshiaki']","['Suzuki R', 'Tanaka T', 'Yamamoto M', 'Sakagami H', 'Tomomura M', 'Tomomura A', 'Satoh K', 'Shirataki Y']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Josai University, Sakado, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,,2012/11/20 06:00,2013/05/25 06:00,['2012/11/20 06:00'],"['2012/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/25 06:00 [medline]']",['26/6/993 [pii]'],ppublish,In Vivo. 2012 Nov-Dec;26(6):993-9.,"['0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acp5 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Tartrate-Resistant Acid Phosphatase)']",IM,,"['Acid Phosphatase/analysis', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Free Radical Scavengers/analysis/chemistry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/analysis', 'Macrophage Activation/drug effects', 'Macrophages/cytology/metabolism', 'Magnoliopsida/*chemistry', 'Mice', 'Nitric Oxide/analysis', 'Osteoclasts/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Tartrate-Resistant Acid Phosphatase']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is known to exert antitumor activity via induction of apoptosis in many human cancer cells. However, its signaling pathway in human leukemia cells still remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the roles of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondria and caspases during chlorogenic acid-induced apoptosis of U937 human leukemia cells. Chlorogenic acid exhibited a strong cytotoxicity and induced apoptosis in U937 cells, as determined by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Chlorogenic acid induced apoptosis by promoting ROS production and reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim), as assayed by flow cytometry. Furthermore, the activity of caspase-3 was evaluated and results indicated that chlorogenic acid promoted caspase-3 activity in U937 cells. Results from western blot analysis showed that chlorogenic acid promoted expression of caspase-3, -7, -8 and -9 in U937 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that chlorogenic acid may induce apoptosis by reducing the levels of DeltaPsim and by increasing the activation of caspase-3 pathways in human leukemia U937 cells in vitro.","['Yang, Jai-Sing', 'Liu, Che-Wei', 'Ma, Yi-Shih', 'Weng, Shu-Wen', 'Tang, Nou-Ying', 'Wu, Shin-Hwar', 'Ji, Bin-Chuani', 'Ma, Chia-Yu', 'Ko, Yang-Ching', 'Funayama, Shinji', 'Kuo, Chao-Lin']","['Yang JS', 'Liu CW', 'Ma YS', 'Weng SW', 'Tang NY', 'Wu SH', 'Ji BC', 'Ma CY', 'Ko YC', 'Funayama S', 'Kuo CL']","['Department of Pharmacology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,,2012/11/20 06:00,2013/05/25 06:00,['2012/11/20 06:00'],"['2012/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/25 06:00 [medline]']",['26/6/971 [pii]'],ppublish,In Vivo. 2012 Nov-Dec;26(6):971-8.,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '318ADP12RI (Chlorogenic Acid)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Chlorogenic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', '*Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'U937 Cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, only a limited number of Tcl1-interacting proteins that regulate its oncogenic function have been identified. Prior studies used a proteomic approach to identify a novel interaction between Tcl1 with Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated. The association of Tcl1 and Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated leads to activation of the NF-kappaB pathway. Here, we demonstrate that Tcl1 also interacts with heat shock protein (Hsp) 70. The Tcl1-Hsp70 complex was validated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. In addition, we report that Hsp70, a protein that plays a critical role in the folding and maturation of several oncogenic proteins, associates with Tcl1 protein and stabilizes its expression. The inhibition of the ATPase activity of Hsp70 results in ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of Tcl1. The inhibition of Hsp70 significantly reduced the growth of lymphoma xenografts in vivo and down-regulated the expression of Tcl1 protein. Our findings reveal a functional interaction between Tcl1 and Hsp70 and identify Tcl1 as a novel Hsp70 client protein. These findings suggest that inhibition of Hsp70 may represent an alternative effective therapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia and lymphomas via its ability to inhibit the oncogenic functions of Tcl1.","['Gaudio, Eugenio', 'Paduano, Francesco', 'Ngankeu, Apollinaire', 'Lovat, Francesca', 'Fabbri, Muller', 'Sun, Hui-Lung', 'Gasparini, Pierluigi', 'Efanov, Alexey', 'Peng, Yong', 'Zanesi, Nicola', 'Shuaib, Mohammed A', 'Rassenti, Laura Z', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Li, Chenglong', 'Aqeilan, Rami I', 'Lesinski, Gregory B', 'Trapasso, Francesco', 'Croce, Carlo M']","['Gaudio E', 'Paduano F', 'Ngankeu A', 'Lovat F', 'Fabbri M', 'Sun HL', 'Gasparini P', 'Efanov A', 'Peng Y', 'Zanesi N', 'Shuaib MA', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Kipps TJ', 'Li C', 'Aqeilan RI', 'Lesinski GB', 'Trapasso F', 'Croce CM']","['Department of Molecular Immunology, Virology, and Medical Genetics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20121115,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC3544116,2012/11/20 06:00,2013/03/30 06:00,['2012/11/20 06:00'],"['2012/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47418-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-09-457374 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Jan 10;121(2):351-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-09-457374.

We examined the significance of WT1-CTL responses in patients with relapsed MM and high-risk cytogenetics who were undergoing allogeneic T cell-depleted hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloTCD-HSCT) followed by donor lymphocyte infusions. Of 24 patients evaluated, all exhibited WT1-CTL responses before allogeneic transplantation. These T-cell frequencies were universally correlated with pretransplantation disease load. Ten patients received low-dose donor lymphocyte infusions beginning 5 months after transplantation. All patients subsequently developed increments of WT1-CTL frequencies that were associated with reduction in specific myeloma markers, in the absence of graft-versus-host disease. Immunohistochemical analyses of WT1 and CD138 in bone marrow specimens demonstrated consistent coexpression within malignant plasma cells. WT1 expression in the bone marrow correlated with disease outcome.

Given that the CYP2B6 gene is primarily regulated by the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, NR1I3), we hypothesize that selective activation of CAR can enhance systemic exposure of the pharmacologically active 4-hydroxycyclophosamide (4-OH-CPA), with improved efficacy of CPA-based chemotherapy. In this study, we have developed a unique human primary hepatocyte (HPH)-leukemia cell coculture model; the chemotherapeutic effects of CPA on leukemia cells can be directly investigated in vitro in a cellular environment where hepatic metabolism was well maintained. Our results demonstrated that activation of CAR preferentially induces the expression of CYP2B6 over CYP3A4 in HPHs, although endogenous expression of these enzymes in leukemia cells remains negligible. Importantly, coadministration of CPA with a human CAR activator led to significantly enhanced cytotoxicity in leukemia cells by inducing the apoptosis pathways, without concomitant increase in the off-target hepatotoxicity. Associated with the enhanced antitumor activity, a time and concentration-dependent increase in 4-OH-CPA formation was observed in the coculture system. Together, our findings offer proof of concept that CAR as a novel molecular target can facilitate CPA-based chemotherapy by selectively promoting its bioactivation.","['Wang, Duan', 'Li, Linhao', 'Yang, Hui', 'Ferguson, Stephen S', 'Baer, Maria R', 'Gartenhaus, Ronald B', 'Wang, Hongbing']","['Wang D', 'Li L', 'Yang H', 'Ferguson SS', 'Baer MR', 'Gartenhaus RB', 'Wang H']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Maryland School of Pharmacy, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121116,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC3544115,2012/11/20 06:00,2013/03/30 06:00,['2012/11/20 06:00'],"['2012/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47416-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-06-436691 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Jan 10;121(2):329-38. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-06-436691.

The SF3B1 gene encodes subunit 1 of the splicing factor 3b, which is important for anchoring the spliceosome to precursor mRNA. In 2011, whole-exome sequencing studies showed recurrent somatic mutations of SF3B1 and other genes of the RNA splicing machinery in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm. SF3B1 mutations had a particularly high frequency among conditions characterized by ring sideroblasts, which is consistent with a causal relationship. SF3B1 mutants were also detected at a lower frequency in a variety of other tumor types. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia, SF3B1 was found to be the second most frequently mutated gene. In myelodysplastic syndromes, SF3B1 mutations appear to be founding genetic lesions and are associated with a low risk of leukemic evolution. In contrast, SF3B1 mutations have a lower incidence in early stages of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, are more common in advanced disease, and tend to be associated with poor prognosis, suggesting that they occur during clonal evolution of the disease. The assessment of SF3B1 mutation status may become innovative diagnostic and prognostic tools and the availability of spliceosome modulators opens novel therapeutic prospects.","['Cazzola, Mario', 'Rossi, Marianna', 'Malcovati, Luca']","['Cazzola M', 'Rossi M', 'Malcovati L']","['Department of Hematology Oncology, Fondazione Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20121116,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC3790951,2012/11/20 06:00,2013/03/30 06:00,['2012/11/20 06:00'],"['2012/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47409-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-09-399725 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Jan 10;121(2):260-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-09-399725.

We analyzed CBFB-MYH11 fusion types in 208 inv(16)/t(16;16) patients with de novo disease, and compared clinical and cytogenetic features and the KIT mutation status between type A (n = 182; 87%) and non-type A (n = 26; 13%) patients. At diagnosis, non-type A patients had lower white blood counts (P = .007), and more often trisomies of chromosomes 8 (P = .01) and 21 (P < .001) and less often trisomy 22 (P = .02). No patient with non-type A fusion carried a KIT mutation, whereas 27% of type A patients did (P = .002). Among the latter, KIT mutations conferred adverse prognosis; clinical outcomes of non-type A and type A patients with wild-type KIT were similar. We also derived a fusion-type-associated global gene-expression profile. Gene Ontology analysis of the differentially expressed genes revealed-among others-an enrichment of up-regulated genes involved in activation of caspase activity, cell differentiation and cell cycle control in non-type A patients. We conclude that non-type A fusions associate with distinct clinical and genetic features, including lack of KIT mutations, and a unique gene-expression profile.","['Schwind, Sebastian', 'Edwards, Colin G', 'Nicolet, Deedra', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Maharry, Kati', 'Wu, Yue-Zhong', 'Paschka, Peter', 'Eisfeld, Ann-Kathrin', 'Hoellerbauer, Pia', 'Becker, Heiko', 'Metzeler, Klaus H', 'Curfman, John', 'Kohlschmidt, Jessica', 'Prior, Thomas W', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Blum, William', 'Pettenati, Mark J', 'Dal Cin, Paola', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Volinia, Stefano', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Bloomfield, Clara D']","['Schwind S', 'Edwards CG', 'Nicolet D', 'Mrozek K', 'Maharry K', 'Wu YZ', 'Paschka P', 'Eisfeld AK', 'Hoellerbauer P', 'Becker H', 'Metzeler KH', 'Curfman J', 'Kohlschmidt J', 'Prior TW', 'Kolitz JE', 'Blum W', 'Pettenati MJ', 'Dal Cin P', 'Carroll AJ', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Larson RA', 'Volinia S', 'Marcucci G', 'Bloomfield CD']","['The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121116,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC3544117,2012/11/20 06:00,2013/03/30 06:00,['2012/11/20 06:00'],"['2012/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47422-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-07-442772 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Jan 10;121(2):385-91. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-07-442772.

However, the role of PPARalpha in CLL is unclear. PPARalpha was found to be expressed by circulating CLL cells and highly associated with advanced stage disease. Consistent with this observation, palmitate oxidation rates in circulating CLL cells were similar to more conventional fat-burning cells such as muscle. Transgenic expression of PPARalpha in CD5(+) Daudi cells increased both their expression of immunosuppressive factors (that is, interleukin (IL)10 and phospho-STAT3) and resistance to metabolic and cytotoxic stressors. In contrast, marked downregulation of PPARalpha expression accompanied immunogenic death of proliferating CLL cells. The PPARalpha antagonist MK886 killed circulating CLL cells directly, caused proliferating CLL cells to enter an immunogenic death pathway and cleared CLL xenografts from immunodeficient mice. These results suggest that PPARalpha is a biological mediator of CLL and MK886 is a clinically relevant agent with activity against CLL.","['Spaner, D E', 'Lee, E', 'Shi, Y', 'Wen, F', 'Li, Y', 'Tung, S', 'McCaw, L', 'Wong, K', 'Gary-Gouy, H', 'Dalloul, A', 'Ceddia, R', 'Gorzcynski, R']","['Spaner DE', 'Lee E', 'Shi Y', 'Wen F', 'Li Y', 'Tung S', 'McCaw L', 'Wong K', 'Gary-Gouy H', 'Dalloul A', 'Ceddia R', 'Gorzcynski R']","['Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. spanerd@sri.utoronto.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121119,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2012/11/20 06:00,2013/07/20 06:00,['2012/11/20 06:00'],"['2012/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012329 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.329 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Apr;27(5):1090-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.329.

Previous research has shown that BCR-ABL mediates down-modulation of CBL-B protein levels. A murine bone marrow transplantation (BMT) study was performed to assess the contribution of Cbl-b to BCR-ABL-induced disease. The predominant phenotype in the Cbl-b(-/-) recipients was a CML-like myeloproliferative disease (MPD) similar to that observed in the wild-type animals, but with a longer latency, diminished circulating leukocyte numbers and reduced spleen weights. Despite the decreased leukemic burden in comparison to their wild-type counterparts, the Cbl-b(-/-) animals displayed enhanced numbers of Gr-1(+)/Mac-1(+) spleen cells and neutrophilia. On the basis of prior evidence of CBL-B-dependent motility toward SDF-1alpha, we hypothesized that Cbl-b deficiency might impair bone marrow localization during transplantation. Homing experiments showed reduced migration of Cbl-b(-/-) cells to the bone marrow. Intrafemoral transplantation of BCR-ABL-transduced Cbl-b(-/-) cells revealed equivalent latency of disease development to the wild-type transplants, supporting the conclusion that Cbl-b deficiency diminishes homing of leukemic cells to the bone marrow, and perturbs the proliferation of BCR-ABL-expressing malignant clones during CML development.","['Badger-Brown, K M', 'Gillis, L C', 'Bailey, M L', 'Penninger, J M', 'Barber, D L']","['Badger-Brown KM', 'Gillis LC', 'Bailey ML', 'Penninger JM', 'Barber DL']","['Ontario Cancer Institute, 610 University Avenue, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121119,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2012/11/20 06:00,2013/07/20 06:00,['2012/11/20 06:00'],"['2012/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012331 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.331 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Apr;27(5):1146-54. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.331.

What is not often realized is that formaldehyde is also produced as a normal physiologic chemical in all living cells. In 1980, chronic inhalation of high concentrations of formaldehyde was shown to be carcinogenic, inducing a high incidence of nasal squamous cell carcinomas in rats. Some epidemiologic studies have also found increased numbers of nasopharyngeal carcinoma and leukemia in humans exposed to formaldehyde that resulted in formaldehyde being considered a Known Human Carcinogen. This article reviews the data for rodent and human carcinogenicity, early Mode of Action studies, more recent molecular studies of both endogenous and exogenous DNA adducts, and epigenetic studies. It goes on to demonstrate the power of these research studies to provide critical data to improve our ability to develop science-based cancer risk assessments, instead of default approaches. The complexity of constant physiologic exposure to a known carcinogen requires that new ways of thinking be incorporated into determinations of cancer risk assessment for formaldehyde, other endogenous carcinogens, and the role of background endogenous DNA damage and mutagenesis.","['Swenberg, James A', 'Moeller, Benjamin C', 'Lu, Kun', 'Rager, Julia E', 'Fry, Rebecca C', 'Starr, Thomas B']","['Swenberg JA', 'Moeller BC', 'Lu K', 'Rager JE', 'Fry RC', 'Starr TB']","['Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599, USA. jswenber@email.unc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20121116,United States,Toxicol Pathol,Toxicologic pathology,7905907,PMC3893912,2012/11/20 06:00,2014/01/01 06:00,['2012/11/20 06:00'],"['2012/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [medline]']","['0192623312466459 [pii]', '10.1177/0192623312466459 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Pathol. 2013 Feb;41(2):181-9. doi: 10.1177/0192623312466459.

Studies in myeloid cells demonstrated that CEBPG overexpression blocked neutrophilic differentiation. Further, downregulation of Cebpg in murine Cebpa-deficient stem/progenitor cells or in human CEBPA-silenced AML samples restored granulocytic differentiation.

Therefore, enhanced SMS activity could favor cell proliferation. To examine if dysregulated SMS contributes to leukemogenesis, we measured SMS activity in several leukemic cell lines and found that it is highly elevated in K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells. The increased SMS in K562 cells was caused by the presence of Bcr-abl, a hallmark of CML; stable expression of Bcr-abl elevated SMS activity in HL-60 cells while inhibition of the tyrosine kinase activity of Bcr-abl with Imatinib mesylate decreased SMS activity in K562 cells. The increased SMS activity was the result of up-regulation of the Sms1 isoform. Inhibition of SMS activity with D609 (a pharmacological SMS inhibitor) or down-regulation of SMS1 expression by siRNA selectively inhibited the proliferation of Bcr-abl-positive cells. The inhibition was associated with an increased production of ceramide and a decreased production of DAG, conditions that antagonize cell proliferation.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether there might be excess cancer mortality in towns situated in the vicinity of Spanish-based incinerators and installations for the recovery or disposal of hazardous waste, according to the different categories of industrial activity. METHODS: An ecologic study was designed to examine municipal mortality due to 33 types of cancer, across the period 1997-2006. Population exposure to pollution was estimated on the basis of distance from town of residence to pollution source. Using Besag-York-Mollie (BYM) regression models with Integrated Nested Laplace approximations for Bayesian inference, and Mixed Poisson regression models, we assessed the risk of dying from cancer in a 5-kilometer zone around installations, analyzed the effect of category of industrial activity, and conducted individual analyses within a 50-kilometer radius of each installation. RESULTS: Excess cancer mortality (BYM model: relative risk, 95% credible interval) was detected in the total population residing in the vicinity of these installations as a whole (1.06, 1.04-1.09), and, principally, in the vicinity of incinerators (1.09, 1.01-1.18) and scrap metal/end-of-life vehicle handling facilities, in particular (1.04, 1.00-1.09). Special mention should be made of the results for tumors of the pleura (1.71, 1.34-2.14), stomach (1.18, 1.10-1.27), liver (1.18, 1.06-1.30), kidney (1.14, 1.04-1.23), ovary (1.14, 1.05-1.23), lung (1.10, 1.05-1.15), leukemia (1.10, 1.03-1.17), colon-rectum (1.08, 1.03-1.13) and bladder (1.08, 1.01-1.16) in the vicinity of all such installations. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis of a statistically significant increase in the risk of dying from cancer in towns near incinerators and installations for the recovery or disposal of hazardous waste.","['Garcia-Perez, Javier', 'Fernandez-Navarro, Pablo', 'Castello, Adela', 'Lopez-Cima, Maria Felicitas', 'Ramis, Rebeca', 'Boldo, Elena', 'Lopez-Abente, Gonzalo']","['Garcia-Perez J', 'Fernandez-Navarro P', 'Castello A', 'Lopez-Cima MF', 'Ramis R', 'Boldo E', 'Lopez-Abente G']","['Cancer and Environmental Epidemiology Unit, National Center for Epidemiology, Carlos III Institute of Health, Avda.

An inhalation experiment with FA was performed in rats to study whether FA can enter the blood and could thus cause systemic toxicity in remote tissues such as the bone marrow. Therefore, a sophisticated analytical method was developed to detect blood concentrations of FA during and after single 6-h exposure by inhalation. In order to differentiate between exogenous and endogenous FA the rats were exposed to stable isotope ((13)C) labeled FA by inhalation. During and after exposure of the rats to (13)C-FA their blood was analyzed to determine the ratio between labeled and natural FA in blood and the total blood concentration of FA. With respect to sensitivity, with the applied method exogenous (13)C-FA could have been detected in blood at a concentration approximately 1.5% of the endogenous FA blood concentration. Exogenous (13)C-FA was not detectable in the blood of rats either during or up to 30 min after the exposure. It was concluded that the inhalation of (13)C-FA at 10 ppm for 6h did not result in an increase of the total FA concentration in blood.","['Kleinnijenhuis, Anne J', 'Staal, Yvonne C M', 'Duistermaat, Evert', 'Engel, Roel', 'Woutersen, Ruud A']","['Kleinnijenhuis AJ', 'Staal YC', 'Duistermaat E', 'Engel R', 'Woutersen RA']","['TNO Triskelion, Utrechtseweg 48, 3704 HE Zeist, The Netherlands. anne.kleinnijenhuis@tno.triskelion.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121114,England,Food Chem Toxicol,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,8207483,,2012/11/20 06:00,2013/09/07 06:00,['2012/11/20 06:00'],"['2012/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/02 00:00 [revised]', '2012/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0278-6915(12)00815-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.fct.2012.11.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Food Chem Toxicol. 2013 Feb;52:105-12. doi: 10.1016/j.fct.2012.11.008.

Here, we reveal that LSA induces rapid and reversible premature chromosome condensation (PCC) associated with cell detachment, plasma membrane smoothening and actin reorganization. PCC is induced at all phases of the cell cycle in proliferative cells as well as in circulating human lymphocytes in G 0. It is independent of Cdk1 signaling, associated with cyclin B downregulation and induced in cells at LSA concentrations that are three orders of magnitude lower than those required to block phosphatases 1 and 2A in vitro. At the epigenetic level, LSA-induced PCC is coupled with histone H3 and H1 hyperphosphorylation and deacetylation. Treatment with SAHA reduced LSA-induced PCC, implicating histone deacetylation as one of the PCC effector mechanisms. In addition, PCC is coupled with topoisomerase II (Top2) and Aurora A hyperphosphorylation and activation. Inhibition of Top2 or Aurora A partially blocked LSA-induced PCC. Our findings demonstrate the profound epigenetic alterations induced by LSA and the potential of LSA as a new cytogenetic tool.

Rapid detection of the PML-RARA fusion gene provides the molecular basis for a highly effective therapy with all-trans retinoic acid. We developed a rapid assay by novel droplet-reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (droplet-RT-PCR) for the detection of the PML-RARA fusion gene in APL patients. METHODS: RNA was extracted from 7 samples obtained from 5 APL patients with the PML-RARA fusion gene confirmed by nested RT-PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Using these 7 samples, we evaluated the reaction time and amplification efficiency of the droplet-RT-PCR. RESULTS: Using the droplet-RT-PCR, we could detect the PML-RARA fusion gene in all 7 samples. The reaction time for 50 cycles of droplet-RT-PCR was 27 min. The amplification by the droplet-RT-PCR assay was considered positive for the PML-RARA fusion gene in less than 22 min, at the point when the fluorescence exceeded the threshold level. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel droplet-RT-PCR assay is specific for the detection of the PML-RARA fusion gene and has a markedly reduced reaction time. Thus, the novel droplet-RT-PCR assay contributes to the rapid diagnosis of APL without lagging behind the morphological assessment.","['Sueki, Akane', 'Matsuda, Kazuyuki', 'Taira, Chiaki', 'Yamaguchi, Akemi', 'Koeda, Hiroshi', 'Takagi, Fumio', 'Kobayashi, Yukihiro', 'Sugano, Mitsutoshi', 'Honda, Takayuki']","['Sueki A', 'Matsuda K', 'Taira C', 'Yamaguchi A', 'Koeda H', 'Takagi F', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Sugano M', 'Honda T']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Shinshu University Hospital, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, 390-8621, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121113,Netherlands,Clin Chim Acta,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,1302422,,2012/11/20 06:00,2013/06/01 06:00,['2012/11/20 06:00'],"['2012/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-8981(12)00531-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cca.2012.10.059 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chim Acta. 2013 Jan 16;415:276-8. doi: 10.1016/j.cca.2012.10.059.

However, the significance of its N-terminal region and its correlation to the SUMO modification pathway remain largely uncharacterized. In this study, a human cultured cell line was established, in which FLAG-tagged mouse Nip45 (FLAG-mNip45) was stably overexpressed. Under standard, non-stressful conditions, we detected FLAG-mNip45 diffusely distributed in the nucleus. Intriguingly, proteasome inhibition by MG132 caused FLAG-mNip45, together with SUMOylated proteins, to localize in nuclear domains associated with promyelocytic leukemia protein. Finally, using an in vitro binding assay, we showed interaction of the N-terminal region of mNip45 with both free SUMO-3 and SUMO-3 chains, indicating that Nip45 may, in part, exert its function via interaction with SUMO/SUMOylated proteins. Taken together, our study provides novel information on a poorly characterized mammalian protein and suggests that our newly established cell line will be useful for elucidating the physiological role of Nip45.","['Hashiguchi, Kohtaro', 'Ozaki, Masumi', 'Kuraoka, Isao', 'Saitoh, Hisato']","['Hashiguchi K', 'Ozaki M', 'Kuraoka I', 'Saitoh H']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Science and Technology, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121115,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,,2012/11/20 06:00,2013/05/15 06:00,['2012/11/20 06:00'],"['2012/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(12)02179-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.11.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2013 Jan 4;430(1):72-7. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.11.020.

We have recently reported that the important cholesterol and inflammatory regulator, liver X receptor (LXRalpha/beta), can potently inhibit osteoclast formation from bone marrow-derived osteoclast precursors in a bacterial/LPS environment. In this manuscript, we further studied the effect of the LXR agonist GW3965 on osteoclast differentiation in RAW264.7 promyelocytic leukemia cells exposed to LPS. We found that not only did activation of the LXR potently inhibit the formation of TRAP-positive osteoclast-like cells, but promoted a population of TRAP-negative mononuclear cells with high phagocytic activity. We observed reduced expression of the osteoclast markers TRAP/Acp5, Ctsk, Calcr and Oscar after 3-4days of GW3965 treatment, coinciding with an increase in the expression of the anti-osteoclastogenic factor Irf8. Expression of the macrophage/phagocytic marker Cd68 was increased, however the ""classical"" macrophage markers F4/80 and Cd14 and the ""alternatively"" activated macrophage markers Tgfbeta and Il10 were not altered. Further, activation of LXR increased the expression of the macrophage survival gene AIM/SPalpha, a known LXR target gene, and osteoclast/macrophage-related markers (Mitf, Pu.1, Usf1/2, Ostm1 and Mfr). Although Akt phosphorylation was reduced, GW3965 seemed to act independently of MAPKs (p38, ERK, JNK) and NFkappaB, and had no inhibitory effect on cytokine expression (Tnfalpha, Il6, or Il1beta). Our results indicate that activation of the LXR not only inhibits the differentiation of osteoclast-like cells from RAW264.7 cells in a bacterial/LPS environment, but is also involved in the fate determination of myeloid progenitor cells into macrophages with high phagocytic capacity.","['Robertson Remen, Kirsten M', 'Gustafsson, Jan-Ake', 'Andersson, Goran']","['Robertson Remen KM', 'Gustafsson JA', 'Andersson G']","['Department of Biosciences and Nutrition at Novum, Karolinska Institutet, 14157 Huddinge, Sweden. kirsten.remen@ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121115,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,,2012/11/20 06:00,2013/05/15 06:00,['2012/11/20 06:00'],"['2012/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(12)02180-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.11.021 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2013 Jan 4;430(1):375-80. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.11.021.

Thus, we performed in vitro study to investigate if treatment of PCA affects cell proliferation and apoptosis in human colorectal cancer cells and define potential mechanisms by which PCA mediates growth arrest and apoptosis of cancer cells. Exposure of PCA to human colorectal cancer cells (HCT116 and SW480 cells) suppressed cell growth and induced apoptosis in dose-dependent manner. PCA decreased cyclin D1 expression in protein and mRNA level and suppressed luciferase activity of cyclin D1 promoter, indicating transcriptional downregulation of cyclin D1 gene by PCA. We also observed that PCA treatment attenuated enzyme activity of histone deacetylase (HDAC) and reduced expression of HDAC2, but not HDAC1. These findings suggest that cell growth inhibition and apoptosis by PCA may be a result of HDAC2-mediated cyclin D1 suppression.","['Jeong, Jin Boo', 'Lee, Seong-Ho']","['Jeong JB', 'Lee SH']","['Department of Nutrition and Food Science, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121114,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,,2012/11/20 06:00,2013/05/15 06:00,['2012/11/20 06:00'],"['2012/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(12)02173-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.11.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2013 Jan 4;430(1):381-6. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.11.018.

This mutation is generally detected in the clinical laboratory by PCR and electrophoresis-based product sizing. As the number of clinically relevant somatic mutations in AML increases, it becomes increasingly attractive to incorporate FLT3 ITD testing into multiplex assays for many somatic mutations simultaneously, using next-generation sequencing (NGS). However, the performance of most NGS analysis tools for identifying medium-size insertions such as FLT3 ITD mutations is largely unknown. We used a multigene, targeted NGS assay to obtain deep sequence coverage (>1000-fold) of FLT3 and 26 other genes from 22 FLT3 ITD-positive and 29 ITD-negative specimens to examine the performance of several commonly used NGS analysis tools for identifying FLT3 ITD mutations. ITD mutations were present in hybridization-capture sequencing data, and Pindel was the only tool out of the seven tested that reliably detected these insertions. Pindel had 100% sensitivity (95% CI = 83% to 100%) and 100% specificity (95% CI = 88% to 100%) in our samples; Pindel provided accurate ITD insertion sizes and was able to detect ITD alleles present at estimated frequencies as low as 1%.

METHOD: A total of 176 patients with ALL and a cohort of 170 matched healthy subjects were included. SNaPshot SNP typing was used to determine the genotypes of MDR1 C1236T, G2677T/A, C3435T. Based on the clinical data, the relationship between genetic polymorphism of MDR1 and the risk of childhood ALL was analyzed. RESULT: There was significant difference in the distribution of genotype of MDR1 C3435T between the group of controls and cases. The mutant homozygous TT genotype was found to be associated with occurrence of ALL (P = 0.000; OR = 4.504). The data show evidence of pairwise linkage disequilibrium between the three common SNPs (C1236T-G2677T/A-C3435T). The haplotypes of TTT, TGC, CGC and CAC were predominant.

METHOD: Dual color fluorescence in situ hybridization (D-FISH) using a LSI CBFbeta inv(16) break apart probe labeled by Spectrum red and Spectrum green was performed in 15 acute myeloid leukemia cases, including 13 cases with or without abnormal eosinophils but with positive core binding factor beta (CBFbeta)-MYH11 fusion transcript detected by RT-PCR, and 2 cases with trisomy 8 (+8). The results were compared with the morphology, immunophenotype, karyotype and RT-PCR. RESULT: Morphologically, 12 cases were diagnosed as M(4)EO, 2 as M(4), and 1 as M(2a). Immunophenotypically, all 13 AML cases with inv(16) showed positive expression of CD(13) and CD(33), but without the expression of any lymphoid lineage antigens. Karyotyping analysis with G-banding detected inv(16) in 10 AML cases, including 9 M(4)EO cases and 1 M(2a), but only 5 positive cases were detected using R-banding technique. Among them, 2 cases had simultaneous +8 and trisomy22 (+22), one had +22 only in addition to inv(16). D-FISH revealed a CBFbeta-MYH11 rearrangement in 13 cases of AML with positive RT-PCR results, and the mean positive rate of cell detection was 55.15% (range 37.0% - 86.0%). The complete remission rate (CR) and median survival period in this series of inv(16) AML were 81.5%and 11 months, respectively, of whom, 8 cases were still in CR. Relapse and karyotypic evolution were seen in case 5 with +8, +22 in addition to inv(16). CONCLUSION: AML with inv(16) is a special subtype. Most cases belong to M(4)EO. Its prognosis is good in general, but it seems to be an unfavorable feature for AML with inv(16) and +8, +22 simultaneously, especially with karyotypic evolution. For detection of inv(16), G-banding technique is evidently superior to R-banding technique. D-FISH combined with RT-PCR are more sensitive and reliable than chromosome banding analysis.","['He, Ya-xiang', 'Xue, Yong-quan', 'Wang, Hong-ying', 'Yang, Nai-chao', 'Shao, Xue-jun', 'Xu, Jun', 'Ji, Zheng-hua', 'Huang, Yi-ping', 'Ding, Yun-fang', 'Hu, Shao-yan']","['He YX', 'Xue YQ', 'Wang HY', 'Yang NC', 'Shao XJ', 'Xu J', 'Ji ZH', 'Huang YP', 'Ding YF', 'Hu SY']","[""Suzhou Children's Hospital Affiliated to Medical School of Suzhou University, Suzhou, China.""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,0417427,,2012/11/20 06:00,2013/03/15 06:00,['2012/11/20 06:00'],"['2012/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/15 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi. 2012 Aug;50(8):593-7.,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/*genetics', 'Eosinophilia/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Chromosomal analysis was performed with short-term cell cultures and R-banding techniques in 129 MDS patients. And the technique of FISH was employed for clinical follow-ups in 28 MDS patients. Based on the result of abnormal karyotype, the patients were divided into three groups: low risk group , intermediate risk and high risk group. The leukemia transformation time and survival time between these three groups were compare. RESULTS: Among them, 52 patients (40.3%) had numeral karyotypic abnormalities of chromosomes and structural alterations. Complex abnormal karyotype was the most common and accounted for 30.8% (16 cases). The frequencies of 20q(-) and +8 were 19.2% (10 cases) and 15.4% (8 cases)respectively. Six cases were positive by FISH, however, of whom, were negative for conventional cytogenetics. The follow-up data were available in 88 patients with a median follow up duration of 11(3, 60) months, 27 cases (30.7%) progressed to acute leukemia. The rate of leukemia transformation were 27.8% (15/54), 23.5% (4/17) and 47.1% (8/17) in the low, intermediate and high risk groups respectively. The median durations of leukemic transformation were > 60 (14, > 60), 48 (35, > 60) and 7 (6, 12) months in the low, intermediate and high-risk groups and the median survival times were 26(15, > 60), 21(14, 35) and 10(6, 13) months respectively. The median durations of leukemic transformation and median survival periods in the high-risk groups were shorter than those in the low and intermediate risk groups (all P < 0.05).

In particular, soluble factors present in OC ascites can create a protective environment for tumor cells that promote de novo resistance to drug- and death receptor-induced apoptosis. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for ascites-induced drug resistance are not well characterized. METHODS: Using human OC cell lines and tissues microarrays of human OC biopsies, we assessed the mechanism by which OC ascites increase Mcl-1 expression using Western blots, chemical inhibitors of ERK and small-inhibitory RNA treatments. RESULTS: In the present study, we found that both Mcl-1 mRNA and protein levels were upregulated within 2 h upon treatment of OC cells with ascites obtained from women with advanced OC. In contrast, the expression of other Bcl-2 family antiapoptotic members such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL was not affected by ascites. An increase of Mcl-1 expression was consistently observed across different ascites from women with advanced serous OC. The knockdown of Mcl-1 significantly blocked ascites-induced Mcl-1 upregulation and ascites-mediated inhibition of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Ascites induced a rapid phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Elk-1 transcription factor. Furthermore, we found that ERK1/2 inhibition or Elk-1 knockdown was sufficient to block ascites-induced Mcl-1 expression. In high grade serous OC, we found a positive correlation between phosphorylated ERK1/2 and Mcl-1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that ascites-induced ERK1/2/Elk-1 signaling is critical for Mcl-1 expression and for the ascites-mediated attenuation of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The ERK1/2/Elk-1/Mcl-1 pathway represents a novel mechanism by which ascites induce de novo TRAIL resistance in OC cells.","['Goncharenko-Khaider, Nadzeya', 'Matte, Isabelle', 'Lane, Denis', 'Rancourt, Claudine', 'Piche, Alain']","['Goncharenko-Khaider N', 'Matte I', 'Lane D', 'Rancourt C', 'Piche A']","['Departement de Microbiologie et Infectiologie, Faculte de Medecine, Universite de Sherbrooke, 3001, 12ieme Avenue Nord, Sherbrooke, J1H 5N4, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121117,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,PMC3526430,2012/11/20 06:00,2013/03/23 06:00,['2012/11/20 06:00'],"['2012/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-11-84 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-11-84 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2012 Nov 17;11:84. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-11-84.,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (ets-Domain Protein Elk-1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Ascites/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 1/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*metabolism', 'ets-Domain Protein Elk-1/*metabolism']",,,,,"['115072-1/CAPMC/ CIHR/Canada', 'MOP-115072/CAPMC/ CIHR/Canada']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FA protected gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) was synthesized and labeled with fluorescein isothiocynate (FITC) to form the FITC-FA-AuNPs (FFANPs). As over-expressed folic acid receptor in some cancer cells and folic acid can specifically and selectively combine, the FFANPs can bind to the FR expressed on tumor cells such as HeLa cells (human epithelial cervical cancer) and CERF-CEM cells (T cell line, human acute lymphoblastic leukemia). As a result, cancer cell imaging can be achieved. To ascertain the FR target ability, it has been acquired by FR-targeted images using synthetic FFANPs. The formation of FITC-FA can be identified by MS. FCM was carried out to study the cell uptake of FFANPs. The cell toxicity (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2]-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, MTT) assay demonstrated that the FITC-labeled conjugate had only little effect on the cytotoxicity to the cells, which further proved the applicability of the method in tumor cell imaging.","['Ai, Jun', 'Xu, Yuanhong', 'Li, Dan', 'Liu, Zuojia', 'Wang, Erkang']","['Ai J', 'Xu Y', 'Li D', 'Liu Z', 'Wang E']","['State Key Laboratory of Electroanalytical Chemistry, Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changchun, Jilin 130022, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120912,Netherlands,Talanta,Talanta,2984816R,,2012/11/20 06:00,2013/05/02 06:00,['2012/11/20 06:00'],"['2012/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/26 00:00 [revised]', '2012/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0039-9140(12)00664-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.talanta.2012.07.075 [doi]']",ppublish,Talanta. 2012 Nov 15;101:32-7. doi: 10.1016/j.talanta.2012.07.075.

Previous work has correlated the deoxynucleotide triphosphohydrolase activity of SAMHD1 with its ability to block HIV-1 and SIV(mac) infection. SAMHD1 is comprised of the sterile alpha motif (SAM) and histidine-aspartic (HD) domains; however the contribution of these domains to retroviral restriction is not understood. Mutagenesis and deletion studies revealed that expression of the sole HD domain of SAMHD1 is sufficient to achieve potent restriction of HIV-1 and SIV(mac). We demonstrated that the HD domain of SAMHD1 is essential for the ability of SAMHD1 to oligomerize by using a biochemical assay. In agreement with previous observations, we mapped the RNA-binding ability of SAMHD1 to the HD domain. We also demonstrated a direct interaction of SAMHD1 with RNA by using enzymatically-active purified SAMHD1 protein from insect cells. Interestingly, we showed that double-stranded RNA inhibits the enzymatic activity of SAMHD1 in vitro suggesting the possibility that RNA from a pathogen might modulate the enzymatic activity of SAMHD1 in cells. By contrast, we found that the SAM domain is dispensable for retroviral restriction, oligomerization and RNA binding. Finally we tested the ability of SAMHD1 to block the infection of retroviruses other than HIV-1 and SIV(mac). These results showed that SAMHD1 blocks infection of HIV-2, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV), Equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), N-tropic murine leukemia virus (N-MLV), and B-tropic murine leukemia virus (B-MLV).","['White, Tommy E', 'Brandariz-Nunez, Alberto', 'Valle-Casuso, Jose Carlos', 'Amie, Sarah', 'Nguyen, Laura', 'Kim, Baek', 'Brojatsch, Jurgen', 'Diaz-Griffero, Felipe']","['White TE', 'Brandariz-Nunez A', 'Valle-Casuso JC', 'Amie S', 'Nguyen L', 'Kim B', 'Brojatsch J', 'Diaz-Griffero F']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine Bronx, NY 10461, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20121113,United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,PMC3767443,2012/11/20 06:00,2013/04/02 06:00,['2012/11/20 06:00'],"['2012/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/24 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0042-6822(12)00537-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virol.2012.10.029 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2013 Feb 5;436(1):81-90. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2012.10.029.

In particular, ALV-J induced various clinical tumors in infected chickens, which caused enormous economic losses to poultry. In this study, an infectious clone from an epidemic ALV-J Chinese isolate designated HLJ09SH01 was constructed and rescued. The rescued virus (named rHLJ09SH01) was inoculated into specific-pathogen-free (SPF) layer chickens, and infected chickens were observed for 238 days to explore the oncogenicity of rHLJ09SH01. As a result, 57.9% of rHLJ09SH01-infected chickens produced tumors. Accumulating evidence shows that microRNAs (miRNAs) have a close relationship with tumorigenesis. To gain more insight into the tumorigenesis of ALV-J, a miRNA microarray was performed as part of an investigation of changes in host miRNA expression in a liver tumor from ALV-J infected chickens. The results showed that four miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed; these data were verified using real-time PCR. Bioinformatics analysis showed the differentially expressed miRNAs to be involved in some tumorigenesis-related signaling pathways, such as the MAPK signaling pathway and the Wnt signaling pathway, which may represent a possible signaling pathway that was involved in the ALV-J-induced tumorigenesis.","['Wang, Qi', 'Gao, Yulong', 'Ji, Xiaolin', 'Qi, Xiaole', 'Qin, Liting', 'Gao, Honglei', 'Wang, Yongqiang', 'Wang, Xiaomei']","['Wang Q', 'Gao Y', 'Ji X', 'Qi X', 'Qin L', 'Gao H', 'Wang Y', 'Wang X']","['Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150001, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121026,Netherlands,Vet Microbiol,Veterinary microbiology,7705469,,2012/11/20 06:00,2014/02/14 06:00,['2012/11/20 06:00'],"['2012/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/09 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-1135(12)00562-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.vetmic.2012.10.023 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Microbiol. 2013 Feb 22;162(1):232-8. doi: 10.1016/j.vetmic.2012.10.023.

METHODS: The clinical and pathologic features of 15 cases of PTLD were retrospectively analyzed by light microscopy, immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridization, according to the updated 2008 WHO classification of tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues. RESULTS: Amongst the 15 cases studied, 14 cases had received allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) and 1 case had received renal transplantation. There were altogether 12 males and 3 females. The male-to-female ratio was 4:1. The mean age was 30.4 years and the median age was 31 years (range from 9 to 60 years). PTLD developed 1.5 to 132 months after transplantation (median 13.0 months). The mean age of the 14 patients with AHSCT was 28.3 years (range from 9 to 45 years) and PTLD developed 1.5 to 19 months after transplantation (mean 4.5 months). Major clinical presentation included fever and lymphadenopathy. Twelve cases involved mainly lymph nodes and the remaining 3 cases involved tonsils, stomach and small intestine, respectively. The histologic types in 4 cases represented early lesions, including plasmacytic hyperplasia (n = 1) and infectious mononucleosis-like PTLD (n = 3). Seven cases were polymorphic PTLD, with 4 cases containing a predominance of large cells. Graft-versus-host disease was also seen in the case of small intestinal involvement. Four cases were monomorphic PTLD, 3 of which were diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 1 was plasmablastic lymphoma and 1 was a mixture of monomorphic and polymorphic PTLD. Foci of necrosis were seen in 5 cases. The proliferating index of Ki-67 was high. The positive rate of EBV-encoded RNA in AHSCT was 92.9%. The duration of PTLD onset was shorter in EBV-positive cases (range from 1.5 to 7 months) than EBV-negative cases (range from 19 and 132 months). Some cases were treated by reduction of immunosuppression, antiviral agents or anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody Rituximab. The duration of follow-up in 14 patients ranged from 0 to 8 months. Five of the patients died of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of PTLD relies on morphologic examination and immunohistochemistry. Most of them are of B-cell origin. EBV plays an important role in the pathogenesis of PTLD. The duration of disease onset is shorter in EBV-positive cases. PTLD in AHSCT cases occurs in younger age group, with shorter duration of onset, as compared to solid organ transplantation. The prognosis of PTLD is poor. The modalities of treatment include reduction of immunosuppression, antiviral agents or anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody Rituximab.","['Chen, Ding-bao', 'Wang, Ying', 'Song, Qiu-jing', 'Shen, Dan-hua']","['Chen DB', 'Wang Y', 'Song QJ', 'Shen DH']","[""Department of Pathology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology,0005331,,2012/11/20 06:00,2013/04/30 06:00,['2012/11/20 06:00'],"['2012/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0529-5807.2012.09.008 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi. 2012 Sep;41(9):607-12. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0529-5807.2012.09.008.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Ki-1 Antigen)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD20/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Ki-1 Antigen/metabolism', 'Kidney Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy/etiology/pathology/virology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/drug therapy/*etiology/*pathology/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rituximab', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was shown that different acetylation of proteins correlates with development of leukemia. It is proposed that histone acetyltransferases (HATs) are important novel drug targets for leukemia treatment, however data are still not consistent. Our previous data showed that a derivative of anacardic acid - small molecule MG153, which has been designed and synthesized to optimize the HAT inhibitory potency of anacardic acid, is a potent inhibitor of p300/CBP associated factor (PCAF) acetyltransferase. Here we ask whether inhibition of PCAF acetyltransferase with MG153 will show proapoptotic effects in cells expressing BCR-ABL, which show increased PCAF expression and are resistant to apoptosis. We found that inhibition of PCAF decreases proliferation and induces apoptosis, which correlates with loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential and DNA fragmentation. Importantly, cells expressing BCR-ABL are more sensitive to PCAF inhibition compared to parental cells without BCRABL. Moreover, inhibition of PCAF in BCR-ABL-expressing cells breaks their resistance to DNA damage-induced cell death. These findings provide direct evidence that targeting the PCAF alone or in combination with DNA-damaging drugs shows cytotoxic effects and should be considered as a prospective therapeutic strategy in chronic myeloid leukemia cells. Moreover, we propose that anacardic acid derivative MG153 is a valuable agent and further studies validating its therapeutic relevance should be performed.","['Kusio-Kobialka, Monika', 'Dudka-Ruszkowska, Wioleta', 'Ghizzoni, Massimo', 'Dekker, Frank J', 'Piwocka, Katarzyna']","['Kusio-Kobialka M', 'Dudka-Ruszkowska W', 'Ghizzoni M', 'Dekker FJ', 'Piwocka K']","['Laboratory of Cytometry, Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology, 3 Pasteur Str., 02-093 Warsaw, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,,2012/11/20 06:00,2014/02/04 06:00,['2012/11/20 06:00'],"['2012/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/23 00:00 [revised]', '2012/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['CMCACA-EPUB-20121113-2 [pii]', '10.2174/1871520611313050010 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2013 Jun;13(5):762-7. doi: 10.2174/1871520611313050010.,"['0 (Anacardic Acids)', '18654-18-7 (anacardic acid)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP-associated factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,,"['Anacardic Acids/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'DNA Damage/drug effects/*physiology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The transformed cell acquires an unrestrained capacity for self-renewal and, in the case of the acute leukaemias, also fails to differentiate into functional mature cells. Historically leukaemias were classified using a combination of clinical and (presumed) cell lineage criteria. Thus, the four major subgroups of acute and chronic myeloid leukaemia and acute and chronic lymphoid leukaemia were recognised. Up until the last 10-15 years, patients within each major subgroup were treated along broadly similar lines. Genetic abnormalities have been recognised in certain leukaemias for over 50 years; however, the recent explosion in our understanding of the frequency and complexity of molecular abnormalities in the leukaemias has 'opened the door' for the design of more targeted therapies with the expectation that their incorporation into therapeutic regimens will be associated with greater efficacy and less off-target toxicity.","['Brown, C M S', 'Larsen, S R', 'Iland, H J', 'Joshua, D E', 'Gibson, J']","['Brown CM', 'Larsen SR', 'Iland HJ', 'Joshua DE', 'Gibson J']","['Institute of Haematology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital and the University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Australia,Intern Med J,Internal medicine journal,101092952,,2012/11/20 06:00,2013/07/09 06:00,['2012/11/20 06:00'],"['2011/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1445-5994.2012.02938.x [doi]'],ppublish,Intern Med J. 2012 Nov;42(11):1179-86. doi: 10.1111/j.1445-5994.2012.02938.x.,,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease Management', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/diagnosis/epidemiology/genetics/*therapy', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Mutation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Opportunistic Infections/prevention & control', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,,"['(c) 2012 The Authors; Internal Medicine Journal (c) 2012 Royal Australasian', 'College of Physicians.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Haematopoiesis, erythropoiesis, myelopoiesis, formation of monocytic and lymphocytic lineages, thrombopoiesis and other stromal cellular elements are regulated by the local BM RAS. The local BM RAS is present and active even in primitive embryonic haematopoiesis. ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) is expressed on the surface of the first endothelial and haematopoietic cells, forming the marrow cavity in the embryo. ACE marks early haematopoietic precursor cells and long-term blood-forming CD34(+) BM cells. The local autocrine tissue BM RAS may also be active in neoplastic haematopoiesis. Critical RAS mediators such as renin, ACE, AngII (angiotensin II) and angiotensinogen have been identified in leukaemic blast cells. The local tissue RAS influences tumour growth and metastases in an autocrine and paracrine fashion via the modulation of numerous carcinogenic events, such as angiogenesis, apoptosis, cellular proliferation, immune responses, cell signalling and extracellular matrix formation. The aim of the present review is to outline the known functions of the local BM RAS within the context of primitive, definitive and neoplastic haematopoiesis. Targeting the actions of local RAS molecules could represent a valuable therapeutic option for the management of neoplastic disorders.","['Haznedaroglu, Ibrahim C', 'Beyazit, Yavuz']","['Haznedaroglu IC', 'Beyazit Y']","['Department of Hematology, Hacettepe University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Clin Sci (Lond),"Clinical science (London, England : 1979)",7905731,,2012/11/20 06:00,2013/01/25 06:00,['2012/11/20 06:00'],"['2012/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['CS20120300 [pii]', '10.1042/CS20120300 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Sci (Lond). 2013 Mar;124(5):307-23. doi: 10.1042/CS20120300.,,IM,,"['Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Renin-Angiotensin System/*physiology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No definitive pharmacological treatment is currently available. We previously reported that thrombopoietin (TPO) promoted liver regeneration and improved liver cirrhosis by increasing platelet count. TPO is therefore considered to be a therapeutic agent for LC; however, it is unclear whether TPO has proliferative effects on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which arises frequently in cirrhotic livers. In this study, we examined the effects of TPO on growth of HCC. METHODS: Expression of the TPO receptor, myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene (MPL) was examined in various liver tumor cell lines and liver cell types. In an in vitro study, the effects of TPO on signal transduction, cell proliferation, migration and invasion were examined in Huh7 cells, in which MPL is highly expressed. In an in vivo study, we subcutaneously transplanted Huh7 cells into nude mice that were divided into a TPO-treated group and a control group, and the tumor volume of each group was measured. RESULTS: MPL was expressed strongly in hepatocytes but not in other cell types. Among liver tumor cell lines, Huh7 showed the highest expression of MPL. In Huh7, the addition of TPO activated Akt phosphorylation but not cell proliferation, migration or invasion. In the mouse experiment, there was no significant difference in tumor volume between the two groups. CONCLUSION: TPO had no proliferative effect on HCC in vitro or in vivo, and could therefore be useful in the treatment of liver cirrhosis.","['Nozaki, Reiji', 'Murata, Soichiro', 'Nowatari, Takeshi', 'Maruyama, Takehito', 'Ikeda, Naoya', 'Kawasaki, Takuya', 'Fukunaga, Kiyoshi', 'Ohkohchi, Nobuhiro']","['Nozaki R', 'Murata S', 'Nowatari T', 'Maruyama T', 'Ikeda N', 'Kawasaki T', 'Fukunaga K', 'Ohkohchi N']","['Department of Surgery, Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121116,Netherlands,Hepatol Res,Hepatology research : the official journal of the Japan Society of Hepatology,9711801,,2012/11/20 06:00,2012/11/20 06:01,['2012/11/20 06:00'],"['2012/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/19 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1111/hepr.12006 [doi]'],ppublish,Hepatol Res. 2013 Jun;43(6):610-20. doi: 10.1111/hepr.12006.

Many studies have suggested that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) overexpression correlates with poorer survival in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but some studies suggest a greater probability of survival. To investigate the prognostic significance of VEGF overexpression in adult AML, we performed a meta-analysis of the published studies that provided survival information according to VEGF expression status. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) indicated that VEGF overexpression had a poor impact on the survival of adult patients with AML. The combined hazard ratio for event-free survival (EFS) was 1.40 and summary HR for overall survival was 1.54. The pooled HR was 1.92 in AML by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and 1.67 in AML by immunohistochemistry. These findings indicate that VEGF overexpression has an adverse impact on prognosis for patients with AML.

Telomerase dysfunction also leads to short telomeric overhang, which is a crucial telomeric structural component, and potentially results in chromosome instability. We screened variants in telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and telomerase RNA component (TERC) genes, and investigated the 3'-overhang length in bone marrow samples from 72 Chinese patients with AML (61 de novo, 11 secondary, excluding M3), aged 13-77. Cytogenetics, disease severity and short-term survival were evaluated. Three TERT mutations (n896G>A, n1079C>G and n1451G>C) were identified. Mutation carriers had short overhangs and a poor prognosis. We found that overhang lengths were much shorter in AML compared to normal controls (p < 0.001). Short overhangs were related to a high percentage of karyotype abnormalities and poor prognosis (73.8% in short overhang group vs. 30% in normal group, p=0.001). Multivariant analysis showed that overhang length, age and unfavorable chromosome abnormalities served as independent prognostic markers in AML (Cox regression, p=0.001). These data raise the possibility that short overhang length may predict poor prognosis in patients with AML. These findings would have to be confirmed in large, prospective studies.","['Yan, Siyi', 'Han, Bing', 'Wu, Yongji', 'Zhou, Daobin', 'Zhao, Yongqiang']","['Yan S', 'Han B', 'Wu Y', 'Zhou D', 'Zhao Y']","['Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Beiing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121210,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,2012/11/20 06:00,2014/02/11 06:00,['2012/11/20 06:00'],"['2012/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2012.729834 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2013 Jul;54(7):1437-41. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2012.729834.

JAK2 inhibitors, however, do not readily eliminate neoplastic MPN cells and thus do not induce patient remission. Further understanding JAK2 signalling in MPNs may uncover novel avenues for therapeutic intervention. Recent work has suggested a potential role for cellular cholesterol in the activation of JAK2 by the erythropoietin receptor and in the development of an MPN-like disorder in mice. Our study demonstrates for the first time that the MPN-associated JAK2-V617F kinase localizes to lipid rafts and that JAK2-V617F-dependent signalling is inhibited by lipid raft disrupting agents, which target membrane cholesterol, a critical component of rafts. We also show for the first time that statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, widely used to treat hypercholesterolaemia, induce apoptosis and inhibit JAK2-V617F-dependent cell growth. These cells are more sensitive to statin treatment than non-JAK2-V617F-dependent cells. Importantly, statin treatment inhibited erythropoietin-independent erythroid colony formation of primary cells from MPN patients, but had no effect on erythroid colony formation from healthy individuals. Our study is the first to demonstrate that JAK2-V617F signalling is dependent on lipid rafts and that statins may be effective in a potential therapeutic approach for MPNs.","['Griner, Lori N', 'McGraw, Kathy L', 'Johnson, Joseph O', 'List, Alan F', 'Reuther, Gary W']","['Griner LN', 'McGraw KL', 'Johnson JO', 'List AF', 'Reuther GW']","['Cancer Biology Ph.D. Program, University of South Florida, H.

Their main complication is infection, that can even mean their removal. We try to identify the risk factors really involved in this complication and in their removal. We have made a retrospective review of 120 oncologic pediatric patients who received a central venous device between 2003 and 2009. We searched for epidemiologic, clinic, microbiologic and surgical risk factors. We made a comparative data analysis among: GROUP A, children who suffered device infection, GROUP B the others. Group A was divided into early infection (first month after implantation)/late infection, removed/not removed. Data were analized with statistical program SPSS. 29 suffered from leukemia, 19 from lymphoma and the main part, 72, from solid tumour. 31% experienced infection (GROUP A), being early in the 36% of them. 16% had to be withdrawn. Data analysis revealed statistical association with the age (p=0.015) and with the reception of chemiotherapic treatment the week before the surgical insertion. The rest of the studied factors did not revealed a real association, but could be guess a relationship among infection and leukemia, subclavian catheters, those patients whose deviced was introduced using a guide over a previous catheter and also transplanted. Related to early infection the only associateon founded was with the subclavian access (p=0.018). In conclusion, in our serie long-term central venous access infection was more frequent in the younger patients and also in those who had received chemotherapy the week before the catheter implantation. The tendency towards infection in leukemia, transplanted and subclavian carriers has to be studied in a prospective way with a larger number of oncologic children.","['Tardaguila, A R', 'Del Canizo, A', 'Santos, M M', 'Fanjul, M', 'Corona, C', 'Zornoza, M', 'Parente, A', 'Carrera, N', 'Belendez, C', 'Cerda, J', 'Saavedra, J', 'Molina, E', 'Garcia-Casillas, M A', 'Pelaez, D']","['Tardaguila AR', 'Del Canizo A', 'Santos MM', 'Fanjul M', 'Corona C', 'Zornoza M', 'Parente A', 'Carrera N', 'Belendez C', 'Cerda J', 'Saavedra J', 'Molina E', 'Garcia-Casillas MA', 'Pelaez D']","['Servicio de Cirugia Pediatrica, Hospital Gregorio Maranon, Madrid. artardaguila@gmail.com']",['spa'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Spain,Cir Pediatr,Cirugia pediatrica : organo oficial de la Sociedad Espanola de Cirugia Pediatrica,8900492,,2012/11/20 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/11/20 06:00'],"['2012/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Cir Pediatr. 2011 Oct;24(4):208-13.,,IM,,"['Catheter-Related Infections/*etiology/*prevention & control', 'Catheters, Indwelling/*adverse effects', 'Central Venous Catheters/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,,,,,,,"Dispositivos intravasculares centrales de insercion subcutanea en el paciente oncologico pediatrico, inverted question markpodemos minimizar su infeccion?",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Patients with high gonadotoxic risk are included in the Oncology Paediatric Fertility Preservation Programme: those receiving pelvic radiotherapy, bone marrow transplantation, high doses of cranial radiotherapy or alquilating agents, or those with bilateral ovarian pathology. Prior to the oncological treatment, the ovarian tissue is harvested laparoscopically. At the same time, other invasive procedures are done. Once malignancy is ruled out of the specimen and the presence of primordial follicles is confirmed, the multidisciplinary team of oncologist, paediatric surgeon and fertility specialist coordinate the processing and delivery of the ovarian cortex to the Comunidad Valenciana Tissue Bank. RESULTS: From July 2008 to May 2010 eight patients have been included in the programme, aged between 8-18 years old and with diagnosis of: Hodgkin's lymphoma (n= 2), Acute Myeloblastic and Lymphoblastic leukaemia (n= 2), pelvic Ewing's sarcoma, bilateral ovarian Teratoma and Meduloblastoma. Five patients underwent non gonadotoxic chemotherapy before OCC. Six additional procedures were done using the same anaesthetic event. Partial oophorectomy was performed in half the cases, total oophorectomy in the rest of them, and an ovarian pexia was once associated. All taken samples were found to be valid. CONCLUSIONS: OCC of selected patients was performed safely, with neither postoperative complications nor delay of the oncological treatment.

Here, we have used a cross-species functional genomic approach to identify conserved genetic interactions to improve therapeutic effect of the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) valproic acid, which increases survival in more than 20% of patients with advanced acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Using a bidirectional synthetic lethality screen revealing genes that increased or decreased VPA sensitivity in C. elegans, we identified novel conserved sensitizers and synthetic lethal interactors of VPA. One sensitizer identified as a conserved determinant of therapeutic success of HDACi was UTX (KDM6A), which demonstrates a functional relationship between protein acetylation and lysine-specific methylation. The synthetic lethal screen identified resistance programs that compensated for the HDACi-induced global hyper-acetylation, and confirmed MAPKAPK2, HSP90AA1, HSP90AB1 and ACTB as conserved hubs in a resistance program for HDACi that are drugable in human AML cell lines. Hence, these resistance hubs represent promising novel targets for refinement of combinatorial epigenetic anti-cancer therapy.","['Forthun, Rakel Brendsdal', 'Sengupta, Tanima', 'Skjeldam, Hanne Kim', 'Lindvall, Jessica Margareta', 'McCormack, Emmet', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore', 'Nilsen, Hilde']","['Forthun RB', 'Sengupta T', 'Skjeldam HK', 'Lindvall JM', 'McCormack E', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Nilsen H']","['Institute of Medicine, Hematology Section, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121114,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC3498369,2012/11/17 06:00,2013/05/10 06:00,['2012/11/17 06:00'],"['2012/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0048992 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-12362 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(11):e48992. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0048992.

Excess iron, however, can be cytotoxic. Emerging evidence suggests that radioresistance can be achieved in lower organisms by the protection of proteins, but not DNA, immediately following ionizing radiation (IR) exposure, allowing for improved DNA repair. One potential mechanism for protein protection is controlling and limiting the amount of free iron in cells, as has been demonstrated in the extremophile Deinococcus Radiodurans, reducing the potential for oxidative damage to proteins during exposure to IR. We found that iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1) expression was markedly reduced in human myeloid leukemia HL60 cells resistant to low linear energy transfer (LET) gamma rays, but not to high LET alpha particles. Stable knockdown of IRP1 by short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) interference in radiosensitive parental cells led to radioresistance to low LET IR, reduced intracellular Fenton chemistry, reduced protein oxidation, and more rapid DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. The mechanism of radioresistance appeared to be related to attenuated free radical-mediated cell death. Control of intracellular iron by IRPs may be a novel radioresistance mechanism in mammalian cells.","['Haro, Kurtis J', 'Sheth, Aneesh', 'Scheinberg, David A']","['Haro KJ', 'Sheth A', 'Scheinberg DA']","['Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry Program and Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121114,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC3498264,2012/11/17 06:00,2013/05/10 06:00,['2012/11/17 06:00'],"['2012/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0048841 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-11363 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(11):e48841. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0048841.

In this study, 49 Japanese patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) were followed up for 5 years after treatment with a definitive 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/cisplatin (CDDP)-based chemoradiotherapy (CRT), and the effects of genotypes of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were retrospectively revaluated in terms of prediction of long-term survival. METHODS: A course consisted of the continuous infusion of 5-FU at 400 mg/m(2)/day for days 1-5 and 8-12, the infusion of CDDP at 40 mg/m(2)/day on days 1 and 8, and radiation at 2 Gy/day on days 1 to 5, 8 to 12, and 15 to 19, with a second course repeated after a 2-week interval. The VEGF genotypes -1498T/C, -1154G/A, -634C/G, -7C/T, 936C/T, and 1612G/A were evaluated. RESULTS: The complete response (CR) rate was 46.9% (23/49). The 5-year survival rate was 42.9 % (21/49). There were 7 patients with a CR, but survival of less than 5 years. They died from myocardial infarction (N=1), sudden cardiac death after suffering from heart failure (N=1), acute myeloid leukemia that developed from myelodysplastic syndromes (N=1), factors not specified (N=2), oropharynx cancer (N=1), and tongue cancer (N=1). VEGF -634C/G had no effect on clinical response, but long-term survival depended on the genotype (p=0.033, Fisher's; p=0.038, Cochran-Armitage; p=0.079, Log-rank). The genotype frequency of 7 patients with a CR, but survival of less than 5 years was different from that for the other 42 patients (p=0.032, Fisher's). None of the other 5 genotypes evaluated affected either clinical response or survival. CONCLUSIONS: VEGF -634C/G is possibly predictive of long-term survival after treatment with a definitive 5-FU/CDDP-based CRT.

We therefore studied its expression and function in cluster of differentiation 34-positive (CD34(+)) primary human hematopoietic progenitor cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CD34(+) cells were differentiated into various myeloid lineages using the appropriate cytokines. EVI1 expression was measured by quantitative real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and intranuclear fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Experimental manipulation of EVI1 levels was achieved using retroviral infection. RESULTS: EVI1 mRNA and its variant myelodysplastic syndrome 1 (MDS1)/EVI1, which gives rise to a partially antagonistic protein, were detectable in CD34(+) cells, but their levels declined rapidly during differentiation into the granulocyte, monocyte, dendritic, erythroid, and megakaryocyte lineages. Similarly, EVI1 protein levels decreased during myeloid differentiation. Attempts to experimentally express EVI1 in CD34(+) and U937 cells indicated that ectopic expression of EVI1 may cause growth arrest, apoptosis and/or senescence of human hematopoietic cells. CONCLUSION: EVI1 is expressed in human hematopoietic progenitor cells, but is down-regulated during differentiation.

The cell death of HSC-2 and HSC-4 cells was significantly inhibited by pre-treatment with caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK) and autophagy inhibitors (3-methyladenine, bafilomycin A1), respectively. The present study demonstrated that SN-38 is highly cytotoxic to OSCC cell lines, regardless of the type of induced cell death, suggesting its future application for chemotherapy of OSCC.","['Tamura, Nozomi', 'Hirano, Kumi', 'Kishino, Kaori', 'Hashimoto, Ken', 'Amano, Osamu', 'Shimada, Jun', 'Sakagami, Hiroshi']","['Tamura N', 'Hirano K', 'Kishino K', 'Hashimoto K', 'Amano O', 'Shimada J', 'Sakagami H']","['Division of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Meikai University School of Dentistry, Sakado, Saitama 350-0283, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,,2012/11/17 06:00,2013/03/05 06:00,['2012/11/17 06:00'],"['2012/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [medline]']",['32/11/4823 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2012 Nov;32(11):4823-32.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Topoisomerase Inhibitors)', '7673326042 (Irinotecan)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Camptothecin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Irinotecan', 'Mouth Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Topoisomerase Inhibitors/*pharmacology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The general aim of the present work was to explore novel ways to take advantage of the anti-leukemic potential of ATRA, and, specifically, to search for a synergism between ATRA and epigenetic drugs. Because previous reports have found no major influence of ATRA on DNA methylation, we investigated whether ATRA-mediated differentiation of the U937 and HL-60 AML cell lines, both lacking a PML-retinoic acid receptor (RAR) fusion product, is accompanied by early-appearing and weak changes in CpG methylation. We report that in HL-60 cells, by using a highly quantitative analysis of a set of genes found to be abnormally expressed in AML, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified p16 gene promoter molecules (each with 15 CpG sites), exhibited a CpG methylation level of 0-4% in untreated cells, which increased to 4-21% after treatment with ATRA for seven days. In contrast to HL-60 cells, U937 cells exhibited a very high CpG methylation level in p16, and ATRA did not influence the promoter methylation of this gene. In the total CCGG sites of the genome, analysed using a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme, CpG methylation was significantly lower in ATRA-treated HL-60 (p<0.01) and U937 cells (p<0.05) than in controls. Taken together, our findings show that ATRA can influence DNA methylation, and suggest that future research should investigate whether epigenetic modulation may evoke a clinical effect of ATRA in leukemia.","['Miftakhova, Regina', 'Sandberg, Tove', 'Hedblom, Andreas', 'Nevzorova, Tatyana', 'Persson, Jenny L', 'Bredberg, Anders']","['Miftakhova R', 'Sandberg T', 'Hedblom A', 'Nevzorova T', 'Persson JL', 'Bredberg A']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Skane University Hospital, Lund University, 205 02 Malmo, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,,2012/11/17 06:00,2013/03/05 06:00,['2012/11/17 06:00'],"['2012/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [medline]']",['32/11/4715 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2012 Nov;32(11):4715-22.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CDKN2A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'CpG Islands', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",,,,,,,,,['Anticancer Res. 2013 Apr;33(4):1783'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sixty-six novel 6,7-annulated-4-substituted indole compounds were synthesized, using a strategic combination of 6,7-indolyne cycloaddition and cross-coupling reactions under both Suzuki-Miyaura and Buchwald-Hartwig conditions, and tested for their effectiveness against murine L1210 tumor cell proliferation in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Various markers of tumor cell metabolism, DNA degradation, mitotic disruption, cytokinesis and apoptosis were assayed in vitro to evaluate drug cytotoxicity. RESULTS: Most compounds inhibited the metabolic activity of leukemic cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner but only 9 of them were sufficiently potent to inhibit L1210 tumor cell proliferation by 50% in the low-muM range after 2 (IC(50): 4.5-20.4 muM) and 4 days (0.5-4.0 muM) in culture. However, the antiproliferative compounds that were the most effective at day 4 were not necessarily the most potent at day 2, suggesting different speeds of action. A 3-h treatment with antiproliferative annulated indole was sufficient to inhibit, in a concentration-dependent manner, the rate of DNA synthesis measured in L1210 cells over a 0.5-h period of pulse-labeling with (3)H-thymidine. Four of the antiproliferative compounds had weak DNA-binding activities but one compound reduced the fluorescence of the ethidium bromide-DNA complex by up to 53%, suggesting that some annulated indoles might directly interact with double-stranded DNA to disrupt its integrity and prevent the dye from intercalating into DNA base pairs. However, all 9 antiproliferative compounds induced DNA cleavage at 24 h in L1210 cells, containing (3)H-thymidine-prelabeled DNA, suggesting that these antitumor annulated indoles might trigger an apoptotic pathway of DNA fragmentation. Indeed the antiproliferative annulated indoles caused a time-dependent increase of caspase-3 activity with a peak at 6 h. Interestingly, the compounds with the most potent antiproliferative IC(50) values at day 2 were consistently the most effective at inhibiting DNA synthesis at 3 h and inducing DNA fragmentation at 24 h. After 24-48 h, antiproliferative concentrations of annulated indoles increased the mitotic index of L1210 cells and stimulated the formation of many bi-nucleated cells, multi-nucleated cells, apoptotic cells and micronuclei, suggesting that these antitumor compounds might enhance mitotic abnormality, induce chromosomal damage or missegregation, and block cytokinesis to induce apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Although annulated indoles may have interesting bioactivity, novel derivatives with different substitutions must be synthesized to elucidate structure-activity relationships, identify more potent antitumor lead compounds, and investigate their molecular targets and mechanisms of action.","['Perchellet, Jean-Pierre H', 'Waters, Andrew M', 'Perchellet, Elisabeth M', 'Thornton, Paul D', 'Brown, Neil', 'Hill, David', 'Neuenswander, Ben', 'Lushington, Gerald H', 'Santini, Conrad', 'Chandrasoma, Nalin', 'Buszek, Keith R']","['Perchellet JP', 'Waters AM', 'Perchellet EM', 'Thornton PD', 'Brown N', 'Hill D', 'Neuenswander B', 'Lushington GH', 'Santini C', 'Chandrasoma N', 'Buszek KR']","['Anti-Cancer Drug Laboratory, Kansas State University, Division of Biology, Ackert Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506-4901, USA. jpperch@ksu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,PMC4175989,2012/11/17 06:00,2013/03/05 06:00,['2012/11/17 06:00'],"['2012/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [medline]']",['32/11/4671 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2012 Nov;32(11):4671-84.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Indoles)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Indoles/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Mice']",,,,,"['P50 GM069663/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM069711/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '5P50GM069663/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS577721'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sorafenib significantly inhibited osteoclastic formation at clinically achievable concentrations (1-3 muM) and promoted autophagia with minimal induction of apoptosis. At the molecular levels, the M-CSF + RANKL combination increased the expression level of the Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 protein, which is known to play a key role in the control of both cell survival and autophagia. The simultaneous treatment with Sorafenib significantly down-regulated endogenous Mcl-1 expression. Conversely, over-expression of Mcl-1 in primary human macrophages significantly counteracted the anti-osteoclastic activity of Sorafenib, strongly suggesting that Mcl-1 down-regulation played a major role in mediating the inhibitory activity of Sorafenib in cells of the osteoclastic lineage.","['Rimondi, Erika', 'Secchiero, Paola', 'Melloni, Elisabetta', 'Grill, Vittorio', 'Zauli, Giorgio']","['Rimondi E', 'Secchiero P', 'Melloni E', 'Grill V', 'Zauli G']","['Department of Life Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121116,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,,2012/11/17 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2012/11/17 06:00'],"['2012/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-012-9903-x [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2013 Jun;31(3):780-6. doi: 10.1007/s10637-012-9903-x.

We recently reported differential DNA methylation profiles in IGHV-mutated and IGHV-unmutated CLL subgroups. For the first time, we here explore the global methylation profiles of stereotyped subsets with different prognosis, by applying high-resolution methylation arrays on CLL samples from three major stereotyped subsets: the poor-prognostic subsets #1 (n = 15) and #2 (n = 9) and the favorable-prognostic subset #4 (n = 15). Overall, the three subsets exhibited significantly different methylation profiles, which only partially overlapped with those observed in our previous study according to IGHV gene mutational status. Specifically, gene ontology analysis of the differentially methylated genes revealed a clear enrichment of genes involved in immune response, such as B cell activation (e.g., CD80, CD86 and IL10), with higher methylation levels in subset #1 than subsets #2 and #4. Accordingly, higher expression of the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 was demonstrated in subset #4 vs. subset #1, pointing to a key role for these molecules in the crosstalk of CLL subset #4 cells with the microenvironment. In summary, investigation of three prototypic, stereotyped CLL subsets revealed distinct DNA methylation profiles for each subset, which suggests subset-biased patterns of transcriptional control and highlights a key role for epigenetics during leukemogenesis.","['Kanduri, Meena', 'Marincevic, Millaray', 'Halldorsdottir, Anna M', 'Mansouri, Larry', 'Junevik, Katarina', 'Ntoufa, Stavroula', 'Kultima, Hanna Goransson', 'Isaksson, Anders', 'Juliusson, Gunnar', 'Andersson, Per-Ola', 'Ehrencrona, Hans', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas', 'Rosenquist, Richard']","['Kanduri M', 'Marincevic M', 'Halldorsdottir AM', 'Mansouri L', 'Junevik K', 'Ntoufa S', 'Kultima HG', 'Isaksson A', 'Juliusson G', 'Andersson PO', 'Ehrencrona H', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Rosenquist R']","['Institute of Biomedicine, Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121115,United States,Epigenetics,Epigenetics,101265293,PMC3528698,2012/11/17 06:00,2013/06/07 06:00,['2012/11/17 06:00'],"['2012/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/07 06:00 [medline]']","['22901 [pii]', '10.4161/epi.22901 [doi]']",ppublish,Epigenetics. 2012 Dec 1;7(12):1435-42. doi: 10.4161/epi.22901.

METHODS: We used reverse-phase protein microarrays to map the activated protein signaling networks of 47 NSCLC tumors, 28 of which were node negative, which were subjected to tumor cellular enrichment using laser capture microdissection. The phosphorylation/cleavage levels of 111 key signaling proteins and total levels of 17 proteins were measured for broadscale signaling analysis. RESULTS: Pathway activation mapping of NSCLC revealed distinct subgroups composed of epidermal growth factor receptor (ERBB1), v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ERBB2), v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 3 (ERBB3), v-erb-a erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 4 (ERBB4), v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1- mammalian target of rapamycin (AKT-mTOR), protein kinase, AMP-activated, alpha 2 catalytic subunit (AMPK), and autophagy-related signaling, along with transforming growth factor-beta-signaling protein 1 (SMAD), insulin-line growth factor receptor (IGFR), rearranged during transfection proto-oncogene (RET), and activated CDC42-associated kinase (ACK) activation. Investigation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-driven signaling identified a unique cohort of tumors with low EGFR protein expression yet high relative levels of phosphorylated EGFR and high EGFR total protein with low relative levels of phosphorylation. Last, mapping analysis of patients with NSCLC with N0 disease revealed a pilot pathway activation signature composed of linked epidermal growth factor receptor family (HER)-AMPK-AKT-mTOR signaling network along with focal adhesion kinase- LIM domain kinase-1 (FAK-LIMK) and janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) pathways that correlated with short-term survival and aggressive disease. CONCLUSIONS: Functional protein pathway activation mapping of NSCLC reveals distinct activation subgroups that are underpinned by important therapeutic targets and that patients with early-stage node negative disease and poor prognosis may be identified by activation of defined, biochemically linked protein signaling events. Such findings, if confirmed in larger study sets, could help select and stratify patients for personalized targeted therapies.","['Zupa, Angela', 'Improta, Giuseppina', 'Silvestri, Alessandra', 'Pin, Elisa', 'Deng, Jianghong', 'Aieta, Michele', 'Musto, Pellegrino', 'Nitti, Donato', 'Mammano, Enzo', 'Liotta, Lance', 'Belluco, Claudio', 'Wulfkuhle, Julia', 'Petricoin, Emanuel 3rd']","['Zupa A', 'Improta G', 'Silvestri A', 'Pin E', 'Deng J', 'Aieta M', 'Musto P', 'Nitti D', 'Mammano E', 'Liotta L', 'Belluco C', 'Wulfkuhle J', 'Petricoin E 3rd']","['Laboratory of Clinical Research, IRCCS-CROB Rionero in Vulture (PZ) Italy.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Research, IRCCS-CROB Rionero in Vulture (PZ) Italy.', 'CRO-IRCCS, National Cancer Institute, Aviano, Italy.', 'CRO-IRCCS, National Cancer Institute, Aviano, Italy.', 'Center for Applied Proteomics and Molecular Medicine, George Mason University, Manassas Virginia.', 'Department of Onco-haematology I.R.C.C.S Centro di Riferimento, Oncologico di Basilicata- Rionero in Vulture (PZ) Italy.', 'Department of Onco-haematology I.R.C.C.S Centro di Riferimento, Oncologico di Basilicata- Rionero in Vulture (PZ) Italy.', 'University of Padova, Clinica Chirurgica 2, Padova, Italy.', 'University of Padova, Clinica Chirurgica 2, Padova, Italy.', 'CRO-IRCCS, National Cancer Institute, Aviano, Italy.', 'CRO-IRCCS, National Cancer Institute, Aviano, Italy.', 'Center for Applied Proteomics and Molecular Medicine, George Mason University, Manassas Virginia.', 'Center for Applied Proteomics and Molecular Medicine, George Mason University, Manassas Virginia.

We characterized two distinct mechanisms of silencing in embryonic mouse cells infected by Moloney murine leukaemia virus (MLV): a highly efficient one targeting the proline transfer RNA primer-binding site (PBSpro), and a less efficient one operating independently of the PBS. Rare virus-expressing populations were isolated, and the timing and efficiency of establishment of silencing were determined. Superinfection of the selected virus-expressing cells with a second virus carrying a distinguishable reporter revealed that the PBSpro-directed silencing was still largely intact, whereas the PBS-independent silencing was partially reduced. The timing and stability of silencing, and the associated chromatin modifications on newly established and endogenous proviruses were determined. The results indicate that epigenetic mechanisms with different specificity and efficiency are used to silence the exogenous retroviral sequences in embryonic cells.","['Schlesinger, Sharon', 'Goff, Stephen P']","['Schlesinger S', 'Goff SP']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20121116,England,EMBO Rep,EMBO reports,100963049,PMC3537137,2012/11/17 06:00,2013/06/05 06:00,['2012/11/17 06:00'],"['2012/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/15 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['embor2012182 [pii]', '10.1038/embor.2012.182 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO Rep. 2013 Jan;14(1):73-9. doi: 10.1038/embor.2012.182.

In a prospective study we analysed the cognitive functions of ALL survivors in relation to Tau protein as a marker of white matter injury. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-one survivors of childhood ALL (6.3 years after diagnosis); without the signs of CNS involvement, treated with chemotherapy alone, rested in first remission; underwent Intelligence tests- Wechsler Intelligence Scales (WISC-R, WAIS-R). Their results were analyzed in relation to the levels of Tau in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained during the treatment. RESULTS: The analysis showed that all survivors attained the average scores in intelligence tests. A negative correlation was found between methotrexate (MTX) doses and Freedom from Distractibility (FFD). Females had higher values of Performance Intelligence Quotient (PIQ) than males. A negative correlation was noted of Tau protein levels obtained from the last CSF with: Total and Verbal Intelligence Quotient, PIQ, Perceptual Organisation Index and FFD but not with Verbal Comprehension Index. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest the possibility of white matter injury during the treatment for ALL with chemotherapy alone. Elevated Tau protein level in CSF at the end of treatment might indicate future difficulties in neurocognitive functioning.","['Krawczuk-Rybak, M', 'Grabowska, A', 'Protas, P T', 'Muszynska-Roslan, K', 'Holownia, A', 'Braszko, J']","['Krawczuk-Rybak M', 'Grabowska A', 'Protas PT', 'Muszynska-Roslan K', 'Holownia A', 'Braszko J']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland. rybak@umwb.edu.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Adv Med Sci,Advances in medical sciences,101276222,,2012/11/17 06:00,2013/09/07 06:00,['2012/11/17 06:00'],"['2012/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2478/v10039-012-0035-5 [doi]', 'S1896-1126(14)60084-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Adv Med Sci. 2012;57(2):266-72. doi: 10.2478/v10039-012-0035-5.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (MAPT protein, human)', '0 (tau Proteins)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Biomarkers/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Brain Injuries/cerebrospinal fluid/*etiology/psychology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition Disorders/cerebrospinal fluid/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intelligence', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/cerebrospinal fluid/*psychology/therapy', 'tau Proteins/*cerebrospinal fluid']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUMMARY ANSWER: Menopause occurred at a median age of 44 years in this cohort which is earlier than in the general population, but premature menopause was uncommon. Main risk factors for non-surgical menopause were exposure to and dose of alkylating agents, especially during adolescence, radiation dose to the ovaries and oophorectomy. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: While survivors of childhood cancer are known to be at increased risk for developing premature menopause, data on its risk factors are limited. STUDY DESIGN: A cohort study of 1109 still-living female survivors of childhood solid cancer treated between 1945 and 1985, of whom 863 (78%) returned a follow-up questionnaire. Of them, 157 were excluded. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Seven hundred and six women, among whom 32% have attained 40 years of age, were included in this study. A Cox regression model was used to determine risk factors influencing the age at menopause. MAIN RESULTS: Ninety seven women have reached menopause at a median age of 44 years. Menopause has been surgically induced in 36% of women. In multivariate analysis, risk factors for non-surgical menopause included exposure to alkylating agents, increasing radiation dose to the ovaries, procarbazine dose, cyclophosphamide dose and unilateral oophorectomy. The highest risk ratio for non-surgical menopause was observed for women treated after the onset of puberty with alkylating agents, either alone (RR = 9, 95% CI: 2.7-28, P = 0.0003) or associated with even a low dose of radiation to the ovaries (RR = 29, 95% CI: 8-108, P < 0.0001). Exposure to unilateral oophorectomy is associated with a 7-year earlier age at menopause. By the age of 40, only 2.1% had non-surgical premature menopause and its main risk factors were age at diagnosis, cyclophosphamide dose, exposure to melphalan and radiation dose to the ovaries. LIMITATIONS: The information on menopause was based on self-reported data without confirmation by FSH levels. Participants to this study have been treated for cancer from 1945 to 1985 and one can expect an increase in premature menopause incidence with more recent protocols using high-dose alkylating agents. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This study provides data on risk factors for a reduced fertility window in order to inform survivors at risk and help oncologists to design new therapeutic protocols avoiding this risk. This study does not confirm the high rate of premature menopause reported by the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, but this population differs from theirs (no leukemia and a lower percentage of lymphoma).","['Thomas-Teinturier, Cecile', 'El Fayech, Chiraz', 'Oberlin, Odile', 'Pacquement, Helene', 'Haddy, Nadia', 'Labbe, Martine', 'Veres, Cristina', 'Guibout, Catherine', 'Diallo, Ibrahima', 'De Vathaire, Florent']","['Thomas-Teinturier C', 'El Fayech C', 'Oberlin O', 'Pacquement H', 'Haddy N', 'Labbe M', 'Veres C', 'Guibout C', 'Diallo I', 'De Vathaire F']","['Radiation Epidemiology Group, Center for Research in Epidemiology and Population Health (CESP) - INSERM U1018, Villejuif F-94800, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121115,England,Hum Reprod,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",8701199,,2012/11/17 06:00,2013/07/26 06:00,['2012/11/17 06:00'],"['2012/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/26 06:00 [medline]']","['des391 [pii]', '10.1093/humrep/des391 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Reprod. 2013 Feb;28(2):488-95. doi: 10.1093/humrep/des391.

The state of leukemia treatment in the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s is reviewed, the discovery of the two drugs in question described, and the introduction of clinical trials to reach an optimal regimen for their use delineated. During the 1950s, following World War Two and after a period of civil reconstitution, a national effort, facilitated by the U.S. Congress and federal investments in the National Cancer Institute, was initiated to enhance cancer therapy in the United States. The development of mouse models of leukemia and advances in understanding the structure and function of DNA and RNA and the process of cell proliferation provided new targets for drug development and new concepts for their use. The year, 2013, marks the 40th year that this protocol, 7+3, is the method of induction of remission for most patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. Its inadequacies also are made clear. Many patients with the disease die soon after diagnosis, and patients who have more unfavorable oncogenetic subtypes, intrinsically drug resistant cells, and greater intolerance to therapy make up the vast majority of the affected and few are cured. It is evident to all that new paradigms are needed if acute myelogenous leukemia is to be subdued in most patients with the disease.","['Lichtman, Marshall A']",['Lichtman MA'],"['University of Rochester Medical Center, 601 Elmwood Avenue, Rochester, NY 14642, USA. mal@urmc.rochester.edu']",['eng'],"['Autobiography', 'Biography', 'Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",20121112,United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,,2012/11/17 06:00,2013/07/05 06:00,['2012/11/17 06:00'],"['2012/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S1079-9796(12)00191-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2012.10.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2013 Feb;50(2):119-30. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2012.10.005.

Until recently, the only treatment was bone marrow transplantation, but, over the past few years, a new therapeutic approach based on immunomodulatory drugs (IMiD) has been developed. IMiDs belong to a therapeutic class whose progenitor is thalidomide, a synthetic derivative of glutamate that was initially used because of its sedative and antiemetic properties but was then withdrawn because of its teratogenic effects. IMiDs represent a major advance in the treatment of multiple myeloma at different disease stages, 5q minus syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia with the 5q deletion, mantle cell lymphoma, relapsing or unresponsive high-grade lymphoma, and relapsing indolent lymphoma. METHODS: Medical databases and conference proceedings were searched to identify articles and clinical trials that have investigated or are investigating the use of IMiDs on MDS. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: An important part of their in vivo efficacy is attributed to their immunomodulatory properties because they potentiate the immune response by restoring dendritic cell function and inhibiting T-cell regulatory activity, which leads to the activation of T lymphocytes and natural killer T cells by increasing the production of interleukin-2 and interferon gamma. IMiDs are characterized by antitumoral and antiangiogenic activities, and they also induce the apoptosis of neoplastic cells. Thalidomide and its derivative lenalidomide have been proposed for the treatment of MDS because of their action on the immune mechanisms that appear to play an important role in the pathophysiology of this syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: This article examines the pharmacology and molecular action of IMiDs and the evidence of their efficacy in treating patients with MDS in different risk classes.","['Castelli, Roberto', 'Cassin, Ramona', 'Cannavo, Antonino', 'Cugno, Massimo']","['Castelli R', 'Cassin R', 'Cannavo A', 'Cugno M']","['Department of Pathophysiology and Transplantation, Section of Internal Medicine, University of Milan, Milan, Italy. roberto.castelli@unimi.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20121113,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,,2012/11/17 06:00,2013/11/16 06:00,['2012/11/17 06:00'],"['2012/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/24 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(12)00200-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2012.09.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2013 Feb;13(1):1-7. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2012.09.016.

Furthermore, both the percentage of CD4(+) cells and CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio in peripheral blood cells were significantly enhanced by this combined administration, while the CD4(+) cells was only slightly increased and CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio was not affected by Combivir alone. Additionally, combination of APS-1 and Combivir also alleviated the toxicity of Combivir. APS-1 not only increased the survival rate of mice administered with LD(50) dose of Combivir, but also reduced the hematologic toxicity induced by Combivir, RBC, HGB and PLT were restored to normal level. These results suggest that APS-1 had synergistic effect with Combivir, which provided new insight into the potential clinical use of polysaccharide sulfate in anti-AIDS field.","['Yang, Tiehong', 'Jia, Min', 'Yue, Zhenggang', 'Cheng, Ying', 'Zhang, Xinxin', 'Huang, Junjie', 'Zhou, Siyuan', 'Mei, Qibing']","['Yang T', 'Jia M', 'Yue Z', 'Cheng Y', 'Zhang X', 'Huang J', 'Zhou S', 'Mei Q']","[""Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an 710032, China. thyang72@hotmail.com""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121112,Netherlands,Int J Biol Macromol,International journal of biological macromolecules,7909578,,2012/11/17 06:00,2013/06/05 06:00,['2012/11/17 06:00'],"['2012/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/20 00:00 [revised]', '2012/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0141-8130(12)00435-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2012.11.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Biol Macromol. 2013 Feb;53:122-6. doi: 10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2012.11.006.

Epithelial cells grown alone or in co-culture with stromal cells (ESC) were treated with E(2) or P(4), or both. Homogeneity of the endometrial cell populations was ascertained immunocytochemically. The quantities of cytokines secreted in this system were assessed by ELISA and their protein expression by Western blot. The exposure of EEC to P(4) alone or in combination with E(2) significantly increased the amount of TGF-beta1, TNF-alpha and IL-18 secretion, whereas E(2) had no effect on the synthesis of these cytokines. When epithelial cells were co-cultured with ESC, the secretion of TGF-beta1, TNF-alpha and IL-18 by EEC significantly increased compared to that by EEC alone. However, the treatment with both steroids decreased the secretion of TNF-alpha, IL-18 and TGF-beta1 by EEC in the presence of ESC. In contrast to TGF-beta1, TNF-alpha and IL-18, the secretion of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) by EEC was not affected by E(2) and/or P(4) either directly or indirectly. The present results indicate that the interactions between caprine endometrial stromal and epithelial cells can modulate the secretion of TGF-beta1, TNF-alpha and IL-18 by EEC exposed to E(2) and/or P(4)in vitro.","['Qi, Xuefeng', 'Qu, Yanyan', 'Nan, Zhichun', 'Jin, Yaping', 'Zhao, Xianjun', 'Wang, Aihua']","['Qi X', 'Qu Y', 'Nan Z', 'Jin Y', 'Zhao X', 'Wang A']","['College of Veterinary Medicine of Northwest A&F University, Yangling, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121017,Poland,Reprod Biol,Reproductive biology,101160559,,2012/11/17 06:00,2013/04/30 06:00,['2012/11/17 06:00'],"['2011/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2012/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S1642-431X(12)00004-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.repbio.2012.09.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Reprod Biol. 2012 Nov;12(3):309-15. doi: 10.1016/j.repbio.2012.09.003.

CLL can also present as bleeding, rarely isolated. We report a rare case of CLL the first symptoms of which were recurrent epistaxis and asymptomatic intraoral swelling. CASE PRESENTATION: A 74-year-old woman consulted for recurrent epistaxis. She presented with a small asymptomatic swelling in the left superior vestibule. Computed tomography revealed a tissular-like mass without invasion of surrounding tissues. The hemogram revealed thrombocytopenia and leukocytosis with 51% of lymphocytes. The immuno-histochemical analysis of the lesion and of the bone marrow allowed diagnosing stage IV CLL. DISCUSSION: CLL may present as unusual symptoms. It should be suspected in elderly patients presenting with atypical clinical signs such as oral swelling or signs of bone marrow involvement.","['Alessandrini, M', 'Micarelli, A', 'Mugnaini, F', 'De Padova, A', 'Pavone, I', 'Bruno, E']","['Alessandrini M', 'Micarelli A', 'Mugnaini F', 'De Padova A', 'Pavone I', 'Bruno E']","['ENT Department of ""Tor Vergata"", University Hospital; Viale Oxford, 81 00133 Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20121113,France,Rev Stomatol Chir Maxillofac,Revue de stomatologie et de chirurgie maxillo-faciale,0201010,,2012/11/17 06:00,2013/05/28 06:00,['2012/11/17 06:00'],"['2011/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/05 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0035-1768(12)00157-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.stomax.2012.10.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Stomatol Chir Maxillofac. 2012 Dec;113(6):455-7. doi: 10.1016/j.stomax.2012.10.001.

These phenotypes are a consequence of developmental arrest at an intermediate/late stage of B-lineage maturation. Additionally, inhibition of pre-BCR signaling induces further ROR1 upregulation, and we identify distinct ROR1 and pre-BCR downstream signaling pathways that are modulated in a counterbalancing manner-both leading to AKT phosphorylation. Consistent with this, AKT phosphorylation is transiently eliminated after dasatinib treatment, but is partially restored following dasatinib potentiation of ROR1 expression.

Previous studies have suggested that exposure to pesticides may increase the risk of childhood cancer; however, few studies have focused on pyrethroid metabolites. We investigated five nonspecific metabolites of pyrethroid pesticides found in children's urine and examined the correlation with childhood leukemia. We conducted a hospital-based case-control study of childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) in Shanghai between 2010 and 2011. The study included 176 children aged 0-14 years and 180 controls matched for age and sex.

Of note, DNA methylation of tumor suppressor miRNAs has been implicated in various human cancers. Moreover, miRNA silencing mediated by aberrant promoter DNA methylation can potentially be reversed by hypomethylating agents, and hence may pose a new therapeutic target in cancer.

New therapeutic agents to overcome drug-resistant tumors are urgently needed. Cyrtosperma johnstonii N.E. Br. (Araceae) is used for treatment of cancer in Thai traditional medicine. This study aimed to evaluate antioxidant activity and cytotoxicity of C. johnstonii extracts on human cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dried powder of C. johnstonii rhizomes was extracted with several solvents. The 0.1 mg/ml extract solution was tested for antioxidant activity by 2,2'-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. Color formation from 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide was used to determine cell viability. Standardization of the extract was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with photodiode array detector at 254 and 360 nm. Cell cycle arrest was evaluated by flow cytometry after 5 min, 12 h and 24 h treated with 20 microg/ml of the acetone extract. RESULTS: The acetone extract exhibited the highest phenolic content and antioxidant activity (TEAC and EC values = 19.2 +/- 0.14 and 19.2 +/- 0.31 mM/mg, respectively). The IC(5)(0) values for leukemia ranged from 11 +/- 1 to 29 +/- 3 microg/ml and from 5 +/- 2 to 6 +/- 0 microg/ml for small cell lung carcinoma cells. Cell cycle arrest occurred at the G2/M phase followed by apoptosis. HPLC analysis revealed that rutin is the major constituents of the extract. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The acetone extract of C. johnstoni is a promising source of natural antioxidants and anticancer. The extract inhibits cancer cells effectively with less effect on normal cells.","['Okonogi, Siriporn', 'Khonkarn, Ruttiros', 'Mankhetkorn, Samlee', 'Unger, Frank M', 'Viernstein, Helmut']","['Okonogi S', 'Khonkarn R', 'Mankhetkorn S', 'Unger FM', 'Viernstein H']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Science, Faculty of Pharmacy, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand. sirioko@chiangmai.ac.th']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121115,England,Pharm Biol,Pharmaceutical biology,9812552,,2012/11/17 06:00,2013/08/10 06:00,['2012/11/17 06:00'],"['2012/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/13880209.2012.729064 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharm Biol. 2013 Mar;51(3):329-38. doi: 10.3109/13880209.2012.729064.

The classic model of haematopoiesis divides cells into two families, myeloid and lymphoid, and dictates a route to a particular cell fate. New discoveries question these long-held principles, including: (i) the identification of lineage-biased cells that self-renew; (ii) a strict myeloid/lymphoid dichotomy is refuted by the existence of progenitors with lymphoid potential and an incomplete set of myeloid potentials; (iii) there are multiple routes to some end cell types; and (iv) thymocyte progenitor cells that have progressed some way along this pathway retain clandestine myeloid options. In essence, the progeny of HSC are more versatile and the process of haematopoiesis is more flexible than previously thought. Here we examine this new way of viewing haematopoiesis and the impact of rewriting an account of haematopoiesis on our understanding of what goes awry in leukaemia.","['Brown, Geoffrey', 'Hughes, Philip J', 'Ceredig, Rhodri']","['Brown G', 'Hughes PJ', 'Ceredig R']","['School of Immunity and Infection, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK. g.brown@bham.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20121115,England,Crit Rev Clin Lab Sci,Critical reviews in clinical laboratory sciences,8914816,,2012/11/17 06:00,2013/09/24 06:00,['2012/11/17 06:00'],"['2012/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10408363.2012.742487 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Rev Clin Lab Sci. 2012 Sep-Dec;49(5-6):232-40. doi: 10.3109/10408363.2012.742487.

It is based on the interpretation of results from different laboratory analyses, which range from microscopy to gene expression profiling. Recently, a method for the analysis of RNA phenotypes has been developed, the nCounter technology (Nanostring(R) Technologies), which allows for simultaneous quantification of hundreds of RNA molecules in biological samples. We evaluated this technique in a Swiss multi-center study on eighty-six samples from acute leukemia patients. METHODS: mRNA and protein profiles were established for normal peripheral blood and bone marrow samples. Signal intensities of the various tested antigens with surface expression were similar to those found in previously performed Affymetrix microarray analyses. Acute leukemia samples were analyzed for a set of twenty-two validated antigens and the Pearson Correlation Coefficient for nCounter and flow cytometry results was calculated. RESULTS: Highly significant values between 0.40 and 0.97 were found for the twenty-two antigens tested. A second correlation analysis performed on a per sample basis resulted in concordant results between flow cytometry and nCounter in 44-100% of the antigens tested (mean = 76%), depending on the number of blasts present in a sample, the homogeneity of the blast population, and the type of leukemia (AML or ALL). CONCLUSIONS: The nCounter technology allows for fast and easy depiction of a mRNA profile from hematologic samples. This technology has the potential to become a valuable tool for the diagnosis of acute leukemias, in addition to multi-color flow cytometry.","['Fernandez, Paula', 'Solenthaler, Max', 'Spertini, Olivier', 'Quarroz, Stephane', 'Rovo, Alicia', 'Lovey, Pierre-Yves', 'Leoncini, Leda', 'Ruault-Jungblut, Sylvie', ""D'Asaro, Mathilde"", 'Schaad, Olivier', 'Docquier, Mylene', 'Descombes, Patrick', 'Matthes, Thomas']","['Fernandez P', 'Solenthaler M', 'Spertini O', 'Quarroz S', 'Rovo A', 'Lovey PY', 'Leoncini L', 'Ruault-Jungblut S', ""D'Asaro M"", 'Schaad O', 'Docquier M', 'Descombes P', 'Matthes T']","['Kantonsspital Aarau, Aarau, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121109,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC3494663,2012/11/16 06:00,2013/05/02 06:00,['2012/11/16 06:00'],"['2012/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0049010 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-12565 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(11):e49010. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0049010.

APL is associated with chromosomal aberrations, including t(15;17) and t(11;17). For these two translocations, the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) is fused to the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene or the promyelocytic zinc finger (PLZF) gene, respectively. Both fusion proteins lead to the formation of a high-molecular-weight complex. High-molecular-weight complexes are caused by the ""coiled-coil"" domain of PML or the BTB/POZ domain of PLZF. PML/RARalpha without the ""coiled-coil"" fails to block differentiation and mediates an all-trans retinoic acid-response. Similarly, mutations in the BTB/POZ domain disrupt the high-molecular-weight complex, abolishing the leukemic potential of PLZF/RARalpha. Specific interfering polypeptides were used to target the oligomerization domain of PML/RARalpha or PLZF/RARalpha. PML/RARalpha and PLZF/RARalpha were analyzed for the ability to form high-molecular-weight complexes, the protein stability and the potential to induce a leukemic phenotype in the presence of the interfering peptides. Expression of these interfering peptides resulted in a reduced replating efficiency and overcame the differentiation block induced by PML/RARalpha and PLZF/RARalpha in murine hematopoietic stem cells. This expression also destabilized the PLZF/RARalpha-induced high-molecular-weight complex formation and caused the degradation of the fusion protein. Targeting fusion proteins through interfering peptides is a promising approach to further elucidate the biology of leukemia.","['Beez, Sabine', 'Demmer, Philipp', 'Puccetti, Elena']","['Beez S', 'Demmer P', 'Puccetti E']","['Institute of Molecular Biology and Tumor Research, Philipps University, Marburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121109,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC3494703,2012/11/16 06:00,2013/05/02 06:00,['2012/11/16 06:00'],"['2012/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0048636 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-11593 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(11):e48636. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0048636.

Thus, cases with a high number of 13q- cells (13q-H) had both shorter overall survival and time to first therapy. The goal of the study was to analyze the genetic profile of 13q-H patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 102 samples were studied, 32 of which served as a validation cohort and five were healthy donors. RESULTS: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with higher percentages of 13q- cells (>80%) showed a different level of gene expression as compared to patients with lower percentages (<80%, 13q-L). This deregulation affected genes involved in apoptosis and proliferation (BCR and NFkB signaling), leading to increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis in 13q-H patients. Deregulation of several microRNAs, such as miR-15a, miR-155, miR-29a and miR-223, was also observed in these patients. In addition, our study also suggests that the gene expression pattern of 13q-H cases could be similar to the patients with 11q- or 17p-. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new evidence regarding the heterogeneity of 13q deletion in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, showing that apoptosis, proliferation as well as miRNA regulation are involved in cases with higher percentages of 13q- cells.","['Rodriguez, Ana Eugenia', 'Hernandez, Jose Angel', 'Benito, Rocio', 'Gutierrez, Norma C', 'Garcia, Juan Luis', 'Hernandez-Sanchez, Maria', 'Risueno, Alberto', 'Sarasquete, M Eugenia', 'Ferminan, Encarna', 'Fisac, Rosa', 'de Coca, Alfonso Garcia', 'Martin-Nunez, Guillermo', 'de Las Heras, Natalia', 'Recio, Isabel', 'Gutierrez, Oliver', 'De Las Rivas, Javier', 'Gonzalez, Marcos', 'Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus M']","['Rodriguez AE', 'Hernandez JA', 'Benito R', 'Gutierrez NC', 'Garcia JL', 'Hernandez-Sanchez M', 'Risueno A', 'Sarasquete ME', 'Ferminan E', 'Fisac R', 'de Coca AG', 'Martin-Nunez G', 'de Las Heras N', 'Recio I', 'Gutierrez O', 'De Las Rivas J', 'Gonzalez M', 'Hernandez-Rivas JM']","['IBSAL,IBMCC, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, Universidad de Salamanca-CSIC, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121113,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC3496725,2012/11/16 06:00,2013/05/02 06:00,['2012/11/16 06:00'],"['2012/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0048485 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-20428 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(11):e48485. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0048485.

In the present study, we elucidated the DNA methylome in primary acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and the role of promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML-RARalpha) in establishing these patterns. Cells from APL patients showed increased genome-wide DNA methylation with higher variability than healthy CD34(+) cells, promyelocytes, and remission BM cells. A core set of differentially methylated regions in APL was identified. Age at diagnosis, Sanz score, and Flt3-mutation status characterized methylation subtypes. Transcription factor-binding sites (eg, the c-myc-binding sites) were associated with low methylation. However, SUZ12- and REST-binding sites identified in embryonic stem cells were preferentially DNA hypermethylated in APL cells. Unexpectedly, PML-RARalpha-binding sites were also protected from aberrant DNA methylation in APL cells. Consistent with this, myeloid cells from preleukemic PML-RARalpha knock-in mice did not show altered DNA methylation and the expression of PML-RARalpha in hematopoietic progenitor cells prevented differentiation without affecting DNA methylation. Treatment of APL blasts with all-trans retinoic acid also did not result in immediate DNA methylation changes. The results of the present study suggest that aberrant DNA methylation is associated with leukemia phenotype but is not required for PML-RARalpha-mediated initiation of leukemogenesis.","['Schoofs, Till', 'Rohde, Christian', 'Hebestreit, Katja', 'Klein, Hans-Ulrich', 'Gollner, Stefanie', 'Schulze, Isabell', 'Lerdrup, Mads', 'Dietrich, Nikolaj', 'Agrawal-Singh, Shuchi', 'Witten, Anika', 'Stoll, Monika', 'Lengfelder, Eva', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Schlenke, Peter', 'Buchner, Thomas', 'Hansen, Klaus', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Rosenbauer, Frank', 'Dugas, Martin', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten']","['Schoofs T', 'Rohde C', 'Hebestreit K', 'Klein HU', 'Gollner S', 'Schulze I', 'Lerdrup M', 'Dietrich N', 'Agrawal-Singh S', 'Witten A', 'Stoll M', 'Lengfelder E', 'Hofmann WK', 'Schlenke P', 'Buchner T', 'Hansen K', 'Berdel WE', 'Rosenbauer F', 'Dugas M', 'Muller-Tidow C']","['Department of Medicine A, Hematology, Oncology and Pneumology, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121114,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2012/11/16 06:00,2013/02/26 06:00,['2012/11/16 06:00'],"['2012/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47337-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-08-448860 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Jan 3;121(1):178-87. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-08-448860.

To test the role of the fusion protein's C-terminus in vivo, we generated knock-in mice expressing a C-terminally truncated CBFbeta-SMMHC (CBFbeta-SMMHCDeltaC95). Embryos with a single copy of CBFbeta-SMMHCDeltaC95 were viable and showed no defects in hematopoiesis, whereas embryos homozygous for the CBFbeta-SMMHCDeltaC95 allele had hematopoietic defects and died in mid-gestation, similar to embryos with a single-copy of the full-length CBFbeta-SMMHC.

Interactions between the glycoprotein cytoplasmic tail and the matrix domain of Gag are thought to direct recruitment of glycoproteins to native virions for many retroviruses. However, retroviruses can also incorporate glycoproteins from other viruses to form infectious virions known as pseudotyped particles. The glycoprotein murine leukemia virus (MLV) Env can readily form pseudotyped particles with many retroviruses, suggesting a generic mechanism for recruitment. Here, we sought to identify which components of Gag, particularly the matrix domain, contribute to recruitment of MLV Env into retroviral particles. Unexpectedly, we discovered that the matrix domain of HIV-1 Gag is dispensable for generic recruitment, since it could be replaced with a nonviral membrane-binding domain without blocking active incorporation of MLV Env into HIV virions. However, MLV Env preferentially assembles with MLV virions. When MLV and HIV particles are produced from the same cell, MLV Env is packaged almost exclusively by MLV particles, thus preventing incorporation into HIV particles. Surprisingly, the matrix domain of MLV Gag is not required for this selectivity, since MLV Gag containing the matrix domain from HIV is still able to outcompete HIV particles for MLV Env. Although MLV Gag is sufficient for selective incorporation to occur, no single Gag domain dictates the selectivity. Our findings indicate that Env recruitment is more complex than previously believed and that Gag assembly/budding sites have fundamental properties that affect glycoprotein incorporation.","['Gregory, Devon A', 'Lyddon, Terri D', 'Johnson, Marc C']","['Gregory DA', 'Lyddon TD', 'Johnson MC']","['Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20121114,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,PMC3554149,2012/11/16 06:00,2013/03/06 06:00,['2012/11/16 06:00'],"['2012/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02604-12 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02604-12 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2013 Feb;87(3):1518-27. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02604-12.

Increased understanding of these numerous others clinical manifestations associated to the virus than adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and HAM/TSP has challenged the view that HTLV-1 is a low morbidity infection.","['Souza, Anselmo', 'Tanajura, Davi', 'Toledo-Cornell, Cristina', 'Santos, Silvane', 'Carvalho, Edgar Marcelino de']","['Souza A', 'Tanajura D', 'Toledo-Cornell C', 'Santos S', 'Carvalho EM']","['Servico de Imunologia, Complexo Hospitalar Universitario Professor Edgard Santos, Universidade Federal da Bahia, Salvador, BA, Brasil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Brazil,Rev Soc Bras Med Trop,Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical,7507456,,2012/11/16 06:00,2013/07/16 06:00,['2012/11/16 06:00'],"['2011/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0037-86822012000500002 [pii]', '10.1590/s0037-86822012000500002 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Soc Bras Med Trop. 2012 Oct;45(5):545-52. doi: 10.1590/s0037-86822012000500002.,,IM,,"['HTLV-I Infections/*complications/immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/complications/*immunology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Standard treatments include mono- or polychemotherapies, usually combined with monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab or alemtuzumab. However, the impact of these agents remains unclear, as there are hints for increased risk of severe infections. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this review are to provide an evidence-based answer regarding the clinical benefits and harms of monoclonal anti-CD20 antibodies (such as rituximab, ofatumumab, GA101) compared to no further therapy or to other anti-leukaemic therapies in patients with CLL, irrespective of disease status. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 12, 2011), MEDLINE (from January 1990 to 4 January 2012), and EMBASE (from 1990 to 20 March 2009) as well as conference proceedings (American Society of Hematology, American Society of Clinical Oncology, European Hematology Association and European Society of Medical Oncology) for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs examining monoclonal anti-CD20 antibodies compared to no further therapy or to anti-leukaemic therapy such as chemotherapy or monoclonal antibodies in patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed CLL. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used hazard ratios (HR) as effect measures for overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and time to next treatment, and risk ratios (RR) for response rates, treatment-related mortality (TRM) and adverse events (AEs). Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed quality of trials. MAIN RESULTS: We screened a total of 1150 records. Seven RCTs involving 1763 patients were identified, but only five could be included in the two separate meta-analyses we performed. We judged the overall the quality of these trials as moderate to high. All trials were randomised and open-label studies. However, two trials were published as abstracts only, therefore we were unable to assess the potential risk of bias for these trials in detail.Three RCTs (N = 1421) assessed the efficacy of monoclonal anti-CD20 antibodies (i.e. rituximab) plus chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone. The meta-analyses showed a statistically significant OS (HR 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.98, P = 0.03, the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial effect (NNTB) was 12) and PFS (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.74, P < 0.00001) advantage for patients receiving rituximab. In the rituximab-arm occurred more AEs, World Health Organization (WHO) grade 3 or 4 (3 trials, N = 1398, RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.23, P < 0.0001; the number needed to harm for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) was 9), but that did not lead to a statistically significant difference regarding TRM (3 trials, N = 1415, RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.01, P = 0.52).Two trials (N = 177) evaluated rituximab versus alemtuzumab. Neither study reported OS or PFS. There was no statistically significant difference between arms regarding complete response rate (CRR) (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.58, P = 0.14) or TRM (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.51, P = 0.15). However, the CLL2007FMP trial was stopped early owing to an increase in mortality in the alemtuzumab arm. More serious AEs occurred in this arm (43% with alemtuzumab versus 22% with rituximab; P = 0.006).Two trials assessed different dosages or time schedules of monoclonal anti-CD20 antibodies. One trial (N = 104) evaluated two different rituximab schedules (concurrent arm: fludarabine plus rituximab (Flu-R) plus rituximab consolidation versus sequential arm: fludarabine alone plus rituximab consolidation). The comparison of the concurrent versus sequential regimen of rituximab showed a statistically significant difference of the CRR with 33% in the concurrent-arm and 15% in the sequential-arm (P = 0.04), that did not lead to statistically significant differences regarding OS (HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.20 to 6.65, P = 0.30) or PFS (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.15, P = 0.11). Furthermore results showed no differences in occurring AEs, except for neutropenia, which was more often observed in patients of the concurrent arm. The other trial (N = 61) investigated two different dosages (500 mg and 1000 mg) of ofatumumab in addition to FluC. The arm investigating ofatumumab did not assess OS and a median PFS had not been reached owing to the short median follow-up of eight months. It showed no statistically significant differences between arms regarding CRR (32% in the FCO500 arm versus 50% in the FCO1000 arm; P = 0.10) or AEs (anaemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis showed that patients receiving chemotherapy plus rituximab benefit in terms of OS as well as PFS compared to those with chemotherapy alone. Therefore, it supports the recommendation of rituximab in combination with FluC as an option for the first-line treatment as well as for the people with relapsed or refractory CLL. The available evidence regarding the other assessed comparisons was not sufficient to deduct final conclusions.","['Bauer, Kathrin', 'Rancea, Michaela', 'Roloff, Verena', 'Elter, Thomas', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Engert, Andreas', 'Skoetz, Nicole']","['Bauer K', 'Rancea M', 'Roloff V', 'Elter T', 'Hallek M', 'Engert A', 'Skoetz N']","['Cochrane Haematological Malignancies Group, Department I of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne,Germany. kathrin.bauer@uk-koeln.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20121114,England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,PMC6485963,2012/11/16 06:00,2013/01/16 06:00,['2012/11/16 06:00'],"['2012/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD008079.pub2 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2012 Nov 14;11:CD008079. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD008079.pub2.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'M95KG522R0 (ofatumumab)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Rituximab', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The major site of tungsten deposition is bone, the site of B-cell development. In addition, our in vitro data suggest that developing B lymphocytes are susceptible to tungsten-induced DNA damage and growth inhibition. To extend these results, we assessed whether tungsten exposure altered B-cell development and induced DNA damage in vivo. Wild-type mice were exposed to tungsten in their drinking water for up to 16 weeks. Tungsten concentration in bone was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and correlated with B-cell development and DNA damage within the bone marrow. Tungsten exposure resulted in a rapid deposition within the bone following 1 week, and tungsten continued to accumulate thereafter albeit at a decreased rate. Flow cytometric analyses revealed a transient increase in mature IgD(+) B cells in the first 8 weeks of treatment, in animals of the highest and intermediate exposure groups. Following 16 weeks of exposure, all tungsten groups had a significantly greater percentage of cells in the late pro-/large pre-B developmental stages. DNA damage was increased in both whole marrow and isolated B cells, most notably at the lowest tungsten concentration tested. These findings confirm an immunological effect of tungsten exposure and suggest that tungsten could act as a tumor promoter, providing leukemic ""hits"" in multiple forms to developing B lymphocytes within the bone marrow.","['Kelly, Alexander D R', 'Lemaire, Maryse', 'Young, Yoon Kow', 'Eustache, Jules H', 'Guilbert, Cynthia', 'Molina, Manuel Flores', 'Mann, Koren K']","['Kelly AD', 'Lemaire M', 'Young YK', 'Eustache JH', 'Guilbert C', 'Molina MF', 'Mann KK']","['Division of Experimental Medicine, Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121114,United States,Toxicol Sci,Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,9805461,,2012/11/16 06:00,2013/08/13 06:00,['2012/11/16 06:00'],"['2012/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['kfs324 [pii]', '10.1093/toxsci/kfs324 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Sci. 2013 Feb;131(2):434-46. doi: 10.1093/toxsci/kfs324.

On B lymphocytes and respective malignancies, its level decreases with the stage of maturation. Inter-individual variability of CD99 on B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) blasts was shown recently to be associated with distinct cytogenetic backgrounds. However, CD99 targets remain mainly unknown. Here, we show that administration of an anti-CD99 antibody to B- and T-leukemia cell lines induces heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), both on the cell surface and in the cytoplasm. Investigation of primary BCP-ALL cells rendered similar results. Intriguingly, CD99-induced modulation of HSP70 on ET cells had profiles different from that on leukemia cells. Since HSP70 expression on tumor cells is a prerequisite for natural killer (NK) cell-mediated tumor lysis, we hypothesized that CD99-induced HSP70 may allow targeting of some CD99-positive malignancies via NK-cell cytotoxicity. Our experiments with NK92 cell line demonstrated that leukemia cells with upregulated HSP70 can be successfully killed by effector cells. We consider our data as a new view of CD99 functions and as a basis for the development of a potential anti-tumor strategy based on heat-shock protein activation via CD99 triggering.","['Husak, Z', 'Dworzak, M N']","['Husak Z', 'Dworzak MN']","[""Department of Immunological Diagnostics, St. Anna Kinderkrebsforschung, Children's Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria. zvenyslava.husak@ccri.at""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121115,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,PMC3542600,2012/11/16 06:00,2013/06/01 06:00,['2012/11/16 06:00'],"['2012/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/01 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2012164 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2012.164 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2012 Nov 15;3:e425. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2012.164.,"['0 (12E7 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD99 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)']",IM,,"['12E7 Antigen', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/*genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', '*Up-Regulation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We treated 47 patients affected by relapsed/refractory AML with a regimen including clofarabine at 22.5 mg/m(2) daily on days 1-5, followed after 3 hr by cytarabine at 1 g/m(2) daily on days 1-5. Ten patients received a further consolidation cycle with clofarabine at 22.5 mg/m(2) and cytarabine at 1 g/m(2) day 1-4.

The Philadelphia translocation, producing a BCRABL hybrid oncogene, is the most common mechanism of CML development. However, in the present study, b3a2, b2a2 and ela2 fusion junctions of the breakpoint cluster region (BCR)-V-abl Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (ABL) gene were not detected in patients diagnosed with CML three and four years previously. RNA-Seq technology, with an average coverage of ~30fold, was used to detect gene fusion events in a patient with a 6-year history of CML, identified to be in the chronic phase of the disease. Using deFuse and TopHatfusion programs with improved filtering methods, we identified two reliable gene fusions in a blood sample obtained from the CML patient, including extremely low expression levels of the classic BCRABL1 gene fusion. In addition, a novel gene fusion involving the ring finger protein 213 (RNF213)-solute carrier family 26, member 11 (SLC26A11) was identified and validated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Further bioinformatic analysis revealed that specific domains of SLC26A11 were damaged, which may affect the function of sulfate transportation of the normal gene. The present study demonstrated that, in specific cases, alternative gene fusions, besides BCRABL, may be associated with the development of CML.","['Zhou, Jian-Bo', 'Zhang, Ting', 'Wang, Ben-Fang', 'Gao, Hai-Zhen', 'Xu, Xin']","['Zhou JB', 'Zhang T', 'Wang BF', 'Gao HZ', 'Xu X']","[""Department of Clinical Laboratories, Jiang Yin People's Hospital, Jiang Yin, Jiangsu 214400, P.R.

We are interested to study the genetic aberration in precursor B-cell ALL with specific t(12;21) translocation in childhood ALL patients. A high resolution 244K array-based Comparative Genomic Hybridization (array-CGH) was used to study eleven ETV6/RUNX1-positive childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. RESULT: 155 chromosomal aberrations (119 losses, 36 gains) were reported in the array findings, corresponding to 76.8% deletions and 23.2% amplifications. The ETV6 gene deletion occurred in 4 of the patients, corresponding to 45% of the sample. The most common alterations above 1 Mb were deletion 6q (13%), 12p (12%) and 9p (8%), and duplication 4q (6%) and Xq (4%). Other genes important in ALL were also identified in this study including RUNX1, CDKN2A, FHIT, and PAX5. The array-CGH technique was able to detect microdeletion as small as 400 bp. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate the usefulness of high resolution array-CGH as a complementary tool in the investigation of ALL.","['Zakaria, Zubaidah', 'Ahid, Mohd Fadly Md', 'Ismail, Azli', 'Keoh, Ten Sew', 'Nor, Nooraisyah Mohamad', 'Kamaluddin, Nor Rizan', 'Esa, Ezalia', 'Yuen, Lam Kah', 'Rahman, Eni Juraida Abdul', 'Osman, Raudhawati']","['Zakaria Z', 'Ahid MF', 'Ismail A', 'Keoh TS', 'Nor NM', 'Kamaluddin NR', 'Esa E', 'Yuen LK', 'Rahman EJ', 'Osman R']","['Hematology Unit, Cancer Research Center, Institute for Medical Research, Kuala Lumpur, 50588, Malaysia. zubaidah@imr.gov.my.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121115,England,Mol Cytogenet,Molecular cytogenetics,101317942,PMC3549777,2012/11/16 06:00,2012/11/16 06:01,['2012/11/16 06:00'],"['2012/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/16 06:01 [medline]']","['1755-8166-5-41 [pii]', '10.1186/1755-8166-5-41 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cytogenet. 2012 Nov 15;5(1):41. doi: 10.1186/1755-8166-5-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lipocalin 2 (LCN2) is related to cancer development and is believed to be associated with the outcome of cytogenetically normal (CN)-AML. In the present study, we analyzed the prognostic effects and interactions of LCN2 expression (by molecular analysis, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction [qRT-PCR]) with neucleophosmin 1, fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha mutations in 85 patients with CN-AML receiving intensive induction chemotherapy. Our results indicate that patients with higher LCN2 mRNA expression in the bone marrow (LCN2high), especially in combination with wild type FLT3-ITD, had better prognoses. FLT3-ITD compensated LCN2-overexpression-enhanced oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in cell line studies. In conclusion, LCN2high was associated with better prognosis, and FLT3 status had an adjuvant effect on overall survival.","['Yang, Wen-Chi', 'Lin, Pai-Mei', 'Yang, Ming-Yu', 'Liu, Yi-Chang', 'Chang, Chao-Sung', 'Chou, Wen-Chien', 'Hsu, Jui-Feng', 'Huang, Chiung-Tang', 'Cho, Shih-Feng', 'Yu, Wen-Hui', 'Lin, Sheng-Fung']","['Yang WC', 'Lin PM', 'Yang MY', 'Liu YC', 'Chang CS', 'Chou WC', 'Hsu JF', 'Huang CT', 'Cho SF', 'Yu WH', 'Lin SF']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121224,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,2012/11/16 06:00,2014/02/25 06:00,['2012/11/16 06:00'],"['2012/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2012.749402 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2013 Aug;54(8):1614-25. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2012.749402.

This study was designed to monitor the expression of the IK6 isoform with associated cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities. The IK6 isoform, cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities were detected in 100 Chinese patients with de novo Ph+ adult ALL. Expression levels of the IK6 isoform and BCR-ABL1 transcripts were monitored during treatment. BCR-ABL1 mutation was identified in 45 paired samples. Strong correlations were found between the expression status of the IK6 isoform and blast cells, additional cytogenetic abnormalities, BCR-ABL1 transcripts, increased risk of relapse, shorter relapse-free survival and overall survival at diagnosis. Higher frequencies of single IK6 expression and ABL mutation, including the types and shifts thereof, were confirmed in relapsed patients. Furthermore, expression of the IK6 isoform was dynamically consistent with BCR-ABL1 transcript levels during treatment in the single expression group, whereas no such correlation was observed in the co-expression group. The expression pattern of the IK6 isoform was altered in three patients from the co-expression group. The findings of this study in Chinese patients with Ph+ adult ALL exhibit some discrepancies with data reported in other countries, thereby enhancing current knowledge on the therapeutic response and prognosis of this disease.","['Yao, Li', 'Cen, Jiannong', 'Chen, Suning', 'Shen, Hongjie', 'Chen, Yan', 'He, Jun', 'Chen, Zixing']","['Yao L', 'Cen J', 'Chen S', 'Shen H', 'Chen Y', 'He J', 'Chen Z']","['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, P R China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121210,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,2012/11/16 06:00,2014/02/25 06:00,['2012/11/16 06:00'],"['2012/11/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2012.749403 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2013 Aug;54(8):1626-32. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2012.749403.

Two hundred normal females and 45 female patients with AML entered the study. The frequency of heterozygosity was 48.5% (119/245) for P55, 40% (93/245) for IDS, and only 28.9% (71/245) for G6PD. Some individuals were heterozygous for more than one gene polymorphism. Overall, one hundred normal individuals proved showed to be heterozygous for at least one of the above polymorphisms. 92/100 (92%) normal females showed a polyclonal pattern. Clonal patterns were observed in 44/45 (98%) AML patients at presentation. Of 27 patients who were followed after remission, 23 (85.2%) patients showed a clonal pattern. Ten patients were available for a longer followup (up to 12 months) and the clonal pattern was observed in seven patients. It can be concluded that clonality at remission is a frequent event in AML and does not necessarily mean relapse of the disease.

Expression of these genes correlates with regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation by alternating proliferation and maturation stages for three main Ph+cell types that occur under chronic myeloid leukemia. Thep53, p21, mdm2, and gapdh genes overexpress in active proliferating myeloid cells in the cell cycle S+ G2/M phases and when the phases are coincident with the proliferation stage. Expression of these genes decreases to a considerable level under alternation of the Ph(+)cell proliferation and maturation stages and whenever the expression is greatly diminished under significant neutrophil accumulation and especially under repeated alternation of the stages. In the course of neutrophil maturation, gene expression levels decrease in the range of gapdh > actin > c-myc, bcr/abl,p21 > p53 > bcl2 > bax.The expression levels of these genes in neutrophils are lower than those in myelocytes and lower by an order of magnitude than that in the cells with a prolonged proliferation stage. TheBcr/ablexpression gene under prolonged maturation and neutrophil accumulation is inhibited; however it is enhanced by 2-3 times for the proliferation stage with myelocyte accumulation. Minimalbcr/ablexpression is observed under overexpression ofp53, mdm2, p21, c-myc,as well as under cell maximum at the S and G2/M phases.

Particularly in mouse skin Runx1 modulates Wnt signaling levels thereby regulating timely induction of hair follicle specification, proper maturation of the emerging adult hair follicle stem cells in embryogenesis, and timely stem cell (SC) activation during adult homeostasis. Moreover, Runx1 acts as a tumor promoter in mouse skin squamous tumor formation and maintenance, likely by repressing p21 and promoting Stat3 activation. Similarly, Runx1 is essential for oral epithelium tumorigenesis mediated in mice by Ras, and for growth of three kinds of human epithelial cancer cells. In contrast, Runx1 has a tumor suppressor function in the mouse intestine and shows tumor subtype specific behavior in human breast cancer. Multiple studies revealed Runx1 SNPs to be associated with human cancers and autoimmune disease. With this information as background, the field is poised for functional and mechanistic studies to elucidate the role of Runx1 in formation and/or progression of epithelial-based human disease.","['Scheitz, Cornelia Johanna Franziska', 'Tumbar, Tudorita']","['Scheitz CJ', 'Tumbar T']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,PMC5788165,2012/11/15 06:00,2013/08/28 06:00,['2012/11/15 06:00'],"['2012/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.24453 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2013 May;114(5):985-93. doi: 10.1002/jcb.24453.,['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)'],IM,,"['Animals', 'Autoimmune Diseases/metabolism/pathology', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Hair Follicle/pathology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Stem Cells/*metabolism/*pathology']",,,,"['Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",['R01 AR053201/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS640552'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During normal signaling, the multidomain adapter CARD11 transitions from a closed, inactive state to an open, active scaffold that assembles a multiprotein complex, leading to NF-kappaB activation. The regulation of CARD11 scaffold function is bypassed by lymphoma-associated oncogenic CARD11 mutations that induce spontaneous signaling. We report an unbiased high-throughput quantitative signaling screen that identifies new CARD11 hyperactive variants and defines a LATCH domain that functions with the CARD to promote CARD11 autoinhibition. Gain-of-function mutations in the LATCH or CARD disrupt inhibitory domain binding, promote Bcl10 association, and induce Bcl10 ubiquitination, NF-kappaB activation, and human lymphoma cell survival. Our results identify CARD11 mutations with oncogenic potential, provide a mechanistic explanation for their signaling potency, and offer a straightforward method for the discovery of variants that promote the tumorigenesis of NF-kappaB-dependent lymphomas.","['Chan, Waipan', 'Schaffer, Thomas B', 'Pomerantz, Joel L']","['Chan W', 'Schaffer TB', 'Pomerantz JL']","['Department of Biological Chemistry and Institute for Cell Engineering, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121112,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,PMC3554118,2012/11/15 06:00,2013/02/22 06:00,['2012/11/15 06:00'],"['2012/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/22 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.00850-12 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00850-12 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2013 Jan;33(2):429-43. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00850-12.

Here, we report that FLT3-ITD transforms hematopoietic cells in cooperation with MOZ-TIF2 in vitro and in vivo. Coexpression of FLT3-ITD confers growth factor independent survival/proliferation, shortens disease latency, and results in an increase in the number of leukemic stem cells (LSC). We show that STAT5, a major effector of aberrant FLT3-ITD signal transduction, is both necessary and sufficient for this cooperative effect. In addition, STAT5 signaling is essential for MOZ-TIF2-induced leukemic transformation itself. Lack of STAT5 in fetal liver cells caused rapid differentiation and loss of replating capacity of MOZ-TIF2-transduced cells enriched for LSCs. Furthermore, mice serially transplanted with Stat5(-/-) MOZ-TIF2 leukemic cells develop AML with longer disease latency and finally incomplete penetrance when compared with mice transplanted with Stat5(+/+) MOZ-TIF2 leukemic cells. These data suggest that STAT5AB is required for the self-renewal of LSCs and represents a combined signaling node of FLT3-ITD and MOZ-TIF2 driven leukemogenesis. Therefore, targeting aberrantly activated STAT5 or rewired downstream signaling pathways may be a promising therapeutic option.","['Tam, Winnie F', 'Hahnel, Patricia S', 'Schuler, Andrea', 'Lee, Benjamin H', 'Okabe, Rachel', 'Zhu, Nan', 'Pante, Saskia V', 'Raffel, Glen', 'Mercher, Thomas', 'Wernig, Gerlinde', 'Bockamp, Ernesto', 'Sasca, Daniel', 'Kreft, Andreas', 'Robinson, Gertraud W', 'Hennighausen, Lothar', 'Gilliland, D Gary', 'Kindler, Thomas']","['Tam WF', 'Hahnel PS', 'Schuler A', 'Lee BH', 'Okabe R', 'Zhu N', 'Pante SV', 'Raffel G', 'Mercher T', 'Wernig G', 'Bockamp E', 'Sasca D', 'Kreft A', 'Robinson GW', 'Hennighausen L', 'Gilliland DG', 'Kindler T']","[""Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121113,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,PMC3916953,2012/11/15 06:00,2013/02/28 06:00,['2012/11/15 06:00'],"['2012/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/28 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-12-0255 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-0255 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2013 Jan 1;73(1):373-84. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-0255.

Yet, it remains unknown how the bone marrow niche in which AML arises is subverted to support leukemic persistence at the expense of homeostatic function. Exosomes are cell membrane-derived vesicles carrying protein and RNA cargoes that have emerged as mediators of cell-cell communication. In this study, we examined the role of exosomes in developing the AML niche of the bone marrow microenvironment, investigating their biogenesis with a focus on RNA trafficking. We found that both primary AML and AML cell lines released exosome-sized vesicles that entered bystander cells. These exosomes were enriched for several coding and noncoding RNAs relevant to AML pathogenesis. Furthermore, their uptake by bone marrow stromal cells altered their secretion of growth factors. Proof-of-concept studies provided additional evidence for the canonical functions of the transferred RNA. Taken together, our findings revealed that AML exosome trafficking alters the proliferative, angiogenic, and migratory responses of cocultured stromal and hematopoietic progenitor cell lines, helping explain how the microenvironmental niche becomes reprogrammed during invasion of the bone marrow by AML.","['Huan, Jianya', 'Hornick, Noah I', 'Shurtleff, Matthew J', 'Skinner, Amy M', 'Goloviznina, Natalya A', 'Roberts, Charles T Jr', 'Kurre, Peter']","['Huan J', 'Hornick NI', 'Shurtleff MJ', 'Skinner AM', 'Goloviznina NA', 'Roberts CT Jr', 'Kurre P']","['Department of Pediatrics, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon 97239, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121113,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,2012/11/15 06:00,2013/03/27 06:00,['2012/11/15 06:00'],"['2012/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-12-2184 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-2184 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2013 Jan 15;73(2):918-29. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-2184.

However, the incidence of other cancers gradually increased, while that of leukemia decreased after this period. We evaluated the clinical outcome of early gastric cancer and microsatellite stability over a long-term period in atomic bomb survivors. METHODS: The results of surgical treatment for early gastric cancer were reviewed for 117 atomic bomb survivors and 394 control patients between 1995 and 2006. In addition, immunohistochemical staining for hMSH2 and hMLH1 expression was performed to evaluate the status of microsatellite stability in 57 atomic bomb survivors and 82 control patients. RESULTS: The long-term survival rate for early gastric cancer in atomic bomb survivors was significantly lower than that in control patients (p < 0.01). Multivariable analysis revealed that age and sex were significant and independent prognostic factors for early gastric cancer. Defective hMSH2 and/or hMLH1 expression was also significantly higher in survivors than in control patients (p < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis revealed that atomic bomb survivorship was related to defective hMSH2 and/or hMLH1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of early gastric cancer in atomic bomb survivors was poor and was related to age and sex, rather than to being an atomic bomb survivor. Furthermore, a higher rate of defective hMSH2 and/or hMLH1 expression was observed in the survivors.","['Yamamoto, Manabu', 'Taguchi, Kenichi', 'Yamanaka, Takeharu', 'Matsuyama, Ayumi', 'Yoshinaga, Keiji', 'Tsutsui, Shinichi', 'Ishida, Teruyoshi']","['Yamamoto M', 'Taguchi K', 'Yamanaka T', 'Matsuyama A', 'Yoshinaga K', 'Tsutsui S', 'Ishida T']","['Department of Surgery, Hiroshima Atomic Bomb Survivors Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan. yamamoto.m@nk-cc.go.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121113,United States,Ann Surg Oncol,Annals of surgical oncology,9420840,,2012/11/15 06:00,2013/08/07 06:00,['2012/11/15 06:00'],"['2012/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1245/s10434-012-2567-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Surg Oncol. 2013 Mar;20(3):798-803. doi: 10.1245/s10434-012-2567-0.

Melittin, an antibacterial peptide isolated from the bee Apis mellifera, has shown strong cytotoxicity to both tumor and normal cells. To ameliorate the cytotoxicity of melittin on cells and enhance the activity of TRAIL on cancer cells, we constructed a novel fusion protein, sTRAIL-melittin, containing a small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) tag and expressed this fusion protein in Escherichia coli. Data showed that expression of the soluble fusion protein with the SUMO tag was approximately 85% of total target protein which was much higher than that without the SUMO tag (approximately 10%); sTRAIL-melittin was easily purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and the tag was removed easily using SUMO-specific protease. To assay anticancer activity and side effects, methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium, hemolytic, and apoptosis assays were employed. Results demonstrated that sTRAIL-melittin had cytotoxic and apoptotic activity in K562 leukemia cells and HepG2 liver carcinoma cells, while it had only a minimal effect on erythrocytes and normal HEK293 cells. This indicates that the cytotoxicity of sTRAIL-melittin in normal cells was low and the anticancer activity of the fusion protein in tumor cells was significantly enhanced compared with sTRAIL (P<0.01). Furthermore, we found that sTRAIL-melittin also showed antibacterial activity to Staphylococcus aureus due to the presence of the melittin domain. Therefore, TRAIL fused with an antibacterial peptide may be a promising novel TRAIL-based anticancer treatment strategy.","['Liu, Hongyan', 'Han, Yangyang', 'Fu, Haiyan', 'Liu, Meng', 'Wu, Jing', 'Chen, Xiaonan', 'Zhang, Shuangquan', 'Chen, Yuqing']","['Liu H', 'Han Y', 'Fu H', 'Liu M', 'Wu J', 'Chen X', 'Zhang S', 'Chen Y']","['Jiangsu Province Key Laboratory for Molecular and Medical Biotechnology, Life Sciences College, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, 210046, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121113,Germany,Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,8406612,,2012/11/15 06:00,2013/09/03 06:00,['2012/11/15 06:00'],"['2012/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/20 00:00 [revised]', '2012/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00253-012-4541-y [doi]'],ppublish,Appl Microbiol Biotechnol. 2013 Apr;97(7):2877-84. doi: 10.1007/s00253-012-4541-y.

Moreover, survival and neuritogenesis in deafferented adult neurons is important for cochlear implant function. To address these issues, developmental changes in the responsiveness of postnatal rat spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) to neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were examined by using a dissociated cell culture system. SGNs at postnatal day (P) 0, P5 and P20 (young adult) were cultured with the addition of NT-3, BDNF, or LIF or of a combination of NT-3 and BDNF (N + B) or of NT-3, BDNF and LIF (ALL factors). SGNs were analyzed for three parameters: survival, longest neurite length (LNL) and neuronal morphology. At P0, SGNs required exposure to N + B or ALL factors for enhanced survival and the ALL factors combination showed a synergistic effect much greater than the sum of the individual factors. At P5, SGNs responded to a wider range of treatment conditions for enhanced survival and combinations showed only an additive improvement over individual factors. The survival percentage of untreated SGNs was highest at P20 but combinations of neurotrophic factors were no more effective than individual factors. LNL of each SGN was enhanced by LIF alone or ALL factors at P0 and P5 but was suppressed by NT-3, BDNF and N + B at P5 in a dose-dependent manner. The LNL at P20 was enhanced by ALL factors and suppressed by N + B. Treatment with ALL factors increased the proportion of SGNs that had two or more primary neurites in all age groups. These findings suggest that NT-3, BDNF, LIF and their combinations predominantly support different ontogenetic events at different developmental stages in the innervation of the inner ear.","['Jin, Yulian', 'Kondo, Kenji', 'Ushio, Munetaka', 'Kaga, Kimitaka', 'Ryan, Allen F', 'Yamasoba, Tatsuya']","['Jin Y', 'Kondo K', 'Ushio M', 'Kaga K', 'Ryan AF', 'Yamasoba T']","['Department of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121113,Germany,Cell Tissue Res,Cell and tissue research,0417625,PMC3577061,2012/11/15 06:00,2013/06/06 06:00,['2012/11/15 06:00'],"['2012/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00441-012-1526-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Tissue Res. 2013 Jan;351(1):15-27. doi: 10.1007/s00441-012-1526-1.

The high substrate affinity and low susceptibility to formamide of HIV-1 RT might be advantageous for its use in cDNA synthesis.","['Konishi, Atsushi', 'Shinomura, Mayu', 'Yasukawa, Kiyoshi']","['Konishi A', 'Shinomura M', 'Yasukawa K']","['Division of Food Science and Biotechnology, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8502, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121113,United States,Appl Biochem Biotechnol,Applied biochemistry and biotechnology,8208561,,2012/11/15 06:00,2013/07/03 06:00,['2012/11/15 06:00'],"['2012/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12010-012-9953-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Appl Biochem Biotechnol. 2013 Jan;169(1):77-87. doi: 10.1007/s12010-012-9953-8.

Although the aetiology is still unclear, in the last few years various reports suggested a potential role of chromosomal aberrations in the oncogenesis. The disease is currently enclosed among ""acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and related precursor neoplasms"" in the last WHO classification. BPDCN has an aggressive course, however, it has been suggested that an exclusive cutaneous involvement at presentation is related to a better clinical outcome. METHODS: We review the literature about BPDCN, and we present a series of 11 cases, all characterised by disease limited to the skin at presentation. Furthermore, we examined all cases of the last 10 years stored in the database of the multidisciplinary study group on cutaneous lymphomas of the University of Florence. RESULTS: Basing on the clinical features, patient were classified into two groups: with a single-lesion or multiple eruptive-lesions presentation. The former were treated with radiotherapy (limited field, electron beam therapy). The latter were treated with different therapeutic options, depending on age and co-morbidities. All patients with a single lesion achieved complete response. Five of 6 patients with eruptive lesions achieved a clinical response (2 complete and 3 partial response). Notably, the progression free survival was higher in the single-lesion than in the eruptive-lesion group (23 vs. 9 months). However all patients relapsed and 8 of 11 died. CONCLUSION: Although the small number of selected patients, we could speculate that the concept of ""cutaneous sanctuary"" is particularly true in patients with a single lesion-presentation. In these patients, especially if >70 year-old aged, radiotherapy should be encouraged as the treatment of choice.","['Pileri, A', 'Delfino, C', 'Grandi, V', 'Agostinelli, C', 'Pileri, S A', 'Pimpinelli, N']","['Pileri A', 'Delfino C', 'Grandi V', 'Agostinelli C', 'Pileri SA', 'Pimpinelli N']","['Division of Dermatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Geriatrics and Nephrology, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy. alessandropileri@hotmail.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Italy,G Ital Dermatol Venereol,"Giornale italiano di dermatologia e venereologia : organo ufficiale, Societa italiana di dermatologia e sifilografia",8102852,,2012/11/15 06:00,2013/04/02 06:00,['2012/11/15 06:00'],"['2012/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/02 06:00 [medline]']",['R23124420 [pii]'],ppublish,G Ital Dermatol Venereol. 2012 Dec;147(6):603-8.,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Dendritic Cells', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Skin Neoplasms/*pathology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We reviewed the pathological files of patients less than 12 years of age with lymphoma in Shanghai Xinhua Hospital from January 1982 to June 2009. SPSS version 11.0 was used to analyse the results. RESULTS: Of the 213 subjects, 176 (82.6%) had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and 37 (17.4%) had Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). All NHL cases had diffuse and high grade tumours, and 33.5% of these tumours primarily involved extra-nodal sites. Of the NHL cases, 56.6%, 43.3%, and 1.7% were derived from T, B, and null cells, respectively. Lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL, 50.6%), Burkitt's lymphoma (BL, 28.4%), and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL, 12.5%) comprised the majority of the NHL cases. A significant difference was found in the frequency of stage I/II cases between LL and ALCL. Paediatric HL resembled the disease in adults. CONCLUSIONS: Paediatric lymphoma in China is different from that in Western countries with respect to the incidence rate of HL and BL. The distribution pattern of NHL histological subtypes is more similar to that in Japan than that in Pakistan.

OBJECTIVES: We estimated relative risks of CLL and non-CLL from protracted exposures to low-dose ionizing radiation. METHODS: A nested case-control study was conducted in a cohort of 110,645 Ukrainian cleanup workers of the 1986 Chornobyl nuclear power plant accident. Cases of incident leukemia diagnosed in 1986-2006 were confirmed by a panel of expert hematologists/hematopathologists. Controls were matched to cases on place of residence and year of birth. We estimated individual bone marrow radiation doses by the Realistic Analytical Dose Reconstruction with Uncertainty Estimation (RADRUE) method. We then used a conditional logistic regression model to estimate excess relative risk of leukemia per gray (ERR/Gy) of radiation dose. RESULTS: We found a significant linear dose response for all leukemia [137 cases, ERR/Gy = 1.26 (95% CI: 0.03, 3.58]. There were nonsignificant positive dose responses for both CLL and non-CLL (ERR/Gy = 0.76 and 1.87, respectively). In our primary analysis excluding 20 cases with direct in-person interviews < 2 years from start of chemotherapy with an anomalous finding of ERR/Gy = -0.47 (95% CI: < -0.47, 1.02), the ERR/Gy for the remaining 117 cases was 2.38 (95% CI: 0.49, 5.87). For CLL, the ERR/Gy was 2.58 (95% CI: 0.02, 8.43), and for non-CLL, ERR/Gy was 2.21 (95% CI: 0.05, 7.61). Altogether, 16% of leukemia cases (18% of CLL, 15% of non-CLL) were attributed to radiation exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to low doses and to low dose-rates of radiation from post-Chornobyl cleanup work was associated with a significant increase in risk of leukemia, which was statistically consistent with estimates for the Japanese atomic bomb survivors. Based on the primary analysis, we conclude that CLL and non-CLL are both radiosensitive.","['Zablotska, Lydia B', 'Bazyka, Dimitry', 'Lubin, Jay H', 'Gudzenko, Nataliya', 'Little, Mark P', 'Hatch, Maureen', 'Finch, Stuart', 'Dyagil, Irina', 'Reiss, Robert F', 'Chumak, Vadim V', 'Bouville, Andre', 'Drozdovitch, Vladimir', 'Kryuchkov, Victor P', 'Golovanov, Ivan', 'Bakhanova, Elena', 'Babkina, Nataliya', 'Lubarets, Tatiana', 'Bebeshko, Volodymyr', 'Romanenko, Anatoly', 'Mabuchi, Kiyohiko']","['Zablotska LB', 'Bazyka D', 'Lubin JH', 'Gudzenko N', 'Little MP', 'Hatch M', 'Finch S', 'Dyagil I', 'Reiss RF', 'Chumak VV', 'Bouville A', 'Drozdovitch V', 'Kryuchkov VP', 'Golovanov I', 'Bakhanova E', 'Babkina N', 'Lubarets T', 'Bebeshko V', 'Romanenko A', 'Mabuchi K']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94118, USA. lydia.zablotska@ucsf.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20121108,United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,PMC3553431,2012/11/15 06:00,2013/07/09 06:00,['2012/11/15 06:00'],"['2012/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1289/ehp.1204996 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2013 Jan;121(1):59-65. doi: 10.1289/ehp.1204996.

DESIGN: Pragmatic, randomised, parallel group, multicentre, unblinded and non-inferiority trial. Randomisation stratified by baseline use of methotrexate. PARTICIPANTS: 125 adults with active RA despite treatment with two disease-modifying drugs (DMARDs), including methotrexate randomised (1 : 1) to adalimumab 40 mg alternate weeks or etanercept 50 mg weekly, added to existing medication. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was proportion of patients continuing treatment after 52 weeks. Secondary outcomes included: disease activity score using 28 joints (DAS28), treatment satisfaction (TSQM V.2), health status (Euroqol-5D), drug toxicity and persistence with therapy after 2 years. RESULTS: Persistence with therapy was 65% for adalimumab versus 56.7% for etanercept (one-sided 95% CI for proportion still taking adalimumab minus proportion on etanercept >/=-7.9%); demonstrating non-inferiority at the 15% margin. After 2 years these figures were: adalimumab 58.3% and etanecept 43.3% (CI >/=-1.7%). The proportion of good, moderate and non-responders based on DAS28-C reactive protein, after 52 weeks, were 26.3%, 33.3% and 40.4%, respectively, for adalimumab versus 16.7%, 31.7% and 51.7%, respectively, for etanercept (p=0.158). Baseline median EQ-5D scores improved from 0.52 to 0.69 for adalimumab and from 0.52 to 0.64 for etanercept (p=0.046) after 52 weeks. Global satisfaction, effectiveness, side effects and convenience scores based on the TSQM were similar for both drugs. Fourteen serious adverse events occurred including two deaths from myocardial infarction, one patient with ovarian cancer and one with acute myeloid leukaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians choosing a first tumour necrosis factor inhibitor for active RA, despite trying two DMARDs including methotrexate, may choose either adalimumab or etanercept in the knowledge that these drugs are similarly effective.

However, because of the heterogeneity and clonal evolution that is a feature of myeloid leukemia, targeting single peptide epitopes has had limited success, highlighting the need for novel antigen discovery. In this study, we characterize the role of the myeloid azurophil granule protease cathepsin G (CG) as a novel target for AML immunotherapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used Immune Epitope Database and in vitro binding assays to identify immunogenic epitopes derived from CG. Flow cytometry, immunoblotting, and confocal microscopy were used to characterize the expression and processing of CG in AML patient samples, leukemia stem cells, and normal neutrophils. Cytotoxicity assays determined the susceptibility of AML to CG-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Dextramer staining and cytokine flow cytometry were conducted to characterize the immune response to CG in patients. RESULTS: CG was highly expressed and ubiquitinated in AML blasts, and was localized outside granules in compartments that facilitate antigen presentation. We identified five HLA-A*0201 binding nonameric peptides (CG1-CG5) derived from CG, and showed immunogenicity of the highest HLA-A*0201 binding peptide, CG1. We showed killing of primary AML by CG1-CTL, but not normal bone marrow. Blocking HLA-A*0201 abrogated CG1-CTL-mediated cytotoxicity, further confirming HLA-A*0201-dependent killing. Finally, we showed functional CG1-CTLs in peripheral blood from AML patients following allogeneic stem cell transplantation. CONCLUSION: CG is aberrantly expressed and processed in AML and is a novel immunotherapeutic target that warrants further development.","['Zhang, Mao', 'Sukhumalchandra, Pariya', 'Enyenihi, Atim A', 'St John, Lisa S', 'Hunsucker, Sally A', 'Mittendorf, Elizabeth A', 'Sergeeva, Anna', 'Ruisaard, Kathryn', 'Al-Atrache, Zein', 'Ropp, Patricia A', 'Jakher, Haroon', 'Rodriguez-Cruz, Tania', 'Lizee, Gregory', 'Clise-Dwyer, Karen', 'Lu, Sijie', 'Molldrem, Jeffrey J', 'Glish, Gary L', 'Armistead, Paul M', 'Alatrash, Gheath']","['Zhang M', 'Sukhumalchandra P', 'Enyenihi AA', 'St John LS', 'Hunsucker SA', 'Mittendorf EA', 'Sergeeva A', 'Ruisaard K', 'Al-Atrache Z', 'Ropp PA', 'Jakher H', 'Rodriguez-Cruz T', 'Lizee G', 'Clise-Dwyer K', 'Lu S', 'Molldrem JJ', 'Glish GL', 'Armistead PM', 'Alatrash G']","['Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, Surgical Oncology, and Melanoma Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121112,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,PMC3537920,2012/11/14 06:00,2013/06/19 06:00,['2012/11/14 06:00'],"['2012/11/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-12-2753 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-2753 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2013 Jan 1;19(1):247-57. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-2753.

The literature on the subject for the western Amazon region is scarce. This study aimed to determine cancer incidence in the population of Rio Branco, Acre State. A total of 718 new cases were recorded during the study period. Among men, the five leading cancer sites were prostate (ASR 75.1), stomach (ASR 23.0), lung (ASR 19.1), colon and rectum (ASR 9.5), and leukemia (ASR 6.9). Among women, they were breast (ASR 41.5), cervix (ASR 41.3), lung (ASR 11.8), colon and rectum (ASR 11.0), and stomach (ASR 7.7). These indicators reveal that Rio Branco has a cancer incidence pattern that overlaps with epidemiological cancer patterns observed in developed and developing regions. The results of the study point to the importance of implementing a population-based cancer registry - currently nonexistent in Rio Branco - as a factor to promote analysis of incident cases of the disease and monitoring of its evolution.","['Nakashima, Juliano de Padua', 'Koifman, Rosalina Jorge', 'Koifman, Sergio']","['Nakashima JP', 'Koifman RJ', 'Koifman S']","['Centro de Alta Complexidade em Oncologia, Universidade de Brasilia, Brasilia, Brasil. julianonakashima@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Brazil,Cad Saude Publica,Cadernos de saude publica,8901573,,2012/11/14 06:00,2013/07/25 06:00,['2012/11/14 06:00'],"['2011/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0102-311X2012001100012 [pii]', '10.1590/s0102-311x2012001100012 [doi]']",ppublish,Cad Saude Publica. 2012 Nov;28(11):2125-32. doi: 10.1590/s0102-311x2012001100012.,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Sex Distribution', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A study recently published in Nature identified a novel signal-initiating interaction between the third complementary determining region of the IG heavy chain variable domain (HCDR3) and an epitope in the second framework region (FR2) that appears to be unique to CLL B cells and that calls into question the need for classical antigen binding in the activation and expansion of the leukemic cells.

CML occurring as a secondary malignancy in individuals treated for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is also rare. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 5-year-old female patient who developed a right orbital mass that was diagnosed as DLBCL. 9 months after receiving treatment for DLBCL, she presented with a white cell count of 250,000/mm(3). Peripheral blood and bone marrow (BM) evaluation revealed a myeloproliferative disorder. Cytogenetic and molecular studies demonstrated the presence of t(9;22). CML following DLBCL has not been previously described in the younger population. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a child who developed a CML as a second malignancy after DLBCL. Therapy-related CML and non-therapy-related secondary CML are discussed as potential explanations of this highly unusual clinical presentation. CONCLUSION: Hematological disorders such as CML may occur after lymphomas. With the increased use of BM cytogenetic studies during staging for lymphoid malignancies, future studies may be able to clarify the question of whether the CML clone in some of these patients existed before treatment for lymphoma.","['Zahra, Kmira', 'Ben Fredj, Wafa', 'Ben Youssef, Yosra', 'Zaghouani, Houneida', 'Chebchoub, Imene', 'Zaier, Monia', 'Badreddine, Sriha', 'Braham, Nejia', 'Sennana, Hlima', 'Khelif, Abderrahim']","['Zahra K', 'Ben Fredj W', 'Ben Youssef Y', 'Zaghouani H', 'Chebchoub I', 'Zaier M', 'Badreddine S', 'Braham N', 'Sennana H', 'Khelif A']","['Department of Clinical Hematology, Farhat Hached University Hospital Sousse-Tunisia, Tunisia.

Morphological changes, cell surface markers CD11b/CD14 and NBT-reducing ability were used to determine the differentiation of HL-60 cells, and 2,7-dichlorofluorescein (DCFH-DA) was used to detect the level of intracellular ROS. ISL-induced HL-60 cell differentiation was accompanied by an increase in the intracellular ROS levels. l-Buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO), N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinoxyl (Tempol) were used to interfere with ROS production. NADPH oxidase inhibitors, apocynin (APO) and diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) were used to study the role of NADPH oxidase in ISL-induced HL-60 cell differentiation. The ISL-induced HL-60 cell differentiation and intracellular ROS generation were enhanced by the oxidant BSO and inhibited by the antioxidants NAC, SOD, and tempol, and were also inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors APO and DPI. The protein and mRNA expression of the NADPH oxidase subunits gp91phox and p47phox were determined by Western blotting and RT-PCR, respectively. The levels of translation and transcription of the NADPH oxidase subunits gp91phox and p47phox increased markedly in a concentration-dependent manner. These findings suggest that NADPH oxidase plays a critical role in HL-60 cell differentiation induced by ISL and that NADPH oxidase-derived ROS is involved in the differentiation mechanism.","['Chen, Hongmei', 'Zhang, Bo', 'Yao, Ying', 'Chen, Na', 'Chen, Xiaoyu', 'Tian, Hui', 'Wang, Zhenhua', 'Zheng, Qiusheng']","['Chen H', 'Zhang B', 'Yao Y', 'Chen N', 'Chen X', 'Tian H', 'Wang Z', 'Zheng Q']","['Key Laboratory of Xinjiang Endemic Phytomedicine Resources, Ministry of Education, School of Pharmacy, Shihezi University, Shihezi 832002, China. zqsyt@sohu.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121112,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,PMC6268504,2012/11/14 06:00,2013/04/06 06:00,['2012/11/14 06:00'],"['2012/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/24 00:00 [revised]', '2012/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/06 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules171113424 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules171113424 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2012 Nov 12;17(11):13424-38. doi: 10.3390/molecules171113424.,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (CD11 Antigens)', '0 (Chalcones)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'B9CTI9GB8F (isoliquiritigenin)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (CYBB protein, human)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidase 2)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 1.6.3.1 (neutrophil cytosolic factor 1)']",IM,,"['Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'CD11 Antigens/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus Shape/drug effects', 'Cell Shape/drug effects', 'Chalcones/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'NADPH Oxidase 2', 'NADPH Oxidases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A diverse number of possible functions have previously been ascribed to ASXL1 in non-hematopoietic contexts, including physical co-operativity with HP1a and LSD1. Here we discuss new evidence for a BAP1-independent function of ASXL1 in regulating histone H3 lysine 27 methylation through interactions with the Polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2). BAP1, a nuclear-localized deubiquitinase, has been shown to interact with a number of proteins, including ASXL1 and/or ASXL2, but the functional importance of this interaction has remained elusive. Here, we highlight recent work revealing the critical function of BAP1 in restricting myelopoiesis and in regulating hematopoietic stem cell function. These data provide evidence that BAP1 and ASXL1 function as a novel class of tumor suppressors in myeloid malignancies. BAP1 functions through effects on stability of host cell factor-1, and O-GlcNAcylation, and ASXL1 impacts histone post-translational modifications through interaction with PRC2. Future studies investigating the mechanism of transformation by loss of BAP1 and ASXL1 may result in new therapeutic approaches to treat hematological malignancies.","['Abdel-Wahab, O', 'Dey, A']","['Abdel-Wahab O', 'Dey A']","['Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA. abdelwao@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20121009,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2012/11/14 06:00,2013/03/01 06:00,['2012/11/14 06:00'],"['2012/11/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012288 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.288 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Jan;27(1):10-5. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.288.

METHODS: Twenty-eight children with ALL (15 Han children and 13 Uyghur children), who received high-dose MTX chemotherapy, were divided into >10 mumol/L and </=10 mumol/L groups according to 24-hour blood concentration of MTX, and divided into >1.0 mumol/L and </=1.0 mumol/L groups according to 48-hour blood concentration of MTX. Enzyme multiplied immunoassay was used to measure blood concentrations of MTX in the MTX-treated children at 24 and 48 hours after MTX administration, and the adverse effects were observed. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse effects between the >10 mumol/L and </=10 mumol/L groups (P>0.05). The >1.0 mumol/L group showed higher incidences of gastrointestinal reactions and mucosal injuries than the </=1.0 mumol/L group (P<0.05), but no significant difference was found between the two groups with respect to the incidence of abnormal liver function and bone marrow suppression (P>0.05). Compared with Uyghur children, Han children showed higher 24- and 48-hour blood concentrations of MTX (P<0.05) and higher incidence of abnormal liver function, mucosal injuries, and bone marrow suppression (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The 24-hour blood concentration of MTX cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse effects in MTX chemotherapy, but 48-hour blood concentration of MTX is helpful in this regard. There are significant differences in 24- and 48-hour blood concentrations of MTX and the incidence of adverse effects between Uyghur and the Han children with ALL who receive MTX chemotherapy. Monitoring of blood MTX concentration maybe significant for timely adjustment of MTX dosage and individualized MTX chemotherapy.","['Hu, Wei-Wei', 'Nuriding, Hailiqiguli', 'Yan, Mei']","['Hu WW', 'Nuriding H', 'Yan M']","['Department of Pediatrics, First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi 830054, China. .']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,,2012/11/14 06:00,2013/05/07 06:00,['2012/11/14 06:00'],"['2012/11/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/07 06:00 [medline]']",['1008-8830(2012)11-0852-04 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2012 Nov;14(11):852-5.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China/ethnology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects/blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, unlike human or mouse LAG-3, no functional analysis of LAG-3 has been reported in domestic animals. Thus, in this study, bovine LAG-3 expression was analyzed in bovine leukemia virus (BLV)-infected cattle. In persistent lymphocytotic (PL) cattle, the numbers of LAG-3(+)CD4(+) cells and LAG-3(+)CD8(+) cells were conserved whilst the number of MHC class II(+) cells was remarkably higher than in the control animals. In contrast, the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for LAG-3 on PBMCs from PL cattle was significantly increased compared to control and asymptomatic (AL) cattle. Specifically, the LAG-3 expression level was significantly increased in both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells from PL cattle. LAG-3 expression correlated positively with increased numbers of lymphocytes and MHC class II(+) cells in infected animals. Preliminary results from PD-L1 and LAG-3 blockade assay revealed that IFN-gamma and IL-2 expressions were significantly up-regulated by addition of anti- PD-L1 and LAG-3 antibodies in PBMCs from PL cattle. These findings suggest that LAG-3 might be involved in the inhibition of T-cell function through its binding and signaling on MHC class II molecule during BLV infection.","['Konnai, Satoru', 'Suzuki, Saori', 'Shirai, Tatsuya', 'Ikebuchi, Ryoyo', 'Okagawa, Tomohiro', 'Sunden, Yuji', 'Mingala, Claro N', 'Onuma, Misao', 'Murata, Shiro', 'Ohashi, Kazuhiko']","['Konnai S', 'Suzuki S', 'Shirai T', 'Ikebuchi R', 'Okagawa T', 'Sunden Y', 'Mingala CN', 'Onuma M', 'Murata S', 'Ohashi K']","['Department of Disease Control, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan. konnai@vetmed.hokudai.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121110,England,Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,"Comparative immunology, microbiology and infectious diseases",7808924,,2012/11/14 06:00,2013/06/12 06:00,['2012/11/14 06:00'],"['2012/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/01 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0147-9571(12)00105-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cimid.2012.09.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis. 2013 Jan;36(1):63-9. doi: 10.1016/j.cimid.2012.09.005.

The pathogenic roles of human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) in acute leukemia have been of great interest. Discordant results to establish a link between HHV-6 activation and the genesis of acute leukemia have been observed. The objective of this study was to evaluate a possible association between HHV-6 infection and acute leukemia in children and adults, with a longitudinal follow-up at diagnosis, aplasia, remission and relapse. METHODS: HHV-6 load was quantified by a quantitative real-time PCR in the blood and bone marrow samples from 37 children and 36 adults with acute leukemia: 33 B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), 6 T acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), 34 acute myeloid leukemia (AML). RESULTS: HHV-6 was detected in 15%, 8%, 30% and 28% of the blood samples at diagnosis, aplasia, remission and relapse, respectively. The median viral loads were 138, 244, 112 and 78 copies/million cells at diagnosis, aplasia, remission and relapse, respectively. In the bone marrow samples, HHV-6 was detected in 5%, 20% and 23% of the samples at diagnosis, remission and relapse, respectively. The median viral loads were 34, 109 and 32 copies/million cells at diagnosis, remission and relapse, respectively. According to the type of leukemia at diagnosis, HHV-6 was detected in 19% of the blood samples and in 7% of the bone marrow samples (with median viral loads at 206 and 79 copies/million cells, respectively) from patients with B-ALL. For patients with AML, HHV-6 was present in 8% of the blood samples and in 4% of the bone marrow samples (with median viral loads at 68 and 12 copies/million cells, respectively). HHV-6 was more prevalent in the blood samples from children than from adults (25% and 9%, respectively) and for the bone marrow (11% and 0%, respectively). All typable HHV-6 were HHV-6B species.

A series of reports illustrate a convincing link between the rate of intrauterine growth and the risk of childhood leukemia. Some studies suggest that this risk relationship also extends to non-Hodgkin lymphoma in children, although, overall, the association with childhood lymphoma is less clear.

The cytotoxic activity of these compounds in vitro was evaluated against the human leukaemia (HL-60) and human hepatoma (SMMC-7721) cell lines. METHODS: Eight natural flavonoids (1-8) were isolated from the aerial parts of Rhododendron hainanense and a series of modified flavonoid derivatives (9-18) were obtained from the natural product matteucinol (1), using simple synthetic methods. Antitumour inhibitory activity of these flavonoids was assessed using the sulforhodamine B method. KEY FINDINGS: Most of the compounds exhibited good pharmacological activity and the preliminary structure-activity relationships were described. Within the series of flavonoid derivatives in this study, compounds 3 (2,3-dihydro-5-hydroxy-7-methoxy-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-6,8-dimethyl-4H-1-benzopyran -4-one) and 16 (5-hydroxy-7, 4'-dimethoxy-6, 8-dimethylflavan) exhibited strong inhibitory activity against the HL-60 cell line with IC50 values (the drug concentration that resulted in a 50% reduction in cell viability or inhibition of the biological activity) of 15.2 and 13.2 microm, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Renewed attention to flavonoid derivatives revealed the possibility that compounds 3 and 16 could be considered as lead compounds for the development of new antitumour agents. Our results have not only enriched the family of active flavonoids from natural sources, but have encouraged the synthesis of flavonoid analogues for improving cytotoxic activity.","['Zhao, Jie', 'Ding, Huan-Xing', 'Zhao, Deng-Gao', 'Wang, Chun-Ming', 'Gao, Kun']","['Zhao J', 'Ding HX', 'Zhao DG', 'Wang CM', 'Gao K']","['School of Biotechnology and Chemical Engineering, Ningbo Institute of Technology, Zhejiang University, Ningbo, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20120704,England,J Pharm Pharmacol,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,0376363,,2012/11/14 06:00,2013/04/25 06:00,['2012/11/14 06:00'],"['2012/11/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.2042-7158.2012.01560.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Pharm Pharmacol. 2012 Dec;64(12):1785-92. doi: 10.1111/j.2042-7158.2012.01560.x.

This hypoglycemia has been hypothesized to affect substrate utilization of gluconeogenic precursor alanine in the liver. CASE REPORT: An overweight 5-year-old boy with ALL was evaluated for SH (lethargy and vomiting) that occurred 8-10 h after fasting while receiving daily 6-MP. Hypoglycemic episodes (>20 episodes per month) occurred predominantly around midmorning but not during the 5-day dexamethasone pulse. The adrenocorticotropic hormone test yielded a normal cortisol response, which ruled out pituitary adrenal suppression. A 12-h overnight fasting glucose was 49 mg/dL, with suppressed insulin response <2 IU/mL, low C-peptide of 0.5 ng/mL, high insulin-like growth factor-binding protein >160 ng/mL, high free fatty acid of 2.64 mmol/L, and negative glucagon stimulation test (change in blood glucose [BG] <5 mg/dL). These results ruled out hyperinsulinism. The patient was placed on cornstarch therapy 5 h prior to dosing with 6-MP. This treatment reduced the SH events to fewer than two episodes per month. To study the efficacy of cornstarch, the patient was fitted with the iPro professional continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) (Medtronic MiniMed, Northridge, CA) with a preset low alarm at 70 mg/dL, which was worn for a period of 5 days while the patient was on cornstarch. With 1,000 sensor reading the BG range was 65-158 mg/dL, and the percentage mean absolute difference between sensor and finger-stick BG readings (the parent monitored his BG four times a day) was 9.4%. There were no hypoglycemic episodes detected by the CGMS while the patient was on cornstarch. After the cessation of chemotherapy, a 15-h fasting study was performed, and the CGMS was placed. Results showed resolution of hypoglycemia. CONCLUSIONS: The CGMS helped us devise an effective management plan for our patient. CGMS proved useful as an adjunct to characterize the pattern of hypoglycemia and to validate the benefit of cornstarch in hypoglycemia associated with 6-MP treatment of ALL.","['Visavachaipan, Nipapat', 'Aledo, Alexander', 'Franklin, Bonita H', 'Brar, Preneet C']","['Visavachaipan N', 'Aledo A', 'Franklin BH', 'Brar PC']","['Division of Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York 10016, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20121112,United States,Diabetes Technol Ther,Diabetes technology & therapeutics,100889084,,2012/11/14 06:00,2013/07/03 06:00,['2012/11/14 06:00'],"['2012/11/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/dia.2012.0181 [doi]'],ppublish,Diabetes Technol Ther. 2013 Jan;15(1):97-100. doi: 10.1089/dia.2012.0181.

Thereby, signaling pathway-targeted therapies are powerful customized treatment to eradicate cancer cells. In murine and human leukemia cells harboring mutations in Kit, we previously showed that distinct and independent pathways controlled resistance to apoptosis or cell cycle. A treatment with PI3Kinase inhibitors to reduce cell proliferation combined with inhibitors of Erk1/2 activity to promote apoptosis had synergistic effects allowing eradication of leukemia cell growth. We reported here that Bim(EL), a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl2 family proteins, is the target of Erk1/2 signaling and that its down-regulation is responsible for the apoptosis resistance of murine and human leukemic cells. Downstream of Kit mutant, the tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 maintains Bim(EL) expression at a low level, through Erk/2 activation and proteosomal Bim(EL) degradation. This process is controlled by Shp2 independently of other signaling pathways activated downstream of oncogenic Kit, demonstrating that Shp2 is a key regulator of Bim expression in the context of an oncogenic signaling. The increase in Bim(EL) expression is associated to an increased apoptosis. Moreover, the depletion of Bim overcomes apoptosis associated with Erk1/2 inactivation in UO126-treated leukemic cells, thereby establishing the contribution of Bim to drug-induced apoptosis. These data provide a molecular rationale for using BH3 mimetics in combination with PI3K inhibitors to treat leukemia, especially in the case of an oncogenic signaling refractory to Tyrosine Kinase inhibitors.","['Selimoglu-Buet, Dorothee', 'Gallais, Isabelle', 'Denis, Nicole', 'Guillouf, Christel', 'Moreau-Gachelin, Francoise']","['Selimoglu-Buet D', 'Gallais I', 'Denis N', 'Guillouf C', 'Moreau-Gachelin F']","['Institut Curie, Inserm-U830, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121107,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC3492180,2012/11/13 06:00,2013/07/25 06:00,['2012/11/13 06:00'],"['2012/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0049052 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-20163 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(11):e49052. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0049052.

We have previously shown that imatinib therapy is associated with an increase in trabecular bone volume. OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we performed a prospective analysis of bone indices in imatinib-treated CML patients to determine the mechanism responsible for this altered bone remodeling. DESIGN, PATIENTS, AND INTERVENTION: This study assessed the effects of high-dose (600 mg/d) imatinib on bone parameters in newly diagnosed chronic-phase Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML patients (n = 11) enrolled in the TIDEL II study. At baseline and after 6, 12, and 24 months of treatment, serum markers of bone remodeling were quantitated, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry analysis of bone mineral density (BMD) was carried out, and a bone biopsy was collected for histological and micro-computed tomography analysis. RESULTS: Our studies show that the increase in trabecular bone volume and trabecular thickness after imatinib treatment was associated with a significant decrease in osteoclast numbers, accompanied by a significant decrease in serum levels of a marker of osteoclast activity. In contrast, osteoblast numbers were not altered by up to 24 months of imatinib treatment. Notably, we also found that imatinib caused a site-specific decrease in BMD at the femoral neck. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that imatinib therapy dysregulates bone remodeling, causing a generalized decrease in osteoclast number and activity that is not counterbalanced by a decrease in osteoblast activity, leading to increased trabecular bone volume. Further long-term investigations are required to determine the causes and consequences of the site-specific decrease in BMD at the femoral neck.","['Vandyke, Kate', 'Fitter, Stephen', 'Drew, Jenny', 'Fukumoto, Seiji', 'Schultz, Christopher G', 'Sims, Natalie A', 'Yeung, David T', 'Hughes, Timothy P', 'Zannettino, Andrew C W']","['Vandyke K', 'Fitter S', 'Drew J', 'Fukumoto S', 'Schultz CG', 'Sims NA', 'Yeung DT', 'Hughes TP', 'Zannettino AC']","['Myeloma Research Laboratory, Division of Hematology, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, GPO Box 14, Adelaide, SA, Australia 5000.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121108,United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,,2012/11/13 06:00,2013/03/08 06:00,['2012/11/13 06:00'],"['2012/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/08 06:00 [medline]']","['jc.2012-2426 [pii]', '10.1210/jc.2012-2426 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2013 Jan;98(1):67-76. doi: 10.1210/jc.2012-2426.

To identify co-operating pathways to leukemogenesis, we crossed MRP8-PML/RARA transgenic mice with BXH-2 mice which harbor an endogenous murine leukemia virus that causes acute myeloid leukemia. Approximately half of the leukemias that arose in this cross showed features of acute promyelocytic leukemia. We identified 22 proviral insertion sites in acute promyelocytic-like leukemias and focused our analysis on insertion at Sox4, a HMG box transcription factor. Using a transplant model, co-operation between PML-RARalpha and Sox4 was confirmed with increased penetrance and reduced latency of disease. Interestingly, karyotypic analysis revealed cytogenetic changes suggesting that the factors combined to initiate but not complete leukemic transformation. The cooperation between these transcription factors is consistent with the paradigm of multiple routes to the disease and reinforces the concept that transcription factor networks are important therapeutic targets in myeloid leukemias.","['Omidvar, Nader', 'Maunakea, Mei Lin', 'Jones, Letetia', 'Sevcikova, Sabina', 'Yin, Bin', 'Himmel, Karen L', 'Tennant, Thelma R', 'Le Beau, Michelle M', 'Largaespada, David A', 'Kogan, Scott C']","['Omidvar N', 'Maunakea ML', 'Jones L', 'Sevcikova S', 'Yin B', 'Himmel KL', 'Tennant TR', 'Le Beau MM', 'Largaespada DA', 'Kogan SC']","['Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center and Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California San Francisco, USA.

B-cell receptor signaling is a driving event in the progression of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and markers of B-cell receptor responsiveness have been shown to be of prognostic value. Single cell network profiling, a multiparametric flow cytometry-based assay, allows functional signaling analysis at the level of the single cell. B-cell receptor signaling proteins (i.e. p-SYK, p-NF-kappaB p65, p-ERK, p-p38, p-JNK) were functionally characterized by single cell network profiling in samples from patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia in an exploratory study (n=27) after stimulation with anti-IgM. Significant associations of single cell network profiling data with clinical outcome (i.e. time to first treatment), as assessed by Cox regression models, were then confirmed in patients' samples in two other sequential independent studies, i.e. test study 1 (n=30), and test study 2 (n=37). In the exploratory study, higher responsiveness of the B-cell receptor signaling proteins to anti-IgM was associated with poor clinical outcomes. Patients' clustering based on signaling response was at least as powerful in discriminating different disease courses as traditional prognostic markers. In an unselected subgroup of patients with Binet stage A disease (n=21), increased anti-IgM-modulated p-ERK signaling was shown to be a significant, independent predictor of shorter time to first treatment. This result was independently confirmed in two test cohorts from distinct populations of patients. In conclusion, these findings support the utility of the single cell network profiling assay in elucidating signaling perturbations with the potential for the development of a clinically useful prognostic test in patients with early stage B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. These data support the clinical relevance of B-cell receptor signaling in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and suggest a key role of ERK activation in the physiopathology of this leukemia.","['Cesano, Alessandra', 'Perbellini, Omar', 'Evensen, Erik', 'Chu, Charles C', 'Cioffi, Federica', 'Ptacek, Jason', 'Damle, Rajendra N', 'Chignola, Roberto', 'Cordeiro, James', 'Yan, Xiao-jie', 'Hawtin, Rachael E', 'Nichele, Ilaria', 'Ware, Jodi R', 'Cavallini, Chiara', 'Lovato, Ornella', 'Zanotti, Roberta', 'Rai, Kanti R', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas', 'Pizzolo, Giovanni', 'Scupoli, Maria T']","['Cesano A', 'Perbellini O', 'Evensen E', 'Chu CC', 'Cioffi F', 'Ptacek J', 'Damle RN', 'Chignola R', 'Cordeiro J', 'Yan XJ', 'Hawtin RE', 'Nichele I', 'Ware JR', 'Cavallini C', 'Lovato O', 'Zanotti R', 'Rai KR', 'Chiorazzi N', 'Pizzolo G', 'Scupoli MT']","['Nodality Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121109,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC3685273,2012/11/13 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2012/11/13 06:00'],"['2012/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2012.071910 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2012.071910 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2013 Apr;98(4):626-34. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2012.071910.

Recognizing potentially important differences between the diseases, we undertook a population-based comparison of baseline characteristics, treatments, and outcomes between older adults with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. The patients' data were obtained from Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results registry data from 2001-2005, linked to Medicare claims. Baseline characteristics, treatment (red blood cell transfusions, hematopoietic growth factors, hypomethylating agents, chemotherapy or transplantation), progression to acute myeloid leukemia, and overall survival were compared using bivariate techniques. Multivariate logistic regression estimated differences in treatments received. Cox proportional hazard models estimated the effects of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia relative to myelodysplastic syndromes on progression-free survival. A larger proportion of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (n=792), compared to patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (n=7,385), failed to receive any treatment (25% versus 15%; P<0.0001), or only received red blood cell transfusions (19.8% versus 16.7%; P=0.037). A larger percentage of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (42.6% versus 15.5%, respectively; P<0.0001), with shorter time to progression. Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia patients had a shorter median survival (13.3 versus 23.3 months; P<0.0001) and lower 3-year survival rate (19% versus 36%; P<0.0001). Adjusted estimates, controlling for baseline characteristics and selected treatments, indicate that chronic myelomonocytic leukemia was associated with an increased risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia or death (HR 2.22; P<0.0001), compared to myelodysplastic syndromes. In conclusion, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia is less frequently treated in older adults and is associated with worse outcomes, even after controlling for the patients' baseline characteristics and selected treatments. Our data suggest the need for continued evaluation of the biological differences between these diseases and clinical trials targeting chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.","['Zandberg, Dan P', 'Huang, Ting-Ying', 'Ke, Xuehua', 'Baer, Maria R', 'Gore, Steven D', 'Smith, Sheila Weiss', 'Davidoff, Amy J']","['Zandberg DP', 'Huang TY', 'Ke X', 'Baer MR', 'Gore SD', 'Smith SW', 'Davidoff AJ']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine and Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA. dzandberg@umm.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20121109,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC3659989,2012/11/13 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2012/11/13 06:00'],"['2012/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2012.062547 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2012.062547 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2013 Apr;98(4):584-90. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2012.062547.

The patients (n = 126) were newly diagnosed using a panel of monoclonal antibodies: CD1a, CD2, CD3, CD4, CD7, CD8, CD10, CD13, CD33, CD14, CD19, CD22, CD79a, CD117, CD34, anti-IgM, anti-TdT, anti-HLA-Dr, and anti-human kappa and lambda light chains. Additional data, such as patients' age and gender, clinical and laboratory findings such as presence of tumor masses, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, leukemic infiltration in the central nervous system (CNS) were also investigated. Results showed that 56.7% of the cases were B-lineage ALL and 55% were T-cell ALL. Also, we found that males were more affected by the disease, regardless of immunological classification. The correlation between age and immunological subtypes showed that the B-lineage ALL occurred more frequently in patients aged under 15 while the T-cell ALL subtype was more frequent in adults. Immunophenotypic profiles and morphological subtypes showed a direct correlation between L3 subtype and B-lineage ALL, while L1 and L2 subtypes correlated more often with B-cell lineage and T-cell ALL, respectively. Correlation analysis between immunophenotypic and clinical profiles showed that T-cell ALL was more associated with a higher incidence of lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and CNS leukemic infiltration, also showing a greater blast cell count in peripheral blood than the other subgroups. The presented data suggest that immunophenotyping is an important method in the diagnosis, monitoring and prognostic assessment in determining the pathological mechanisms of evolution of ALL.","['Alves, Gabriela Vasconcelos de Andrade', 'Fernandes, Andrea Luciana Araujo da Cunha', 'Freire, Juliana Mendonca', 'Paiva, Aldair de Souza', 'Vasconcelos, Roberto Chaves de', 'Sales, Valeria Soraya de Farias', 'Lemos, Telma Maria de Araujo Moura', 'Gil, Erica Aires', 'Freire, Flavio Henrique Miranda de Araujo', 'Cavalcanti e Silva, Dany Geraldo Kramer', 'Maciel, James Farley Rafael', 'Farkatt, Irian Guedes', 'Cavalcanti Junior, Geraldo Barroso']","['Alves GV', 'Fernandes AL', 'Freire JM', 'Paiva Ade S', 'Vasconcelos RC', 'Sales VS', 'Lemos TM', 'Gil EA', 'Freire FH', 'Cavalcanti e Silva DG', 'Maciel JF', 'Farkatt IG', 'Cavalcanti Junior GB']","['Departamento de Analises Clinicas e Toxicologicas, Faculdade de Farmacia da Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, Natal-RN, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Lab Anal,Journal of clinical laboratory analysis,8801384,PMC6807456,2012/11/13 06:00,2013/07/17 06:00,['2012/11/13 06:00'],"['2012/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcla.21540 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Lab Anal. 2012 Nov;26(6):431-40. doi: 10.1002/jcla.21540.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/blood/chemistry/classification', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*classification/diagnosis/immunology/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,"['(c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Groups of injured and sham controls receiving estrogen or vehicle were killed 2 h after injury and resuscitation, and liver tissue was harvested. Complementary RNA was synthesized from each RNA sample and hybridized to microarrays. A large number of genes were differentially expressed at the 2-h time point in injured animals with or without estrogen treatment. The upregulation or downregulation of a cohort of 14 of these genes was validated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. This large-scale microarray analysis shows that at the 2-h time point, there is marked alteration in hepatic gene expression following trauma-hemorrhage. However, estrogen treatment attenuated these changes in injured animals. Pathway analysis demonstrated predominant changes in the expression of genes involved in metabolism, immunity, and apoptosis. Upregulation of low-density lipoprotein receptor, protein phosphatase 1, regulatory subunit 3C, ring-finger protein 11, pyroglutamyl-peptidase I, bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein, integrin, alphaD, BCL2-like 11, leukemia inhibitory factor receptor, ATPase, Cu transporting, alpha polypeptide, and Mk1 protein was found in estrogen-treated trauma-hemorrhaged animals. Thus, estrogen produces hepatoprotection following trauma-hemorrhage likely via antiapoptosis and improving/restoring metabolism and immunity pathways.","['Yu, Huang-Ping', 'Pang, See-Tong', 'Chaudry, Irshad H']","['Yu HP', 'Pang ST', 'Chaudry IH']","['Department of Anesthesiology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Shock,"Shock (Augusta, Ga.)",9421564,,2012/11/13 06:00,2013/06/05 06:00,['2012/11/13 06:00'],"['2012/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/SHK.0b013e3182768aa4 [doi]'],ppublish,Shock. 2013 Jan;39(1):77-82. doi: 10.1097/SHK.0b013e3182768aa4.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cytoprotection/drug effects/genetics', 'Estradiol/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Liver/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Shock, Hemorrhagic/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Wounds and Injuries/genetics/*metabolism/pathology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in some mouse strains ERVs are actively involved in disease. Here we report that nucleic acid-recognizing Toll-like receptors 3, 7, and 9 (TLR 3, TLR7, and TLR9) are essential for the control of ERVs. Loss of TLR7 function caused spontaneous retroviral viremia that coincided with the absence of ERV-specific antibodies. Importantly, additional TLR3 and TLR9 deficiency led to acute T cell lymphoblastic leukemia, underscoring a prominent role for TLR3 and TLR9 in surveillance of ERV-induced tumors. Experimental ERV infection induced a TLR3-, TLR7-, and TLR9-dependent group of ""acute-phase"" genes previously described in HIV and SIV infections.

However, the development of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) to rHuEPO can result in the development of antibody-mediated pure red cell aplasia (PRCA). The detection of NAb in patient sera by in vitro bioassay relies on the inhibition of a cellular response to rHuEPO. Current bioassays for rHuEPO measure proliferation in responsive cell lines such as the erythroleukaemic cell lines, UT-7 and UT-7/EPO, the latter sensitized to EPO. Using these cell lines, we show the dose-responsive induction of both PIM1 and EGR1 gene expression in UT-7 cells and of EGR1 in UT-7/EPO cells. The expression of EGR1 in UT-7/EPO cells in response to rHuEPO was comparable to the proliferative response measured by (3)H-thymidine incorporation and could be inhibited by serum from a patient with NAb-mediated PRCA in a dilution-dependent manner. Bioassays based on the induction of endogenous gene expression are comparable to current bioassays but are considerably quicker given that incubation time is decreased from 2-3 days to 50 min. Measurement of EGR1 gene expression in response to rHuEPO in UT-7/EPO cells offers a rapid, non-radioactive and automatable alternative to current assays for the detection of rHuEPO NAbs.","['Ferguson, Jackie', 'Bird, Chris', 'Wadhwa, Meenu', 'Burns, Chris']","['Ferguson J', 'Bird C', 'Wadhwa M', 'Burns C']","['Biotherapeutics Group, National Institute of Biological Standards and Control, South Mimms, Potters Bar, Herts EN6 3QG, UK.

Considerable evidence also suggests a lower rate of recurrence after UCB SCT than after transplantation from adult donors. Recent advances in understanding of the human fetal immune development provide a rational underpinning for these clinical outcomes. The fetal immune system is geared toward maintaining tolerance to foreign antigens, particularly to the maternal antigens to which it is exposed throughout gestation. To this purpose it is dominated by a unique population of peripheral T regulatory cells that actively maintain tolerance. This and other features of the UCB lymphoid system explains the low incidence of graft-versus-host disease and superior outcomes of UCB SCT with noninherited maternal antigen-matched grafts. At the same time, highly sensitized maternal microchimeric cells are frequently detected in UCB and likely contribute to superior graft-versus-leukemia effects and low rates of disease recurrence in inherited paternal antigen-matched UCB recipients. However, historically erratic and slow hematopoietic recovery after UCB SCT leads to increased early morbidity and mortality, excessive hospitalization, and increased costs. This has held up the widespread utilization of UCB SCT in adults. Here we summarize recent data on UCB SCT with an emphasis on studies of co-infusion of adult CD34 selected hematopoietic stem cells with UCB SCT. This procedure, through transient engraftment of adult hematopoietic stem cells, largely overcomes the problem of delayed engraftment. It also results in predictable engraftment of a UCB with the desired characteristics. We also briefly discuss unresolved issues and possible future applications of this technology.","['Van Besien, Koen', 'Liu, Hongtao', 'Jain, Nitin', 'Stock, Wendy', 'Artz, Andrew']","['Van Besien K', 'Liu H', 'Jain N', 'Stock W', 'Artz A']","['Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.

The active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25(OH)2 D3) is a natural ligand for vitamin D receptor (VDR). Since 1,25(OH)2D3 exerts toxic effects at a concentration that is beneficial, nearly 1500 analogs of vitamin D have been synthesized and evaluated for their efficacy in a variety of carcinogenesis and human cancer models both in vitro and in vivo. Among these only a handful of them have been approved for evaluation in clinical trials for leukemia, breast, prostate and colon cancers. The mechanism of vitamin D action is mediated by the nuclear VDR and the signaling cascade for its action is extensively reported. In this review we focus on the newer concepts for vitamin D action. These include (1) differential effects of vitamin D in maintaining cell proliferation when the cells are under stress but suppressing cell growth when the cells are transformed; (2) functional significance of VDR polymorphism in potential vitamin D responsiveness; (3) regulation of constitutive splicing of vitamin D target gene, CYP24a, by the hormone and its significance; and (4) regulation of microRNA by vitamin D in breast cancer. It is anticipated that the new work in these selective areas would expand the understanding of vitamin D in breast cancer prevention and therapy.","['Mehta, Rajendra G', 'Peng, Xinjian', 'Alimirah, Fatouma', 'Murillo, Genoveva', 'Mehta, Rajeshwari']","['Mehta RG', 'Peng X', 'Alimirah F', 'Murillo G', 'Mehta R']","['IIT Research Institute, 10 West 35th Street, Chicago, IL 60616, United States.

These results suggest a potential role of MMP-9, MT1-MMP, TIMP-1, TIMP-2 and VEGF in tissue migration and angiogenesis in canine leukaemia.","['Arico, Arianna', 'Giantin, Mery', 'Gelain, Mariaelena', 'Riondato, Fulvio', 'Mortarino, Michele', 'Comazzi, Stefano', 'Dacasto, Mauro', 'Castagnaro, Massimo', 'Aresu, Luca']","['Arico A', 'Giantin M', 'Gelain M', 'Riondato F', 'Mortarino M', 'Comazzi S', 'Dacasto M', 'Castagnaro M', 'Aresu L']","[""Department of Comparative Biomedicine and Food Science, University of Padova, Viale dell'Universita 16, 35020 Agripolis Legnaro (PD), Italy.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121108,England,Vet J,"Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)",9706281,,2012/11/13 06:00,2014/01/01 06:00,['2012/11/13 06:00'],"['2012/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/14 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S1090-0233(12)00426-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tvjl.2012.10.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet J. 2013 May;196(2):260-2. doi: 10.1016/j.tvjl.2012.10.004.

METHODS: The gingival fibroblasts were isolated and cultured in vivo, divided into blank control group, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) group and Escherichia coli (Ec) group. mRNA expression levels were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The protein expression levels were detected by the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The data was statistically analyzed by SPSS16.0 software package. RESULTS: LPS from Pg could stimulate the expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) mRNA and protein, which reached the peak (5.87 +/- 0.83) at 10 h, and the expression level increased with the increase of the Pg concentration. IL-11 or oncostatin-M (OSM) mRNA expression was not affected by LPS. After treated with Pg for 48 h, the protein expression of IL-6 and LIF was up-regulated, (962 +/- 57) ng/L and (47 +/- 18) ng/L respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Signaling through TLR-2 controls the expression of cytokines of IL-6 family in human gingival fibroblasts.","['Xin, Hong', 'Wang, Yan-hua', 'Liu, Hao']","['Xin H', 'Wang YH', 'Liu H']","[""Department of Stomatology, People's Hospital of Tianjin, 300121 Tianjin, China.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Kou Qiang Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua kou qiang yi xue za zhi = Zhonghua kouqiang yixue zazhi = Chinese journal of stomatology,8711066,,2012/11/13 06:00,2014/02/18 06:00,['2012/11/13 06:00'],"['2012/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.1002-0098.2012.09.003 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Kou Qiang Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2012 Sep;47(9):523-7. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.1002-0098.2012.09.003.,"['0 (IL11 protein, human)', '0 (IL6 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Pam(3)CSK(4) peptide)', '0 (Pam2CSK4 lipopeptide)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TLR2 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 2)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Escherichia coli/chemistry', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/*metabolism', 'Gingiva/cytology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/genetics/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lipopeptides/pharmacology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/administration & dosage/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Oncostatin M/genetics/metabolism', 'Porphyromonas gingivalis/chemistry', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Toll-Like Receptor 2/*agonists', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Survival of patients with localized cRMS is 70% after 5 years but not in the case of intracranial neoplasms, where survival rarely exceeds 10 months. CASE REPORT: A 10-year-old female patient with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and holocranial radiotherapy (RT) 6 years ago, referred after partial surgical resection of a left parietal lesion, diagnosed as an embryonal tumor with mixed neuronal-glial differentiation (WHO grade IV). A second operation was performed for complete resection and placement of intracavitary chemotherapy (carmustine). The pathology revealed a high-grade undifferentiated neoplasm positive for myogenin and desmin that was compatible with cRMS. In the immunohistochemistry study, the neoplasm was positive for vimentin, myogenin, and desmin, as is characteristic of cRMS, and negative for synaptophysin and enolase, ruling out primitive neuroectodermal embriogenic tumor (PNET). Given a diagnosis of cRMS, a combined thoracoabdominal PET-CT scan was performed without finding other primary lesions and a bone marrow study was also performed without observing abnormalities. Consequently, the diagnosis was established as primary cRMS. DISCUSSION: Among the long-term sequelae of radiotherapy, neurocognitive disorders, brain disorders such as leukomalacia, vascular diseases, or secondary tumors, ranging from benign lesions such as meningiomas to more aggressive lesions such as ependymomas, which are high-grade gliomas, are described. In the brain MRI, our patient showed a radiotherapy-induced periventricular leukomalacia and a malignant lesion: a cRMS. The use of carmustine in this disease may facilitate local control.","['Rivero-Garvia, Monica', 'Marquez-Rivas, Javier', 'Rivas, Eloy', 'Medina-Lopez, Diego', 'Quiroga-Cantero, Eduardo']","['Rivero-Garvia M', 'Marquez-Rivas J', 'Rivas E', 'Medina-Lopez D', 'Quiroga-Cantero E']","['Department of Pediatrics Neurosurgery, Virgen del Rocio University Hospital, Seville, Spain. monicargarvia@msn.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20121109,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,,2012/11/13 06:00,2015/05/06 06:00,['2012/11/13 06:00'],"['2012/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08880018.2012.737440 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2013 Feb;30(1):1-3. doi: 10.3109/08880018.2012.737440.

F1F0 ATPase, an inner mitochondrial enzyme, is expressed on the plasma membrane of tumor cells, and its inhibition induces both anti-angiogenic and anti-tumorigenic activity. METHODS: Monoclonal Antibody (McAb) against ATPase was produced by polyethylene glycol-mediated fusions and screened by ELISA. Proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis of cells were analyzed when the surface ATPase of cells was blockaded with McAb. RESULTS: We detected cell-membrane expression of the F1F0 ATPase beta subunit on 0.1% to 56% of the 11 cell lines derived from leukemia, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We produced a monoclonal antibody, McAb7E10, which recognizes both the native and recombinant ATPase beta subunit, with a dissociation constant (KD) of 3.26E-10. We demonstrate that McAb7E10 binds to ATPase at the cell surface, where it is able to inhibit ATP synthesis. McAb7E10 significantly inhibited proliferation of AML cell lines in vitro: the relative inhibitory rates of 50 mug/mL McAb7E10 treated MV4-11and HL-60 cells were 69.6% and 81.9% respectively. Cell cycle analysis indicated that McAb7E10 significantly induced apoptosis in MV4-11 and HL-60 cells: the relative rates of apoptosis in 5, 10 and 50ug/mL McAb7E10 treated MV4-11 cells was 3.6 +/- 0.83%, 8.4 +/- 1.69% and 17.3 +/- 2.56% compared to 1.5% +/- 0.85% in mouse IgG treated cells (p < 0.01). The relative rate of apoptosis in 5, 10 and 50ug/mL McAb7E10 treated HL-60 cells was 5.5 +/- 2.37%, 11.3 +/- 3.62% and 19.9 +/- 3.31% compared to 1.56% +/- 0.97% in mouse IgG treated cells (p < 0.01). Annexin V staining demonstrated that the relative apoptotic rates in 50 mug/mL McAb7E10 treated MV4-11 and HL-60 cells were 50.5% +/- 7.04% and 32.9% +/- 4.52%, respectively, significantly higher than IgG control antibody treated cells were 21.9% +/- 3.11% and 15.3% +/- 3.95%, p < 0.01. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that ectopic expression of ATPase beta subunit may be a tumor-associated antigen in hematological malignancies.

It forms a ring shaped structure of 86 kDa by the symmetric association of three identical protomers. The ring encircles the DNA and acts as a docking platform for other proteins, most of them containing the PCNA Interaction Protein sequence (PIP-box). We have used NMR to characterize the interactions of PCNA with several other proteins and fragments in solution. The binding of the PIP-box peptide of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 to PCNA is consistent with the crystal structure of the complex. A shorter p21 peptide binds with reduced affinity but retains most of the molecular recognition determinants. However the binding of the corresponding peptide of the tumor suppressor ING1 is extremely weak, indicating that slight deviations from the consensus PIP-box sequence dramatically reduce the affinity for PCNA, in contrast with a proposed less stringent PIP-box sequence requirement. We could not detect any binding between PCNA and the MCL-1 or the CDK2 protein, reported to interact with PCNA in biochemical assays. This suggests that they do not bind directly to PCNA, or they do but very weakly, with additional unidentified factors stabilizing the interactions in the cell. Backbone dynamics measurements show three PCNA regions with high relative flexibility, including the interdomain connector loop (IDCL) and the C-terminus, both of them involved in the interaction with the PIP-box. Our work provides the basis for high resolution studies of direct ligand binding to PCNA in solution.","['De Biasio, Alfredo', 'Campos-Olivas, Ramon', 'Sanchez, Ricardo', 'Lopez-Alonso, Jorge P', 'Pantoja-Uceda, David', 'Merino, Nekane', 'Villate, Maider', 'Martin-Garcia, Jose M', 'Castillo, Francisco', 'Luque, Irene', 'Blanco, Francisco J']","['De Biasio A', 'Campos-Olivas R', 'Sanchez R', 'Lopez-Alonso JP', 'Pantoja-Uceda D', 'Merino N', 'Villate M', 'Martin-Garcia JM', 'Castillo F', 'Luque I', 'Blanco FJ']","['Structural Biology Unit, CIC bioGUNE, Derio, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121106,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC3491057,2012/11/10 06:00,2013/04/24 06:00,['2012/11/10 06:00'],"['2012/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0048390 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-18273 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(11):e48390. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0048390.

Here, we show that RANKL is expressed by primary multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, whereas release of soluble RANKL was observed exclusively with multiple myeloma cells and was strongly influenced by posttranscriptional/posttranslational regulation. Signaling via RANKL into multiple myeloma and CLL cells induced release of cytokines involved in disease pathophysiology. Both the effects of RANKL on osteoclastogenesis and cytokine production by malignant cells could be blocked by disruption of RANK-RANKL interaction with denosumab. As we aimed to combine neutralization of RANKL with induction of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) cells against RANKL-expressing malignant cells and as denosumab does not stimulate NK reactivity, we generated RANK-Fc fusion proteins with modified Fc moieties. The latter displayed similar capacity compared with denosumab to neutralize the effects of RANKL on osteoclastogenesis in vitro, but also potently stimulated NK cell reactivity against primary RANKL-expressing malignant B cells, which was dependent on their engineered affinity to CD16.

The study aims to describe the health status of populations living in Tuscany municipalities where concessions for exploitation of geothermal resources were granted. DESIGN: This is an ecological study, so it is not useful to produce evidence to sustain a judgment on the cause-effect link. The major limits of this type of study are the use of the residence at municipal level as a proxy of exposure to both environmental and socioeconomic factors and the use of aggregated data of health outcomes that can lead to the well-known ecological fallacy. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen municipalities were included in the study area: eight are part of the so-called ""traditional"" geothermal area, defined as Northern Geothermal Area (NGA) and eight located in the Amiata Mountain defined as Southern Geothermal Area (SGA). In 2000-2006, the average resident population in the overall area was approximately 43,000 inhabitants. Thirty-one geothermal power plants were active, with a production capacity of 811 MW, 5 of them with 88 MW located in the SGA. Statistical analyses on the entire geothermal area, NGA and SGA subareas, and the sixteen municipalities were performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality data were obtained from Tuscany Regional Mortality Registry for the 1971-2006 period, analysing 60 causes of death, of interest for population health status or consistent with ""Project SENTIERI"" criteria. Hospital discharge records of residents in Tuscany Region in 2004-2006, anywhere admitted to hospital, were analyzed considering only the main diagnosis, excluding repeated admissions for the same cause. The causes taken into account are the same analysed for mortality were considered. Age-standardized mortality rates (TSDM) and the temporal trends of TSDM for four periods (1971-1979, 1980-1989, 1990-1999, 2000-2006) were computed. Age-standardized mortality/hospitalization ratios (SMR/SHR), with and without adjustment for the deprivation index based on 2001 census data, were calculated: mortality in the years 2000-2006 and hospitalization in 2004-2006. The expected number of events were computed using rates of residents in neighbouring municipalities (municipalities included in 50 km radius circle centred on the study area). Bayesian estimates of mortality/hospitalization ratios (BMR/BHR) at municipal level only and relating maps of the Bayesian risk estimators were elaborated. Congenital malformations (MC) were analysed using data from Tuscan Registry of Birth Defect in 1992-2006 period, relative to outcomes of pregnancies in women resident in the municipalities of study area, wherever the birth or termination of pregnancy occurred. The ratio between observed and expected cases (O/A), with expected defined according to regional rate, were calculated and O/A Bayesian estimates (BMR) are showed only at municipal level. The low weight and the males/females ratio at birth were analysed using data from Tuscany Birth Certificates, covering period 2001-2007, excluding births occurred in facilities outside Tuscany Region. For Low birth weight (< 2,500 grams), very low birth weight (< 1,500 grams), low birth weight in women with normal gestational age or greater than 36 weeks, gestational age less than 36 weeks, and the frequency of males, the observed/expected ratio was calculated, with the expected number defined according to regional rate. RESULTS: ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND: High levels of arsenic in drinking water distribution emerges as a critical element, so that several municipalities resorted to granting exemptions for the parameters laid down by the Legislative Decree in force (D.Lgs 31/01). However, during the final phase of the study, new blast systems activated in the SGA decreased the arsenic levels in the water supply, reaching values not requiring derogations, which, instead, are still effective in some NGA municipalities. Air quality data, from Tuscany Regional Agency for Environmental Protection-ARPAT, show that geothermal activities are able to affect air quality, especially with hydrogen sulphide in NGA, and hydrogen sulphide and mercury in SGA. A significant contribution to the presence of mercury in air is due to previous metallurgical sites. Although mercury levels are below WHO guideline values, in SGA nearby Siena, values were significantly higher than in other geothermal areas, because of power plant PC2 (turned off in July 2011) in Piancastagnaio municipality. The hydrogen sulphide concentration levels were generally lower than WHO reference values, with occasional excesses over guideline value for health protection (150 microg/m3 as average of the 24 hours). Olfactory pollution was more critic with values exceeding 7-10 microg/m3 range even in areas without geothermal plants. RESULTS: POPULATION'S HEALTH STATUS: This study evaluated health status of resident population in geothermal areas analysing geographic and temporal distribution of mortality, hospitalization and reproductive health outcomes (congenital malformations, low birth weight, sex ratio among newborns). In both geothermal areas mortality rates steadily declined from 1971 to 2006, in males and females, in line with the regional trends. In 2000-2006 period, in the overall geothermal area a significant mortality excess was observed for all causes among males (2,312 deaths, 2,146 expected), but not among females, using as reference residents in neighbouring municipalities. The mortality excess among males was more evident for infectious diseases (25 deaths, 10 expected), especially tuberculosis (8 deaths, 2 expected), for respiratory diseases (218 deaths, 170 expected), in particular pneumoconiosis, including deaths from silicosis (51 deaths, 14 expected), and for nervous system diseases (72 deaths, 56 expected). Among females significant mortality excess for liver cirrhosis (35 deaths, 25 expected) emerged, while mortality from cardiovascular diseases and ischemic heart diseases were significantly lower than expected. In the NGA, mortality among men was lower than expected for all cancers (-15%), in particular for lung cancer (- 25%), while values significantly in excesses were observed for infectious diseases (11 observed, 4 expected) and respiratory diseases (90 observed, 73 expected), expecially pneumoconiosis (20 observed, 6 expected). Among females, significant mortality excesses for ovarian cancer (17 observed, 10 expected) and for circulatory disorders of brain (170 observed, 140 expected) resulted. In the SGA, mortality was more critical, accounting for majority of the excesses detected in overall Geothermal Area. In fact, only infectious diseases and pneumoconiosis were detected in excess in both the geothermal areas. In the SGA, excess of general mortality among males (1,431 deaths; 1,245 expected) but not among females emerged. Even for all cancers, an excess among males (505 deaths, 419 expected) was observed, in particular for cancer of stomach (53 deaths, 44 expected, not statistically significant after adjusting for DI), liver (39 deaths, 23 expected) and lung (124 deaths, 102 expected) cancer. Mortality in SGA was also in excess for respiratory diseases only among men (128 deaths, 97 expected), mostly due to silicosis (31 deaths, 8 expected), although steadily decreasing since 1971 as observed at regional level. Also tuberculosis resulted in excess in SGA (7 deaths, 1 expected). Among females acute respiratory disease mortality was significantly in excess (41 observed, 29 expected). Temporal trend showed a decline from the 70s to the 90s, with a rising trend in recent years in line with Tuscany region. It should be considered that pneumonia was the commonest cause of death of acute respiratory diseases, which allow for lower reliability of death certificate, especially among the elderly (> 64 years). Among females resident in SGA a mortality excess from digestive system diseases was observed (72 observed, 55 expected). The hospitalization in the overall Geothermal Area did not show any excess for all causes and all tumours in both genders. Statistically significant excesses for hospital admission from stomach cancer among males (49 observed, 38 expected) and females (42 observed, 28 expected), and from lymphohematopoietic tumours among females, particularly from lymphatic leukaemia (15 observed, 5 expected), were observed. As mortality analysis highlighted, also hospital admissions by geothermal areas and gender showed a worst picture in SGA than in NGA. In the latter, a significant excess of hospital admissions from all causes among females (1,357 observed, 1,284 expected) but not among males (1,193 observed, 1,141 expected) and an excess - close to statistical significance - from all tumours only among females (297 observed; 272 expected) were observed. Furthermore, statistically significant excesses of hospital admissions from digestive system diseases in both genders (M: 392 observed, 350 expected; F: 300 observed, 268 expected), from dementias (16 observed, 8 expected) and from lympho hematopoietic cancers among females, particularly from lymphatic leukaemia (9 observed, 2 expected), were observed. In the SGA, statistically significant excesses of hospital admissions for stomach cancer (M: 32 observed, 21 expected, not significant after adjusting by DI; F: 29 observed, 18 expected), for respiratory diseases (M: 408 observed, 351 expected; F: 339 observed, 277 expected) and for renal failure (M: 61 observed, 41 expected; F: 52 observed, 34 expected) were observed in both genders.

Brain, thyroid, breast and lung cancer and leukaemia have been associated with exposure to ionizing radiations, but the health effects of nuclear plants on the resident populations are controversial. OBJECTIVE: to evaluate whether living close to NPPs is associated with an increased risk of cancer incidence and mortality. METHODS: we defined a cohort of residents within 7 km from the NPPs during the period 1996-2002. Individual follow-up for vital status at 01.01.2007 was conducted using municipality data. Gender specific Standardized Incidence and Mortality Ratios, adjusted for age, were calculated (SIR and SMR) using the regional population as reference. Each participant's address was assigned to a distance from the NPP on the basis of a GIS. A relative risk (RR, CI95%), adjusted for age and socioeconomic status, was calculated in 3 bands of increasing radius from the plants: 0-2, 2-4, and 4-7 km (reference group), using a Poisson regression model. RESULTS: the cohort was of 39,775 people, 32%of whom lived near (0-4 km) the NPP. No differences in mortality was found when comparing the cohort with the regional population; among women living within 7 km from the NPP, we found thyroid cancer incidence higher than expected (SIR 1.53 CI95% 1.18-1.95). However, when the analysis was conducted on the basis of the distance from the NPP, we found a statistically significant increase in male mortality only for causes unrelated to radiation exposure (all causes, stomach cancer, and cardiovascular diseases). No mortality excess was observed among women living close to the NPPs. No statistically significant distance-related gradient was observed for cancer incidence both in men and women. CONCLUSIONS: living close to the NPP was not associated with mortality for causes related to radiation exposure. However, the results suggest to continue the epidemiological surveillance of the population.","['Mataloni, Francesca', 'Ancona, Carla', 'Badaloni, Chiara', 'Bucci, Simone', 'Busco, Susanna', 'Cupellaro, Elisabetta', 'Pannozzo, Fabio', 'Davoli, Marina', 'Forastiere, Francesco']","['Mataloni F', 'Ancona C', 'Badaloni C', 'Bucci S', 'Busco S', 'Cupellaro E', 'Pannozzo F', 'Davoli M', 'Forastiere F']","['Dipartimento di epidemiologia del Servizio sanitario regionale, Lazio. f.mataloni@deplazio.it']",['ita'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Italy,Epidemiol Prev,Epidemiologia e prevenzione,8902507,,2012/11/10 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2012/11/10 06:00'],"['2012/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['1492 [pii]'],ppublish,Epidemiol Prev. 2012 Sep;36(5):253-62.,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/mortality', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Italy', 'Male', 'Medical Record Linkage', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/mortality', '*Nuclear Power Plants', 'Radiometry', 'Risk', 'Sex Distribution', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,Incidenza di tumori e mortalita nella coorte dei residenti in prossimita delle centrali nucleari italiane di Borgo Sabotino e del Garigliano.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CNS involvement usually occurs in patients with advanced or relapsing systemic disease. Because primary CNS Hodgkin's lymphoma may present unexpected and sometimes misleading clinical and neuroradiological features, the description of unusual cases is important for expanding the awareness of this rare disease of the central nervous system.

METHODS: MTX (12 mg/m(2)) combined with methylprednisolone 1 g as three monthly courses followed by three quarterly courses was administered during an observational multicentre open study including 51 consecutive patients (28 NMO, 23 limited forms of NMO) of the French Caribbean and Guyana. The main outcome measure was the reduction of the annualised relapse rate (ARR), and the secondary outcome measures were alteration of disability measured by expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score, the time to onset of the first relapse, and the progression of neuroradiological lesions at 1 year of treatment. RESULTS: At 1 year of treatment, the ARR dropped from 1.82 to 0.37 (p<0.0001). The mean EDSS score improved by 1.3 points, going from 5.8 at baseline to 4.5 at 1 year (p<0.0001). The number of patients showing gadolinium (Gad)+ spinal cord lesions at baseline, that is, 46.9%, dropped to 10.6% (a 77.4% reduction; p=0.02). The median time to onset of the first relapse was 18 months. IgG-NMO seropositivity was a predictive factor of relapse (p=0.006). A case of acute myeloid leukaemia was observed after a mean time span of 4.8 years. CONCLUSIONS: In this observational NMO study, MTX decreased dramatically the frequency of relapses, which is directly related to progression of disability or even death in this disorder.","['Cabre, Philippe', 'Olindo, Stephane', 'Marignier, Romain', 'Jeannin, Severine', 'Merle, Harold', 'Smadja, Didier']","['Cabre P', 'Olindo S', 'Marignier R', 'Jeannin S', 'Merle H', 'Smadja D']","['Department of Neurology, CHRU Pierre Zobda-Quitman, Fort de France, Martinique 97261, French West Indies. pcabre_fr@yahoo.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121108,England,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,"Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",2985191R,,2012/11/10 06:00,2013/06/01 06:00,['2012/11/10 06:00'],"['2012/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/01 06:00 [medline]']","['jnnp-2012-303121 [pii]', '10.1136/jnnp-2012-303121 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry. 2013 May;84(5):511-6. doi: 10.1136/jnnp-2012-303121.

Here, we demonstrate that MLL-AF10 and CALM-AF10-mediated transformation is dependent on the H3K79 methyltransferase Dot1l using genetic and pharmacological approaches in mouse models. Targeted disruption of Dot1l using a conditional knockout mouse model abolished in vitro transformation of murine bone marrow cells and in vivo initiation and maintenance of MLL-AF10 or CALM-AF10 leukemia. The treatment of MLL-AF10 and CALM-AF10 transformed cells with EPZ004777, a specific small-molecule inhibitor of Dot1l, suppressed expression of leukemogenic genes such as Hoxa cluster genes and Meis1, and selectively impaired proliferation of MLL-AF10 and CALM-AF10 transformed cells. Pretreatment with EPZ004777 profoundly decreased the in vivo spleen-colony-forming ability of MLL-AF10 or CALM-AF10 transformed bone marrow cells.

Here, we investigate the role of Fas apoptosis inhibitory molecule (FAIM) in MM. We demonstrate that insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) treatment upregulated FAIM expression in MM cells in a dose-dependent manner. Silencing of FAIM expression attenuates Akt signaling downstream of IGF-1 and compromises the viability of MM cells. We further showed that IGF-1 stimulation of MM cells leads to enhanced expression of IRF4, a known 'addictive' factor for MM. This upregulation of IRF4 expression by IGF-1 treatment of MM cells is abrogated when FAIM expression is silenced or Akt activation is inhibited. Thus, FAIM modulates IGF-1-induced Akt activation and IRF4 expression and has a role in MM cell survival. Consistent with these findings, FAIM expression is shown to be higher in plasma cells of symptomatic MM patients compared with normal individuals or patients with premalignant conditions. Moreover, a higher level of FAIM expression is shown to correlate with poorer survival outcomes of newly diagnosed MM patients treated with stem cell transplantation or relapsed MM patients treated in clinical trials with Bortezomib. Thus taken together, our study reveals a novel, as well as clinically relevant role for FAIM in MM.","['Huo, J', 'Xu, S', 'Lin, B', 'Chng, W-J', 'Lam, K-P']","['Huo J', 'Xu S', 'Lin B', 'Chng WJ', 'Lam KP']","['Immunology Group, Bioprocessing Technology Institute, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Republic of Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121109,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2012/11/10 06:00,2013/07/20 06:00,['2012/11/10 06:00'],"['2012/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012326 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.326 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Apr;27(5):1165-71. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.326.

METHODS: This study included 106 children between the ages of 1 and 17 years with newly diagnosed ALL monitored between 1999 and 2010. All the patients were treated with the modified St Jude Total 13A treatment plan at the Pediatric Hematology Clinic at Harran University. RESULTS: Sixty-eight (64.2%) patients were boys and 38 (35.8%) were girls. The median age at diagnosis was 5.9 +/- 3.7 years. Thirty-eight (35.8%) children were classified as standard risk, 53 (39.3%) were intermediate risk, and 15 (14.2%) were high risk. Thirteen (12.3%) children died in induction before the remission date (43 d of remission induction). Of all the 93 (100%) patients who completed remission induction therapy and whose bone marrow were in remission, 5 (4.7%) had a bone marrow relapse, 1 (0.9%) had a retinal relapse, and 5 (4.7%) had secondary acute myeloid leukemia. At a median follow-up of 44 months (range, 0.36 to 135.5 mo), the estimated 5-year overall survival and event-free survival were 77.4 +/- 5% and 68.9 +/- 6.5%, respectively. The estimated 5-year overall survival for boys and girls was 76.5 +/- 6% and 65.8 +/- 8%, respectively (P = 0.182). CONCLUSIONS: St Jude Total 13A treatment protocols to treat childhood ALL can be successfully adapted, which suggests that such an approach may be useful in low socioeconomic regions; however, it should be noted that secondary leukemia can occur at a high rate.","['Koc, Ahmet', 'Aycicek, Ali', 'Ozdemir, Zeynep C', 'Soker, Murat', 'Varma, Mustafa']","['Koc A', 'Aycicek A', 'Ozdemir ZC', 'Soker M', 'Varma M']","['Pediatric Hematology Department, Medical Faculty, Harran University, Sanliurfa, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,2012/11/10 06:00,2013/02/22 06:00,['2012/11/10 06:00'],"['2012/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0b013e318271f43f [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2013 Jan;35(1):36-41. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e318271f43f.,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Turkey']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identification of patients with poor outcome in the categories of lower risk disease is critical. In this study, we classify a cohort of 332 lower risk MDS into 3 groups with differences in survival and risk for leukemic progression that could drive treatment approaches to improve prognosis in a fraction of these patients. BACKGROUND: Prognosis of MDS and particularly in patients categorized as lower risk (< 10% blasts or low and intermediate-1 International Prognostic Scoring System [IPSS]) is very heterogeneous and includes patients with very different outcomes with current scoring systems. Recently, a new cytogenetic classification has been proposed for the revised IPSS in predicting the outcome for MDS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To evaluate the prognostic significance of multiple variables for survival and risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia, we analyzed baseline characteristics of 332 lower risk MDS patients within the lower risk cytogenetic categories by IPSS and the recent proposal for the new cytogenetic classification. RESULTS: In multivariate analysis, severity of cytopenias, age > 60 years, bone marrow blasts (5%-9%) and transfusion dependency significantly influenced outcome. The combination of these variables allowed development of a model which categorizes patients in 3 different groups with median survival of 95, 44, and 13 months for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively (P < .001). In addition, this score also stratified patients for their risk for leukemic progression, estimated at 2 years in 3.1%, 7.6%, and 21.3% for each group (P = .024). CONCLUSION: Although karyotype remains the main prognostic factor in MDS, the current study identifies clinical parameters predicting outcome among patients with the better cytogenetic profile. Degree of cytopenias, blasts 5%-9% and transfusion dependence might identify a subset of patients within the nonadverse karyotype, in which early or more aggressive approaches could possibly be required to improve survival or prevent disease progression.","['Falantes, Jose F', 'Calderon, Cristina', 'Marquez Malaver, Francisco J', 'Alonso, Dora', 'Martin Noya, Antonio', 'Carrillo, Estrella', 'Martino, Maria L', 'Montero, Isabel', 'Gonzalez, Jose', 'Parody, Rocio', 'Espigado, Ildefonso', 'Perez-Simon, Jose A']","['Falantes JF', 'Calderon C', 'Marquez Malaver FJ', 'Alonso D', 'Martin Noya A', 'Carrillo E', 'Martino ML', 'Montero I', 'Gonzalez J', 'Parody R', 'Espigado I', 'Perez-Simon JA']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital Virgen del Rocio, Instituto de Biomedicina de Sevilla, IBIS/CSIC/Universidad de Sevilla, Sevilla, Spain. josef.falantes.sspa@juntadeandalucia.es']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121106,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,,2012/11/10 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2012/11/10 06:00'],"['2012/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(12)00178-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2012.09.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2013 Apr;13(2):144-52. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2012.09.013.

Consequently, forcing the reengagement of terminal differentiation of transformed cells coupled or not with an inhibition of their proliferation is a putative therapeutic approach to counteracting tumorigenicity. UT7 is a human leukemic cell line able to grow in the presence of IL3, GM-CSF and Epo. This cell line has been widely used to study Epo-R/Epo signaling pathways but is a poor model for erythroid differentiation. We used the BET bromodomain inhibition drug JQ1 to target gene expression, including that of c-Myc. We have shown that only 2 days of JQ1 treatment was required to transitory inhibit Epo-induced UT7 proliferation and to restore terminal erythroid differentiation.

G. Don (Apocynaceae) is a medicinal plant that produces more than 130 alkaloids, with special attention given to the production of the anti-hypertensive monomeric indole alkaloids, serpentine and ajmalicine, and the antitumor dimeric alkaloids, vinblastine and vincristine. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the cytotoxic activity of the indole alkaloid-enriched bioactive extract obtained from suspension cultured-cells of C. roseus elicited with methyl jasmonate (MJ) and cyclodextrins (CDs) in three cell lines: JURKAT E.6 human lymphocytic leukemia, THP-1 human monocytic leukemia and BL 1395 non-tumor human B-cell line. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An indole alkaloid-enriched bioactive extract was obtained from C. roseus cell cultures elicited with MJ and CDs. The indole alkaloids were identified using an HPLC-diode array system coupled to a time-of-flight mass spectrometer using electrospray ionization (ESI) source. The cytotoxic assays were made using the colorimetric assay 2, 3-bis (2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-S-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2 tetrazolium hydroxide (XTT). RESULTS: Four indole alkaloids were identified (catharanthine, ajmalicine, tabersonine and lochnericine) but only catharanthine and ajmalicine were quantified. The concentration of the indole alkaloid-enriched bioactive extract that inhibited cell growth by 50% was 211 and 210 ng/mL for the JURKAT E.6 and THP-1 cell lines, respectively. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The results confirm that the powerful antitumor activity of this indole alkaloid-enriched bioactive extract is not due to the effect of a single compound but depends on the synergistic action of the four compounds identified.","['Fernandez-Perez, Francisco', 'Almagro, Lorena', 'Pedreno, Maria A', 'Gomez Ros, Laura V']","['Fernandez-Perez F', 'Almagro L', 'Pedreno MA', 'Gomez Ros LV']","['Department of Plant Biology, Faculty of Biology, University of Murcia, Campus Universitario de Espinardo, 30100 Murcia, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121108,England,Pharm Biol,Pharmaceutical biology,9812552,,2012/11/10 06:00,2013/08/10 06:00,['2012/11/10 06:00'],"['2012/11/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/13880209.2012.722646 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharm Biol. 2013 Mar;51(3):304-10. doi: 10.3109/13880209.2012.722646.

Chemically synthesized natural acetogenins, such as mucocin (compound 1), jimenezin (compound 2), muconin (compound 4), pyranicin (compound 5) and pyragonicin (compound 6) were investigated. Concomitantly, 19-epi jimenezin (compound 3), 10-epi pyragonicin (compound 7) and a gamma-lactone (compound 8), which is estimated to be a biosynthetic precursor of acetogenins, were synthesized and investigated. Compounds 5 and 6 strongly inhibited, and compound 7 moderately inhibited the activities of mammalian DNA polymerases (pols), such as replicative pol alpha and repair/recombination-related pol beta and lambda, and also inhibited human DNA topoisomerase (topos) I and II activities. On the other hand, compounds 1-4 and 8 did not influence the activities of any pols and topos. Compound 5 was the strongest inhibitor of the pols and topos tested, and the IC(50) values were 5.0-9.6 muM, respectively. These compounds also suppressed human cancer cell growth with almost the same tendency as the inhibition of pols and topos. Compound 5 was the strongest suppressor of the proliferation of the promyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL-60, in human cancer cell lines tested with an LD(50) value of 9.4 muM, and arrested the cells at G1 phases, indicating that it blocks DNA replication by inhibiting the activity of pols rather than topos. This compound also induced cell apoptosis. The relationship between the three-dimensional molecular structure of acetogenins and these inhibitory activities is discussed. The results suggested that compound 5 is a lead compound of potentially useful cancer chemotherapy agents.","['Matsui, Yuki', 'Takeuchi, Toshifumi', 'Kumamoto-Yonezawa, Yuko', 'Takemura, Masaharu', 'Sugawara, Fumio', 'Yoshida, Hiromi', 'Mizushina, Yoshiyuki']","['Matsui Y', 'Takeuchi T', 'Kumamoto-Yonezawa Y', 'Takemura M', 'Sugawara F', 'Yoshida H', 'Mizushina Y']","['Laboratory of Food and Nutritional Sciences, Department of Nutritional Science, and.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20100101,Greece,Exp Ther Med,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,101531947,PMC3490394,2010/01/01 00:00,2010/01/01 00:01,['2012/11/09 06:00'],"['2009/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2009/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/etm_00000004 [doi]', 'etm-01-01-0019 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Ther Med. 2010 Jan;1(1):19-26. doi: 10.3892/etm_00000004.

Improved understanding of CLL/SLL biology would identify better prognostic/predictive markers. This study attempts to address these issues by determining the relationship between cytokine aberrations and poor clinical outcomes in CLL/SLL in the context of a genetic-based prognostic model. Fifty-nine serum cytokines/chemokines were measured in 28 untreated CLL/SLL patients. Patients were stratified as GR or int/PR using cytogenetics. Comparison of CLL/SLL with 28 HCs revealed increased expression of Th2 cytokines (IL-10, IL-5, sIL-2Ralpha; P</=0.01) and decreased levels of Th1 cytokines (IL-17, IL-23, IFN-gamma; P</=0.003). In a multivariate analysis of GR versus int/PR groups, differential expression of sIL-2Ralpha maintained significance with increased expression in int/PR CLL/SLL. With median follow-up of 54.3 months after diagnosis, four patients incurred disease progression, with an IL-17/sIL-2Ralpha model predicting need for treatment in all cases. In summary, specific cytokine signatures are associated with genetically defined aggressive disease and predict need for therapy. This suggests utility in detecting disease progression early, identifying those likely to incur a survival advantage with early treatment, and directing future therapy.","['Karmali, Reem', 'Paganessi, Laura A', 'Frank, Robin R', 'Jagan, Sucheta', 'Larson, Melissa L', 'Venugopal, Parameswaran', 'Gregory, Stephanie A', 'Christopherson, Kent W 2nd']","['Karmali R', 'Paganessi LA', 'Frank RR', 'Jagan S', 'Larson ML', 'Venugopal P', 'Gregory SA', 'Christopherson KW 2nd']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology/Cell Therapy, Rush University Medical Center, 1725 W.

We showed that apoptosis level after bortezomib treatment is higher in NB4 cells than in differentiated NB4 cells. To compare early protein variations upon bortezomib treatment in both NB4 cell populations, we performed a quantitative proteomic analysis based on iTRAQ peptide labeling followed by data analysis with in-house developed scripts. This strategy revealed the regulation of 14 proteins principally involved in protein stress response and apoptosis in NB4 cells after proteasome inhibition. Altogether, our results suggest that the differential level of apoptosis induced by bortezomib treatment in both NB4 cell populations could result from distinct protein toxicity level.","['Uttenweiler-Joseph, Sandrine', 'Bouyssie, David', 'Calligaris, David', 'Lutz, Pierre G', 'Monsarrat, Bernard', 'Burlet-Schiltz, Odile']","['Uttenweiler-Joseph S', 'Bouyssie D', 'Calligaris D', 'Lutz PG', 'Monsarrat B', 'Burlet-Schiltz O']","['CNRS, Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale, Toulouse, France.

In this Perspective article, we propose that the expression of mitochondrial enzymes in the metabolism of serine and glycine, in addition to those involved in folate metabolism, are determinants of the response to methotrexate. Furthermore, we show that myc activation in tumors is associated with upregulation of these enzymes.

Although encoding a Tax transactivator (Tax2) that activates the canonical NF-kappaB pathway, HTLV-2 does not cause leukemia. These distinct pathological outcomes might be related, at least in part, to distinct NF-kappaB activation mechanisms. Tax1 has been shown to be both ubiquitinated and SUMOylated, and these two modifications were originally proposed to be required for Tax1-mediated NF-kappaB activation. Tax1 ubiquitination allows recruitment of the IKK-gamma/NEMO regulatory subunit of the IKK complex together with Tax1 into centrosome/Golgi-associated cytoplasmic structures, followed by activation of the IKK complex and RelA/p65 nuclear translocation. Herein, we compared the ubiquitination, SUMOylation, and acetylation patterns of Tax2 and Tax1. We show that, in contrast to Tax1, Tax2 conjugation to endogenous ubiquitin and SUMO is barely detectable while both proteins are acetylated. Importantly, Tax2 is neither polyubiquitinated on lysine residues nor ubiquitinated on its N-terminal residue. Consistent with these observations, Tax2 conjugation to ubiquitin and Tax2-mediated NF-kappaB activation is not affected by overexpression of the E2 conjugating enzyme Ubc13. We further demonstrate that a nonubiquitinable, non-SUMOylable, and nonacetylable Tax2 mutant retains a significant ability to activate transcription from a NF-kappaB-dependent promoter after partial activation of the IKK complex and induction of RelA/p65 nuclear translocation.

Despite being unrelated at the sequence level, ICP0 and human cytomegalovirus proteins IE1 and pp71 share some functional similarities in their abilities to counteract antiviral restriction mediated by components of cellular nuclear structures known as ND10. To investigate the extent to which IE1 and pp71 might substitute for ICP0, cell lines were developed that express either IE1 or pp71, or both together, in an inducible manner. We found that pp71 dissociated the hDaxx-ATRX complex and inhibited accumulation of these proteins at sites juxtaposed to HSV-1 genomes but had no effect on the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) or Sp100. IE1 caused loss of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-conjugated forms of PML and Sp100 and inhibited the recruitment of these proteins to HSV-1 genome foci but had little effect on hDaxx or ATRX in these assays. Both IE1 and pp71 stimulated ICP0-null mutant plaque formation, but neither to the extent achieved by ICP0. The combination of IE1 and pp71, however, inhibited recruitment of all ND10 proteins to viral genome foci, stimulated ICP0-null mutant HSV-1 plaque formation to near wild-type levels, and efficiently induced derepression of quiescent HSV-1 genomes. These results suggest that ND10-related intrinsic resistance results from the additive effects of several ND10 components and that the effects of IE1 and pp71 on subsets of these components combine to mirror the overall activities of ICP0.","['Everett, Roger D', 'Bell, Adam J', 'Lu, Yongxu', 'Orr, Anne']","['Everett RD', 'Bell AJ', 'Lu Y', 'Orr A']","['MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research 8, Glasgow, Scotland. roger.everett@glasgow.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121107,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,PMC3554063,2012/11/09 06:00,2013/02/26 06:00,['2012/11/09 06:00'],"['2012/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.01103-12 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01103-12 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2013 Jan;87(2):978-90. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01103-12.

These domains are also known for their potential to mediate an intracellular defense mechanism against many virus types. This is likely why they are targeted and subsequently manipulated by numerous viral proteins. Paradoxically, the genomes of various DNA viruses become associated with PML NBs, and initial sites of viral transcription/replication centers are often juxtaposed to these domains. The question is why viruses start their transcription and replication next to their supposed antagonists. Here, we report that PML NBs are targeted by the adenoviral (Ad) transactivator protein E1A-13S. Alternatively spliced E1A isoforms (E1A-12S and E1A-13S) are the first proteins expressed upon Ad infection. E1A-13S is essential for activating viral transcription in the early phase of infection. Coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that E1A-13S preferentially interacts with only one (PML-II) of at least six nuclear human PML isoforms. Deletion mapping located the interaction site within E1A conserved region 3 (CR3), which was previously described as the transcription factor binding region of E1A-13S. Indeed, cooperation with PML-II enhanced E1A-mediated transcriptional activation, while deleting the SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) of PML proved even more effective. Our results suggest that in contrast to PML NB-associated antiviral defense, PML-II may help transactivate viral gene expression and therefore play a novel role in activating Ad transcription during the early viral life cycle.","['Berscheminski, Julia', 'Groitl, Peter', 'Dobner, Thomas', 'Wimmer, Peter', 'Schreiner, Sabrina']","['Berscheminski J', 'Groitl P', 'Dobner T', 'Wimmer P', 'Schreiner S']","['Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121107,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,PMC3554061,2012/11/09 06:00,2013/02/26 06:00,['2012/11/09 06:00'],"['2012/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.02023-12 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02023-12 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2013 Jan;87(2):965-77. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02023-12.

Concurrently, PBOX-15 differentially down-regulates beta1-, beta2- and alpha4-integrin expression in ALL cells and significantly decreases integrin-mediated cell attachment. PBOX-15 interferes with the lateral mobility and clustering of integrins in both B-ALL and T-ALL cells.

However, the expression and molecular mechanism of MLAA-34 in U937 cells remain largely unclear. Here, we utilized three strategies to gain insight into the expression and molecular functions of MLAA-34 and to identify its interacting proteins and pathways involved in the fine-tuning of the MLAA-34 response. Western blot analysis was performed to assess the expression of MLAA-34 in 41 cell lines and five mixed cell types, which revealed that MLAA-34 is most strongly expressed in U937 cells. Immunostaining indicated that MLAA-34 is localized in the cytoplasm and cell membrane. Furthermore, lentivirus-mediated overexpression of MLAA-34 in the U937 cell line led to significant suppression of apoptosis and increased the potential of tumorigenicity. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), shotgun and bioinformatic analysis identified 256 proteins and 225 of them were annotated by gene ontology categories. This analysis revealed 71 proteins involved in cell apoptosis or proliferation of biological processes and signaling pathways. Moreover, the effect of MLAA-34 apoptosis may be through interaction with the Ras, Wnt, calcium and chemokine signaling pathways and thirteen of the annotated proteins may interact with MLAA-34 and participate in carcinogenesis directly. This study provides a basis for a better understanding of the molecular mechanism and proteomics in the inhibition of apoptosis by MLAA-34 in U937 cells and indicates that MLAA-34 may be a potential candidate for the early diagnosis and therapeutic application of M5.","['Zhang, Wen-Juan', 'Zhang, Wang-Gang', 'Zhang, Peng-Yu', 'Cao, Xing-Mei', 'He, Ai-Li', 'Chen, Yin-Xia', 'Gu, Liu-Fang']","['Zhang WJ', 'Zhang WG', 'Zhang PY', 'Cao XM', 'He AL', 'Chen YX', 'Gu LF']","[""Department of Clinical Hematology, Affiliated No. 2 Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University College of Medicine, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710004, PR China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121107,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,,2012/11/09 06:00,2013/06/14 06:00,['2012/11/09 06:00'],"['2012/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2012.2129 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2013 Feb;29(2):491-506. doi: 10.3892/or.2012.2129.

Recently, more light has been shed on the epigenetic mechanisms regulating expression of genes involved in IGF signaling (IFS) and it has become evident that these mechanisms are crucial for initiation of embryogenesis, maintaining the quiescence of pluripotent stem cells deposited in adult tissues (for example, very-small embryonic-like stem cells), the aging process, and the malignant transformation of cells. The expression of several genes involved in IFS is regulated at the epigenetic level by imprinting/methylation within differentially methylated regions (DMRs), which regulate their expression from paternal or maternal chromosomes. The most important role in the regulation of IFS gene expression is played by the Igf-2-H19 locus, which encodes the autocrine/paracrine mitogen IGF-2 and the H19 gene, which gives rise to a non-coding RNA precursor of several microRNAs that negatively affect cell proliferation. Among these, miR-675 has recently been demonstrated to downregulate expression of the IGF-1 receptor. The proper imprinting of DMRs at the Igf-2-H19 locus, with methylation of the paternal chromosome and a lack of methylation on the maternal chromosome, regulates expression of these genes so that Igf-2 is transcribed only from the paternal chromosome and H19 (including miR-675) only from the maternal chromosome. In this review, we will discuss the relevance of (i) proper somatic imprinting, (ii) erasure of imprinting and (iii) loss of imprinting within the DMRs at the Igf-2-H19 locus to the expression of genes involved in IFS, and the consequences of these alternative patterns of imprinting for stem cell biology.","['Ratajczak, M Z', 'Shin, D-M', 'Schneider, G', 'Ratajczak, J', 'Kucia, M']","['Ratajczak MZ', 'Shin DM', 'Schneider G', 'Ratajczak J', 'Kucia M']","['Stem Cell Biology Program at the James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20121108,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC5538807,2012/11/09 06:00,2013/06/05 06:00,['2012/11/09 06:00'],"['2012/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012322 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.322 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Apr;27(4):773-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.322.

The disappeared mutations at relapse were 3 of 11 internal tandem duplications of FLT3 (FLT3-ITD) (27.3%), 3 of 3 FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain (FLT3-TKD) (100%), 3 of 13 Nucleophosmin 1 (23.1%) and 2 of 5 CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha (40%) mutations. However, epigenetics-modifying gene (DNMT3a, TET2 and IDH1/2) mutations had no change between diagnosis and relapse samples, and may become minimal residual disease marker. The frequency of FLT3-ITD at relapse in patients with DNMT3a mutation at diagnosis is significantly higher than those in patients without them (P=0.001). Moreover, the high frequency of FLT3-ITD at relapse is also seen in AML cases that initially present with any epigenetics-modifying gene mutations (P<0.001). Our results indicate that epigenetics-modifying gene mutations may cause genetic instability and induce FLT3-ITD, leading to resistance to therapy and relapse.","['Wakita, S', 'Yamaguchi, H', 'Omori, I', 'Terada, K', 'Ueda, T', 'Manabe, E', 'Kurosawa, S', 'Iida, S', 'Ibaraki, T', 'Sato, Y', 'Todoroki, T', 'Hirakawa, T', 'Ryotokuji, T', 'Arai, K', 'Kitano, T', 'Mitamura, Y', 'Kosaka, F', 'Dan, K', 'Inokuchi, K']","['Wakita S', 'Yamaguchi H', 'Omori I', 'Terada K', 'Ueda T', 'Manabe E', 'Kurosawa S', 'Iida S', 'Ibaraki T', 'Sato Y', 'Todoroki T', 'Hirakawa T', 'Ryotokuji T', 'Arai K', 'Kitano T', 'Mitamura Y', 'Kosaka F', 'Dan K', 'Inokuchi K']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121108,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2012/11/09 06:00,2013/07/20 06:00,['2012/11/09 06:00'],"['2012/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012317 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.317 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Apr;27(5):1044-52. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.317.

Patients with t(9;11) ), t(6;11) or other 11q23 balanced translocations (t(11;v)(q23;v)) presented at a younger age and with higher percentage of bone marrow blasts. Unbalanced 11q23 abnormalities were commonly associated with deletions of chromosomes 5q, 7q and/or complex karyotypes. In multivariate analysis, when compared with patients with non-11q23 AML and unfavorable-risk karyotype, there was a significant difference in overall survival (OS) for patients with t(9;11) (P=0.004), whereas there were no differences in OS for patients with t(6;11) (P=0.62), t(11;19) (P=0.20) and unbalanced 11q23 aberrations (P=0.85) or t(11;v)(q23;v) (P=0.59), indicating that t(9;11) has an independent intermediate prognostic significance, with all others being poor prognostic factors for OS; this was further confirmed by comparing them with patients with non-11q23 AML and intermediate-risk karyotype. Using intention-to treat analysis based on donor availability, we also noted that allogeneic stem cell transplant in first remission had a significant benefit toward improving OS (P<0.001) and relapse-free survival (P<0.001) in patients with AML and 11q23 abnormalities.","['Chen, Y', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Pierce, S', 'Faderl, S', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Qiao, W', 'Abruzzo, L', 'de Lima, M', 'Kebriaei, P', 'Jabbour, E', 'Daver, N', 'Kadia, T', 'Estrov, Z', 'Garcia-Manero, G', 'Cortes, J', 'Ravandi, F']","['Chen Y', 'Kantarjian H', 'Pierce S', 'Faderl S', ""O'Brien S"", 'Qiao W', 'Abruzzo L', 'de Lima M', 'Kebriaei P', 'Jabbour E', 'Daver N', 'Kadia T', 'Estrov Z', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Cortes J', 'Ravandi F']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121108,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC4181539,2012/11/09 06:00,2013/06/05 06:00,['2012/11/09 06:00'],"['2012/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012319 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.319 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Apr;27(4):836-42. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.319.

On the other hand under-nutrition is a common problem in our country. This prospective study was conducted to see the outcome of induction of remission in undernourished children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. This study was carried out in the department of Paediatric hematology and oncology of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) during the period from November 2002 to October 2004. A total of sixty (60) children who were diagnosed as acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in 1 to 15 years of age were included in this study. But the children with previous history of congenital disease and that of chemotherapy or steroid were excluded from this study. Patients were divided into two groups on the basis of Z score of weight for age. Thirty (30) children those with Z score- 2 or less were classified as undernourished and was labeled as Group A and another thirty (30) patient those Z score above-2 were classified as well nourished and was placed in Group B, After inclusion into the study, completion of induction of remission was monitored by physical examination and laboratory investigations. The result showed that mean age in Group A was 77.16 +/- 7.07 months and that in Group B was 74.13 +/- 5.09 months with male preponderance in both the groups. Mean body weight in Group A was 14.55 +/- 0.76 Kg and that in Group B was 21.40 +/- 1.05 kg (p<0.001). Children in Group A required 39.06 +/- 0.72 days to complete induction but in Group B it required 31.63 +/- 0.17 days (p<0.04). Hospital stay in Group A children was 52.10 +/- 1.08 days and in Group B 42.37 +/- 0.50 (p<0.002). The result suggested that under nutrition has an influence on the out come of induction of remission in undernourished children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. So appropriate measures are essential to improve nutritional status of children for successful management of ALL in children.","['Begum, M', 'Jahan, S', 'Tawfique, M', 'Mannan, M A']","['Begum M', 'Jahan S', 'Tawfique M', 'Mannan MA']","['Department of Paediatric Oncology, National Institute of Cancer Research and Hospital, Mohakhali, Dhaka-1212, Bangladesh.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Bangladesh,Mymensingh Med J,Mymensingh medical journal : MMJ,9601799,,2012/11/09 06:00,2013/04/03 06:00,['2012/11/09 06:00'],"['2012/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/03 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Mymensingh Med J. 2012 Oct;21(4):691-5.,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Length of Stay', 'Male', 'Malnutrition/*complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*therapy', 'Remission Induction']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notch signals are essential for the emergence of definitive hematopoiesis in mouse embryos and are critical regulators of lymphoid lineage fate determination. However, it remains unclear how Notch regulates the balance between HSC self-renewal and differentiation in the adult bone marrow (BM). Here we report a novel mechanism that prevents HSCs from undergoing premature lymphoid differentiation in BM. Using a series of in vivo mouse models and functional HSC assays, we show that leukemia/lymphoma related factor (LRF) is necessary for HSC maintenance by functioning as an erythroid-specific repressor of Delta-like 4 (Dll4) expression. Lrf deletion in erythroblasts promoted up-regulation of Dll4 in erythroblasts, sensitizing HSCs to T-cell instructive signals in the BM. Our study reveals novel cross-talk between HSCs and erythroblasts, and sheds a new light on the regulatory mechanisms regulating the balance between HSC self-renewal and differentiation.","['Lee, Sung-Uk', 'Maeda, Manami', 'Ishikawa, Yuichi', 'Li, Sierra Min', 'Wilson, Anne', 'Jubb, Adrian M', 'Sakurai, Nagisa', 'Weng, Lihong', 'Fiorini, Emma', 'Radtke, Freddy', 'Yan, Minhong', 'Macdonald, H Robson', 'Chen, Ching-Cheng', 'Maeda, Takahiro']","['Lee SU', 'Maeda M', 'Ishikawa Y', 'Li SM', 'Wilson A', 'Jubb AM', 'Sakurai N', 'Weng L', 'Fiorini E', 'Radtke F', 'Yan M', 'Macdonald HR', 'Chen CC', 'Maeda T']","['Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope, Duarte, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121107,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC3567339,2012/11/09 06:00,2013/04/06 06:00,['2012/11/09 06:00'],"['2012/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)42142-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-03-418103 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Feb 7;121(6):918-29. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-03-418103.

For next generation sequencing (NGS), these include data storage, computational costs, sequence processing and alignment, delineating appropriate statistical measures, and data visualization. Currently there is a lack of workflows for efficient analysis of large, MethylCap-seq datasets containing multiple sample groups. METHODS: The NGS application MethylCap-seq involves the in vitro capture of methylated DNA and subsequent analysis of enriched fragments by massively parallel sequencing. The workflow we describe performs MethylCap-seq experimental Quality Control (QC), sequence file processing and alignment, differential methylation analysis of multiple biological groups, hierarchical clustering, assessment of genome-wide methylation patterns, and preparation of files for data visualization. RESULTS: Here, we present a scalable, flexible workflow for MethylCap-seq QC, secondary data analysis, tertiary analysis of multiple experimental groups, and data visualization. We demonstrate the experimental QC procedure with results from a large ovarian cancer study dataset and propose parameters which can identify problematic experiments. Promoter methylation profiling and hierarchical clustering analyses are demonstrated for four groups of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. We propose a Global Methylation Indicator (GMI) function to assess genome-wide changes in methylation patterns between experimental groups. We also show how the workflow facilitates data visualization in a web browser with the application Anno-J. CONCLUSIONS: This workflow and its suite of features will assist biologists in conducting methylation profiling projects and facilitate meaningful biological interpretation.","['Rodriguez, Benjamin A T', 'Frankhouser, David', 'Murphy, Mark', 'Trimarchi, Michael', 'Tam, Hok-Hei', 'Curfman, John', 'Huang, Rita', 'Chan, Michael W Y', 'Lai, Hung-Cheng', 'Parikh, Deval', 'Ball, Bryan', 'Schwind, Sebastian', 'Blum, William', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Yan, Pearlly', 'Bundschuh, Ralf']","['Rodriguez BA', 'Frankhouser D', 'Murphy M', 'Trimarchi M', 'Tam HH', 'Curfman J', 'Huang R', 'Chan MW', 'Lai HC', 'Parikh D', 'Ball B', 'Schwind S', 'Blum W', 'Marcucci G', 'Yan P', 'Bundschuh R']","['The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121026,England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,PMC3481483,2012/11/21 06:00,2013/04/17 06:00,['2012/11/09 06:00'],"['2012/11/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/17 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2164-13-S6-S14 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-13-S6-S14 [doi]']",ppublish,BMC Genomics. 2012;13 Suppl 6:S14. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-13-S6-S14.

OBJECTIVE: This technology assessment reviews the available evidence for the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of dasatinib, nilotinib and standard-dose imatinib for the first-line treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML. DATA SOURCES: Databases [including MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE, Current Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, the US Food and Drug Administration website and the European Medicines Agency website] were searched from search end date of the last technology appraisal report on this topic in October 2002 to September 2011. REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review of clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness studies; a review of surrogate relationships with survival; a review and critique of manufacturer submissions; and a model-based economic analysis. RESULTS: Two clinical trials (dasatinib vs imatinib and nilotinib vs imatinib) were included in the effectiveness review. Survival was not significantly different for dasatinib or nilotinib compared with imatinib with the 24-month follow-up data available. The rates of complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and major molecular response (MMR) were higher for patients receiving dasatinib than for those with imatinib for 12 months' follow-up (CCyR 83% vs 72%, p < 0.001; MMR 46% vs 28%, p < 0.0001). The rates of CCyR and MMR were higher for patients receiving nilotinib than for those receiving imatinib for 12 months' follow-up (CCyR 80% vs 65%, p < 0.001; MMR 44% vs 22%, p < 0.0001). An indirect comparison analysis showed no difference between dasatinib and nilotinib for CCyR or MMR rates for 12 months' follow-up (CCyR, odds ratio 1.09, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.92; MMR, odds ratio 1.28, 95% CI 0.77 to 2.16). There is observational association evidence from imatinib studies supporting the use of CCyR and MMR at 12 months as surrogates for overall all-cause survival and progression-free survival in patients with CML in chronic phase. In the cost-effectiveness modelling scenario, analyses were provided to reflect the extensive structural uncertainty and different approaches to estimating OS. First-line dasatinib is predicted to provide very poor value for money compared with first-line imatinib, with deterministic incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of between pound256,000 and pound450,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Conversely, first-line nilotinib provided favourable ICERs at the willingness-to-pay threshold of pound20,000-30,000 per QALY. LIMITATIONS: Immaturity of empirical trial data relative to life expectancy, forcing either reliance on surrogate relationships or cumulative survival/treatment duration assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: From the two trials available, dasatinib and nilotinib have a statistically significant advantage compared with imatinib as measured by MMR or CCyR. Taking into account the treatment pathways for patients with CML, i.e. assuming the use of second-line nilotinib, first-line nilotinib appears to be more cost-effective than first-line imatinib. Dasatinib was not cost-effective if decision thresholds of pound20,000 per QALY or pound30,000 per QALY were used, compared with imatinib and nilotinib. Uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness analysis would be substantially reduced with better and more UK-specific data on the incidence and cost of stem cell transplantation in patients with chronic CML.

If unrestricted, retroelements accumulate in the cytoplasm and insert their DNA into the host genome, with the potential to cause autoimmune disease and cancer. Retroviruses and other retroelements are inhibited by proteins of the APOBEC family, of which activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is a member. Although AID is mainly known for being a DNA mutator shaping the antibody repertoire in B lymphocytes, we found that AID also restricts de novo L1 integrations in B- and non-B-cell lines. It does so by decreasing the protein level of open reading frame 1 (ORF1) of both exogenous and endogenous L1. In activated B lymphocytes, AID deficiency increased L1 mRNA 1.6-fold and murine leukemia virus (MLV) mRNA 2.7-fold. In cell lines and activated B lymphocytes, AID forms cytoplasmic high-molecular-mass complexes with L1 mRNA, which may contribute to L1 restriction. Because AID-deficient activated B lymphocytes do not express ORF1 protein, we suggest that ORF1 protein expression is inhibited by additional restriction factors in these cells. The greater increase in MLV compared to L1 mRNA in AID-deficient activated B lymphocytes may indicate less strict surveillance of retrovirus.","['Metzner, Mirjam', 'Jack, Hans-Martin', 'Wabl, Matthias']","['Metzner M', 'Jack HM', 'Wabl M']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America. mmetzner@molmed.uni-erlangen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121102,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC3487726,2012/11/08 06:00,2013/05/08 06:00,['2012/11/08 06:00'],"['2012/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0049358 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-22081 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(11):e49358. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0049358.

The tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib inhibits migration of several cell lines from solid-organ tumours, but effects on CLL cells have not been reported. We studied the effect of clinically achievable concentrations of dasatinib on signaling induced by the chemokine CXCL12 through its' receptor CXCR4, which is highly expressed on CLL cells. Dasatinib pre-treatment inhibited Akt and ERK phosphorylation in CLL cells upon stimulation with CXCL12. Dasatinib also significantly diminished the rapid increase in actin polymerisation observed in CLL cells following CXCL12 stimulation. Moreover, the drug significantly inhibited chemotaxis in a transwell assay, and reduced the percentage of cells able to migrate beneath a CXCL12-expressing murine stromal cell line. Dasatinib also abrogated the anti-apoptotic effect of prolonged CXCL12 stimulation on cultured CLL cells. These data suggest that dasatinib, akin to other small molecule kinase inhibitors targeting the B-cell receptor signaling pathway, may redistribute CLL cells from protective tissue niches to the peripheral blood, and support the investigation of dasatinib in combination strategies.","['McCaig, Alison M', 'Cosimo, Emilio', 'Leach, Michael T', 'Michie, Alison M']","['McCaig AM', 'Cosimo E', 'Leach MT', 'Michie AM']","['Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.

Recent evidence has indicated an important role for GCS in multidrug resistance (MDR) tumors. Doxorubicin (DOX)can modulate the expression of GCS in leukemia and ovary cell lines. However, few studies have investigated their relationship in breast cancer; METHODS: We collected 84 excision biopsies from patients with invasive ductal breast cancer of whom 33 patients had undergone preoperative chemotherapy. Immunohistochemistry was used to analyze the expression of GCS protein and significantly showed that the expression of GCS was higher in the samples from patients treated with preoperative chemotherapy(p = 0.018). In order to investigate the underlying mechanism, breast cancer cell lines were cultured with different concentrations of DOX, and mRNA and protein levels of GCS were then detected; RESULTS: DOX significantly upregulated the expression of GCS at both the mRNA and protein level in ERalpha-positive MCF-7 cells.We then block down the Sp1 site of GCS promoter, which inhibited the DOX-mediated increase in GCS expression; and after Eralpha was inhibited in MCF-7 cells, the up-regulation of GCS by DOX also been inhibited. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our data demonstrated the novel finding that DOX could modulate the expression of GCS through the Sp1 site of GCS promoter in ERalpha-positive breast cancer cells.","['Zhang, Xiaofang', 'Wu, Xiaojuan', 'Su, Peng', 'Gao, Yongsheng', 'Meng, Bin', 'Sun, Yanlin', 'Li, Li', 'Zhou, Zhiqiang', 'Zhou, Gengyin']","['Zhang X', 'Wu X', 'Su P', 'Gao Y', 'Meng B', 'Sun Y', 'Li L', 'Zhou Z', 'Zhou G']","['Department of Pathology, Shandong University School of Medicine, Jinan, Shandong, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121102,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC3487728,2012/11/08 06:00,2013/05/08 06:00,['2012/11/08 06:00'],"['2012/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0048492 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-19940 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(11):e48492. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0048492.

However, the NMF problem does not have a unique solution, creating a need for additional constraints (regularization constraints) to promote informative solutions. Regularized NMF problems are more complicated than conventional NMF problems, creating a need for computational methods that incorporate the extra constraints in a reliable way. We developed novel methods for regularized NMF based on block-coordinate descent with proximal point modification and a fast optimization procedure over the alpha simplex. Our framework has important advantages in that it (a) accommodates for a wide range of regularization terms, including sparsity-inducing terms like the L1 penalty, (b) guarantees that the solutions satisfy necessary conditions for optimality, ensuring that the results have well-defined numerical meaning, (c) allows the scale of the solution to be controlled exactly, and (d) is computationally efficient. We illustrate the use of our approach on in the context of gene expression microarray data analysis.

Sdl heterozygous mice develop disease with a short latency and high penetrance, while mice homozygous for the mutation die early during embryonic development. Sdl mice exhibit an increase in the frequency of micronucleated reticulocytes, and T-ALLs from Sdl mice harbor small amplifications and deletions, including activating deletions at the Notch1 locus. Using exome sequencing it was determined that Sdl mice harbor a spontaneously acquired mutation in Mcm4 (Mcm4(D573H)). MCM4 is part of the heterohexameric complex of MCM2-7 that is important for licensing of DNA origins prior to S phase and also serves as the core of the replicative helicase that unwinds DNA at replication forks. Previous studies in murine models have discovered that genetic reductions of MCM complex levels promote tumor formation by causing genomic instability. However, Sdl mice possess normal levels of Mcms, and there is no evidence for loss-of-heterozygosity at the Mcm4 locus in Sdl leukemias. Studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicate that the Sdl mutation produces a biologically inactive helicase. Together, these data support a model in which chromosomal abnormalities in Sdl mice result from the ability of MCM4(D573H) to incorporate into MCM complexes and render them inactive. Our studies indicate that dominantly acting alleles of MCMs can be compatible with viability but have dramatic oncogenic consequences by causing chromosomal abnormalities.","['Bagley, Bruce N', 'Keane, Thomas M', 'Maklakova, Vilena I', 'Marshall, Jonathon G', 'Lester, Rachael A', 'Cancel, Michelle M', 'Paulsen, Alex R', 'Bendzick, Laura E', 'Been, Raha A', 'Kogan, Scott C', 'Cormier, Robert T', 'Kendziorski, Christina', 'Adams, David J', 'Collier, Lara S']","['Bagley BN', 'Keane TM', 'Maklakova VI', 'Marshall JG', 'Lester RA', 'Cancel MM', 'Paulsen AR', 'Bendzick LE', 'Been RA', 'Kogan SC', 'Cormier RT', 'Kendziorski C', 'Adams DJ', 'Collier LS']","['School of Pharmacy and UW Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121101,United States,PLoS Genet,PLoS genetics,101239074,PMC3486839,2012/11/08 06:00,2013/05/15 06:00,['2012/11/08 06:00'],"['2012/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pgen.1003034 [doi]', 'PGENETICS-D-12-00181 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS Genet. 2012;8(11):e1003034. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003034.

AMLs bearing MLL (mixed lineage leukemia) rearrangements are associated with intermediate or poor survival. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small noncoding RNAs, have been postulated to be important gene expression regulators virtually in all biological processes, including leukemogenesis. Through a large-scale, genome-wide miRNA expression profiling assay of 85 human AML and 15 normal control samples, we show that among 48 miRNAs that are significantly differentially expressed between MLL- and non-MLL-rearranged AML samples, only one (miR-495) is expressed at a lower level in MLL-rearranged AML than in non-MLL-rearranged AML; meanwhile, miR-495 is also significantly down-regulated in MLL-rearranged AML samples compared with normal control samples. Through in vitro colony-forming/replating assays and in vivo bone marrow transplantation studies, we show that forced expression of miR-495 significantly inhibits MLL-fusion-mediated cell transformation in vitro and leukemogenesis in vivo. In human leukemic cells carrying MLL rearrangements, ectopic expression of miR-495 greatly inhibits cell viability and increases cell apoptosis. Furthermore, our studies demonstrate that PBX3 and MEIS1 are two direct target genes of miR-495, and forced expression of either of them can reverse the effects of miR-495 overexpression on inhibiting cell viability and promoting apoptosis of human MLL-rearranged leukemic cells. Thus, our data indicate that miR-495 likely functions as a tumor suppressor in AML with MLL rearrangements by targeting essential leukemia-related genes.","['Jiang, Xi', 'Huang, Hao', 'Li, Zejuan', 'He, Chunjiang', 'Li, Yuanyuan', 'Chen, Ping', 'Gurbuxani, Sandeep', 'Arnovitz, Stephen', 'Hong, Gia-Ming', 'Price, Colles', 'Ren, Haomin', 'Kunjamma, Rejani B', 'Neilly, Mary Beth', 'Salat, Justin', 'Wunderlich, Mark', 'Slany, Robert K', 'Zhang, Yanming', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Le Beau, Michelle M', 'Mulloy, James C', 'Rowley, Janet D', 'Chen, Jianjun']","['Jiang X', 'Huang H', 'Li Z', 'He C', 'Li Y', 'Chen P', 'Gurbuxani S', 'Arnovitz S', 'Hong GM', 'Price C', 'Ren H', 'Kunjamma RB', 'Neilly MB', 'Salat J', 'Wunderlich M', 'Slany RK', 'Zhang Y', 'Larson RA', 'Le Beau MM', 'Mulloy JC', 'Rowley JD', 'Chen J']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121106,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,PMC3511140,2012/11/08 06:00,2013/01/30 06:00,['2012/11/08 06:00'],"['2012/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/30 06:00 [medline]']","['1217519109 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1217519109 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Nov 20;109(47):19397-402. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1217519109.

In this study, we examined if and through which mechanisms stichoposide C (STC) from Thelenota anax (family Stichopodidae) induces apoptosis in leukemia and colorectal cancer cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We examined STC-induced apoptosis in human leukemia and colorectal cancer cells in the context of mitochondrial injury and signaling pathway disturbances, and investigated the antitumor effect of STC in mouse CT-26 subcutaneous tumor and HL-60 leukemia xenograft models. RESULTS: We found that STC induces apoptosis in these cells in a dose-dependent manner and leads to the activation of Fas and caspase-8, cleavage of Bid, mitochondrial damage, and activation of caspase-3. STC activates acid sphingomyelinase (SMase) and neutral SMase, which resulted in the generation of ceramide. Specific inhibition of acid SMase or neutral SMase and siRNA knockdown experiments partially blocked STC-induced apoptosis. Moreover, STC markedly reduced tumor growth of HL-60 xenograft and CT-26 subcutaneous tumors and increased ceramide generation in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Ceramide generation by STC, through activation of acid and neutral SMase, may in part contribute to STC-induced apoptosis and antitumor activity. Thus, STC may have therapeutic relevance for human leukemia and colorectal cancer.","['Yun, Seong-Hoon', 'Park, Eun-Seon', 'Shin, Sung-Won', 'Na, Yong-Woo', 'Han, Jin-Yeong', 'Jeong, Jin-Sook', 'Shastina, Valeria V', 'Stonik, Valentin A', 'Park, Joo-In', 'Kwak, Jong-Young']","['Yun SH', 'Park ES', 'Shin SW', 'Na YW', 'Han JY', 'Jeong JS', 'Shastina VV', 'Stonik VA', 'Park JI', 'Kwak JY']","['Department of Biochemistry, Dong-A University College of Medicine, Busan, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,,2012/11/08 06:00,2013/06/12 06:00,['2012/11/08 06:00'],"['2012/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['18/21/5934 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-0655 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2012 Nov 1;18(21):5934-48. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-0655.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Glycosides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '37341-37-0 (stichoposide)', 'EC 3.1.4.12 (Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Ceramides/*metabolism', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Glycosides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/metabolism', 'Triterpenes/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'fas Receptor/genetics/metabolism']",,,,['(c)2012 AACR.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forty-six patients with newly diagnosed myeloid (AML, biphenotypic leukemia, CML) or lymphoid (CLL, NHL, B-ALL, T-ALL) hematological disorders were included in the study. In the lymphoid group, the median expression values of RENIN, ACE1, ACE2 and ANGIOTENSINOGEN (ANGTS) mRNAs were 1.96%, 0.42%, 0.00% and 0.00%, respectively; in the myeloid group, 0.73%, 1.55%, 0.04% and 0.006%, respectively. In the lymphoid group, RENIN levels were significantly higher (p = 0.001), whereas ACE1 and ACE2 levels were significantly higher in the myeloid group (p values were 0.013 and 0.010, respectively). ANGTS levels were similar in both groups. In patients with non-ALL lymphoid malignancies, RENIN expressions were significantly higher when compared to ALL patients (p = 0.004). All patients with active disease had significantly higher RENIN mRNA expression levels than patients without active disease (2.03% vs 0.30%) (p = 0.034).

In the present study, we assessed the efficacy of this extract to inhibit the spontaneous development of tumors in elderly mice of the cancer-prone C3H strain. Dietary CVT-E002 was fed for approximately a year beginning when mice were almost 2 years of age. Control mice, consuming the same chow without CVT-E002, all developed assorted, palpable tumors between 22 and 33 months, while all mice consuming CVT-E002 remained alive and tumor-free until they were purposely euthanized as healthy animals. The absolute numbers of NK cells at euthanasia, in CVT-E002-consuming mice, were significantly elevated in both the spleen and bone marrow. Given these profoundly positive results and the fact that CVT-E002 already exists in the marketplace under the label Cold-fX(R), the potential for cancer prevention in humans becomes apparent.","['Durairaj, Punithavathi', 'Miller, Sandra C']","['Durairaj P', 'Miller SC']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121107,England,Phytother Res,Phytotherapy research : PTR,8904486,,2012/11/08 06:00,2014/04/10 06:00,['2012/11/08 06:00'],"['2012/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/02 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ptr.4880 [doi]'],ppublish,Phytother Res. 2013 Sep;27(9):1339-44. doi: 10.1002/ptr.4880.

Allyl ITC (AITC), sec-butyl ITC (s-BuITC), and 3-butenyl ITC (3-BuITC), which have 3 or 4 carbon chains, inhibited histamine release but did not inhibit the release of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) or cysteinyl LTs (CysLTs). 4-Pentenyl ITC (4-PeITC) and 5-hexenyl ITC (5-HeITC), which have 5 or 6 carbon chains and an unsaturated bond at the end, inhibited LTB4 release but did not inhibit the release of histamine or CysLTs. 6-Methylthiohexyl ITC (6-MTITC), 6-methylsulfinylhexyl ITC (6-MSITC), and 6-methylsulfonylhexyl ITC (6-MSFITC), which have a sulfur atom inserted at the end of a 6-carbon chain, inhibited the release of histamine, LTB4, and CysLTs and the elevation in intracellular Ca(2+). These results suggest that wasabi ITCs inhibited type I allergies by inhibiting chemical mediator release and that the inhibitory effects on each chemical mediator were due to differences in the side chain structure of the wasabi ITCs.","['Yamada-Kato, Tomoe', 'Nagai, Masashi', 'Ohnishi, Motoko', 'Yoshida, Kazutoshi']","['Yamada-Kato T', 'Nagai M', 'Ohnishi M', 'Yoshida K']","['Kinjirushi Co., Ltd., Nagoya, Aichi, Japan. t-yamada@kinjirushi.co.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,J Nutr Sci Vitaminol (Tokyo),Journal of nutritional science and vitaminology,0402640,,2012/11/08 06:00,2013/04/23 06:00,['2012/11/08 06:00'],"['2012/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['DN/JST.JSTAGE/jnsv/58.303 [pii]', '10.3177/jnsv.58.303 [doi]']",ppublish,J Nutr Sci Vitaminol (Tokyo). 2012;58(4):303-7. doi: 10.3177/jnsv.58.303.,"['0 (6-methylsulfinylhexyl isothiocyanate)', '0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Isothiocyanates)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (dinitrophenyl-bovine serum albumin)', '1HGW4DR56D (Leukotriene B4)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', '62414-75-9 (2,3,4-tri-O-acetylarabinopyranosyl isothiocyanate)', '63844HOL2H (6-methylthiohexyl isothiocyanate)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dinitrophenols/metabolism', 'Histamine Release/drug effects', 'Isothiocyanates/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukotriene B4/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/metabolism', 'Wasabia/*chemistry']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), have shown activity against colon cancer cells. The aims of this study were to determine whether the combination of aspirin with sorafenib has enhanced anti-proliferative effects and increases recombinant human tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (rhTRAIL)-induced apoptosis in the human SW948, Lovo, Colo205, Colo320, Caco-2 and HCT116 colon cancer cell lines. In four cell lines, aspirin strongly stimulated the anti-proliferative effects of sorafenib ( approximately four-fold enhancement) by inducing cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, combining low doses of aspirin (</= 5 mm) and sorafenib (</= 2.5 microm) greatly sensitized TRAIL-sensitive and TRAIL-resistant colon cancer cells to rhTRAIL, much more potently than either drug combined with rhTRAIL. The increase in rhTRAIL sensitivity was due to inhibition of FLIP and Mcl-1 protein expression following aspirin and sorafenib co-treatment, as confirmed by knock-down studies. Next, the clinical relevance of targeting FLIP and Mcl-1 in colon cancer was examined. Using immunohistochemistry, we found that Mcl-1 expression was significantly increased in colon adenoma and carcinoma patient material compared to healthy colonic epithelium, similar to the enhanced FLIP expression we recently observed in colon cancer. These results underscore the potential of combining low doses of aspirin with sorafenib to inhibit proliferation and target the anti-apoptotic proteins FLIP and Mcl-1 in colon cancer cells.","['Pennarun, Bodvael', 'Kleibeuker, Jan H', 'Boersma-van Ek, Wytske', 'Kruyt, Frank A E', 'Hollema, Harry', 'de Vries, Elisabeth G E', 'de Jong, Steven']","['Pennarun B', 'Kleibeuker JH', 'Boersma-van Ek W', 'Kruyt FA', 'Hollema H', 'de Vries EG', 'de Jong S']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Groningen, University Medical Centre Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,J Pathol,The Journal of pathology,0204634,,2012/11/08 06:00,2013/03/21 06:00,['2012/11/08 06:00'],"['2011/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/15 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/path.4138 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pathol. 2013 Feb;229(3):410-21. doi: 10.1002/path.4138.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (TNIP2 protein, human)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)']",IM,,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Adenocarcinoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Adenoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Aspirin/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Mucosa/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Niacinamide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Phenylurea Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Sorafenib', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,,,"['Copyright (c) 2012 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

Chemotherapy results in a high rate of remission; however, relapse and clinical drug resistance are usually seen within a year. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) acts as a tumor suppressor and plays a critical role in mammalian cell transformation. Increased protein levels of SET, endogenous PP2A inhibitor, have been reported to correlate with poor prognosis in human leukemia. Here, we test the potential therapeutic role for a SET antagonist in canine lymphoma. We observed SET protein levels increased in multiple canine lymphoma cell lines compared with primary peripheral blood cells. A novel SET antagonist OP449 increased PP2A activity and effectively killed SET high-expressing canine lymphoma cells, but not SET low-expressing cells. Caspase-3 activation and enhanced Annexin V positive staining were observed after OP449 treatment, suggesting apoptotic cell death by OP449. Consistent with this, pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK blocked OP449 induced cell death. These data demonstrated the potential therapeutic application of SET antagonists for canine lymphoma.","['Fujiwara, Nobuyuki', 'Kawasaki, Hideyoshi', 'Yabe, Ryotaro', 'Christensen, Dale J', 'Vitek, Michael P', 'Mizuno, Takuya', 'Sato, Koichi', 'Ohama, Takashi']","['Fujiwara N', 'Kawasaki H', 'Yabe R', 'Christensen DJ', 'Vitek MP', 'Mizuno T', 'Sato K', 'Ohama T']","['Laboratory of Veterinary Pharmacology, Joint Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Yamaguchi University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121105,Japan,J Vet Med Sci,The Journal of veterinary medical science,9105360,,2012/11/08 06:00,2013/09/28 06:00,['2012/11/08 06:00'],"['2012/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/09/28 06:00 [medline]']","['DN/JST.JSTAGE/jvms/12-0366 [pii]', '10.1292/jvms.12-0366 [doi]']",ppublish,J Vet Med Sci. 2013;75(3):349-54. doi: 10.1292/jvms.12-0366.

MATERIALS & METHODS: The DNA of 37 samples from patients with CLL, six healthy donors, and Jurkat and Ramos cell lines was analyzed by MS-MLPA. RESULTS: Our results confirm that hypermethylation is a common and not randomly distributed event in CLL, and some genes, such as WT1, CDH13, IGSF4/TSLC1, GATA5, DAPK1 and RARB, are hypermethylated in more than 25% of the analyzed samples. Importantly, MS-MLPA also detected hypermethylation of some genes not reported previously in CLL, and their methylation status was confirmed by bisulfite sequencing. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that MS-MLPA is a useful technique for the detection of methylation in CLL samples. Selecting CLL-specific methylation targets in order to generate a CLL-specific MS-MLPA probe set could enhance its usefulness as a tool in studies of risk stratification and guiding the best therapeutic decision.","['Cosialls, Ana M', 'Santidrian, Antonio F', 'Coll-Mulet, Llorenc', 'Iglesias-Serret, Daniel', 'Gonzalez-Girones, Diana M', 'Perez-Perarnau, Alba', 'Rubio-Patino, Camila', 'Gonzalez-Barca, Eva', 'Alonso, Esther', 'Pons, Gabriel', 'Gil, Joan']","['Cosialls AM', 'Santidrian AF', 'Coll-Mulet L', 'Iglesias-Serret D', 'Gonzalez-Girones DM', 'Perez-Perarnau A', 'Rubio-Patino C', 'Gonzalez-Barca E', 'Alonso E', 'Pons G', 'Gil J']","[""Departament de Ciencies Fisiologiques II, Institut d'Investigacio Biomedica de Bellvitge (IDIBELL)-Universitat de Barcelona, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Epigenomics,Epigenomics,101519720,,2012/11/08 06:00,2013/04/04 06:00,['2012/11/08 06:00'],"['2012/11/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2217/epi.12.40 [doi]'],ppublish,Epigenomics. 2012 Oct;4(5):491-501. doi: 10.2217/epi.12.40.,"['0 (Cadherins)', '0 (H-cadherin)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (retinoic acid receptor beta)']",IM,,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cadherins/genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accordingly, del(20q) as an isolated abnormality must be distinguished from cases in which it is associated with other chromosomal rearrangements for a better stratification of prognosis. We report a case of an isolated del(20q) abnormality with additional genomic aberrations identified using whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A)-based karyotyping. A 39-yr-old man was diagnosed with AML without maturation. Metaphase cytogenetic analysis (MC) revealed del(20)(q11.2) as the isolated abnormality in 100% of metaphase cells analyzed, and FISH analysis using D20S108 confirmed the 20q deletion in 99% of interphase cells. Using FISH, other rearrangements such as BCR/ABL1, RUNX1/RUNX1T1, PML/RARA, CBFB/MYH11, and MLL were found to be negative. SNP-A identified an additional copy neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH) in the 11q13.1-q25 region. Furthermore, SNP-A allowed for a more precise definition of the breakpoints of the 20q deletion (20q11.22-q13.31). Unexpectedly, the terminal regions showed gain on chromosome 20q. The patient did not achieve complete remission; 8 months later, he died from complications of leukemic cell infiltrations into the central nervous system. This study suggests that a presumably isolated chromosomal abnormality by MC may have additional genomic aberrations, including CN-LOH, which could be associated with a poor prognosis. SNP-A-based karyotyping may be helpful for distinguishing true isolated cases from cases in combination with additional genomic aberrations not detected by MC.","['Hahm, Chorong', 'Mun, Yeung Chul', 'Seong, Chu Myong', 'Chung, Wha Soon', 'Huh, Jungwon']","['Hahm C', 'Mun YC', 'Seong CM', 'Chung WS', 'Huh J']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Ewha Womans University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20121017,Korea (South),Ann Lab Med,Annals of laboratory medicine,101571172,PMC3486942,2012/11/07 06:00,2013/11/14 06:00,['2012/11/07 06:00'],"['2012/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/13 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3343/alm.2012.32.6.445 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Lab Med. 2012 Nov;32(6):445-9. doi: 10.3343/alm.2012.32.6.445.

The patient's B-cell lymphoma had a good initial response to chemotherapy for 4 years, after which it became less responsive and was thought to have undergone transition to a higher-grade lymphoma. Different regimens of chemoradiotherapy were then tried with modest response until the patient presented 3 years later with signs and symptoms of HLH. The patient died 1 month later, and an autopsy was performed. Significant para-aortic lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly were found. Microscopic, immunohistochemical and molecular evaluations confirmed the presence of composite B-cell and T-cell lymphoma in the para-aortic enlarged lymph nodes. Bone marrow examination showed hemophagocytosis, and the liver demonstrated infiltration by activated macrophages with hepatocellular necrosis. This report highlights the importance of searching for a possible underlying T-cell lymphoma in light of HLH. Different theories have been proposed to explain the rare occurrence of concurrent B- and T-cell lymphomas, but the development of HLH in this patient highlights the importance of immune dysregulation as a proposed mechanism to explain some cases of composite lymphomas. A review of the literature and discussion of the relative merits of these hypotheses are presented in the context of this case.","['Alomari, Ahmed', 'Hui, Pei', 'Xu, Mina']","['Alomari A', 'Hui P', 'Xu M']","['Yale-New Haven Hospital, New Haven, CT, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20121104,United States,Int J Surg Pathol,International journal of surgical pathology,9314927,,2012/11/07 06:00,2014/02/19 06:00,['2012/11/07 06:00'],"['2012/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1066896912464047 [pii]', '10.1177/1066896912464047 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Surg Pathol. 2013 Jun;21(3):303-8. doi: 10.1177/1066896912464047.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: After randomization, 64 patients received busulfan (3.2 mg/kg per day x 4 days) plus cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg per day x 2 days; BuCy), and 62 patients received busulfan (same dose and schedule) plus fludarabine (30 mg/m(2) per day x 5 days; BuFlu). RESULTS: The median age was 41 years (range, 17 to 59 years). Five patients in the BuFlu arm experienced graft failure (primary, n = 1; secondary, n = 4). At 4 weeks after HCT, the median percentage of recipient hematopoietic chimerism was significantly greater in the BuFlu arm (0% v 5.5%; P < .001), and complete donor chimerism was greater in the BuCy arm (97.2% v 44.4%; P < .001). Severe (grade 3 or higher) infection and gastrointestinal adverse events were significantly more common in the BuCy arm, but the frequencies of hepatic adverse events were similar in the two arms. Nonrelapse mortality was similar in the two arms, but the BuCy arm had better overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), and event-free survival (EFS; OS at 2 years, 67.4% v 41.4%, P = .014; RFS, 74.7% v 54.9%, P = .027; EFS, 60.7% v 36.0%, P = .014).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-five adults (age 60 to 75 years; median, 67 years) with previously untreated AML (including therapy-related and previous myelodysplastic syndrome) received bortezomib 1.3 mg/m(2) intravenously (IV) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 with daunorubicin 60 mg/m(2) on days 1 through 3 and cytarabine 100 mg/m(2) by continuous IV infusion on days 1 through 7. Patients who achieved complete remission (CR) received up to two courses of consolidation chemotherapy with cytarabine 2 gm/m(2) on days 1 through 5 with bortezomib. Three cohorts with escalating dose levels of bortezomib were tested (0.7, 1.0, and 1.3 mg/m(2)). Dose-limiting toxicities were assessed during the first cycle of consolidation. The relationship between cell surface expression of CD74 and clinical outcome was assessed. RESULTS: Frequency of CR was 65% (62 of 95), and 4% of patients (four of 95) achieved CR with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp). Eleven patients developed grade 3 sensory neuropathy. Bortezomib plus Int-DAC proved tolerable at the highest dose tested. Lower CD74 expression was associated with CR/CRp (P = .04) but not with disease-free or overall survival. CONCLUSION: The addition of bortezomib to standard 3 + 7 daunorubicin and cytarabine induction chemotherapy for AML resulted in an encouraging remission rate.

METHODS: To help formulate government guidance on occupational MF, the cancer cases prevented and the monetary benefits accruing to society by reducing workplace exposures were determined. Life-table methods produced Disability Adjusted Life Years, which were converted to monetary values. RESULTS: Adjusted for probabilities of causality, the expected increase in a worker's disability-free life are 0.04 year (2 weeks) from a 1 microtesla (microT) MF reduction in average worklife exposure, which is equivalent to $5,100/worker/microT in year 2010 U.S. dollars (95% confidence interval $1,000-$9,000/worker/microT). Where nine electrosteel workers had 13.8 microT exposures, for example, moving them to ambient MFs would provide $600,000 in benefits to society (uncertainty interval $0-$1,000,000).

In this study, we report that all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) decreases Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK-1) activity, antagonizing the effect of the Tax protein in Jurkat leukemia T cells transiently transfected for expressing the Tax protein. The Tax protein is one of the products of the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) which is the etiologic agent of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), an aggressive neoplasia of CD4+ T cells. The decrease in JNK-1 activity was followed by a marked decrease in the expression of interleukin (IL)-2 and a weak increase in interferon (IFN)-gamma in Jurkat cells treated with ATRA in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting a correlation between the expression of JNK-1 and the activity of the Tax protein. However, the expression levels of IL-4 and IL-10 were enhanced in cells transfected with Tax, compared with the levels in untransfected cells, but the expression levels were not affected following ATRA treatment. In transfection studies using a luciferase reporter construct expressing the IL-2 promoter or a tandem repeat of AP-1 or NF-kappaB, the inhibitory effect of ATRA on the IL-2 promoter and AP-1 construct was confirmed at the transcriptional level. However, the inhibitory effect in the NF-kappaB reporter construct was only marginal. In addition, our data demonstrated that JNK-1 is constitutively activated in Jurkat leukemia T cells expressing the Tax protein, suggesting that JNK-1 is required for Tax-induced proliferation of Jurkat leukemia cells.","['Parra, Eduardo', 'Gutierrez, Luis']","['Parra E', 'Gutierrez L']","['Biomedical Experimental Laboratory, Faculty of Sciences, University of Tarapaca, Arica, Chile. eparra@uta.cl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121026,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,,2012/11/07 06:00,2014/01/10 06:00,['2012/11/07 06:00'],"['2012/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2012.2108 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2013 Jan;29(1):387-93. doi: 10.3892/or.2012.2108.

OBJECTIVE: to describe the therapeutic response and survival of patients with HCL attended in a third level public institution. METHODS: patient's data with HCL diagnosis registered between January 1989 - December 2009 were analyzed. RESULTS: twenty three patients fulfilled HCL diagnosis criteria. Median age was 44 years (range 23-75 years) and median follow-up of the cohort was 1,877 days (range 1-8,462 days). First line treatment varied along time finding complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) rates of 77.3 and 18.2%, respectively. Of all therapeutic modalities employed cladribine induced the highest response rate. Survival at 1,877 days was 82.6%. At last follow-up 65.2% of patients remain alive, 13 in CR and 2 in PR; 4 died (CR = 2, PR = 1, active disease = 1) and 4 were lost during follow-up.

Current therapeutic protocols use prednisone for both the prophase and the induction phase of the therapy because the greater antileukemic activity of dexamethasone is compromised by its high frequency of serious adverse reactions. AIM: To compare, for the first time, the in vitro antileukemic activity of prednisolone alone to that of a combination of prednisolone and dexamethasone using dexamethasone at a very low and presumably safe dosage (1/50 w/w). METHODS: Lymphoblasts were isolated from bone marrow and/or blood samples from children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The cytotoxic activity of prednisolone, dexamethasone and the prednisolone/dexamethasone combination against isolated leukemia cells was analyzed using the MTT cytotoxicity assay. RESULTS: We observed differences in the in vitro antileukemic activity of prednisolone and dexamethasone in 21% of the tested patients. 3% of the children were prednisolone sensitive but dexamethasone resistant, while 18% were prednisolone resistant and dexamethasone sensitive. 32% were sensitive to both glucocorticoids and 18% were resistant to both. Cells from patients with good in vivo responses to prednisone monotherapy were more responsive to prednisolone in vitro than were cells from patients with poor prednisone responses (P<0.07). Importantly, we demonstrated that the use of even a minimal dose (1/50 w/w) of dexamethasone with prednisolone dramatically increases the in vitro anti-leukemic activity of prednisolone (P<0.0006). CONCLUSION: The high inter-individual variability of acute lymphoblastic leukemia responses to glucocorticoids suggest that either patients should be selected for prednisone or dexamethasone treatment on the basis of predictive biomarkers or that prednisone should be used directly in combination with a very low and safe dose of dexamethasone to potentiate its antileukemic activity. The latter option is likely to be cheaper and more efficient, and therefore warrants further clinical investigation to assess its efficacy and safety in treating childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Spenerova, Michaela', 'Dzubak, Petr', 'Srovnal, Josef', 'Radova, Lenka', 'Burianova, Renata', 'Konecny, Petr', 'Salkova, Sona', 'Novak, Zbynek', 'Pospisilova, Dagmar', 'Stary, Jan', 'Blazek, Bohumir', 'Hak, Jiri', 'Votava, Tomas', 'Timr, Pavel', 'Kaiserova, Emilia', 'Bubanska, Eva', 'Mihal, Vladimir', 'Hajduch, Marian']","['Spenerova M', 'Dzubak P', 'Srovnal J', 'Radova L', 'Burianova R', 'Konecny P', 'Salkova S', 'Novak Z', 'Pospisilova D', 'Stary J', 'Blazek B', 'Hak J', 'Votava T', 'Timr P', 'Kaiserova E', 'Bubanska E', 'Mihal V', 'Hajduch M']","['Laboratory of Experimental Medicine, Institute of Molecular and Translational Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc and University Hospital Olomouc, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121031,Czech Republic,Biomed Pap Med Fac Univ Palacky Olomouc Czech Repub,"Biomedical papers of the Medical Faculty of the University Palacky, Olomouc, Czechoslovakia",101140142,,2012/11/07 06:00,2016/09/23 06:00,['2012/11/07 06:00'],"['2012/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5507/bp.2012.059 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Pap Med Fac Univ Palacky Olomouc Czech Repub. 2014 Sep;158(3):422-7. doi: 10.5507/bp.2012.059.

Dismal outcomes for patients with relapsed or refractory disease mandate novel approaches to therapy. We have previously shown that the combination of the mTOR inhibitor RAD001 (everolimus) and the chemotherapeutic agent vincristine increases the survival of non-obese diabetic/severe combined immuno-deficient (NOD/SCID) mice bearing human ALL xenografts. We have also shown that 16 muM RAD001 synergized with agents that cause DNA damage or microtubule disruption in pre-B ALL cells in vitro. Here, we demonstrate that RAD001 has dose-dependent effects on the cell cycle in ALL cells, with 1.5 muM RAD001 inhibiting pRb, Ki67 and PCNA expression and increasing G0/1 cell cycle arrest, whereas 16 muM RAD001 increases pRb, cyclin D1, Ki67 and PCNA, with no evidence of an accumulation of cells in G0/1. Transition from G2 into mitosis was promoted by 16 muM RAD001 with reduced phosphorylation of cdc2 in cells with 4 N DNA content. However, 16 muM RAD001 preferentially induced cell death in cells undergoing mitosis. When combined with vincristine, 16 muM RAD001 reduced the vincristine-induced accumulation of cells in mitosis, probably as a result of increased death in this population. Although 16 muM RAD001 weakly activated Chk1 and Chk2, it suppressed strong vincristine-induced activation of these cell cycle checkpoint regulators. We conclude that RAD001 enhances chemosensitivity at least in part through suppression of cell cycle checkpoint regulation in response to vincristine and increased progression from G2 into mitosis.","['Saunders, P O', 'Weiss, J', 'Welschinger, R', 'Baraz, R', 'Bradstock, K F', 'Bendall, L J']","['Saunders PO', 'Weiss J', 'Welschinger R', 'Baraz R', 'Bradstock KF', 'Bendall LJ']","['Westmead Institute for Cancer Research, Westmead Millennium Institute, University of Sydney, Westmead, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121105,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,2012/11/07 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2012/11/07 06:00'],"['2011/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/14 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2012498 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2012.498 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2013 Oct;32(40):4789-97. doi: 10.1038/onc.2012.498.

PER-624 is a cell line generated from an NMC patient with an unusually complex karyotype that gave no initial indication of the involvement of the NUT locus. Analysis of PER-624 next-generation transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) using the algorithm FusionFinder identified a novel transcript in which Exon 15 of BRD4 was fused to Exon 2 of NUT, therefore differing from all published NMC fusion transcripts. The three additional exons contained in the PER-624 fusion encode a series of polyproline repeats, with one predicted to form a helix. In the NMC cell line PER-403, we identified the 'standard' NMC fusion and two novel isoforms. Knockdown by small interfering RNA in either cell line resulted in decreased proliferation, increased cell size and expression of cytokeratins consistent with epithelial differentiation. These data demonstrate that the novel BRD4-NUT fusion in PER-624 encodes a functional protein that is central to the oncogenic mechanism in these cells. Genomic PCR indicated that in both PER-624 and PER-403, the translocation fuses an intron of BRD4 to a region upstream of the NUT coding sequence. Thus, the generation of BRD4-NUT fusion transcripts through post-translocation RNA-splicing appears to be a common feature of these carcinomas that has not previously been appreciated, with the mechanism facilitating the expression of alternative isoforms of the fusion. Finally, ectopic expression of wild-type NUT, a protein normally restricted to the testis, could be demonstrated in PER-403, indicating additional pathways for aberrant cell signaling in NMC. This study contributes to our understanding of the genetic diversity of NMC, an important step towards finding therapeutic targets for a disease that is refractory to current treatments.","['Thompson-Wicking, K', 'Francis, R W', 'Stirnweiss, A', 'Ferrari, E', 'Welch, M D', 'Baker, E', 'Murch, A R', 'Gout, A M', 'Carter, K W', 'Charles, A K', 'Phillips, M B', 'Kees, U R', 'Beesley, A H']","['Thompson-Wicking K', 'Francis RW', 'Stirnweiss A', 'Ferrari E', 'Welch MD', 'Baker E', 'Murch AR', 'Gout AM', 'Carter KW', 'Charles AK', 'Phillips MB', 'Kees UR', 'Beesley AH']","[""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, University of Western Australia Centre for Child Health Research, Perth, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121105,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,2012/11/07 06:00,2013/11/16 06:00,['2012/11/07 06:00'],"['2011/12/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/04 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2012487 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2012.487 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2013 Sep 26;32(39):4664-74. doi: 10.1038/onc.2012.487.

Palivizumab is approved for prevention of RSV in specific populations but not for treatment. Few studies demonstrated the safety and successful treatment with intravenous (IV) palivizumab. We describe our experience with IV palivizumab treatment for RSV in a pediatric hematology-oncology department during an outbreak. METHODS: During a short period of renovations, oncology patients were placed in a general pediatric ward. After a case of severe fatal RSV pneumonia in a 2-year-old male patient with acute myeloid leukemia, all patients were actively screened twice weekly regardless of symptoms. Respiratory samples were tested for RSV using rapid immunochromatography detection, immunofluorescence, or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. A single dose of palivizumab (15 mg/kg) was given to children below 3 years of age who tested positive for RSV. RESULTS: Over a 6-week period, 12 patients tested positive for RSV. Seven patients were treated with palivizumab. Five patients had respiratory symptoms, and 2 were asymptomatic. No adverse events were attributed to IV palivizumab treatment. Early-treated patients had no complications attributed to RSV. CONCLUSIONS: Containment of RSV outbreak in high-risk children is difficult. Screening with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and the early use of IV palivizumab is safe and may prevent complications of RSV infection among these patients.","['Shachor-Meyouhas, Yael', 'Zaidman, Irina', 'Kra-Oz, Zipi', 'Arad-Cohen, Nira', 'Kassis, Imad']","['Shachor-Meyouhas Y', 'Zaidman I', 'Kra-Oz Z', 'Arad-Cohen N', 'Kassis I']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Meyer Children's Hospital, Haifa, Israel. y_shahor@rambam.health.gov.il""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,2012/11/07 06:00,2013/04/12 06:00,['2012/11/07 06:00'],"['2012/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0b013e3182756edc [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2013 Mar;35(2):124-8. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3182756edc.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', 'DQ448MW7KS (Palivizumab)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*therapeutic use', 'Antiviral Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Disease Outbreaks', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Palivizumab', 'Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections/diagnosis/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Respiratory Tract Infections/drug therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On an exploratory basis, we sought to evaluate the influence of treatment with immunosuppressive therapy (IST) versus observation on long-term outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Records from 1999 to 2010 were screened for patients who met the criteria for MAA: (1) bone marrow cellularity of 20% to 50%; (2) cytopenias in at least 1 cell line (absolute neutrophil count<1000/microL, hemoglobin<9 g/dL, platelet count<100,000/microL); (3) mean corpuscular volume >/=90; (4) persistence >6 months; and (5) negative Fanconi studies. Data were collected for patient/disease characteristics, treatments, and outcomes. RESULTS: Eight patients met the criteria for MAA. Three of 8 patients received IST. Of 3 patients who received IST, complete response was observed in 2 and transfusion independence in 1, as compared with 2 of 5 and 3 of 5 in the group who were observed without IST. Median duration of follow-up was 48 months. DISCUSSION: As several patients spontaneously resolved, and none developed severe aplastic anemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome, the criteria used here may identify a group of children with favorable prognosis who can be managed supportively.","['Brock, Katharine', 'Goldenberg, Neil', 'Graham, Douglas K', 'Liang, Xiayuan', 'Hays, Taru']","['Brock K', 'Goldenberg N', 'Graham DK', 'Liang X', 'Hays T']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,2012/11/07 06:00,2013/04/12 06:00,['2012/11/07 06:00'],"['2012/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0b013e3182755f36 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2013 Mar;35(2):148-52. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3182755f36.,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],IM,,"['Anemia, Aplastic/*drug therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Coombs Test', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Telomere', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During invasive infection the inhaled fungal conidia enter the morphogenic cycle leading to angioinvasive hyphae. This work aimed to study differentially expressed proteins of A. fumigatus during morphogenesis. To achieve this goal, a 2D-DIGE approach was applied to study surface proteins extractable by reducing agents of two A. fumigatus morphotypes: germlings and hyphae. Sixty-three differentially expressed proteins were identified by MALDI-ToF/MS. We observed that proteins associated with biosynthetic pathways and proteins with multiple functions (miscellaneous) were over-expressed in the early stages of germination, while in hyphae, the most abundant proteins detected were related to metabolic processes or have unknown functions. Among the most interesting proteins regulated during morphogenesis, two putative drug targets were identified, the translational factor, eEF3 and the CipC-like protein.

In this study, we show that an oncogenic mutant of the ubiquitin ligase casitas B-lineage lymphoma (CBL; CBLDeltaexon8), which is found in acute myeloid leukemia patients, predominantly cooperates with receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) class III receptors (PDGFRA, PDGFRB, KIT, and FLT3), but not with non-class III RTKs or cytokine receptors, to induce IL-3-independent growth of Ba/F3 cells. In cells coexpressing RTK class III/CBLDeltaexon8, receptor internalization was delayed, and cells were protected from apoptosis after cytokine withdrawal. Ligand-stimulated Ba/F3 cells and acute myeloid leukemia cell lines coexpressing the CBL deletion mutant and FLT3 showed enhanced AKT phosphorylation. Combined pharmacologic inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway and FLT3 had an additive effect on cell proliferation. The transforming potential of the CBL mutant was completely abolished by the mutation of the CBL PTB domain and was decreased by the mutation of tyrosines 589 and 591 in the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3. A constitutively active AKT1 mutant (E17K) recapitulated the phenotype induced by the CBL deletion mutant in Ba/F3 cells. This study reveals FLT3-CBL interaction sites and the AKT pathway as critical mediators of transformation by oncogenic CBL mutants.","['Polzer, Harald', 'Janke, Hanna', 'Schmid, Diana', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Spiekermann, Karsten']","['Polzer H', 'Janke H', 'Schmid D', 'Hiddemann W', 'Spiekermann K']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians University, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121102,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,2012/11/07 06:00,2013/05/22 06:00,['2012/11/07 06:00'],"['2012/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/05 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(12)00532-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2012.10.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2013 Mar;41(3):271-80.e4. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2012.10.016.

HTLV-1 Tax and HBZ proteins have been implicated in HAM/TSP pathogenesis in inducing cell proliferation and cytotoxic T lymphocytes response. OBJECTIVES: To quantify the expression of tax and HBZ mRNA in asymptomatic carriers (AC) and HAM patients, and to investigate their association with HAM/TSP. STUDY DESIGN: We quantified the expression of HTLV-1 tax and HBZ mRNA in 37 AC and 26 HAM patients classified according to proviral load as low (AC(L) and HAM(L): <1% infected cells) or high (AC(H) and HAM(H): >1%). RESULTS: The AC(L) subgroup showed the lowest frequency of individuals expressing tax mRNA in comparison with AC(H), HAM(L) and HAM(H), and tax mRNA load normalized by proviral load was significantly lower in the AC(L). In turn, normalized HBZ mRNA expression was similar in all subgroups. Both tax and HBZ mRNA expression were moderately correlated with proviral load in AC (r=0.6, p<0.001) and were weaker in HAM (r=0.4, p<0.05). In contrast, the correlation between tax and HBZ mRNA load was moderate in AC (r=0.5, p=0.001) and was much stronger in HAM (r=0.8, p<0.001). In addition, HBZ mRNA load, but not tax, was significantly associated with motor disability in HAM patients (p=0.036). CONCLUSIONS: The expression of tax mRNA seems to be best to estimate the risk of HAM/TSP, whereas HBZ mRNA appears to be a surrogate marker to disease progression, indicating that they have important but distinct roles in HAM/TSP pathogenesis.","['Andrade, Rafaela Gomes', 'Goncalves, Poliane de Cassia', 'Ribeiro, Maisa Aparecida', 'Romanelli, Luiz Claudio Ferreira', 'Ribas, Joao Gabriel', 'Torres, Elidio Barbosa', 'Carneiro-Proietti, Anna Barbara de Freitas', 'Barbosa-Stancioli, Edel Figueiredo', 'Martins, Marina Lobato']","['Andrade RG', 'Goncalves Pde C', 'Ribeiro MA', 'Romanelli LC', 'Ribas JG', 'Torres EB', 'Carneiro-Proietti AB', 'Barbosa-Stancioli EF', 'Martins ML']","['Microbiology Department, Biology Science Institute, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil. rafaela_biolog@yahoo.com.br']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121103,Netherlands,J Clin Virol,Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology,9815671,,2012/11/07 06:00,2013/06/20 06:00,['2012/11/07 06:00'],"['2012/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/10 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S1386-6532(12)00382-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jcv.2012.10.003 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Virol. 2013 Feb;56(2):135-40. doi: 10.1016/j.jcv.2012.10.003.

METHODS: K562 cells were treated with different concentrations of imatinib mesylate. After different time periods, the mRNA levels of BCR/ABL, PTEN and FAK were detected by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (FQ-PCR) to analyze their relationships. The protein level of FAK was detected by immunocytochemistry. The cell invasive ability was examined by Transwell (Boyden chamber) assay. RESULTS: In the initial 36 h, the expression level of PTEN mRNA was up-regulated and the FAK mRNA was down-regulated with the reduction of BCR/ABL fusion gene expression and the cell invasive ability of K562 cells was inhibited by 2 mug/mL imatinib mesylate. 48 h later, the PTEN mRNA expression level decreased and the FAK mRNA expression level was elevated with the restore of BCR/ABL fusion gene. BCR/ABL mRNA level presented a positive correlation with PTEN mRNA expression level, and a negative correlation with FAK mRNA.

We here describe an alternative DNA-based technique applied after long-term blood storage. DNA was isolated from dried blood stains from CML patients stored on filter paper (Guthrie cards) after a median period from diagnosis of 11 years (range: 5-12 years) and analyzed with a two round long-range multiplex PCR (MLR-PCR) to identify the genomic BCR-ABL1 breakpoint. Patient-specific individual BCR-ABL1 fusion sites were successfully detected in 10 out of 13 patients. Dried blood stains represent a valuable resource for genomic DNA analyses. Long term preservation is easily manageable in paper envelopes with the patient's medical files with a minimum of financial costs and efforts. Such the cooperation between laboratories and hospitals separated by long distances is facilitated rendering possible offering specialized genomic analyses to patients with CML virtually everywhere around the world.

The guidelines recommend regular monitoring using standard methods (e.g., real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction based on the international scale for molecular response) and treatment adjustment when failure is detected among patients treated with imatinib. The objective of this study was to assess the real-world monitoring and therapy adjustment in this patient population in the US. METHODS: Twenty-nine physicians from community practices across the US participated in an online chart review. Adult patients with chronic phase CML who initiated imatinib as first-line therapy during 2006-2010 were selected. Information was collected up to 36 months after imatinib initiation, including response monitoring, response status, and therapy adjustment upon treatment failure. RESULTS: The study included 297 eligible patients. By 18 months, 47% of patients had received cytogenetic response assessment continuously as recommended by the guidelines. The corresponding proportion was 39% for continuous molecular response assessment. Among patients who experienced treatment failure by 18 months, only 14%-38% of patients switched to a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor as recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the European Leukemia Net guidelines. LIMITATIONS: Major limitations included limited generalizability and the inability to accurately assess molecular response due to the variations in testing methods during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the guidelines, the rates of treatment monitoring and switching upon failure were low, demonstrating the need for improvement in CML care in community settings in the US.","['Chen, Lei', 'Guerin, Annie', 'Xie, Jipan', 'Wu, Eric Q', 'Yu, Andrew P', 'Ericson, Solveig G', 'Jabbour, Elias']","['Chen L', 'Guerin A', 'Xie J', 'Wu EQ', 'Yu AP', 'Ericson SG', 'Jabbour E']","['Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ 07936-1080, USA. lei.chen@novartis.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121105,England,Curr Med Res Opin,Current medical research and opinion,0351014,,2012/11/07 06:00,2013/04/23 06:00,['2012/11/07 06:00'],"['2012/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1185/03007995.2012.741577 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Med Res Opin. 2012 Nov;28(11):1831-9. doi: 10.1185/03007995.2012.741577.

While benefits have been obtained from use of inhibitors of KIT kinase activity such as imatinib, especially in gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST), primary resistance occurs with certain oncogenic mutations. Furthermore, resistance frequently develops due to secondary mutations. Approaches to addressing both of these issues as well as combination therapies to optimise use of KIT kinase inhibitors are discussed. AREAS COVERED: This review covers the occurrence of oncogenic KIT mutations in different cancers and the molecular basis of their action. The action of KIT kinase inhibitors, especially imatinib, sunitinib, dasatinib and PKC412, on different primary and secondary mutants is discussed. Outcomes of clinical trials in GIST, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), systemic mastocytosis and melanoma and their implications for future directions are considered. EXPERT OPINION: Analysis of KIT mutations in individual patients is an essential prerequisite to the use of kinase inhibitors for therapy, and monitoring for development of secondary mutations that confer drug resistance is necessary. However, it is unlikely that KIT inhibitors alone can lead to cure. KIT mutations alone do not seem to be sufficient for transformation; thus identification and co-targeting of synergistic oncogenic pathways should lead to improved outcomes.","['Ashman, Leonie K', 'Griffith, Renate']","['Ashman LK', 'Griffith R']","['University of Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20121106,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,,2012/11/07 06:00,2013/05/18 06:00,['2012/11/07 06:00'],"['2012/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543784.2013.740010 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2013 Jan;22(1):103-15. doi: 10.1517/13543784.2013.740010.

We provide data in a dog-model that the minor histocompatibility antigen UTY might be a promising target to further improve GvL-immune reactions after allogeneic-stem-cell transplantations. Female-canine-UTY-specific T cells (CTLs) were stimulated in vitro using autologous-DCs loaded with three HLA-A2-restricted-UTY-derived peptides (3-fold-expansion), and specific T cell responses were determined in 3/6 female dogs. CTLs specifically recognized/lysed autologous-female-peptide-loaded DCs, but not naive-autologous-female DCs and monocytes. They mainly recognized bone-marrow (BM) and to a lower extent DCs, monocytes, PBMCs and B-cells from DLA-identical-male littermates and peptide-loaded T2-cells in an MHC-I-restricted manner. A UTY-/male-specific reactivity was also obtained in vivo after stimulation of a female dog with DLA-identical-male PBMCs. In summary, we demonstrated natural UTY processing and presentation in dogs. We showed that female-dog CTLs were specifically stimulated by HLA-A2-restricted-UTY peptides, thereby enabling recognition of DLA-identical-male cells, mainly BM cells. These observations suggest UTY as a promising candidate-antigen to improve GvL-reactions in the course of immunotherapy.","['Bund, D', 'Buhmann, R', 'Gokmen, F', 'Zorn, J', 'Kolb, H-J', 'Schmetzer, H M']","['Bund D', 'Buhmann R', 'Gokmen F', 'Zorn J', 'Kolb HJ', 'Schmetzer HM']","['Medical Department III, University Hospital Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany. dagmar_bund@gmx.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,,2012/11/07 06:00,2013/03/07 06:00,['2012/11/07 06:00'],"['2012/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/sji.12011 [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 2013 Jan;77(1):39-53. doi: 10.1111/sji.12011.,['0 (H-Y Antigen)'],IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dogs', 'Female', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/drug effects/*immunology', 'H-Y Antigen/*immunology', 'Hematopoiesis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*drug effects/immunology']",,,,"['(c) 2012 The Authors.

Other objectives included assessing: preanalytic, analytic, and postanalytic requirements for TPMT testing; diagnostic accuracy of TPMT genotyping versus phenotyping; association of thiopurine toxicity with TPMT genotypic or phenotypic status; and costs of testing, care, and treating drug-associated complications. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE(R), EMBASE(R), and Healthstar were searched from inception to May 2010; the Cochrane Library(R) to October 2009; and BIOSIS(R), Genetics Abstracts, and EconLit to May 2009, for English language records. REVIEW METHODS: A reviewer screened records, and a second reviewer verified exclusions and subsequent selection of relevant studies. Studies in patients with leukemia and organ transplant were excluded. Additionally, laboratories that provide TPMT analytical services were surveyed to assess means of TPMT testing in practice. Where possible, risk of bias was assessed using standard criteria. Meta-analyses estimated diagnostic sensitivity, and specificity; and odds ratios of associations. RESULTS: 1790 titles or abstracts, and 538 full text records were screened. 114 observational studies and one RCT were included. Majority of studies were rated fair quality, except for diagnostic studies with 37 percent of studies rated poor. In general, there were few patients who were homozygous (or compound heterozygous) for TPMT variant alleles in the included studies limiting applicability. There is insufficient evidence examining effectiveness of pretesting in terms of reduction in clinical adverse events. Sufficient preanalytical data were available regarding preferred specimen collection, stability and storage conditions for TPMT testing. There was no clinically significant effect of age, gender, various coadministered drugs, or most morbidities (with the exception of renal failure and dialysis). TPMT phenotyping methods had coefficients of variation generally below 10 percent. TPMT genotyping reproducibility is generally between 95-100 percent. The sensitivity of genotyping to identify patients with low or intermediate TPMT enzymatic activity is imprecise, ranging from 70.70 to 82.10 percent (95 percent CI, lower bound range 37.90 to 54.00 percent; upper bound range 84.60 to 96.90 percent). Sensitivity of homozygous TPMT genotype to correctly identify patients with low to absent enzymatic activity was 87.10 percent (95 percent CI 44.30 to 98.30 percent). Genotyping specificity approached 100 percent. Leukopenia was significantly associated with low and intermediate enzymatic activity (low activity OR 80.00, 95 percent CI 11.5 to 559; and intermediate activity OR 2.96, 95 percent CI 1.18 to 7.42), and homozygous and heterozygous TPMT variant allele genotype (OR 18.60, 95 percent CI 4.12 to 83.60; and 4.62, 95 percent CI 2.34 to 9.16, respectively). In general, TPMT phenotyping costs less than genotyping, although estimates across studies are quite heterogeneous. CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient direct evidence regarding the effectiveness of pretesting of TPMT status in patients with chronic autoimmune diseases. Indirect evidence confirms strong association of leukopenia with lower levels of TPMT activity and carrier genotype already established in the literature.","['Booth, Ronald A', 'Ansari, Mohammed T', 'Tricco, Andrea C', 'Loit, Evelin', 'Weeks, Laura', 'Doucette, Steve', 'Skidmore, Becky', 'Hoch, Jeffrey S', 'Tsouros, Sophia', 'Sears, Margaret', 'Sy, Richmond', 'Karsh, Jacob', 'Mani, Suja', 'Galipeau, James', 'Yurkiewich, Alexander', 'Daniel, Raymond', 'Tsertsvadze, Alexander', 'Yazdi, Fatemeh']","['Booth RA', 'Ansari MT', 'Tricco AC', 'Loit E', 'Weeks L', 'Doucette S', 'Skidmore B', 'Hoch JS', 'Tsouros S', 'Sears M', 'Sy R', 'Karsh J', 'Mani S', 'Galipeau J', 'Yurkiewich A', 'Daniel R', 'Tsertsvadze A', 'Yazdi F']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Evid Rep Technol Assess (Full Rep),Evidence report/technology assessment,101082681,PMC4781432,2010/12/01 00:00,2013/02/01 06:00,['2012/11/07 06:00'],"['2012/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/01 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Evid Rep Technol Assess (Full Rep). 2010 Dec;(196):1-282.,"['0 (azathiopurine)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)']",IM,,"['Autoimmune Diseases/*drug therapy/economics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukopenia/chemically induced/enzymology', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Methyltransferases/*analysis/genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The physical examination showed splenomegaly (spleen ultrasound-18 cm in large diameter, and 11 cm by palpation) with thrombocytopenia and anemia. He underwent kidney biopsy which described infiltration of small B cell lymphocytes with positive lambda chains. His bone marrow showed infiltration of atypical lymphocytes, and flow cytometry was typical of B-cell CLL. Patient started therapy with corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 80 mg iv) and continued treatment with prednisone (Decortin 20 mg tablets) and chlorambucil (Leukeran 16 mg tablets) through three days. An addition to therapy lead to an increase in platelet count, creatinine level decline and recovery of renal function was observed. He was treated with 6 cycles of therapy with prednisone and chlorambucil and achieved a satisfactory therapeutic effect with adequate hematologic parameters and less severe splenomegaly. Maintenance therapy was continued with prednison at daily dose of 10 mg. Our patient is one of the amongst previously reported as an example of a rare complication of CLL'with leukemic infiltrate causing acute renal insufficiency.

Mediastinal myeloid sarcoma is very rare. There are two major types of myeloid sarcoma: granulocytic sarcoma and monoblastic sarcoma, according to immature cell type. Myeloid sarcoma is found in 2%-8% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Myeloid sarcoma may develop before or concurrently with AML, or may be the initial manifestation of AML relapse in previously treated patients. Blast transformation of some form of myeloproliferative neoplasm or myelodysplastic syndrome may also manifest as myeloid sarcoma. A major differential diagnostic problem is isolated primary myeloid sarcoma without bone marrow and peripheral blood involvement, which may precede leukemic stage for months or years, and which is frequently misdiagnosed, mostly as malignant lymphoma. A case is presented of a 56-year-old female patient complaining of weakness, vertigo, dry cough and breathing difficulties. Clinical examination revealed enhanced vascular pattern on the right chest and right arm edema. Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax showed an expansive growth measuring 11 cm craniocaudally in the anterior mediastinum. Fine needle aspiration cytology of tumor mass yielded a scarcely cellular sample with individual atypical immature cells, fine chromatin structure and scarce cytoplasm with occasional granules and Auer rods. Considering the morphological, cytochemical and immunocytochemical characteristics of immature cells, the diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma was made and verified by histopathology of tumor biopsy sample. Immature cells were not found by analysis of bone marrow puncture sample, immunophenotyping of bone marrow cells and bone biopsy analysis. As immature cell proliferation was not detected in bone marrow and peripheral blood, while spread of the disease beyond the mediastinum was ruled out by imaging methods (CT, ultrasonography), it was decided to be a primary non-leukemic form of mediastinal myeloid sarcoma. Myeloid sarcoma should be taken in consideration on differential diagnosis of solid tumors because making an accurate diagnosis is necessary for timely initiation of appropriate therapy. Weakly expressed or lacking clear signs of myeloid differentiation may hamper morphological diagnosis. As isolated myeloid sarcoma is a very rare entity frequently resembling lymphoma in clinical presentation, it poses a major diagnostic challenge for both morphologists and clinicians.","['Jelic-Puskaric, Biljana', 'Kardum-Skelin, Ika', 'Sustercic, Dunja', 'Pazur, Marina', 'Vrhovac, Radovan', 'Radic-Kristo, Delfa', 'Gredelj-Simec, Njetocka', 'Kovacevic, Dragica Obad', 'Plascak, Jasmina', 'Gasparov, Slavko', 'Jaksic, Branimir']","['Jelic-Puskaric B', 'Kardum-Skelin I', 'Sustercic D', 'Pazur M', 'Vrhovac R', 'Radic-Kristo D', 'Gredelj-Simec N', 'Kovacevic DO', 'Plascak J', 'Gasparov S', 'Jaksic B']","['Merkur University Hospital, Department of Clinical Cytology and Cytogenetics, Zagreb, Croatia. biljana.jelic.puskaric@zg.t-com.hr']",['hrv'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Croatia,Acta Med Croatica,Acta medica Croatica : casopis Hravatske akademije medicinskih znanosti,9208249,,2011/09/01 00:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/11/07 06:00'],"['2012/11/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Acta Med Croatica. 2011 Sep;65 Suppl 1:133-8.,,IM,,"['Biopsy, Fine-Needle', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mediastinal Neoplasms/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/diagnosis/*pathology']",,,,,,,,,,Izolirani mijeloidni sarkom medijastinuma.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sixteen consecutive patients (male 69% and female 31%) diagnosed with APL at Department of Hematology, Merkur University Hospital between August 1998 and December 2010 were included in the study. The mean age of patients was 43.9 (range: 18-78, SD 14.9). The patients' clinical and laboratory features, cytomorphological characteristics of APL-blasts and their immunophenotype determined by flow cytometry were analyzed. Patients were divided into two groups, CD34- and CD34+, and were then compared according to clinical and laboratory characteristics. There was no difference according to age, sex or white blood cell count between two groups. The mean value of hypogranular/agranular APL-blasts was markedly higher in CD34+ group than CD34- group (34%, range 9-60, SD 24.4 vs. 11.5%, range 0-38, SD 13.7), with borderline statistical significance (P=0.055). CD34- patients had significantly better overall survival than CD34+ ones (P=0.02). Patients without Auer rods detected in APL-blasts had higher CD34 expression (69.4% +/- 33.8) compared to patients with detected Auer rods (7.3% +/- 24.8), but statistical significance was not reached (p=0.053). Our results are consistent with the results of other published studies and point to the fact that higher CD34 expression and lower cytoplasmic granularity of APL-blasts are factors that seem to define a specific subgroup of APL patients.

The tyrosine kinase abl fusion protein,the initial leukemogenic event in chronic myeloid leukemia, is constitutively activated thus inducing the production of reactive oxygen species. Of particular relevance is the fact that an increase in reactive oxygen species can facilitate genomic instability and may contribute to disease progression. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate oxidative stress by determining the levels of malondialdehyde and nitrite in chronic myeloid leukemia patients under treatment with 1st and 2nd generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors monitored at a referral hospital in Fortaleza, Ceara. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed of 64 male and female adults. Patients were stratified according to treatment. The levels of malondialdehyde and nitrite were determined by spectrophotometry. Statistical differences between groups were observed using the Student t-test and Fisher's exact test. The results are expressed as mean +/- standard error of mean. The significance level was set for a p-value < 0.05 in all analyses. RESULTS: The results show significantly higher mean concentrations of nitrite and malondialdehyde in chronic myeloid leukemia patients using second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors compared to patients on imatinib. CONCLUSION: It follows that chronic myeloid leukemia patients present higher oxidative activity and that the increases in oxidative damage markers can indicate resistance to 1st generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","['Petrola, Maria Juracy', 'de Castro, Alana Joselina Montenegro', 'Pitombeira, Maria Helena da Silva', 'Barbosa, Maritza Cavalcante', 'Quixada, Acy Telles de Souza', 'Duarte, Fernando Barroso', 'Goncalves, Romelia Pinheiro']","['Petrola MJ', 'de Castro AJ', 'Pitombeira MH', 'Barbosa MC', 'Quixada AT', 'Duarte FB', 'Goncalves RP']","['Universidade Federal do Ceara - UFC, Fortaleza, CE, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Brazil,Rev Bras Hematol Hemoter,Revista brasileira de hematologia e hemoterapia,101220159,PMC3486825,2012/11/06 06:00,2012/11/06 06:01,['2012/11/06 06:00'],"['2012/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5581/1516-8484.20120091 [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Bras Hematol Hemoter. 2012;34(5):352-5. doi: 10.5581/1516-8484.20120091.,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Leukemia, myelogenous, chronic, BCR-ABL positive', 'Malondialdehyde', 'Oxidative stress', 'Protein-tyrosine kinases']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nucleotide concentrations in the extracellular space are strictly regulated by cell surface enzymes, called ectonucleotidases, which hydrolyze nucleotides to the respective nucleosides. Recent studies suggest that ectonucleotidases play a significant role in inflammation by adjusting the balance between ATP, a widely distributed proinflammatory danger signal, and the anti-inflammatory mediator adenosine. There is increasing evidence for a central role of adenosine in alloantigen-mediated diseases such as solid organ graft rejection and acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Solid organ and hematopoietic cell transplantation are established treatment modalities for a broad spectrum of benign and malignant diseases. Immunological complications based on the recognition of nonself-antigens between donor and recipient like transplant rejection and GvHD are still major challenges which limit the long-term success of transplantation. Studies in the past two decades indicate that purinergic signalling influences the severity of alloimmune responses. This paper focuses on the impact of ectonucleotidases, in particular, NTPDase1/CD39 and ecto-5'-nucleotidase/CD73, on allograft rejection, acute GvHD, and graft-versus-leukemia effect, and on possible clinical implications for the modulation of purinergic signalling after transplantation.","['Chernogorova, Petya', 'Zeiser, Robert']","['Chernogorova P', 'Zeiser R']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Freiburg University Medical Center, Albert-Ludwigs-University, 79106 Freiburg, Germany. petya.chernogorova@uniklinik-freiburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20121016,United States,J Biomed Biotechnol,Journal of biomedicine & biotechnology,101135740,PMC3482062,2012/11/06 06:00,2013/04/12 06:00,['2012/11/06 06:00'],"['2012/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2012/208204 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biomed Biotechnol. 2012;2012:208204. doi: 10.1155/2012/208204.

Although the D816V mutation is detected in most cases of systemic mastocytosis, the mutation is rarely observed in other forms of mastocytosis, such as cutaneous mastocytosis and mast cell leukemia/sarcoma, for which the mechanism of tumorigenesis remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrated a novel mechanism of mast cell tumorigenesis via SCF autocrine/paracrine release. SCF was highly expressed in a WT KIT-expressing HRMC line, contributing to the phosphorylation of KIT. Neutralization of external SCF using a neutralizing antibody or suppression of SCF production by RNA interference inhibited the growth of HRMC cells, indicating the essential role of SCF in cell proliferation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to determine the significant contribution of SCF autoproduction to neoplastic proliferation of mast cells. These results indicate the possibility that targeting SCF production may become a novel treatment for mast cell malignancies.","['Amagai, Y', 'Tanaka, A', 'Matsuda, A', 'Jung, K', 'Ohmori, K', 'Matsuda, H']","['Amagai Y', 'Tanaka A', 'Matsuda A', 'Jung K', 'Ohmori K', 'Matsuda H']","['Cooperative Major in Advanced Health Science, Graduate School of Bio-Applications and System Engineering, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121102,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,,2012/11/06 06:00,2013/04/02 06:00,['2012/11/06 06:00'],"['2012/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/02 06:00 [medline]']","['jlb.0512245 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.0512245 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2013 Feb;93(2):245-50. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0512245.

However, the effect of Rh2 on the cell cycle and its underlying molecular mechanism in human leukemia cells are not fully understood. In this study, we found that Rh2 inhibited the proliferation of human leukemia cells concentration- and time-dependently with an IC(50) of ~38 microM. DNA flow cytometric analysis indicated that Rh2 blocked cell cycle progression at the G(1) phase in HL-60 and U937 cells, and this was found to be accompanied by the downregulations of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4, CDK6, cyclin D1, cyclin D2, cyclin D3 and cyclin E at the protein level. However, CDK inhibitors (CDKIs), such as p21(CIP1/WAF1) and p27(KIP1), were gradually upregulated after Rh2 treatment at the protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels. In addition, Rh2 markedly enhanced the bindings of p21(CIP1/WAF1) and p27(KIP1) to CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6, and these bindings reduced CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6 activities. Furthermore, Rh2 induced the differentiation of HL-60 cells as demonstrated by biochemical assays and the expression levels of cell surface antigens. In addition, treatment of HL-60 cells with Rh2 significantly increased transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) production, and cotreatment with TGF-beta neutralizing antibody prevented the Rh2-induced downregulations of CDK4 and CDK6, upregulations of p21(CIP1/WAF1) and p27(KIP1) levels and the induction of differentiation. These results demonstrate that the Rh2-mediated G(1) arrest and the differentiation are closely linked to the regulation of TGF-beta production in human leukemia cells.","['Chung, Kyung-Sook', 'Cho, Sung-Hee', 'Shin, Ji-Sun', 'Kim, Dong-Hyun', 'Choi, Jung-Hye', 'Choi, Sang Y', 'Rhee, Young K', 'Hong, Hee-Do', 'Lee, Kyung-Tae']","['Chung KS', 'Cho SH', 'Shin JS', 'Kim DH', 'Choi JH', 'Choi SY', 'Rhee YK', 'Hong HD', 'Lee KT']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130-701, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121103,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,,2012/11/06 06:00,2013/04/04 06:00,['2012/11/06 06:00'],"['2012/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [medline]']","['bgs341 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgs341 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2013 Feb;34(2):331-40. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgs341.

METHODS: Cell viability in vitro was measured using methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay. CML cell growth in vivo was assessed using a xenograft model in nude mice. Bcr-Abl and beta-catenin protein levels were determined using Western blotting. Bcr-Abl messenger RNA (mRNA) was measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Flow cytometry (FCM) was used to determine cell cycle status. RESULTS: Tetrandrine citrate inhibited the growth of IM-resistant K562 cells, primary leukemia cells, and primitive CD34(+) leukemia cells, and their inhibition concentration that inhibited 50% of target cells (IC(50)) ranged from 1.20 to 2.97 mug/ml. In contrast, tetrandrine citrate did not affect normal blood cells under the same conditions, and IC(50) values were about 10.12-13.11 mug/ml. Oral administration of tetrandrine citrate caused complete regression of IM-resistant K562 xenografts in nude mice without overt toxicity. Western blot results revealed that treatment of IM-resistant K562 cells with tetrandrine citrate resulted in a significant decrease of both p210(Bcr-Abl) and beta-catenin proteins, but IM did not affect the Bcr-Abl protein levels. Proteasome inhibitor, MG132, did not prevent tetrandrine-mediated decrease of the p210(Bcr-Abl) protein. RT-PCR results showed that tetrandrine treatment caused a decrease of Bcr-Abl mRNA. FCM analysis indicated that tetrandrine induced gap 1 (G(1)) arrest in CML cells. CONCLUSIONS: Tetrandrine citrate is a novel orally active tetrandrine salt with potent anti-tumor activity against IM-resistant K562 cells and CML cells.

The models use a linear-quadratic dose response with differing dose effect modifiers. In the present study, a set of more than 40 models has been submitted to a rigorous statistical selection procedure which fosters the parsimonious deployment of model parameters based on pairwise likelihood ratio tests. Nested models were consequently excluded from risk assessment. The set comprises models of the excess absolute risk (EAR) and two types of non-standard ERR models with sigmoidal responses or two line spline functions with a changing slope at a break point. Due to clearly higher values of the Akaike Information Criterion, none of the EAR models has been selected, but two non-standard ERR models qualified for MMI. The preferred ERR model applies a purely quadratic dose response which is slightly damped by an exponential factor at high doses and modified by a power function for attained age. Compared to the previous analysis, the present study reports similar point estimates and confidence intervals (CI) of the ERR from MMI for doses between 0.5 and 2.5 Sv. However, at lower doses, the point estimates are markedly reduced by factors between two and five, although the reduction was not statistically significant. The 2.5 % percentiles of the ERR from the preferred quadratic-exponential model did not fall below zero risk in exposure scenarios for children, adolescents and adults at very low doses down to 10 mSv. Yet, MMI produced risk estimates with a positive 2.5 % percentile only above doses of some 300 mSv. Compared to CI from a single model of choice, CI from MMI are broadened in cohort strata with low statistical power by a combination of risk extrapolations from several models. Reverting to MMI can relieve the dilemma of needing to choose between models with largely different consequences for risk assessment in public health.","['Kaiser, Jan Christian', 'Walsh, Linda']","['Kaiser JC', 'Walsh L']","['Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Research Centre for Environmental Health, Institute of Radiation Protection, 85764 Oberschleissheim, Germany. christian.kaiser@helmholtz-muenchen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20121104,Germany,Radiat Environ Biophys,Radiation and environmental biophysics,0415677,PMC3579470,2012/11/06 06:00,2014/01/30 06:00,['2012/11/06 06:00'],"['2012/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00411-012-0437-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Environ Biophys. 2013 Mar;52(1):17-27. doi: 10.1007/s00411-012-0437-6.

Most of available mouse ES cell original research articles have worked with only six different cell lines. Our goals were to isolate one new mouse ES lineage, and perform a detailed immunocytochemistry study during neural differentiation, making use of an EB strategy protocol following the generation of neural progenitors, glial cells and postmitotic neurons. The dynamics of differentiation of ES cell derived neuronal precursors into differentiated glia cells and neurons were followed in vitro and correlated to exposure to specific elements of feeder medium. Morphological aspects of generated cellular types, including its immunocytochemical expression of differentiation markers were studied. Immuno-positivity against beta-III tubulin, PGP and TH (tyrosine hydroxylase) was observed from stage I. Approximately 80% of cells were positive for TH at stage I. The first glial cell type appears in stage III. TH, PGP or beta-III tubulin-positive cells with neuronal typical morphology only being seen in stage III when TH-positive cells corresponded to approximately 12% of total cells. Variations among other literature findings can be explained by the choice we made to use a newly isolated ES cell line. As colonies may behave differently during neuronal differentiation, it reinforces the necessity of studying original ES cell lines.","['Tavares, Rubens Lene C', 'Cortes, Paloma Alvarenga', 'de Azevedo, Camila Issa', 'Cangussu, Silvia Dantas', 'Camargos, Aroldo Fernando', 'Arantes, Rosa Maria E']","['Tavares RL', 'Cortes PA', 'de Azevedo CI', 'Cangussu SD', 'Camargos AF', 'Arantes RM']","['The Professor Aroldo Fernando Camargos Laboratory of Human Reproduction, The Teaching Hospital of the Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120813,England,Cell Biol Int Rep (2010),Cell biology international reports,101574535,PMC3475445,2012/11/06 06:00,2012/11/06 06:01,['2012/11/06 06:00'],"['2012/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1042/CBR20120002 [doi]', 'e00018 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Biol Int Rep (2010). 2012 Aug 13;19(1):e00018. doi: 10.1042/CBR20120002.,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"[""DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium"", 'EB, embryoid body', 'ES, embryonic stem', 'FBS, fetal bovine serum', 'GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein', 'KOSR, knockout serum replacement', 'LIF, leukaemia inhibitory factor', 'NEAA, non-essential amino acids', 'RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-PCR', 'SSEA-1, stage-specific embryonic antigen 1', 'TH, tyrosine hydroxylase', 'embryonic stem cell differentiation', 'immunocytochemistry', 'neural differentiation', 'neural precursor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we analyze 95 tumor genome sequences from breast, head and neck, colorectal, and prostate carcinomas, and from melanoma, multiple myeloma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We discover three genomic factors that are significantly correlated with the distribution of rearrangements: replication time, transcription rate, and GC content. The correlation is complex, and different patterns are observed between tumor types, within tumor types, and even between different types of rearrangements. Mutations in the APC gene correlate with and, hence, potentially contribute to DNA breakage in late-replicating, low %GC, untranscribed regions of the genome.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of Am80 on neuronal differentiation, BDNF sensitivity and TrkB expression in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Treatment with Am80 induced morphological differentiation of neurite outgrowth and increased the expression of GAP43 mRNA, a neuronal differentiation marker. Additionally, TrkB protein was also increased, and exogenous BDNF stimulation after treatment with Am80 induced greater neurite outgrowth than without BDNF treatment.

The activities of cellular Abl (c-Abl) and BCR-Abl are stringently regulated and the cellular mechanisms involved in their inactivation are poorly understood. Protein tyrosine phosphatases can negatively regulate Abl mediated signaling by dephosphorylating the kinase and/or its substrates. This study investigated the ability of the intracellular T cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP/PTPN2) to dephosphorylate and regulate the functions of BCR-Abl and c-Abl. TCPTP is expressed as two alternately spliced isoforms - TC48 and TC45, which differ in their C-termini and localize to the cytoplasm and nucleus respectively. We show that TC48 dephosphorylates BCR-Abl but not c-Abl and inhibits its activity towards its substrate, CrkII. Y1127 and Y1294 residues whose phosphorylation corresponds with BCR-Abl activation status were the primary sites targeted by TC48. Co-localization and immunoprecipitation experiments showed that TC48 interacted with BCR-Abl but not with c-Abl, and BCR domain was sufficient for interaction. TC48 expression resulted in the stabilization of Bcr-Abl protein dependent on its phosphatase activity. Inactivation of cellular TC48 in K562 cells by stable expression of a dominant negative catalytically inactive mutant TC48, enhanced proliferation. TC48 expressing K562 clones showed reduced proliferation and enhanced sensitivity to STI571 compared to control clones suggesting that TC48 can repress the growth of CML cells. This study identifies a novel cellular regulator that specifically inhibits the activity of oncogenic BCR-Abl but not that of the cellular Abl kinase.","['Mitra, Aninda', 'Sasikumar, Kotagiri', 'Parthasaradhi, B V V', 'Radha, Vegesna']","['Mitra A', 'Sasikumar K', 'Parthasaradhi BV', 'Radha V']","['Council of Scientific & Industrial Research, Hyderabad, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121031,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,,2012/11/06 06:00,2013/03/05 06:00,['2012/11/06 06:00'],"['2012/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/25 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0925-4439(12)00251-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbadis.2012.10.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2013 Jan;1832(1):275-84. doi: 10.1016/j.bbadis.2012.10.014.

METHODS: Primary cultured VSMCs from Sprague-Dawley rats were transfected with siRNAs against leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG), and then treated with Ang II, losartan, PD123319, or Val(5)-Ang II. The target mRNA and protein levels were determined using qPCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. Rat aortic rings were isolated, and the isometric contraction was measured with a force transducer and recorder. RESULTS: Stimulation with Ang II (0.1 mumol/L) for 0.5 h significantly increased the level of LARG mRNA in VSMCs. At 3, 6, and 9 h after the treatment with Ang II (0.1 mumol/L) plus AT(2) antagonist PD123319 (1 mumol/L) or with AT(1) agonist Val(5)-Ang II (1 mumol/L), the LARG protein, RhoA activity, and phosphorylation level of myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1) in VSMCs were significantly increased. Knockdown of LARG with siRNA reduced these effects caused by AT(1) receptor activation. In rat aortic rings pretreated with LARG siRNA, Ang II-induced contraction was diminished. CONCLUSION: Ang II upregulates LARG gene expression and activates the LARG/RhoA/MYPT1 axis via AT(1), thereby maintaining vascular tone.","['Chiu, Wei-chiao', 'Juang, Jyh-ming', 'Chang, Shen-nan', 'Wu, Cho-kai', 'Tsai, Chia-ti', 'Tseng, Yung-zu', 'Chiang, Fu-tien']","['Chiu WC', 'Juang JM', 'Chang SN', 'Wu CK', 'Tsai CT', 'Tseng YZ', 'Chiang FT']","['Graduate Institute of Physiology, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121105,United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,PMC4001838,2012/11/06 06:00,2013/11/16 06:00,['2012/11/06 06:00'],"['2012/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['aps2012117 [pii]', '10.1038/aps.2012.117 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2012 Dec;33(12):1502-10. doi: 10.1038/aps.2012.117.

This study investigated whether CIK cells from recurrent or refractory AML patients with high peripheral leukemia cell burdens could be expanded to a clinically usable number, and it further evaluated the antitumor potentials in vitro and in vivo. The numbers and phenotypes of CIK cells expanded from nine AML patients and 10 healthy donors were compared. Cytotoxicity (against K562 and U937 cell lines) and cytokine secretion (interleukin-2, interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor) were tested for AML-derived and healthy donor-derived CIK cells and fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors. Importantly, we assessed the therapeutic effects of autologous CIK cell infusions in two patients with AML. The proportions of CD3(+)and CD3(+)CD56(+) CIK cells from patients with AML were similar to those from healthy donors, and the number of CD3(+)CD56(+) cells in AML-derived CIK cells was expanded approximately 1,020-fold. Phenotype analyses with flow cytometry showed that the leukemic cells were gradually eliminated during the process of CIK cell preparation to an almost undetectable level. Although the cytotoxic effect of AML-derived CIK cells was equivalent to that of healthy donors, AML-derived CIK cells had a significantly higher cytokine-secreting capacity. In clinical treatment, the leukemia burden in the peripheral blood of one patient was dramatically decreased after four transfusions within 4 months. CIK cells can be efficiently expanded in vitro from patients with recurrent or refractory AML and may be used for reduction of leukemic blasts in vivo.","['Wang, Yao', 'Bo, Jian', 'Dai, Han-ren', 'Lu, Xue-chun', 'Lv, Hai-yan', 'Yang, Bo', 'Wang, Tao', 'Han, Wei-dong']","['Wang Y', 'Bo J', 'Dai HR', 'Lu XC', 'Lv HY', 'Yang B', 'Wang T', 'Han WD']","['Department of Immunology, Institute of Basic Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Chinese PLA General Hospital, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121030,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,2012/11/06 06:00,2013/05/22 06:00,['2012/11/06 06:00'],"['2012/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/17 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(12)00530-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2012.10.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2013 Mar;41(3):241-52.e3. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2012.10.014.

Although novel antipsychotics have been developed, the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia are still unresponsive to pharmacotherapy. The high level of social impairment and a chronic deteriorating course suggest that schizophrenia likely has neurodegenerative characteristics. Inflammatory markers such as pro-inflammatory cytokines are well-known etiological factors for psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. Inflammation in the central nervous system is closely related to neurodegeneration. In addition to pro-inflammatory cytokines, microglia also play an important role in the inflammatory process in the CNS. Uncontrolled activity of pro-inflammatory cytokines and microglia can induce schizophrenia in tandem with genetic vulnerability and glutamatergic neurotransmitters. Several studies have investigated the possible effects of antipsychotics on inflammation and neurogenesis. Additionally, anti-inflammatory adjuvant therapy has been under investigation as a treatment option for schizophrenia. Further studies should consider the confounding effects of systemic factors such as metabolic syndrome and smoking. In addition, the unique mechanisms by which pro-inflammatory cytokines are involved in the etiopathology of schizophrenia should be investigated. In this article, we aimed to review (1) major findings regarding neuroinflammation and pro-inflammatory cytokine alterations in schizophrenia, (2) interactions between neuroinflammation and neurogenesis as possible neural substrates for schizophrenia, and (3) novel pharmacological approaches.","['Na, Kyoung-Sae', 'Jung, Han-Yong', 'Kim, Yong-Ku']","['Na KS', 'Jung HY', 'Kim YK']","['Department of Psychiatry, Soonchunhyang University Bucheon Hospital, Bucheon, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20121101,England,Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,8211617,,2012/11/06 06:00,2014/08/02 06:00,['2012/11/06 06:00'],"['2012/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/11 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0278-5846(12)00278-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.pnpbp.2012.10.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry. 2014 Jan 3;48:277-86. doi: 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2012.10.022.

Alemtuzumab, an anti-CD52 antibody, has been reported to be an effective therapy due to inherent expression of CD52 on eosinophils. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 12 patients treated with alemtuzumab at our center until 2012. RESULTS: Ten (83%) of 12 patients achieved complete hematologic response (CHR) after a median of 1 week for a median duration of 66 weeks, with the elimination of disease-related symptoms; 2 patients achieved partial hematologic remission hematologic remission (PHR). Patients with CHR who received alemtuzumab maintenance (n = 5) had a significantly longer time to progression than those patients who were only observed (n = 5) (P = .01). Eleven patients relapsed (only one while on maintenance), and 6 were rechallenged with alemtuzumab. Five (83%) achieved second CHR after a median of 3.5 weeks, for a median duration of 123 weeks. Again, those given maintenance (n = 3) had a longer time to progression than those who were only observed (P = .04). Adverse effects were mostly related to infusion reactions and lymphopenia-related viral infections (despite antibiotic prophylaxis). One patient developed Epstein-Barr virus-related lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: Alemtuzumab is an effective treatment for patients with relapsed, refractory idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome and chronic eosinophilic leukemia-not otherwise specified, in terms of both CHR achievement (even after repeated rechallenges) and duration (particularly if provided as a maintenance therapy). Common adverse effects are related to infusion reactions and immunosuppression.","['Strati, Paolo', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Verstovsek, Srdan']","['Strati P', 'Cortes J', 'Faderl S', 'Kantarjian H', 'Verstovsek S']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121101,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,PMC4445419,2012/11/06 06:00,2014/05/07 06:00,['2012/11/06 06:00'],"['2012/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/21 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(12)00202-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2012.09.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2013 Jun;13(3):287-91. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2012.09.018.

DESIGN: Experimental study. SETTING: Research institution. PATIENT(S): None. INTERVENTION(S): Cultured trophoblastic HTR-8/SVneo cells were treated with LIF. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Matrigel matrix-based invasion assay of HTR-8/SVneo cells. Signaling molecules associated with LIF-mediated increase in invasion were investigated by Western blot, cDNA microarray, quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and gene silencing by siRNA. RESULT(S): Treatment of HTR-8/SVneo cells with LIF (50 ng/mL) led to a significant increase in invasion. Treatment with LIF also led to an increase in nuclear localization of activated STAT1 and STAT3. Among 237 differentially expressed genes after LIF treatment, expression of pappalysin 1, SERPINB3, podoplanin, integrin beta3, ID1, ICAM1, and so on went up, while tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1), TIMP2, and TIMP3 went down significantly. The presence of several of these proteins has also been demonstrated in human trophoblast cells. Silencing of pappalysin 1 led to a significant reduction in basal as well as LIF-mediated invasiveness of HTR-8/SVneo cells.

Sixteen naturally infected FIV/FeLV cats were followed during rFeIFNomega therapy in order to monitor clinical signs and to correlate with excretion of concomitant viruses (FCV, FHV-1, feline coronavirus (FCoV) and parvovirus (FPV)). Cats were submitted to clinical evaluations and concomitant virus excretion assessement. Comparing D0-D65, 10/16 cats improved clinical scores. Of the 10 cats positive for FHV-1 on D0, 4 were negative and 6 reduced viral loads. Of the 11 FCoV positive cats, 9 reduced viral loads. The 13 FCV positive cats and the FPV positive cat were negative on D65.

They occur after a mean disease duration of 3 years. CLL skin infiltrates as the primary manifestation of the disease have been reported, but a normal lymphocyte count at diagnosis is rare. We present two cases of CLL initially presenting in the skin, without lymphocytosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 53-year-old man developed papulonodular lesions of the face and infiltrated plaques of the scalp, and an 85-year-old woman presented erythematous nodules of the face and neck. Histopathology revealed a lymphocytic infiltrate, consisting of small mature B-cells CD20+, CD79+, with an aberrant phenotype CD5+. CD23 was positive in one case. The two patients had no lymphocytosis, but immunophenotyping was characteristic of CLL. In the second case, there was a sub-mental adenopathy, histologic analysis of which was consistent with CLL. The CLL was classified as Binet stage A in the two cases. No disease progression was noted at follow-up. DISCUSSION: The unusual feature of these cases is the lack of lymphocytosis at diagnosis. Thus, the skin lesions resulted in further evaluations for CLL, although the diagnosis was not suggested by the blood count. CONCLUSION: Skin involvement in CLL does not appear to be a poor prognostic indicator, arguing in favour of recruitment of circulating monoclonal B-cells rather than an additional tumour mass.","['Vonarx, M', 'Carpentier, O', 'Cazin, B', 'Bouchindhomme, B', 'Delaporte, E']","['Vonarx M', 'Carpentier O', 'Cazin B', 'Bouchindhomme B', 'Delaporte E']","['Service de dermatologie, hopital Claude-Huriez, CHRU de Lille, 59037 Lille cedex, France.']",['fre'],['Journal Article'],20120901,France,Ann Dermatol Venereol,Annales de dermatologie et de venereologie,7702013,,2012/11/06 06:00,2013/05/03 06:00,['2012/11/06 06:00'],"['2012/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2012/06/05 00:00 [revised]', '2012/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0151-9638(12)00504-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.annder.2012.06.040 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Dermatol Venereol. 2012 Oct;139(10):641-6. doi: 10.1016/j.annder.2012.06.040.

Compared with more-developed Western countries, higher exposure levels are evident in the Czech Republic, probably because of the different types of housing. In light of this, we aimed to examine the association between ELF-MF exposure and childhood leukaemia in the Czech Republic. METHODS: We conducted a paired case-control study. The cases (children with leukaemia) were age- sex- and permanent residence-matched to controls (children without leukaemia). Although this limited potential bias and confounding, it also limited our number of participants. RESULTS: The matched analyses included 79 case-control pairs. No significant association between ELF-MF exposure and childhood leukaemia was observed for exposures over 0.2 muT (odds ratio [OR]=0.93, confidence interval [CI]=0.45-1.93), 0.3 muT (OR=0.77, CI=0.34-1.75), or 0.4 muT (OR=0.9, CI=0.37-2.22). CONCLUSION: Despite higher levels of exposure in Middle and Eastern Europe, no indication of an association between ELF-MF exposure and childhood leukaemia was determined. This in contrast to the findings of previous studies conducted in different countries.","['Jirik, Vitezslav', 'Pekarek, Ludek', 'Janout, Vladimir', 'Tomaskova, Hana']","['Jirik V', 'Pekarek L', 'Janout V', 'Tomaskova H']",,['eng'],"['Letter', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Biomed Environ Sci,Biomedical and environmental sciences : BES,8909524,,2012/11/06 06:00,2013/02/22 06:00,['2012/11/06 06:00'],"['2011/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2011/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0895-3988(12)60098-1 [pii]', '10.3967/0895-3988.2012.05.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomed Environ Sci. 2012 Oct;25(5):597-601. doi: 10.3967/0895-3988.2012.05.015.,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Czech Republic/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Magnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', 'Risk Factors']",,,,"['Copyright (c) 2012 The Editorial Board of Biomedical and Environmental Sciences.', 'Published by Elsevier B.V.

Previous studies demonstrated that PEGLA, a LIF receptor antagonist (LA) conjugated with polyethylene glycol (PEG), effectively prevents implantation in mice, identifying PEGLA as a potential contraceptive for women. STUDY DESIGN: Adult female cynomolgus macaques were used to determine the optimal route of administration to deliver PEGLA to the uterine endometrium. Endometrial explants were used to examine the ability of PEGLA to block LIF action at endometrial cells. RESULTS: Both intramuscular and subcutaneous PEGLA administration resulted in peak serum PEGLA 24 h after administration; serum PEGLA was detectable throughout the 144-h sampling period. In contrast, serum PEGLA was near or below the limit of detection after vaginal administration. After intramuscular administration, PEGLA was localized to both luminal and glandular epithelial cells of the uterine endometrium, and PEGLA was measurable in endometrial lysates. PEGLA administration reduced endometrial signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation in vivo and in vitro. PEGLA also blocked LIF's ability to elevate expression of cochlin, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3, vascular endothelial growth factor A, and cyclooxygenase-2 (also known as PTGS2) in endometrial explants in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: PEGLA was delivered to the non-human primate uterine endometrium with systemic administration, and PEGLA blocked LIF actions associated with implantation. Blocking LIF receptor activity with the antagonist PEGLA may prevent pregnancy in women and provide a novel alternative to currently-available hormonal and barrier contraceptives.","['Aschenbach, Lindsey C', 'Hester, Kim E', 'McCann, Nicole C', 'Zhang, Jian-Guo', 'Dimitriadis, Evdokia', 'Duffy, Diane M']","['Aschenbach LC', 'Hester KE', 'McCann NC', 'Zhang JG', 'Dimitriadis E', 'Duffy DM']","['Department of Physiological Sciences, Eastern Virginia Medical School, Norfolk, VA 23507, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121031,United States,Contraception,Contraception,0234361,,2012/11/06 06:00,2014/04/08 06:00,['2012/11/06 06:00'],"['2012/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/20 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/04/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0010-7824(12)00884-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.contraception.2012.09.032 [doi]']",ppublish,Contraception. 2013 Jun;87(6):813-23. doi: 10.1016/j.contraception.2012.09.032.

SAR103168 was a potent Src inhibitor, with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) = 0.65 +/- 0.02 nM (at 100 muM ATP), targeting the auto-phosphorylation of the kinase domain (Src(260-535)) and activity of the phosphorylated kinase. Phosphorylation of Src, Lyn and Src downstream signaling pathways (PYK2, P-130CAS, FAK, JNK and MAPK) were inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. SAR103168 inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT5 in KG1 cells and fresh cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). SAR103168 inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in acute and chronic myeloid leukemic cells at nanomolar IC50. SAR103168 induced anti-proliferation of leukemic progenitors (CFU-L) from 29 patients with AML, and > 85% of AML patient samples were sensitive to SAR103168. These antagonist activities of SAR103168 were independent of FLT3 expression. SAR103168 treatment was effective in 50% of high-risk patient samples carrying chromosome 7 abnormalities or complex rearrangement.

The absence of an association between place of birth and the occurrence of CLL is more in line with a genetic basis for the geographic variations in incidence. Genetic predisposition to CLL is supported by the documented familial aggregation of CLL, with an increased frequency of 8.5-fold among first-degree relatives of patients with CLL and the detection of CLL-like clones in 13.5% of first-degree relatives. It is likely that the development of CLL depends on the interplay of a genetic predisposition with exposure to environmental factors.

Vectors derived from the nonprimate lentivirus equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) have been directly administered to patients in several clinical trials, with no toxicity observed to date. Because EIAV does not replicate in human cells, and because putative RCLs derived from vector components within human vector production cells would most likely be human cell-tropic, we previously developed an RCL assay using amphotropic murine leukemia virus (MLV) as a surrogate positive control and human cells as RCL amplification/indicator cells. Here we report an additional RCL assay that tests for the presence of theoretical ""equine-tropic"" RCLs. This approach provides further assurance of safety by detecting putative RCLs with an equine cell-specific tropism that might not be efficiently amplified by the human cell-based RCL assay. We tested the ability of accessory gene-deficient EIAV mutant viruses to replicate in a highly permissive equine cell line to direct our choice of a suitable EIAV-derived positive control. In addition, we report for the first time the mathematical rationale for use of the Poisson distribution to calculate minimal infectious dose of positive control virus and for use in monitoring assay positive/spike control failures in accumulating data sets. No RCLs have been detected in Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)-compliant RCL assays to date, further demonstrating that RCL formation is highly unlikely in contemporary minimal lentiviral vector systems.","['Farley, Daniel C', 'Bannister, Richard', 'Leroux-Carlucci, Marie A', 'Evans, Nerys E', 'Miskin, James E', 'Mitrophanous, Kyriacos A']","['Farley DC', 'Bannister R', 'Leroux-Carlucci MA', 'Evans NE', 'Miskin JE', 'Mitrophanous KA']","['Oxford BioMedica, Oxford OX4 4GA, United Kingdom. d.farley@oxfordbiomedica.co.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121102,United States,Hum Gene Ther Methods,Human gene therapy methods,101573202,PMC3732122,2012/11/06 06:00,2013/07/19 06:00,['2012/11/06 06:00'],"['2012/11/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/hgtb.2012.102 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther Methods. 2012 Oct;23(5):309-23. doi: 10.1089/hgtb.2012.102.

However, the mechanism involved in the cytotoxicity of Shikonin in the submicromolar range has not been fully characterized. Using biochemical and free radical biological experiments in vitro, we identified the prodifferentiated profiles of Shikonin and evaluated the redox homeostasis during HL-60 differentiation. The data showed a strong dose-response relationship between Shikonin exposure and the characteristics of HL-60 differentiation in terms of morphology changes, nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reductive activity, and the expression level of surface antigens CD11b/CD14. During drug exposure, intercellular redox homeostasis changes towards oxidation are necessary to support Shikonin-induced differentiation, which was proven by additional enzymatic and non-enzymatic redox modulators. A statistically significant and dose-dependent increase (P < 0.05) was recorded with regard to the unique expression levels of the Nrf2/ARE downstream target genes in HL-60 cells undergoing late differentiation, which were restored with further antioxidants employed with the Shikonin treatment. Our research demonstrated that Shikonin is a differentiation-inducing agent, and its mechanisms involve the Nrf2/ARE pathway to modulate the intercellular redox homeostasis, thus facilitating differentiation.","['Zhang, Bo', 'Chen, Na', 'Chen, Hongmei', 'Wang, Zhenhua', 'Zheng, Qiusheng']","['Zhang B', 'Chen N', 'Chen H', 'Wang Z', 'Zheng Q']","['Key Laboratory of Xinjiang Endemic Phytomedicine Resources of Ministry of Education, School of Pharmacy, Shihezi University, Shihezi 832002, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121015,United States,Oxid Med Cell Longev,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,101479826,PMC3478756,2012/11/03 06:00,2013/04/04 06:00,['2012/11/03 06:00'],"['2012/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2012/781516 [doi]'],ppublish,Oxid Med Cell Longev. 2012;2012:781516. doi: 10.1155/2012/781516.

This leukemia was characterized by insertion of the vector provirus into the BCL2A1 gene, with resultant BCL2A1 over-expression. There is little information on the role of this anti-apoptotic member of the BCL2 family in hematopoiesis or leukemia induction. Therefore we studied the impact of Bcl2a1a lentiviral over-expression on murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. We demonstrated the anti-apoptotic function of this protein in hematopoietic cells, but did not detect any impact of Bcl2a1a on in vitro cell growth or cell cycle kinetics. In vivo, we showed a higher propensity of HSCs over-expressing Bcl2a1a to engraft and contribute to hematopoiesis. Mice over-expressing Bcl2a1a in the hematologic compartment eventually developed an aggressive malignant disease characterized as a leukemia/lymphoma of B-cell origin. Secondary transplants carried out to investigate the primitive origin of the disease revealed the leukemia was transplantable. Thus, Bcl2a1 should be considered as a proto-oncogene with a potential role in both lymphoid and myeloid leukemogenesis, and a concerning site for insertional activation by integrating retroviral vectors utilized in hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy.","['Metais, Jean-Yves', 'Winkler, Thomas', 'Geyer, Julia T', 'Calado, Rodrigo T', 'Aplan, Peter D', 'Eckhaus, Michael A', 'Dunbar, Cynthia E']","['Metais JY', 'Winkler T', 'Geyer JT', 'Calado RT', 'Aplan PD', 'Eckhaus MA', 'Dunbar CE']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20121030,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC3484072,2012/11/03 06:00,2013/04/13 06:00,['2012/11/03 06:00'],"['2012/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0048267 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-13587 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(10):e48267. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0048267.

In this study, we performed an in vivo study to investigate the anti-tumor effect and mechanisms of fucoxanthin on xenografted sarcoma 180 (S180) in mice. Results revealed that fucoxanthin significantly inhibited the growth of sarcoma at the dose of 50 or 100 mg/kg. TUNEL analysis showed that the number of positive cells in the fucoxanthin-treated group was higher than that in the control group. Western blotting analysis also revealed the suppressed expression of bcl-2 and enhanced expression of cleaved caspase-3 by fucoxanthin. In addition, immunohistochemistry analysis and Western blotting analysis showed that fucoxanthin significantly decreased the expressions of survivin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Most importantly, fucoxanthin inhibited the expressions of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and STAT3 and phosphorylated STAT3 proteins.

The dose to each organ is assumed to be homogeneous. To take into account the differences in radiation sensitivities, the mean organ doses are weighted by a corresponding tissue-weighting coefficients provided by ICRP to calculate the effective dose, which has been used as a surrogate of radiation risk. However, those coefficients were derived under the assumption of a homogeneous dose distribution within each organ. That assumption is significantly violated in most medical-imaging procedures. In helical chest CT, for example, superficial organs (e.g. breasts) demonstrate a heterogeneous dose distribution, whereas organs on the peripheries of the irradiation field (e.g. liver) might possess a discontinuous dose profile. Projection radiography and mammography involve an even higher level of organ dose heterogeneity spanning up to two orders of magnitude. As such, mean dose or point measured dose values do not reflect the maximum energy deposited per unit volume of the organ. In this paper, the magnitude of the dose heterogeneity in both CT and projection X-ray imaging was reported, using Monte Carlo methods. The lung dose demonstrated factors of 1.7 and 2.2 difference between the mean and maximum dose for chest CT and radiography, respectively. The corresponding values for the liver were 1.9 and 3.5. For mammography and breast tomosynthesis, the difference between mean glandular dose and maximum glandular dose was 3.1. Risk models based on the mean dose were found to provide a reasonable reflection of cancer risk. However, for leukaemia, they were found to significantly under-represent the risk when the organ dose distribution is heterogeneous. A systematic study is needed to develop a risk model for heterogeneous dose distributions.","['Samei, Ehsan', 'Li, Xiang', 'Chen, Baiyu', 'Reiman, Robert']","['Samei E', 'Li X', 'Chen B', 'Reiman R']","['Carl E.

The factors and mechanisms providing this growth support for CLL cells are not fully understood. We found that plasma levels of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), a proinflammatory and immunoregulatory chemokine, were elevated in CLL patients. Therefore, we characterized the functional role of MIF in a CLL mouse model. For this purpose, we crossed Emu-TCL1 mice with MIF knockout (MIF-/-) mice. The resulting TCL1+/wtMIF/ mice showed a delayed onset of leukemia, reduced splenomegaly and hepatomegaly, and a longer survival than TCL1+/wtMIFwt/wt controls. Immunohistochemical examination of the lymphoid organs showed that the numbers of macrophages were significantly reduced in the spleen and bone marrow of TCL1+/wtMIF/ mice compared with TCL1+/wtMIFwt/wt controls. Mechanistic studies in vitro revealed that the absence of MIF rendered CLL cells more susceptible to apoptosis. Accordingly, incubation with an anti-MIF antibody reduced the survival of CLL cells on a macrophage feeder layer. In addition, the migratory activity of TCL1+/wtMIF/ macrophages was decreased compared with TCL1+/wtMIFwt/wt macrophages. Taken together, our results provide evidence that MIF supports the development of CLL by enhancing the interaction of CLL cells with macrophages. KEY POINTS: Targeted deletion of the gene for macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) delays development of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and prolongs survival in mice. MIF recruits leukemia-associated macrophages to spleen or liver.","['Reinart, Nina', 'Nguyen, Phuong-Hien', 'Boucas, Jorge', 'Rosen, Natascha', 'Kvasnicka, Hans-Michael', 'Heukamp, Lukas', 'Rudolph, Cornelia', 'Ristovska, Vangica', 'Velmans, Tanja', 'Mueller, Carolin', 'Reiners, Katrin S', 'von Strandmann, Elke Pogge', 'Krause, Gunter', 'Montesinos-Rongen, Manuel', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Herling, Marco', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Fingerle-Rowson, Gunter']","['Reinart N', 'Nguyen PH', 'Boucas J', 'Rosen N', 'Kvasnicka HM', 'Heukamp L', 'Rudolph C', 'Ristovska V', 'Velmans T', 'Mueller C', 'Reiners KS', 'von Strandmann EP', 'Krause G', 'Montesinos-Rongen M', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Herling M', 'Hallek M', 'Fingerle-Rowson G']","['Department I of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Cologne, and Center for Integrated Oncology Koln-Bonn, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121101,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2012/11/03 06:00,2013/03/21 06:00,['2012/11/03 06:00'],"['2012/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)43233-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-05-431452 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Jan 31;121(5):812-21. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-05-431452.

CD4+ T cells that express CD40 ligand (CD40L), along with other accessory immune and stromal cells within CLL lymph nodes, provide signals needed for activation and outgrowth of the tumor clone. Furthermore, correct positioning of CLL cells within lymphoid subcompartments is essential for the transmission of these supportive signals. Thereby, interstitial cell migration and adhesion events, influenced by activational stimuli, determine CLL cell localization. CD44 has been implicated in cell activation, migration, and tissue retention via binding to its extracellular matrix ligand hyaluronan (HA). In this study, we investigated the role of CD44-HA interactions for CLL positioning and interaction with supportive microenvironments in peripheral lymph nodes, focusing on its regulation via CD40L-dependent, T-cell-mediated activation of CLL cells. We found that hyaluronan triggered a robust CCL21-induced motility of resting CLL cells. However, CD40L stimulation promoted the firm, CD44-mediated adhesion of CLL cells to hyaluronan, antagonizing their motile behavior. N-linked glycosylations of CD44, particularly associated with the variant isoform CD44v6 after CD40L activation, seemed to facilitate hyaluronan recognition by CD44. We propose that the CD40L-CD40 signaling axis provides a stop signal to motile CLL cells within lymph node compartments by inducing high avidity CD44-HA adhesion. This might retain CLL cells close to T-cell stimuli and facilitate essential interactions with hyaluronan-bearing stromal cells, collectively promoting CLL cell proliferation and survival.","['Girbl, Tamara', 'Hinterseer, Elisabeth', 'Grossinger, Eva Melanie', 'Asslaber, Daniela', 'Oberascher, Karin', 'Weiss, Lukas', 'Hauser-Kronberger, Cornelia', 'Neureiter, Daniel', 'Kerschbaum, Hubert', 'Naor, David', 'Alon, Ronen', 'Greil, Richard', 'Hartmann, Tanja Nicole']","['Girbl T', 'Hinterseer E', 'Grossinger EM', 'Asslaber D', 'Oberascher K', 'Weiss L', 'Hauser-Kronberger C', 'Neureiter D', 'Kerschbaum H', 'Naor D', 'Alon R', 'Greil R', 'Hartmann TN']","['Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research, Third Medical Department with Hematology, Medical Oncology, Hemostaseology, Rheumatology and Infectiology, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121101,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,2012/11/03 06:00,2013/03/27 06:00,['2012/11/03 06:00'],"['2012/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-12-2749 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-2749 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2013 Jan 15;73(2):561-70. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-2749.

Although cisplatin (CDDP) has been used as a first-line therapy in patients with EAC, resistance remains a major clinical problem. The AXL receptor tyrosine kinase, originally isolated as a transforming gene from leukemia, is overexpressed in several solid tumors. Herein, we assessed AXL protein expression in human EACs and examined its role in CDDP resistance in human EAC cells. AXL overexpression was detected in more than 50% of tumors examined. Elevating AXL in nonoverexpressing cells doubled the CDDP IC(50) and increased cell survival three-fold, while attenuating AXL in overexpressing cells reduced survival two-fold. The effects of AXL modulation on cell survival were associated with changes in cellular and molecular markers of apoptosis. Mechanistic investigations revealed that AXL blocked CDDP-induced activation of endogenous p73beta (TP73), reducing its protein half-life, and inhibited CDDP-induced levels of p-c-ABL(Y412) and p-p73beta(Y99). These changes were associated with a disruption of c-ABL/p73beta protein interactions due to association with c-ABL in the cytoplasm, thereby blocking nuclear accumulation of c-ABL and phosphorylation of p73beta in response to DNA damage. Together, our results establish that AXL promotes CDDP resistance in esophageal adenocarcinoma and argue that therapeutic targeting of AXL may sensitize these cancers to DNA-damaging drugs.","['Hong, Jun', 'Peng, Dunfa', 'Chen, Zheng', 'Sehdev, Vikas', 'Belkhiri, Abbes']","['Hong J', 'Peng D', 'Chen Z', 'Sehdev V', 'Belkhiri A']","['Department of Surgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121101,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,PMC5907497,2012/11/03 06:00,2013/02/28 06:00,['2012/11/03 06:00'],"['2012/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/28 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-12-3151 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-3151 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2013 Jan 1;73(1):331-40. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-12-3151.

Determination of D2HG is of relevance to diagnosis and monitoring of disease. Standard detection methods of D2HG levels are liquid-chromatography-mass spectrometry or gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry. Here we present a rapid, inexpensive and sensitive enzymatic assay for the detection of D2HG levels. The assay is based on the conversion of D2HG to alpha-ketoglutarate (alphaKG) in the presence of the enzyme (D)-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (HGDH) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)). Determination of D2HG concentration is based on the detection of stoichiometrically generated NADH. The quantification limit of the enzymatic assay for D2HG in tumor tissue is 0.44 muM and in serum 2.77 muM. These limits enable detection of basal D2HG levels in human tumor tissues and serum without IDH mutations. Levels of D2HG in frozen and paraffin-embedded tumor tissues containing IDH mutations or in serum from acute myeloid leukemia patients with IDH mutations are significantly higher and can be easily identified with this assay.

Chromosomal content, however, is often not uniform throughout cell populations. Here we evaluated to what extent aCGH can detect DNA copy number alterations in heterogeneous cell populations. A systematic evaluation is currently lacking, despite its importance in diagnostics and research. The detection limits reported are a compound of analytical software and laboratory techniques and do not account for the number of probes in relation to sample homogeneity. METHODS: Detection limits were explored with DNA isolated from a patient with intellectual disability (ID) and from tumor cell line BT474. Both were diluted with increasing amounts of normal DNA to simulate different levels of cellularity. Samples were hybridized on microarrays containing 180,880 oligonucleotides evenly distributed over the genome (spacing ~17 kb). RESULTS: Single copy number alterations, represented by down to 249 probes (4 Mb) and present in 10 % of a cell population, could be detected.

DESIGN: This is a retrospective study of all patients with leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anemia, or myelofibrosis admitted to inpatient rehabilitation at a tertiary referral-based cancer center between January 1, 2005, and April 10, 2012. Items analyzed from patient records included return to the primary acute care service with demographic information, leukemia characteristics, medications, hospital admission characteristics, and laboratory values. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-five patients were admitted a total of 255 times. Ninety-three (37%) of the 255 leukemia inpatient rehabilitation admissions returned to the primary acute care service. Eighteen (19%) and 42 (45%) of the 93 patients died in the hospital and were discharged home, respectively. Statistically significant factors (P < 0.05) associated with return to the primary acute care service include peripheral blast percentage and the presence of an antifungal agent on the day of the inpatient rehabilitation transfer. Using additional two factors (platelet count and the presence of an antiviral agent, both P < 0.11), the Return to Primary-Leukemia Index was formulated. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with leukemia with the presence of circulating peripheral blasts and/or an antifungal agent may be at increased risk for return to the primary acute care service. The Return to Primary-Leukemia Index should be tested in prospective studies to determine its usefulness.","['Fu, Jack Brian', 'Lee, Jay', 'Smith, Dennis W', 'Bruera, Eduardo']","['Fu JB', 'Lee J', 'Smith DW', 'Bruera E']","['Department of Palliative Care and Rehabilitation Medicine, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Am J Phys Med Rehabil,American journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation,8803677,PMC3578167,2012/11/03 06:00,2013/04/10 06:00,['2012/11/03 06:00'],"['2012/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PHM.0b013e3182744151 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Phys Med Rehabil. 2013 Mar;92(3):215-22. doi: 10.1097/PHM.0b013e3182744151.,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/blood', 'Cancer Care Facilities', 'Female', 'Hospital Mortality', '*Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality/*rehabilitation', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Statistical', '*Patient Transfer', 'Platelet Count', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,,,,"['R01CA122292-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA122292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NR010162/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA124481-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01NR010162-01A1/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA124481/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS415057'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In 1998-2003, 2348 incident lymphoma cases and 2462 controls were recruited to the EPILYMPH case-control study in six European countries. A detailed occupational history was collected in cases and controls. Job modules were applied for farm work including specific questions on type of crop, farm size, pests being treated, type and schedule of pesticide use. In each study centre, industrial hygienists and occupational experts assessed exposure to specific groups of pesticides and individual compounds with the aid of agronomists. We calculated the OR and its 95% CI associated with lymphoma and the most prevalent lymphoma subtypes with unconditional logistic regression, adjusting for age, gender, education and centre. RESULTS: Risk of lymphoma overall, and B cell lymphoma was not elevated, and risk of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) was elevated amongst those ever exposed to inorganic (OR=1.6, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.5) and organic pesticides (OR=1.5, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.1). CLL risk was highest amongst those ever exposed to organophosphates (OR=2.7, 95% CI 1.2 to 6.0). Restricting the analysis to subjects most likely exposed, no association was observed between pesticide use and risk of B cell lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide limited support to the hypothesis of an increase in risk of specific lymphoma subtypes associated with exposure to pesticides.","['Cocco, Pierluigi', 'Satta, Giannina', 'Dubois, Stefania', 'Pili, Claudia', 'Pilleri, Michela', 'Zucca, Mariagrazia', ""'t Mannetje, Andrea Martine"", 'Becker, Nikolaus', 'Benavente, Yolanda', 'de Sanjose, Silvia', 'Foretova, Lenka', 'Staines, Anthony', 'Maynadie, Marc', 'Nieters, Alexandra', 'Brennan, Paul', 'Miligi, Lucia', 'Ennas, Maria Grazia', 'Boffetta, Paolo']","['Cocco P', 'Satta G', 'Dubois S', 'Pili C', 'Pilleri M', 'Zucca M', ""'t Mannetje AM"", 'Becker N', 'Benavente Y', 'de Sanjose S', 'Foretova L', 'Staines A', 'Maynadie M', 'Nieters A', 'Brennan P', 'Miligi L', 'Ennas MG', 'Boffetta P']","['Department of Public Health, Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Occupational Health Section, University of Cagliari, Monserrato, Italy. coccop@medicina.unica.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121101,England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,,2012/11/03 06:00,2013/03/12 06:00,['2012/11/03 06:00'],"['2012/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['oemed-2012-100845 [pii]', '10.1136/oemed-2012-100845 [doi]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2013 Feb;70(2):91-8. doi: 10.1136/oemed-2012-100845.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In total, 82 patients with CML who had been administered 400 mg IM daily for over 6 months were genotyped for 11 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in nine genes (CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, ABCB1, SLC22A1, SLC22A2 and ABCG2) using blood samples. The trough imatinib concentration and clinical responses were assessed 6 months after the initiation of IM therapy. RESULTS: The CC, CA and AA genotypes in ABCG2 421C>A gave significantly different frequencies for the major molecular response (MMR) (P = 0.02). However, no significant differences were found between the genotypes of the CYP enzymes and transporters identified in this study and the imatinib plasma trough concentrations and clinical response frequencies, except for the correlation of ABCG2 with MMR. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study may indicate that the ABCG 421C>A genetic polymorphism influences the MMR of imatinib in patients with CML.","['Seong, S J', 'Lim, M', 'Sohn, S K', 'Moon, J H', 'Oh, S-J', 'Kim, B S', 'Ryoo, H M', 'Chung, J S', 'Joo, Y D', 'Bang, S M', 'Jung, C W', 'Kim, D H', 'Park, S Y', 'Yoon, S S', 'Kim, I', 'Lee, H G', 'Won, J H', 'Min, Y H', 'Cheong, J W', 'Park, J S', 'Eom, K S', 'Hyun, M S', 'Kim, M K', 'Kim, H', 'Park, M R', 'Park, J', 'Kim, C S', 'Kim, H J', 'Kim, Y K', 'Park, E K', 'Zang, D Y', 'Jo, D Y', 'Lee, H W', 'Yoon, Y-R']","['Seong SJ', 'Lim M', 'Sohn SK', 'Moon JH', 'Oh SJ', 'Kim BS', 'Ryoo HM', 'Chung JS', 'Joo YD', 'Bang SM', 'Jung CW', 'Kim DH', 'Park SY', 'Yoon SS', 'Kim I', 'Lee HG', 'Won JH', 'Min YH', 'Cheong JW', 'Park JS', 'Eom KS', 'Hyun MS', 'Kim MK', 'Kim H', 'Park MR', 'Park J', 'Kim CS', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim YK', 'Park EK', 'Zang DY', 'Jo DY', 'Lee HW', 'Yoon YR']","['Department of Biomedical Science and Clinical Trial Center, Kyungpook National University Graduate School and Hospital, Daegu 700-721, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121031,England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,,2012/11/03 06:00,2013/07/31 06:00,['2012/11/03 06:00'],"['2012/11/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0923-7534(19)37151-0 [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mds532 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2013 Mar;24(3):756-60. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mds532.

Up-regulation of (HO-1) has contributed to tumorogenicity of some cancers. In this study we investigated the expression pattern of the HO-1, in five different human-derived cancer cell lines with high incidence in Iran. METHODS: Total cell RNA were extracted from HepG2 (hepato carcinoma), A549 (lung adenocarcinoma), MCF-7 (breast cancer), K562 (myeloid leukemia) and LS174T (colon cancer) cell lines. Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cell line was used as a control. cDNAs were synthesized and expression of HO-1 was examined using RT-PCR. RESULTS: The expression of HO-1 was not detected in the control cell line (HEK293), but it was observed to express following ultraviolet (UV) exposure indicating that HO-1 is not constantly expressed. The examined cancer cell lines constitutively expressed different variety of HO-1 on mRNA level. Strong expression of HO-1 was observed in HepG2, MCF-7 and A549 cells. A moderate expression of HO-1 was observed in K562 cells, and LS174T cells showed no expression of HO-1. CONCLUSION: Heme oxygenase-1 could be considered as a new marker in the diagnosis of some cancers, especially hepatomacarcinoma. Our results also suggest that up-regulation of HO-1 may contribute to tumorogenicity of some cancers. Therefore, the combination of gene-silencing effect of HO-1 and chemotherapy might be considered as a new modality for the treatment of cancers in which the expression HO-1 is up-regulated.","['Bahmani, Parisa', 'Hassanshahi, Golamhossein', 'Halabian, Raheleh', 'Roushandeh, Amaneh Mohammadi', 'Jahanian-Najafabadi, Ali', 'Roudkenar, Mehryar Habibi']","['Bahmani P', 'Hassanshahi G', 'Halabian R', 'Roushandeh AM', 'Jahanian-Najafabadi A', 'Roudkenar MH']","['Research Center, Iranian Blood Transfusion Organization, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Iran J Med Sci,Iranian journal of medical sciences,8104374,PMC3470283,2012/11/02 06:00,2012/11/02 06:01,['2012/11/02 06:00'],"['2011/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/27 00:00 [revised]', '2011/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/02 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Med Sci. 2011 Dec;36(4):260-5.,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['A549', 'Heme oxygenase-1', 'HepG2', 'K562', 'MCF7', 'cancer cells', 'gene expression']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied 176 patients, all enrolled on prospective treatment trials, for secondary chromosomal aberrations and mutations in N-/KRAS, KIT, FLT3, and JAK2 (V617F) genes. Most frequent chromosomal aberrations were trisomy 22 (18%) and trisomy 8 (16%). Overall, 84% of patients harbored at least 1 gene mutation, with RAS being affected in 53% (45% NRAS; 13% KRAS) of the cases, followed by KIT (37%) and FLT3 (17%; FLT3-TKD [14%], FLT3-ITD [5%]). None of the secondary genetic lesions influenced achievement of complete remission. In multivariable analyses, KIT mutation (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.67; P = .04], log(10)(WBC) (HR = 1.33; P = .02), and trisomy 22 (HR = 0.54; P = .08) were relevant factors for relapse-free survival; for overall survival, FLT3 mutation (HR = 2.56; P = .006), trisomy 22 (HR = 0.45; P = .07), trisomy 8 (HR = 2.26; P = .02), age (difference of 10 years, HR = 1.46; P = .01), and therapy-related AML (HR = 2.13; P = .14) revealed as prognostic factors. The adverse effects of KIT and FLT3 mutations were mainly attributed to exon 8 and tyrosine kinase domain mutations, respectively. Our large study emphasizes the impact of both secondary chromosomal aberrations as well as gene mutations for outcome in AML with inv(16)/t (16;16).","['Paschka, Peter', 'Du, Juan', 'Schlenk, Richard F', 'Gaidzik, Verena I', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Corbacioglu, Andrea', 'Spath, Daniela', 'Kayser, Sabine', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Krauter, Jurgen', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Kohne, Claus-Henning', 'Held, Gerhard', 'von Lilienfeld-Toal, Marie', 'Kirchen, Heinz', 'Rummel, Mathias', 'Gotze, Katharina', 'Horst, Heinz-August', 'Ringhoffer, Mark', 'Lubbert, Michael', 'Wattad, Mohammed', 'Salih, Helmut R', 'Kundgen, Andrea', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Dohner, Konstanze']","['Paschka P', 'Du J', 'Schlenk RF', 'Gaidzik VI', 'Bullinger L', 'Corbacioglu A', 'Spath D', 'Kayser S', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Krauter J', 'Ganser A', 'Kohne CH', 'Held G', 'von Lilienfeld-Toal M', 'Kirchen H', 'Rummel M', 'Gotze K', 'Horst HA', 'Ringhoffer M', 'Lubbert M', 'Wattad M', 'Salih HR', 'Kundgen A', 'Dohner H', 'Dohner K']","['Universitatsklinikum Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121031,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2012/11/02 06:00,2013/02/26 06:00,['2012/11/02 06:00'],"['2012/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47336-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-05-431486 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Jan 3;121(1):170-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-05-431486.

LSC activity was enriched but rare in the CD8+ CD4 HSA(hi) immature single-positive T-cell subset. Although our murine T-ALL model relies on transduction of HSCs, we were unable to isolate Notch-activated HSCs to test for LSC activity. Further analysis showed that Notch activation in HSCs caused an initial expansion of hematopoietic and T-cell progenitors and loss of stem cell quiescence, which was followed by progressive loss of long-term HSCs and T-cell production over several weeks. Similar results were obtained in a conditional transgenic model in which Notch activation is induced in HSCs by Cre recombinase. We conclude that although supraphysiologic Notch signaling in HSCs promotes LSC activity in T-cell progenitors, it extinguishes self-renewal of LT-HSCs. These results provide further evidence for therapeutically targeting T-cell progenitors in T-ALL while also underscoring the need to tightly regulate Notch signaling to expand normal HSC populations for clinical applications.","['Chiang, Mark Y', 'Shestova, Olga', 'Xu, Lanwei', 'Aster, Jon C', 'Pear, Warren S']","['Chiang MY', 'Shestova O', 'Xu L', 'Aster JC', 'Pear WS']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology and the University of Michigan Cancer Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. markchia@umich.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20121031,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC3567338,2012/11/02 06:00,2013/04/06 06:00,['2012/11/02 06:00'],"['2012/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)42141-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-03-416503 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Feb 7;121(6):905-17. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-03-416503.

SDS patients harbor biallelic mutations in the SBDS gene, resulting in low levels of SBDS protein. Data from nonhuman models demonstrate that the SBDS protein facilitates the release of eIF6, a factor that prevents ribosome joining. The complete abrogation of Sbds expression in these models results in severe cellular and lethal physiologic abnormalities that differ from the human disease phenotype. Because human SDS cells are characterized by partial rather than complete loss of SBDS expression, we interrogated SDS patient cells for defects in ribosomal assembly. SDS patient cells exhibit altered ribosomal profiles and impaired association of the 40S and 60S subunits. Introduction of a wild-type SBDS cDNA into SDS patient cells corrected the ribosomal association defect, while patient-derived SBDS point mutants only partially improved subunit association. Knockdown of eIF6 expression improved ribosomal subunit association but did not correct the hematopoietic defect of SBDS-deficient cells. In summary, we demonstrate an SBDS-dependent ribosome maturation defect in SDS patient cells. The role of ribosomal subunit joining in marrow failure warrants further investigation.","['Burwick, Nicholas', 'Coats, Scott A', 'Nakamura, Tomoka', 'Shimamura, Akiko']","['Burwick N', 'Coats SA', 'Nakamura T', 'Shimamura A']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121031,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC3537309,2012/11/02 06:00,2013/02/16 06:00,['2012/11/02 06:00'],"['2012/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47437-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-04-420166 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2012 Dec 20;120(26):5143-52. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-04-420166.

DATA SOURCES: Relevant literature was identified by a PubMed search (January 1970-March 2012) of English-language literature using the terms decitabine, acute myeloid leukemia, and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All published studies and abstracts, as well as relevant consensus guidelines, evaluating the current literature about the role of decitabine for the treatment of AML were included. DATA SYNTHESIS: Decitabine has been evaluated for the treatment of AML in several different settings. In patients with newly diagnosed AML who are not candidates for standard remission induction chemotherapy, a Phase 2 trial of decitabine administered for 5 days per cycle demonstrated a 24% complete remission rate (CR). A subsequent Phase 3 trial comparing decitabine and low-dose cytarabine or best supportive care in a similar patient population showed a greater CR rate (18% vs 8%; p = 0.001) but no overall survival benefit. A Phase 2 trial demonstrated a 47% CR rate with decitabine initially administered for 10 days per cycle, with subsequent doses customized to individual response and toxicity. This novel dosing schedule has yet to be evaluated in a Phase 3 trial. Decitabine is also being investigated for the treatment of relapsed/refractory AML and as bridge therapy to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Decitabine offers a promising alternative therapeutic option for patients with AML who are not candidates for standard remission induction chemotherapy. Because of its acceptable safety profile, research is investigating the clinical benefit of decitabine in combination with other antileukemic therapies. The potential roles of decitabine in the treatment of AML continue to be explored in numerous clinical trials.","['Ganetsky, Alex']",['Ganetsky A'],"['Pharmacy Department, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA. alex.ganetsky@uphs.upenn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20121031,United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,,2012/11/02 06:00,2013/04/20 06:00,['2012/11/02 06:00'],"['2012/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/20 06:00 [medline]']","['aph.1R151 [pii]', '10.1345/aph.1R151 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2012 Nov;46(11):1511-7. doi: 10.1345/aph.1R151.

The incidence and impact of FLT3 in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is unknown. We conducted a retrospective review to identify WHO MDS and CMML patients with FLT3 mutations at diagnosis. A total of 2,119 patients with MDS and 466 patients with CMML were evaluated at MD Anderson between 1997 and 2010. Of these, FLT3 mutation analysis was performed on 1,232 (58%) MDS and 302 (65%) CMML patients. FLT3 mutations were identified in 12 (0.95%) MDS patients: 9 (75%) had FLT3-ITD mutation and 3 had FLT3-tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutation. MDS patients with FLT3 mutations were younger (P = 0.02) and presented as RAEB (P = 0.03) more frequently. Median overall survival (OS) for FLT3-mutated MDS patients was 19.0 months versus 16.4 months for FLT3-nonmutated MDS patients (P = 0.08). FLT3 mutations were identified in 13 (4.3%) CMML patients: 8 had FLT3-ITD mutation and 5 had FLT3-TKD mutation. There were no significant differences in demographic and disease characteristics among CMML patients with and without FLT3 mutations. Median OS for FLT3-mutated CMML patients was 10.8 months versus 21.3 months for FLT3-nonmutated CMML patients (P = 0.12). FLT3 occurs in MDS and CMML at a lower frequency than AML and does not predict poor outcome.","['Daver, Naval', 'Strati, Paolo', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Luthra, Raja', 'Wang, Sa', 'Patel, Keyur', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Qin Dong, Xiao', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']","['Daver N', 'Strati P', 'Jabbour E', 'Kadia T', 'Luthra R', 'Wang S', 'Patel K', 'Ravandi F', 'Cortes J', 'Qin Dong X', 'Kantarjian H', 'Garcia-Manero G']","['Department of Leukemia and Hematopathology, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121031,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,PMC4085099,2012/11/02 06:00,2013/02/13 06:00,['2012/11/02 06:00'],"['2012/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23345 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2013 Jan;88(1):56-9. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23345.

The occurrence of AIHA was hereby investigated in a retrospective series of 585 CLL patients with available immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) gene status. AIHA occurred in 73 patients and was significantly associated with an IGHV unmutated (UM) status (P < 0.0001) and unfavorable [del(17)(p13) and del(11)(q23)] cytogenetic lesions (P < 0.0001).

Multivariate analysis showed that UM IGHV, del(17)(p13) and del(11)(q23), but not stereotyped subset #3, were the strongest independent variables associated with AIHA. Based on these findings, we generated a biological risk score for AIHA development according to the presence of none (low risk), one (intermediated risk), or two (high risk) of the independent risk factors. Overall, our data indicate that UM IGHV status and/or unfavorable cytogenetic lesions are associated with the risk of developing secondary AIHA in CLL patients and suggest a possible role of specific stereotyped B-cell receptor subsets in a proportion of cases.","['Maura, Francesco', 'Visco, Carlo', 'Falisi, Erika', 'Reda, Gianluigi', 'Fabris, Sonia', 'Agnelli, Luca', 'Tuana, Giacomo', 'Lionetti, Marta', 'Guercini, Nicola', 'Novella, Elisabetta', 'Nichele, Ilaria', 'Montaldi, Anna', 'Autore, Francesco', 'Gregorini, Anna', 'Barcellini, Wilma', 'Callea, Vincenzo', 'Mauro, Francesca R', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Foa, Robin', 'Neri, Antonino', 'Rodeghiero, Francesco', 'Cortelezzi, Agostino']","['Maura F', 'Visco C', 'Falisi E', 'Reda G', 'Fabris S', 'Agnelli L', 'Tuana G', 'Lionetti M', 'Guercini N', 'Novella E', 'Nichele I', 'Montaldi A', 'Autore F', 'Gregorini A', 'Barcellini W', 'Callea V', 'Mauro FR', 'Laurenti L', 'Foa R', 'Neri A', 'Rodeghiero F', 'Cortelezzi A']","['Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health, University of Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121031,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,2012/11/02 06:00,2013/02/13 06:00,['2012/11/02 06:00'],"['2012/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23342 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2013 Jan;88(1):32-6. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23342.

While the cell of origin and etiology are still unknown, significant scientific progress has revealed numerous molecular targets for novel therapeutic interventions. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K) regulate key cellular functions, including growth, survival and migration, by integrating and transmitting signals from diverse surface molecules including the B-cell receptor (BCR). In lymphocytes, the PI3Kdelta isoform plays a critical role in B-cell homeostasis and function. In CLL, the PI3K pathway is constitutively active and dependent on PI3Kdelta. GS-1101 is a highly selective PI3Kdelta inhibitor that in CLL patients causes a rapid and sustained reduction in lymphadenopathy, accompanied by transient lymphocytosis. This article will review new insights into the pathophysiology of CLL, the preclinical rationale of a PI3Kdelta inhibitor in CLL, and the clinical evidence supporting this first-in-class therapeutic target for CLL patients.","['Macias-Perez, Ines M', 'Flinn, Ian W']","['Macias-Perez IM', 'Flinn IW']","['Hematologic Malignancies Research, Sarah Cannon Research Institute, 3322 West End Avenue, Suite 900, Nashville, TN 37203, USA. imaciasperez@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,,2012/11/02 06:00,2013/07/17 06:00,['2012/11/02 06:00'],"['2012/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11899-012-0142-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2013 Mar;8(1):22-7. doi: 10.1007/s11899-012-0142-1.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', 'YG57I8T5M0 (idelalisib)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/physiopathology', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Purines/*therapeutic use', 'Quinazolinones/*therapeutic use']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our published results revealed that thermal transition (95 +/- 5 degrees C) in differential scanning calorimetry profiles appear to be characteristic for the advanced stage of CLL. Moreover, a decrease/loss of this transition in nuclei from leukemic cells exposed to drugs ex vivo could indicate their diverse efficacy. It seems that the lack of changes in thermal profile could predict patient's drug resistance. In this study, we demonstrate the results obtained after drug treatment of leukemic cells by calorimetry, apoptosis-related parameters involved in expression of genes using cDNA microarray and western blot. These data were compared with the patients' clinical parameters before and after RCC therapy (rituximab + cladribine + cyclophosphamide). The complementary analysis of studied cases with opposite clinical response (CR or NR) revealed a strong relationship between clinical data, differences in thermal scans and apoptosis-related gene expression. We quantified expression of eight of apoptosis-related 89 genes, i.e., NOXA, PUMA, APAF1, ESRRBL1, CASP3, BCL2, BCL2A1 and MCL1. Particular differences in NOXA and BCL2 expression were revealed. NOXA expression in cells of patients who achieved a complete response to RCC therapy was 0.44 times higher in comparison to control ones. Interestingly, in the case of patients who did not respond to immunotherapy, NOXA expression was highly downregulated (RQ = 4.39) as compared with untreated cells. These results were confirmed by distinct cell viability, protein expression as well as by differences in calorimetry profiles.","['Rogalinska, Malgorzata', 'Franiak-Pietryga, Ida', 'Blonski, Jerzy Z', 'Goralski, Pawel', 'Maciejewski, Henryk', 'Janus, Agnieszka', 'Robak, Pawel', 'Mirowski, Marek', 'Piekarski, Henryk', 'Robak, Tadeusz', 'Kilianska, Zofia M']","['Rogalinska M', 'Franiak-Pietryga I', 'Blonski JZ', 'Goralski P', 'Maciejewski H', 'Janus A', 'Robak P', 'Mirowski M', 'Piekarski H', 'Robak T', 'Kilianska ZM']","['Department of Cytobiochemistry, University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121031,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,PMC3566054,2012/11/02 06:00,2013/06/19 06:00,['2012/11/02 06:00'],"['2012/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['22623 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.22623 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2013 Jan;14(1):6-12. doi: 10.4161/cbt.22623.

Variations in these single nucleotide polymorphisms influence the risk of specific disease subtypes, and also possess race- and sex-differences in leukemia incidence. Further elucidation of the mechanisms through which ARID5B variants are involved in C-ALL not only has a great diagnostic value, but also a guidance for the clinical therapy, ultimately improving the prognosis of disease. Therefore, the related studies of ARID5B with C-ALL were summarized briefly in this review.","['Qian, Xi-Feng', 'Yang, Guo-Hua', 'Yin, Chen-Yu', 'Chen, Xiang', 'Shen, Yun-Feng']","['Qian XF', 'Yang GH', 'Yin CY', 'Chen X', 'Shen YF']","['Department of Hematology, Nanjing Medical University, Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, China. qxf5828@sina.com']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,2012/11/02 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2012/11/02 06:00'],"['2012/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2012)05-1280-04 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2012 Oct;20(5):1280-3.,"['0 (ARID5B protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,,"['Child', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For such classification, where the sample size is usually much smaller than the number of genes, it is essential to construct properly sparse models for accurately predicting tumor types to avoid over-fitting. Bayesian shrinkage estimation is considered a suitable method for providing such sparse models, effectively shrinking estimates of the effects for many irrelevant genes to zero while maintaining those of a small number of relevant genes at significant magnitudes. However, Bayesian analysis usually requires time-consuming computational techniques such as computationally intensive MCMC iterations. This paper describes a computationally effective method of Bayesian shrinkage regression (BSR) incorporating multiple hierarchical structures for constructing a classification model for tumor types using microarray gene expression data. We use a variational approximation method which provides simple approximations of posterior distributions of parameters to reduce computational burden in the Bayesian estimation. This computationally efficient BSR procedure yields a properly sparse model for accurately and rapidly classifying tumor samples. The accuracy of tumor classification is shown to be at least equivalent to that of other methods such as support vector machine and partial least squares using simulated and actual gene expression data sets.","['Hayashi, Takeshi']",['Hayashi T'],['National Agricultural Research Center.'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121030,Germany,Stat Appl Genet Mol Biol,Statistical applications in genetics and molecular biology,101176023,,2012/11/02 06:00,2013/03/30 06:00,['2012/11/02 06:00'],"['2012/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1515/1544-6115.1700 [doi]', '/j/sagmb.2012.11.issue-5/1544-6115.1700/1544-6115.1700.xml [pii]']",epublish,Stat Appl Genet Mol Biol. 2012 Oct 30;11(5):Article 9. doi: 10.1515/1544-6115.1700.,,IM,,"['Algorithms', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Colonic Neoplasms/classification/genetics', 'Computer Simulation', 'Databases, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/genetics', '*Models, Statistical', 'Neoplasms/*classification/*genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since efficient empirical antibiotic treatment depends on relevant knowledge of the bacterial panorama, the aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of bacteremia, the bacterial spectrum, and the resistance patterns of the isolates in this group today. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, routine blood cultures from febrile episodes occurring in adult patients with hematological disorders and neutropenia presenting to Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden during a 24-month period, were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 142 febrile neutropenic episodes occurring in 124 hematological patients were included in the study. Bacteremia was documented in 27% of the episodes, and of these, 58% were due to Gram-positive pathogens. The most common isolates were viridans streptococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Escherichia coli. Low levels of antibiotic resistance were detected. The underlying diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) was independently negatively associated with documented bacteremia (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of bacteremia and the bacterial spectrum were consistent with recent Scandinavian reports. Substantially lower levels of antimicrobial resistance were registered compared to those found in other European centers. Patients with NHL were less likely to have documented bacteremia in this study.","['Aust, Carl', 'Tolfvenstam, Thomas', 'Broliden, Kristina', 'Ljungman, Per', 'Kalin, Mats', 'Giske, Christian G', 'Ohrmalm, Lars']","['Aust C', 'Tolfvenstam T', 'Broliden K', 'Ljungman P', 'Kalin M', 'Giske CG', 'Ohrmalm L']","['Department of Medicine, Solna, Infectious Disease Unit, Center for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. carl.aust@stud.ki.se']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121031,England,Scand J Infect Dis,Scandinavian journal of infectious diseases,0215333,,2012/11/02 06:00,2014/02/05 06:00,['2012/11/02 06:00'],"['2012/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/00365548.2012.735372 [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Infect Dis. 2013 Apr;45(4):285-91. doi: 10.3109/00365548.2012.735372.

RNase-L activity requires binding of the small molecule 2-5A, leading to RNase-L dimerization and cleavage of single-stranded RNA. RNase-L expression is controlled post-transcriptionally by its 3'-untranslated region (3' UTR), which exerts a strong negative effect on RNase-L levels. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs that repress expression of target genes by binding to regions of complementarity often in the 3' UTR. The miR-29 family acts as a tumor suppressor in several cancers, including acute and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and has many oncogenic targets. We report that the miR-29 family represses RNase-L protein expression across several cell types. Using a luciferase reporter, we showed that miR-29 acts via 4 target sites within the RNASEL 3' UTR. Mutation of all sites is required for abrogation of miR-29 repression. In light of the reported tumor suppressive role of miR-29 in K562 CML cells and miR-29 repression of RNase-L in these cells, we generated K562 cells with stable RNase-L knockdown and demonstrated that loss of RNase-L inhibits proliferation in vitro as well as tumor growth in a xenograft model. Our findings identify a previously unknown miRNA regulator of RNase-L expression and support a novel oncogenic role for RNase-L in CML and potentially other hematopoietic malignancies.","['Lee, Teresa Y', 'Ezelle, Heather J', 'Venkataraman, Thiagarajan', 'Lapidus, Rena G', 'Scheibner, Kara A', 'Hassel, Bret A']","['Lee TY', 'Ezelle HJ', 'Venkataraman T', 'Lapidus RG', 'Scheibner KA', 'Hassel BA']","['Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20121031,United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,PMC3539258,2012/11/02 06:00,2013/06/06 06:00,['2012/11/02 06:00'],"['2012/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/jir.2012.0062 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 2013 Jan;33(1):34-42. doi: 10.1089/jir.2012.0062.

While 2-yr disease-free survival (DFS) of patients who transformed to acute myeloid leukemia (n = 12) was 25%, that of the remaining patients with MDS according to response to HMA was 73.1%, 68.1%, 50.0%, and 20.8% in G-COR (group of continuous response, n = 19), G-NoC (group of no change, n = 15), G-LOR (group of loss of response, n = 6), and G-DP (group of disease progression, n = 4), respectively. When dichotomized as G-COR/G-NoC versus G-LOR/G-DP, significantly different 2-yr DFS (71.0% vs. 33.3%; P = 0.004) and relapse (14.1% vs. 46.7%; P = 0.016) were demonstrated. On multivariate analysis, G-LOR/G-DP [hazard ratio (HR), 3.91; P = 0.008] and poor karyotype at transplantation (HR, 2.69; P = 0.017) were the significant predictors for poor DFS, as G-LOR/G-DP was for relapse (HR, 6.28; P = 0.011). DFS was significantly poor in patients with any of the two predictors in all MDS (81.5% vs. 34.9%; P = 0.001) or higher-risk MDS (HrMDS) at the time of HMA (80.7% vs. 29.2%; P = 0.005). G-COR showed a trend of better DFS compared with G-NoC among HrMDS (74.6% vs. 36.5%; P = 0.090).

The relationship between microRNAs (miRNAs) and cancer development attracted more and more attention over the last few years. Members of the miRNA-29 family, including miRNA-29a, miRNA-29b, and miRNA-29c were shown to participate in the development of rhabdomyosarcoma and hepatocarcinogenesis. Here, it has been demonstrated miRNA-29a and miRNA-29b expression levels to be downregulated in most of the osteosarcoma tissues (23 from 30). Besides, miRNA-29a displayed ability to induce apoptosis in both U2OS and SAOS-2 osteoblastic cells. While miRNA-29 members induced apoptosis through p53 gene activation, the effect of miRNA-29a on osteoblastic cells was independent on p53 expression level. Moreover, Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 were earlier demonstrated to be the direct targets of miRNA-29 in many types of cancer tissues and cancers. In both U2OS and SAOS-2 osteoblastic cell types, overexpression of miRNA-29a also downregulated Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, while silencing of miRNA-29a increased their expression. In addition, enhanced expression of miRNA-29a increased the expression of two tumor suppressor genes, E2F1 and E2F3. In summary, data obtained highlight the role of miRNA-29a in the regulation of osteoblastic cell apoptosis by silencing Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 and inducing E2F1 and E2F3 expression.","['Zhang, W', 'Qian, J-X', 'Yi, H-L', 'Yang, Z-D', 'Wang, C-F', 'Chen, J-Y', 'Wei, X-Z', 'Fu, Q', 'Ma, H']","['Zhang W', 'Qian JX', 'Yi HL', 'Yang ZD', 'Wang CF', 'Chen JY', 'Wei XZ', 'Fu Q', 'Ma H']","['Department of Orthopedics, the No. 401 Hospital ofPLA, 22 Minjiang Road, Qingdao, Shandong, 266071, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Russia (Federation),Mol Biol (Mosk),Molekuliarnaia biologiia,0105454,,2012/11/02 06:00,2013/02/16 06:00,['2012/11/02 06:00'],"['2012/11/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/16 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Mol Biol (Mosk). 2012 Jul-Aug;46(4):622-7.,"['0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2F1 protein, human)', '0 (E2F3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2F3 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN29a microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Bone Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology/physiopathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Disease Progression', 'Down-Regulation', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'E2F3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, p53/genetics', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Osteoblasts/*metabolism/pathology', 'Osteosarcoma/*genetics/pathology/physiopathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Transgenes/genetics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Sixty two children newly diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia were treated with chemotherapy and followed up for 2 years or until death. Twenty apparently healthy volunteers with matched age and sex were taken as control. Survivin protein was measured by quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay and total human p53 was measured by Flow cytometry in peripheral blood at diagnosis and at complete remission. RESULTS: A highly significant elevation (P<0.0001) was found in survivin protein and total p53 levels in acute lymphoblastic leukemia children patients at diagnosis compared to controls. At complete remission a significant decrease of the two indices were found in ALL patients compared to those at diagnosis (P<0.0001). Survivin protein and total p53 was significantly higher in non-survived compared to survived group (P<0.0001 & P=0.016, respectively). A positive correlation was found between survivin level and total human p53 level in children with ALL (r=0.501 & P<0.0001).

The histone-modifying enzyme G9a/KMT1C can act both as a coactivator and a corepressor of transcription. Here, we show that the dual function of G9a as a coactivator vs. a corepressor entails its association within two distinct protein complexes, one containing the coactivator Mediator and one containing the corepressor Jarid1a/KDM5A. Functionally, G9a is important in stabilizing the Mediator complex for gene activation, whereas its repressive function entails a coordinate action with the histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) demethylase Jarid1a for the maintenance of gene repression. The essential nature of cross-talk between the histone methyltransferase G9a and the demethylase Jarid1a is demonstrated on the embryonic E(y)-globin gene, where the concurrent introduction of repressive histone marks (dimethylated H3K9 and dimethylated H3K27) and removal of activating histone mark (trimethylated H3K4) is required for maintenance of gene silencing. Taken together with our previous demonstration of cross-talk between UTX and MLL2 to mediate activation of the adult beta(maj)-globin gene, these data suggest a model where ""active"" and ""repressive"" cross-talk between histone-modifying enzymes coexist on the same multigene locus and play a crucial role in the precise control of developmentally regulated gene expression.","['Chaturvedi, Chandra-Prakash', 'Somasundaram, Brinda', 'Singh, Kulwant', 'Carpenedo, Richard L', 'Stanford, William L', 'Dilworth, F Jeffrey', 'Brand, Marjorie']","['Chaturvedi CP', 'Somasundaram B', 'Singh K', 'Carpenedo RL', 'Stanford WL', 'Dilworth FJ', 'Brand M']","['The Sprott Center for Stem Cell Research, Regenerative Medicine Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, ON, Canada K1H 8L6.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121029,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,PMC3503177,2012/11/01 06:00,2013/02/05 06:00,['2012/11/01 06:00'],"['2012/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['1213951109 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1213951109 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Nov 13;109(46):18845-50. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1213951109.

Pharmaceutical agents that suppress IFN-alpha production by pDCs are instrumental in elucidating the mechanisms behind IFN-alpha production, and in developing novel therapies for inflammatory disorders that involve pDCs. Here, we show that a tyrosine kinase inhibitor for chronic myeloid leukemia with multiple targets, dasatinib, strongly suppresses production of IFN-alpha and proinflammatory cytokines by human pDCs stimulated with multimeric CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-A) without reducing viability. In contrast, other tyrosine kinase inhibitors, imatinib, and nilotinib, did not suppress the cytokine production at clinically relevant concentrations. Inhibitors of SRC family kinases (SFKs), which are prominent targets of dasatinib, also suppressed the cytokine production. Notably, however, dasatinib, but not SFK inhibitors, abrogated prolonged localization of CpG-A in early endosomes, which is a critical step for pDCs to produce a large amount of IFN-alpha. This study suggests that dasatinib suppresses IFN-alpha production by pDCs by inhibiting SFK-dependent pathways and SFK-independent endosomal retention of CpG DNA. Kinases controlling the distinctive endosomal trafficking in pDCs may be exploited as targets to develop novel therapies for pDC-related inflammatory disorders.","['Fujita, Haruyuki', 'Kitawaki, Toshio', 'Sato, Takayuki', 'Maeda, Takahiro', 'Kamihira, Shimeru', 'Takaori-Kondo, Akifumi', 'Kadowaki, Norimitsu']","['Fujita H', 'Kitawaki T', 'Sato T', 'Maeda T', 'Kamihira S', 'Takaori-Kondo A', 'Kadowaki N']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121206,Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,,2012/11/01 06:00,2013/04/09 06:00,['2012/11/01 06:00'],"['2012/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/21 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/eji.201242699 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2013 Jan;43(1):93-103. doi: 10.1002/eji.201242699.

Several members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family can contribute to changes in [Ca(2+)](in); however, the properties and expression levels of these channels in human lymphocytes continue to be elusive. Here, we established and compared the expression of the most Ca(2+)-selective members of the TRPs, Ca(2+) channels transient receptor potential vanilloid 5 and 6 (TRPV5 and TRPV6), in human blood lymphocytes (HBLs) and leukemia Jurkat T cells. We found that TRPV6 and TRPV5 mRNAs are expressed in both Jurkat cells and quiescent HBLs; however, the levels of mRNAs were significantly higher in malignant cells than in quiescent lymphocytes. Western blot analysis showed TRPV5/V6 proteins in Jurkat T cells and TRPV5 protein in quiescent HBLs. However, the expression of TRPV6 protein was switched off in quiescent HBLs and turned on after mitogen stimulation of the cells with phytohemagglutinin. Inwardly directed monovalent currents that displayed characteristics of TRPV5/V6 currents were recorded in both Jurkat cells and normal HBLs. In outside-out patch-clamp studies, currents were reduced by ruthenium red, a nonspecific inhibitor of TRPV5/V6 channels. In addition, ruthenium red downregulated cell-cycle progression in both activated HBLs and Jurkat cells. Thus, we identified TRPV5 and TRPV6 calcium channels, which can be considered new candidates for Ca(2+) entry into human lymphocytes. The correlation between expression of TRPV6 channels and the proliferative status of lymphocytes suggests that TRPV6 may be involved in the physiological and/or pathological proliferation of lymphocytes.","['Vassilieva, Irina O', 'Tomilin, Victor N', 'Marakhova, Irina I', 'Shatrova, Alla N', 'Negulyaev, Yuri A', 'Semenova, Svetlana B']","['Vassilieva IO', 'Tomilin VN', 'Marakhova II', 'Shatrova AN', 'Negulyaev YA', 'Semenova SB']","['Institute of Cytology, Russian Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg, 4 Tikhoretsky Ave., St. Petersburg 194064, Russia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121101,United States,J Membr Biol,The Journal of membrane biology,0211301,,2012/11/01 06:00,2013/08/09 06:00,['2012/11/01 06:00'],"['2012/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/08/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00232-012-9511-x [doi]'],ppublish,J Membr Biol. 2013 Feb;246(2):131-40. doi: 10.1007/s00232-012-9511-x.

However, the mechanism how TSN induces apoptosis remains poorly understood. In this study, we examined the effects of TSN on the growth, cell cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis and the involved signaling pathway in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. Proliferation of HL-60 cells was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner with the IC(50 (48 h)) of 28 ng/mL. The growth inhibition was due primarily to the S phase arrest and cell apoptosis. Cell apoptosis induced by TSN was confirmed by Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide staining.

We report a case of concurrent invasive lobular and papillary carcinoma, the latter with extensive nodal involvement. Multiplex screening for activating point mutations identified different point mutations in the distinct morphologic components: lobular PIK3CA H1047R, papillary; PIK3CA Q546P, and IDH1 R132H. These molecular data favor coincidental ""collision tumors"" over clonal evolution.

Samples from both the peripheral blood and the bone marrow were analyzed at diagnosis and during follow-up. A strong correlation was observed between WT1 normalized with 2 different control genes (beta-actin and ABL1, P<0.001). WT1 mRNA level at diagnosis was of no prognostic relevance (P>0.05). A>/=1-log reduction in WT1 expression in bone marrow samples taken <1 month after diagnosis significantly correlated with an improved overall survival (P=0.004) and freedom from relapse (P=0.010) when beta-actin was used as control gene. Furthermore, a reduction in WT1 expression by >/=2 logs in peripheral blood samples taken at a later time point significantly correlated with a better outcome for overall survival (P=0.004) and freedom from relapse (P=0.012).

In this pooled analysis, we examined the risk of five LH cancers relative to lower levels of benzene exposure in petroleum workers. METHODS: We updated three nested case-control studies from Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom with new incident LH cancers among petroleum distribution workers through December 31, 2006, and pooled 370 potential case subjects and 1587 matched LH cancer-free control subjects. Quantitative benzene exposure in parts per million (ppm) was blindly reconstructed using historical monitoring data, and exposure certainty was scored as high, medium, or low. Two hematopathologists assigned diagnoses and scored the certainty of diagnosis as high, medium, or low. Dose-response relationships were examined for five LH cancers, including the three most common leukemia cell-types (AML, chronic myeloid leukemia [CML], and chronic lymphoid leukemia [CLL]) and two myeloid tumors (myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS] and myeloproliferative disease [MPD]). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using conditional logistic regression, controlling for age, sex, and time period. RESULTS: Cumulative benzene exposure showed a monotonic dose-response relationship with MDS (highest vs lowest tertile, >2.93 vs </=0.348 ppm-years, OR = 4.33, 95% CI = 1.31 to 14.3). For peak benezene exposures (>3 ppm), the risk of MDS was increased in high and medium certainty diagnoses (peak exposure vs no peak exposure, OR = 6.32, 95% CI = 1.32 to 30.2) and in workers having the highest exposure certainty (peak exposure vs no peak exposure, OR = 5.74, 95% CI = 1.05 to 31.2). There was little evidence of dose-response relationships for AML, CLL, CML, or MPD. CONCLUSIONS: Relatively low-level exposure to benzene experienced by petroleum distribution workers was associated with an increased risk of MDS, but not AML, suggesting that MDS may be the more relevant health risk for lower exposures.","['Schnatter, A Robert', 'Glass, Deborah C', 'Tang, Gong', 'Irons, Richard D', 'Rushton, Lesley']","['Schnatter AR', 'Glass DC', 'Tang G', 'Irons RD', 'Rushton L']","['Occupational and Public Health Division, ExxonMobil Biomedical Sciences, Inc, 1545 US Highway 22 East, Annandale, NJ 08801-3059, USA. a.r.schnatter@exxonmobil.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121030,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,PMC3502195,2012/11/01 06:00,2013/01/15 06:00,['2012/11/01 06:00'],"['2012/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['djs411 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djs411 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2012 Nov 21;104(22):1724-37. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djs411.

The 5-year overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), and failure-free survival (FFS) rates for patients with vPh at diagnosis were 77.8%, 75.0%, and 53.3%, respectively; for patients with ACA at diagnosis, 100%, 66.3%, and 52.1%, respectively; and for patients with a standard Ph, 96.0%, 91.3%, and 83.7%, respectively. During IM therapy, eight patients developed an OCA, which had no impact on outcomes as a time-dependent covariate in our Cox proportional hazards regression models. This study showed that vPh was associated with poor OS and FFS and that ACA had adverse effects on EFS and FFS.

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) inhibitors have been reported to possess anticancer activity through different mechanisms. However, whether HDACs inhibitors suppress JAK2/STAT signaling in MPNs is still unknown. In this study, we show that the HDAC inhibitor sodium butyrate (SB) inhibited JAK2/STAT signaling and increased the expression of suppressors of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) and SOCS3, both of which are the potent feedback inhibitors of JAK2/STAT signaling. SB upregulated the expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 by triggering the promoter-associated histone acetylation of SOCS1 and SOCS3 in K562 and HEL cell lines. Importantly, we found that upon knockdown of each class I HDACs, only knockdown of HDAC8 resulted in the increased expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3. Moreover, overexpression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 significantly inhibited cell growth and suppressed JAK2/STAT signaling in K562 and HEL cells. Furthermore, SB increased the transcript levels of SOCS1 and SOCS3 and inhibited the clonogenic activity of hematopoietic progenitors from patients with MPNs.

Exposure has generally been self-reported, so the assessment is potentially limited by recall bias and lack of information on specific chemicals. OBJECTIVES: As part of an integrated assessment of residential pesticide exposure, we identified active ingredients and described patterns of storage and use. METHODS: During a home interview of 500 residentially stable households enrolled in the Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study during 2001-2006, trained interviewers inventoried residential pesticide products and queried participants about their storage and use. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency registration numbers, recorded from pesticide product labels, and pesticide chemical codes were matched to public databases to obtain information on active ingredients and chemical class. Poisson regression was used to identify independent predictors of pesticide storage. Analyses were restricted to 259 participating control households. RESULTS: Ninety-five percent (246 of 259) of the control households stored at least one pesticide product (median, 4). Indicators of higher sociodemographic status predicted more products in storage. We identified the most common characteristics: storage areas (garage, 40%; kitchen, 20%), pests treated (ants, 33%; weeds, 20%), pesticide types (insecticides, 46%; herbicides, 24%), chemical classes (pyrethroids, 77%; botanicals, 50%), active ingredients (pyrethrins, 43%) and synergists (piperonyl butoxide, 42%). Products could contain multiple active ingredients. CONCLUSIONS: Our data on specific active ingredients and patterns of storage and use will inform future etiologic analyses of residential pesticide exposures from self-reported data, particularly among households with young children.","['Guha, Neela', 'Ward, Mary H', 'Gunier, Robert', 'Colt, Joanne S', 'Lea, C Suzanne', 'Buffler, Patricia A', 'Metayer, Catherine']","['Guha N', 'Ward MH', 'Gunier R', 'Colt JS', 'Lea CS', 'Buffler PA', 'Metayer C']","['School of Public Health, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20121024,United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,PMC3569677,2012/11/01 06:00,2013/07/09 06:00,['2012/11/01 06:00'],"['2012/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1289/ehp.1204926 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2013 Feb;121(2):276-82. doi: 10.1289/ehp.1204926.

It has been proposed that the pain interference factor can be further broken down into unique factors of affective (e.g., mood) and activity (e.g., work) interference. The purpose of this analysis was to confirm this affective/activity interference dichotomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective confirmatory factor analysis was completed for a sample of 184 individuals diagnosed with castrate-resistant prostate cancer (age 40-86, mean = 65.46, 77% White non-Hispanic) who had been administered the BPI as part of Cancer and Leukemia Group B trial 9480. A one-factor model was compared against two-factor and three-factor models that were developed based on the design of the instrument. RESULTS: Root mean squared error of approximation (0.075), comparative fit index (0.971), and change in chi-square, given the corresponding change in degrees of freedom (13.33, P < 0.05) values for the three-factor model (i.e., pain intensity, activity interference, and affective interference), were statistically superior in comparison with the one- and two-factor models. This three-factor structure was found to be invariant across age, mean prostate-specific antigen, and hemoglobin levels. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that the BPI can be used to quantify the degree to which pain separately interferes with affective and activity aspects of a patient's everyday life. These findings will provide clinical trialists, pharmaceutical sponsors, and regulators with confidence in the flexibility of the BPI as they consider the use of this instrument to assist with understanding the patient experience as it relates to treatment.","['Atkinson, Thomas M', 'Halabi, Susan', 'Bennett, Antonia V', 'Rogak, Lauren', 'Sit, Laura', 'Li, Yuelin', 'Kaplan, Ellen', 'Basch, Ethan']","['Atkinson TM', 'Halabi S', 'Bennett AV', 'Rogak L', 'Sit L', 'Li Y', 'Kaplan E', 'Basch E']","['Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 641 Lexington Ave., 7th Floor, New York, NY 10022, USA. atkinsot@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20121030,England,Pain Med,"Pain medicine (Malden, Mass.)",100894201,PMC3796944,2012/11/01 06:00,2013/05/04 06:00,['2012/11/01 06:00'],"['2012/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1526-4637.2012.01498.x [doi]'],ppublish,Pain Med. 2012 Nov;13(11):1417-24. doi: 10.1111/j.1526-4637.2012.01498.x.

We investigated whether MCL has multiple subclones as identified in ATLL by high-resolution oligo-array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Eleven of 20 (55%) evaluable MCL cases had a log2 ratio imbalance, suggesting the existence of multiple subclones in MCL. Based on the proportion of every subclone relative to the main clone, we were able to speculate clonal evolution in each MCL case with multiple subclones. Our analysis gave new insights into the clonal heterogeneity quantitatively and accurately. Furthermore, genomic copy number alterations are not hierarchical events and not necessarily the initial or later events for cells to become MCL.","['Liu, Fang', 'Yoshida, Noriaki', 'Suguro, Miyuki', 'Kato, Harumi', 'Karube, Kennosuke', 'Arita, Kotaro', 'Yamamoto, Kiyoko', 'Tsuzuki, Shinobu', 'Oshima, Koichi', 'Seto, Masao']","['Liu F', 'Yoshida N', 'Suguro M', 'Kato H', 'Karube K', 'Arita K', 'Yamamoto K', 'Tsuzuki S', 'Oshima K', 'Seto M']","['Division of Molecular Medicine, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,2012/11/01 06:00,2013/02/07 06:00,['2012/11/01 06:00'],"['2012/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12030 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2013 Jan;90(1):51-8. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12030.,,IM,,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Female', '*Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",,,,['(c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumors also develop resistance to such drugs due to heterogeneity of cell types and clonal selection. Several traditional dietary ingredients from plants, on the other hand, have been shown to act on multiple targets/pathways, and may overcome drug resistance. The dietary agents are safe and readily available. However, application of plant components for cancer treatment/prevention requires better understanding of anticancer functions and elucidation of their mechanisms of action. The current study focuses on the anticancer properties of fenugreek, a herb with proven anti-diabetic, antitumor and immune-stimulating functions. METHOD: Jurkat cells were incubated with 30 to 1500 mug/mL concentrations of 50% ethanolic extract of dry fenugreek seeds and were followed for changes in viability (trypan blue assay), morphology (microscopic examination) and autophagic marker LC3 transcript level (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Incubation of Jurkat cells with fenugreek extract at concentrations ranging from 30 to 1500 mug/mL for up to 3 days resulted in cell death in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Jurkat cell death was preceded by the appearance of multiple large vacuoles, which coincided with transcriptional up-regulation of LC3. GC-MS analysis of fenugreek extract indicated the presence of several compounds with anticancer properties, including gingerol (4.82%), cedrene (2.91%), zingerone (16.5%), vanillin (1.52%) and eugenol (1.25%). CONCLUSIONS: Distinct morphological changes involving appearance of large vacuoles, membrane disintegration and increased expression of LC3 transcripts indicated that fenugreek extract induced autophagy and autophagy-associated death of Jurkat cells.

Mutant TP53 protein typically accumulates to high levels and has been reported to have transcriptional regulatory activity distinct from that of wild-type TP53. To investigate whether such an effect is relevant to CLL, carefully balanced primary CLL samples with or without TP53 mutation/deletion were compared for their gene expression profiles using high-density DNA microarrays. Ninety-six and eight differentially expressed genes were identified, respectively, using two alternative statistical approaches with different stringencies. None of the differentially expressed genes were known to be regulated by mutant TP53, and only four of the 67 under-expressed genes were known transcriptional targets of wild-type TP53. Significantly, both approaches showed that gene under-expression was the dominant feature of TP53-mutant CLL samples. Furthermore, a disproportionate number of the under-expressed genes were located on chromosome 17p, the most significant being TP53 itself. Together, these results indicate that any transcriptional regulatory effects of mutant TP53 in CLL cells are overshadowed by the under-expression of co-deleted TP53 and other genes on chromosome 17p. Our findings have implications for emerging therapeutic strategies that target mutant TP53.","['Lin, Ke', 'Lane, Brian', 'Carter, Anthony', 'Johnson, Gillian G', 'Onwuazor, Obiageli', 'Oates, Melanie', 'Zenz, Thorsten', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Atherton, Mark', 'Douglas, Angela', 'Ebrahimi, Bahram', 'Sherrington, Paul D', 'Pettitt, Andrew R']","['Lin K', 'Lane B', 'Carter A', 'Johnson GG', 'Onwuazor O', 'Oates M', 'Zenz T', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Atherton M', 'Douglas A', 'Ebrahimi B', 'Sherrington PD', 'Pettitt AR']","['Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121030,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,2012/11/01 06:00,2013/05/10 06:00,['2012/11/01 06:00'],"['2012/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/11/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.12092 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2013 Jan;160(1):53-62. doi: 10.1111/bjh.12092.

Mogamulizumab is a humanized antibody, with a defucosylated Fc region, which enhances antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. As a result, mogamulizumab demonstrates potent antitumor activity at much lower doses than other therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Clinical testing indicates that mogamulizumab is effective and well tolerated, with a predictable pharmacokinetic profile in patients with relapsed/refractory ATL.

Here, we demonstrate by gene promoter analysis, Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays that FoxM1 is a new target of the STAT3 transcriptional activator. Additionally, FoxM1 is transcriptionally dependent on STAT3 signaling activation. Furthermore, we verified that FoxM1 is crucial for K562 cell proliferation, cell cycle checkpoints and viability and could be related to chemotherapeutic resistance. By microarray analysis, we determined the signaling pathways related to FoxM1 expression and its role in DNA repair using K562 cells. Our results revealed new signaling involved in FoxM1 expression and its role in leukemic cells that elucidate cellular mechanisms associated with the development of leukemia and disease progression.","['Mencalha, Andre L', 'Binato, Renata', 'Ferreira, Gerson M', 'Du Rocher, Barbara', 'Abdelhay, Eliana']","['Mencalha AL', 'Binato R', 'Ferreira GM', 'Du Rocher B', 'Abdelhay E']","['Laboratorio de Celulas-Tronco, Divisao de laboratorios do CEMO, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil. amencalha@inca.gov.br']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121024,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC3480485,2012/10/31 06:00,2013/04/27 06:00,['2012/10/31 06:00'],"['2012/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0048160 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-04841 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(10):e48160. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0048160.

Excitatory and inhibitory inputs innervate these new granule cells in a stereotyped, temporally segregated manner, which presents a unique opportunity to study synapse development in the adult brain. To examine the role of neuroligins as synapse-inducing molecules in vivo, we infected dividing neural precursors in adult mice with a retroviral construct that increased neuroligin-1 levels during granule cell differentiation. By 21 days post-mitosis, exogenous neuroligin-1 was expressed at the tips of dendritic spines and increased the number of dendritic spines. Neuroligin-1-overexpressing cells showed a selective increase in functional excitatory synapses and connection multiplicity by single afferent fibers, as well as an increase in the synaptic AMPA/NMDA receptor ratio. In contrast to its synapse-inducing ability in vitro, neuroligin-1 overexpression did not induce precocious synapse formation in adult-born neurons. However, the dendrites of neuroligin-1-overexpressing cells did have more thin protrusions during an early period of dendritic outgrowth, suggesting enhanced filopodium formation or stabilization. Our results indicate that neuroligin-1 expression selectively increases the degree, but not the onset, of excitatory synapse formation in adult-born neurons.","['Schnell, Eric', 'Bensen, Aesoon L', 'Washburn, Eric K', 'Westbrook, Gary L']","['Schnell E', 'Bensen AL', 'Washburn EK', 'Westbrook GL']","['Portland VA Medical Center, Portland, Oregon, United States of America. schneler@ohsu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20121022,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC3478279,2012/10/31 06:00,2013/04/06 06:00,['2012/10/31 06:00'],"['2012/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0048045 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-25501 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(10):e48045. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0048045.

Here, we report that the gammaretrovirus XMRV requires cholesterol and lipid rafts for infection and replication. We demonstrate that treatment of XMRV with a low concentration (10 mM) of 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (2OHpbetaCD) partially depleted virion-associated cholesterol resulting in complete inactivation of the virus. This effect could not be reversed by adding cholesterol back to treated virions. Further analysis revealed that following cholesterol depletion, virus-associated Env protein was significantly reduced while the virions remained intact and retained core proteins. Increasing concentrations of 2OHpbetaCD (>/=20 mM) resulted in loss of the majority of virion-associated cholesterol, causing disruption of membrane integrity and loss of internal Gag proteins and viral RNA. Depletion of cholesterol from XMRV-infected cells significantly reduced virus release, suggesting that cholesterol and intact lipid rafts are required for the budding process of XMRV. These results suggest that unlike glycoproteins of other retroviruses, the association of XMRV glycoprotein with virions is highly dependent on cholesterol and lipid rafts.","['Tang, Yuyang', 'George, Alvin', 'Taylor, Thyneice', 'Hildreth, James E K']","['Tang Y', 'George A', 'Taylor T', 'Hildreth JE']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, College of Biological Sciences, University of California Davis, Davis, California, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20121026,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC3482229,2012/10/31 06:00,2013/04/06 06:00,['2012/10/31 06:00'],"['2012/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0048013 [doi]', 'PONE-D-12-18905 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2012;7(10):e48013. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0048013.

The results showed that EG induced morphological changes and DNA fragmentation and reduced HL-60 cell viability in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Western blotting analysis indicated that EG-mediated HL-60 apoptosis mainly occurred through the mitochondrial pathway, as shown by the release of cytochrome c, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), and endonuclease G (Endo G), as well as the upregulation of Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax).

Another NTSR, sortilin, which is common to neurotensin and neurotrophins, was also detected as we have previously described. Neurotensin was functional in B cell lines; it induced their proliferation and inhibited apoptosis induced by serum deprivation or Fas activation. Quantitative study of gene expression in two malignant B cell diseases showed that NTSR2 was overexpressed, NTSR1 decreased, and neurotensin was unexpressed in B cell leukemia patient's cells, as compared with healthy B cells. However, these expressions did not significantly change in large diffuse B cell lymphoma lymph nodes compared with benign ones. This study points out that neurotensin and its two specific receptors are expressed in human B lymphocytes.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase from the phase II nilotinib registration study with available postbaseline BCR-ABL1 transcript assessments were included (N = 237). RESULTS: BCR-ABL1 transcript levels (International Scale [IS]) at 3 months correlated with complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) by 24 months. Patients with BCR-ABL1 (IS) of > 1% to </= 10% at 3 months with nilotinib had higher cumulative incidence of CCyR by 24 months than patients with BCR-ABL1 (IS) of > 10% (53% v 16%). BCR-ABL1 (IS) at 3 months predicted major molecular response (MMR) by 24 months. Cumulative incidence of MMR by 24 months for patients with BCR-ABL1 (IS) of > 0.1% to </= 1%, > 1% to </= 10%, and > 10% was 65%, 27%, and 9%, respectively. These differences were observed for patients with or without baseline BCR-ABL1 mutations and for those with imatinib resistance or intolerance. Estimated event-free survival (EFS) rates at 24 months decreased with higher transcript levels at 3 months; patients with BCR-ABL1 (IS) of </= 1% had an estimated 24-month EFS rate of 82%, compared with 70% for patients with BCR-ABL1 (IS) of > 1% to </= 10% and 48% for patients with BCR-ABL1 (IS) of > 10%. CONCLUSION: Patients with BCR-ABL1 (IS) of > 10% at 3 months had a lower cumulative incidence of CCyR and MMR and lower rates of EFS versus patients with BCR-ABL1 (IS) of </= 10%.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Cardiac function of 60 children with ALL was prospectively studied with measurements of cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) and conventional and myocardial 2D strain echocardiography before start (T = 0), after 3 months (T = 1), and after 1 year (T = 2), and were compared with 60 healthy age-matched controls. None of the patients showed clinical signs of cardiac failure or abnormal fractional shortening. Cardiac function decreased significantly during treatment and was significantly decreased compared with normal controls. Cardiac troponin T levels were abnormal in 11% of the patients at T = 1 and were significantly related to increased time to global peak systolic longitudinal strain at T = 2 (P = 0.003). N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels were abnormal in 13% of patients at T = 1 and in 20% at T = 2, absolute values increased throughout treatment in 59%. Predictors for abnormal NT-pro-BNP at T = 2 were abnormal NT-pro-BNP at T = 0 and T = 1, for abnormal myocardial 2D strain parameters at T = 2 cumulative anthracycline dose and z-score of the diastolic left ventricular internal diameter at baseline. CONCLUSION: Children with newly diagnosed ALL showed decline of systolic and diastolic function during treatment with anthracyclines using cardiac biomarkers and myocardial 2D strain echocardiography. N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels were not related to echocardiographic strain parameters and cTnT was not a predictor for abnormal strain at T = 2.Therefore, the combination of cardiac biomarkers and myocardial 2D strain echocardiography is important in the assessment of cardiac function of children with ALL treated with anthracyclines.","['Mavinkurve-Groothuis, Annelies M C', 'Marcus, Karen A', 'Pourier, Milanthy', 'Loonen, Jacqueline', 'Feuth, Ton', 'Hoogerbrugge, Peter M', 'de Korte, Chris L', 'Kapusta, Livia']","['Mavinkurve-Groothuis AM', 'Marcus KA', 'Pourier M', 'Loonen J', 'Feuth T', 'Hoogerbrugge PM', 'de Korte CL', 'Kapusta L']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, PO Box 9101, Huispost 804, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands. a.mavinkurve@cukz.umcn.nl']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121029,England,Eur Heart J Cardiovasc Imaging,European heart journal.

Hsp70, best known as a protein chaperone with well-defined peptide-refolding properties, is known to interact with ARE-like RNA substrates in vitro. Here, we show that cofactor-free preparations of Hsp70 form direct, high-affinity complexes with ARE substrates based on specific recognition of U-rich sequences by both the ATP- and peptide-binding domains. Suppressing Hsp70 in HeLa cells destabilized an ARE reporter mRNA, indicating a novel ARE-directed mRNA-stabilizing role for this protein. Hsp70 also bound and stabilized endogenous ARE-containing mRNAs encoding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Cox-2, which involved a mechanism that was unaffected by an inhibitor of its protein chaperone function. Hsp70 recognition and stabilization of VEGF mRNA was mediated by an ARE-like sequence in the proximal 3'UTR. Finally, stabilization of VEGF mRNA coincided with the accumulation of Hsp70 protein in HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cells recovering from acute thermal stress. We propose that the binding and stabilization of selected ARE-containing mRNAs may contribute to the cytoprotective effects of Hsp70 following cellular stress but may also provide a novel mechanism linking constitutively elevated Hsp70 expression to the development of aggressive neoplastic phenotypes.","['Kishor, Aparna', 'Tandukar, Bishal', 'Ly, Yann V', 'Toth, Eric A', 'Suarez, Yvelisse', 'Brewer, Gary', 'Wilson, Gerald M']","['Kishor A', 'Tandukar B', 'Ly YV', 'Toth EA', 'Suarez Y', 'Brewer G', 'Wilson GM']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20121029,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,PMC3536313,2012/10/31 06:00,2013/04/27 06:00,['2012/10/31 06:00'],"['2012/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/27 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.01275-12 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.01275-12 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2013 Jan;33(1):71-84. doi: 10.1128/MCB.01275-12.

This study examined the prevalence and severity of malnutrition at diagnosis, as well as after 3 and 6 months of chemotherapy, in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in Guatemala. METHODS: Triceps skin fold thickness (TSFT) and mid upper arm circumference (MUAC) provided measures of nutritional status (NS) in three categories: adequately nourished (A): TSFT and MUAC > 10th percentile; severely depleted (SD): TSFT or MUAC < 5th percentile; and moderately depleted (MD): all the remaining patients. RESULTS: Of 331 new patients, 241 had NS assessed at diagnosis. A = 113 (46.9%); MD = 28 (11.6%); SD = 100 (41.5%). At 3 months A = 106 (52.2%); MD = 25 (12.3%); SD = 72 (35.5%). At 6 months A = 146 (76.0%); MD = 12 (6.3%); SD = 34 (17.7%).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a population-based analysis using administrative data of Ontario ALL AYA patients diagnosed between 1986-2009. We calculated predicted survival proportions (PSPs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We also surveyed sites to determine whether pediatric or adult-based protocols were used in each period. RESULTS: Overall, 290 patients between 15-19 years of age were diagnosed with ALL during the study period; 144 patients (49.7%) were treated at an adult center. When adjusted for gender, age, income quintile and time period, AYA patients treated at a pediatric center did not have a significantly different PSP (0.65, 95% CI: 0.56-0.75) in comparison to those treated at an adult center (0.62, 95% CI 0.52-0.73; P = 0.87).

Besides, dasatinib-treated patients with lymphocytosis have a better prognosis than patients without lymphocytosis. In order to elucidate the effects of dasatinib on the proliferation of lymphocyte subset, dasatinib was added to the culture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with IL-2 (lymphokine-activated killer culture) or a low dose of IL-2 with zoledronate (gammadelta T-cell culture). In both culture conditions, NK cells were increased in both percentage and absolute number in the culture with dasatinib compared with control culture without dasatinib. The increase of NK cells was dose dependent of dasatinib in the range of 2-25 nM. NK cell cytotoxicity of cultured cells with dasatinib was demonstrated to be superior to control cells without dasatinib in cytotoxicity assay using EGFP-transfected K562 cells as target cells. The present study suggested that lymphocytosis in dasatinib-treated CML patients is at least partly associated with a direct effect of dasatinib to stimulate the proliferation of NK cells. Favourable prognosis in patients with dasatinib-induced lymphocytosis might be associated with the effects of dasatinib to potentiate NK cytotoxicity in vivo.","['Uchiyama, Takayoshi', 'Sato, Naoya', 'Narita, Miwako', 'Yamahira, Akie', 'Iwabuchi, Minami', 'Furukawa, Tatsuo', 'Sone, Hirohito', 'Takahashi, Masuhiro']","['Uchiyama T', 'Sato N', 'Narita M', 'Yamahira A', 'Iwabuchi M', 'Furukawa T', 'Sone H', 'Takahashi M']","['Laboratory of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Health Sciences, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121029,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,,2012/10/31 06:00,2014/05/03 06:00,['2012/10/31 06:00'],"['2012/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hon.2034 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2013 Sep;31(3):156-63. doi: 10.1002/hon.2034.

A Western blot analysis showed that imperatorin significantly enhanced the p53 protein level, which subsequently down-regulated Mcl-1 protein and up-regulated Bax, while it had a minimal effect on Bcl-2 expression. In addition, an anchorage-independent growth assay was performed to support the anti-metastasis potential of imperatorin.

Aberrant Notch signaling represents an important oncogenic mechanism for T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), an aggressive subset of the most common malignant childhood cancer ALL. Therefore, understanding the molecular regulation of Notch signaling is critical to identify new approaches to block aberrant Notch oncogenic activity. The family of three MAML transcriptional coactivators is crucial for Notch signaling activation. The prototypic member MAML1 is the major coactivator that regulates Notch oncogenic activities in leukemic cells. However, the molecular basis underlying MAML1 coactivator function that contributes to Notch signaling remains unclear. In this study, we performed proteomic studies and identified DDX5, an ATP-dependent DEAD-box RNA helicase, as a component of the MAML1 protein complex. DDX5 interacts with MAML1 in vitro and in vivo, and is associated with the endogenous NOTCH1 transcription activation complex in human T-ALL leukemic cells. Lentivirus-mediated short-hairpin RNA knock-down of DDX5 resulted in decreased expression of Notch target genes, reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in cultured human leukemic cells with constitutive activation of Notch signaling. Also, DDX5 depletion inhibited the growth of human leukemia xenograft in nude mice. Moreover, DDX5 is highly expressed in primary human T-ALL leukemic cells based on the analyses of Oncomine and GEO databases, and Immunohistochemical staining. Our overall findings revealed a critical role of DDX5 in promoting efficient Notch-mediated transcription in leukemic cells, suggesting that DDX5 might be critical for NOTCH1-mediated T-ALL pathogenesis and thus is a potential new target for modulating the Notch signaling in leukemia.","['Lin, S', 'Tian, L', 'Shen, H', 'Gu, Y', 'Li, J-L', 'Chen, Z', 'Sun, X', 'You, M James', 'Wu, L']","['Lin S', 'Tian L', 'Shen H', 'Gu Y', 'Li JL', 'Chen Z', 'Sun X', 'You MJ', 'Wu L']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Shands Cancer Center, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121029,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,PMC4616007,2012/10/31 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2012/10/31 06:00'],"['2012/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/31 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2012482 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2012.482 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2013 Oct;32(40):4845-53. doi: 10.1038/onc.2012.482.

Their deregulation has been reported in various cancers. We performed a complete and comprehensive study of the expression of 18 HDACs (including Sirtuin; SIRT) by real-time PCR in a cohort of 200 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients with a median follow-up of 77 mo, and compared it with the results obtained from normal B cells. We also compared HDAC expression at diagnosis and after relapse. We observed significant deregulation (mostly upregulation) of HDACs in CLL. In terms of clinical significance, only HDAC6 was significantly correlated with treatment-free survival (TFS), whereas HDAC3 and SIRT2, 3 and 6 were correlated with overall survival (OS). A multivariate Cox regression stepwise analysis indicated that HDAC6, 7 and 10 and SIRT3 were TFS independent predictors. Interestingly, poor prognosis was associated with an overexpression of HDAC7 and 10 but an underexpression of HDAC6 and SIRT3. Therefore, these factors were combined in a TFS score: patients with a score of 0-1-2, 3 and 4 had a median TFS of 107, 57 and 26 mo, respectively (HR = 4.03, p < 0.0001). For OS, SIRT5 and 6 allowed stratification into 3 groups, with a median OS of > 360, 237 and 94 mo (HR = 6.38, p < 0.0001). However, we could not find statistical differences in HDAC expression after relapse.

RECENT FINDINGS: Through advances in NGS technologies, whole-exome sequencing and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) have been performed on various cancers, identifying in the process numerous recurrent mutations and highly mutated genes. These cancers include uterine serous carcinomas, high-grade serous ovarian adenocarcinomas and breast cancer. In contrast to identifying somatic mutations in sporadic cancers, a far smaller number of studies using NGS have been conducted to identify new causal mutations or genes for hereditary cancer syndromes. In addition to research discovery, diagnostic applications of NGS have also become increasingly evident. Thus, WGS has been applied in a diagnostic context to identify a complex chromosomal rearrangement in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia of unclear subtype. Similarly, the targeted sequencing of panels of known cancer genes using NGS has demonstrated its robustness in the context of identifying known pathological mutations. SUMMARY: The research and clinical applications of cancer genome sequencing have progressed at an unprecedented pace over the last few years, and this promises to be accelerated with new developments of high-throughput NGS technologies and robust analytical tools.","['Ku, Chee S', 'Cooper, David N', 'Ziogas, Demosthenes E', 'Halkia, Eugenia', 'Tzaphlidou, Margaret', 'Roukos, Dimitrios H']","['Ku CS', 'Cooper DN', 'Ziogas DE', 'Halkia E', 'Tzaphlidou M', 'Roukos DH']","['Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Curr Opin Obstet Gynecol,Current opinion in obstetrics & gynecology,9007264,,2012/10/31 06:00,2013/07/13 06:00,['2012/10/31 06:00'],"['2012/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/GCO.0b013e32835af17c [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Obstet Gynecol. 2013 Feb;25(1):3-10. doi: 10.1097/GCO.0b013e32835af17c.,,IM,,"['Breast Neoplasms/genetics', 'Female', 'Genital Neoplasms, Female/genetics', 'Genome, Human/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we provide the first mechanistic insights into the role of the Trithorax protein mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) in maintaining cancer stem cell characteristics in human glioblastoma. We found that MLL directly activates the Homeobox gene HOXA10. In turn, HOXA10 activates a downstream Homeobox network and other genes previously characterized for their role in tumorigenesis. The MLL-Homeobox axis we identified significantly contributes to the tumorigenic potential of glioblastoma stem cells.

METHODS: Surveys were mailed to 5 + -year survivors of childhood ALL aged 13 to 25 years. Survivors' siblings were also invited to participate in the study. Prevalence of back pain and hip pain among ALL survivors was determined and compared with siblings. Sex, treatment with radiation therapy, obesity, and physical activity were examined for an association with back pain and hip pain. RESULTS: Forty-four of 99 (44.4%) ALL survivors reported back pain compared with 11 of 52 (21.2%) their siblings (P = 0.007; RR: 2.01; 95% confidence interval = 1.15-3.56). In contrast, 10 of 99 (10.1%) ALL survivors reported experiencing hip pain compared with 1 of 52 (2.0%) siblings experiencing hip pain [P = 0.07; RR: 4.95 (0.65 to 37.57)]. Twenty-six of 43 female survivors reported back pain compared with 18 of 56 male survivors who reported back pain (P = 0.005). Obesity, physical activity, and treatment with radiation therapy were not associated with back pain or hip pain. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study demonstrating an increased frequency of back pain among survivors of childhood ALL. Future studies are needed to better define the causes of back pain among childhood ALL survivors.","['Bowers, Daniel C', 'Griffith, Terri', 'Gargan, Lynn', 'Cochran, Cindy J', 'Kleiber, Beverly', 'Foxwell, Aleksandra', 'Farrow-Gillespie, Alan', 'Orlino, Angela', 'Germann, Julie N']","['Bowers DC', 'Griffith T', 'Gargan L', 'Cochran CJ', 'Kleiber B', 'Foxwell A', 'Farrow-Gillespie A', 'Orlino A', 'Germann JN']","['Department of Pediatrics, UT Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Dallas, TX, USA. daniel.bowers@utsouthwestern.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,2012/10/31 06:00,2013/01/23 06:00,['2012/10/31 06:00'],"['2012/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MPH.0b013e31827080de [doi]', '00043426-201211000-00007 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2012 Nov;34(8):624-9. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e31827080de.,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Arthralgia/epidemiology', 'Back Injuries/epidemiology', 'Back Pain/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Health Surveys', 'Hip Joint', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Motor Activity', 'Obesity/epidemiology', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Radiotherapy', 'Risk', 'Siblings', 'Spinal Puncture/adverse effects', '*Survivors', 'Young Adult']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because EPCs can be introduced by antibody-antigen interactions, the suitable choice of antibody and the biocompatible surface modification technology including antibody immobilization are essential for developing an EPC-capturing stent. In this study, we fabricated a biofunctional stent with EPC specificity by grafting a hydrophilic polymer and consecutively immobilizing the antibody against vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) which is one of the specific EPC surface markers. The surface of a stainless steel stent was sequentially modified by acid-treatment, silanization and covalent attachment of polymers not only to improve biocompatibility but also to introduce functional groups on the stent surface. The surface-modified stent immobilized anti-VE-cadherin antibodies, and the EPCs were remarkably captured whereas THP-1s, human acute monocytic leukemia cells, were not adsorbed on the stent. Furthermore, we confirmed that the recruited EPCs developed the endothelial cell layers on the antibody-conjugated stent.

Leukemia oncoproteins may directly or indirectly disrupt cytosine methylation patterning to mediate the malignant phenotype. We postulated that DNA methylation signatures in these aggressive B-ALLs would point toward disease mechanisms and useful biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We therefore conducted DNA methylation and gene expression profiling on a cohort of 215 adult patients with B-ALL enrolled in a single phase III clinical trial (ECOG E2993) and normal control B cells. In BCR-ABL1-positive B-ALLs, aberrant cytosine methylation patterning centered around a cytokine network defined by hypomethylation and overexpression of IL2RA(CD25). The E2993 trial clinical data showed that CD25 expression was strongly associated with a poor outcome in patients with ALL regardless of BCR-ABL1 status, suggesting CD25 as a novel prognostic biomarker for risk stratification in B-ALLs. In E2A-PBX1-positive B-ALLs, aberrant DNA methylation patterning was strongly associated with direct fusion protein binding as shown by the E2A-PBX1 chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing (ChIP-seq), suggesting that E2A-PBX1 fusion protein directly remodels the epigenome to impose an aggressive B-ALL phenotype. MLLr B-ALL featured prominent cytosine hypomethylation, which was linked with MLL fusion protein binding, H3K79 dimethylation, and transcriptional upregulation, affecting a set of known and newly identified MLL fusion direct targets with oncogenic activity such as FLT3 and BCL6. Notably, BCL6 blockade or loss of function suppressed proliferation and survival of MLLr leukemia cells, suggesting BCL6-targeted therapy as a new therapeutic strategy for MLLr B-ALLs. SIGNIFICANCE: We conducted the first integrative epigenomic study in adult B-ALLs, as a correlative study to the ECOG E2993 phase III clinical trial. This study links for the first time the direct actions of oncogenic fusion proteins with disruption of epigenetic regulation mediated by cytosine methylation. We identify a novel clinically actionable biomarker in B-ALLs: IL2RA (CD25), which is linked with BCR-ABL1 and an inflammatory signaling network associated with chemotherapy resistance. We show that BCL6 is a novel MLL fusion protein target that is required to maintain the proliferation and survival of primary human adult MLLr cells and provide the basis for a clinical trial with BCL6 inhibitors for patients with MLLr.","['Geng, Huimin', 'Brennan, Sarah', 'Milne, Thomas A', 'Chen, Wei-Yi', 'Li, Yushan', 'Hurtz, Christian', 'Kweon, Soo-Mi', 'Zickl, Lynette', 'Shojaee, Seyedmehdi', 'Neuberg, Donna', 'Huang, Chuanxin', 'Biswas, Debabrata', 'Xin, Yuan', 'Racevskis, Janis', 'Ketterling, Rhett P', 'Luger, Selina M', 'Lazarus, Hillard', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Rowe, Jacob M', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Guzman, Monica L', 'Allis, C David', 'Roeder, Robert G', 'Muschen, Markus', 'Paietta, Elisabeth', 'Elemento, Olivier', 'Melnick, Ari M']","['Geng H', 'Brennan S', 'Milne TA', 'Chen WY', 'Li Y', 'Hurtz C', 'Kweon SM', 'Zickl L', 'Shojaee S', 'Neuberg D', 'Huang C', 'Biswas D', 'Xin Y', 'Racevskis J', 'Ketterling RP', 'Luger SM', 'Lazarus H', 'Tallman MS', 'Rowe JM', 'Litzow MR', 'Guzman ML', 'Allis CD', 'Roeder RG', 'Muschen M', 'Paietta E', 'Elemento O', 'Melnick AM']","['Department of Medicine/Hematology-Oncology Division, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY 10065, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20121029,United States,Cancer Discov,Cancer discovery,101561693,PMC3516186,2012/10/31 06:00,2013/06/01 06:00,['2012/10/31 06:00'],"['2012/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/01 06:00 [medline]']","['2159-8290.CD-12-0208 [pii]', '10.1158/2159-8290.CD-12-0208 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Discov. 2012 Nov;2(11):1004-23. doi: 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-12-0208.

Despite a number of reports regarding the molecular mechanisms by which ATO promotes anti-tumor or pro-apoptotic activity in hematological and other solid malignancies, the effects of ATO on immune responses remain poorly understood. To further understand and clarify the effects of ATO on immune responses, we sought to examine whether ATO affects the production of nitric oxide (NO) in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated mouse macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7. Arsenic trioxide was found to prevent NO production in a dose-dependent manner. Arsenic trioxide significantly inhibited the increase in inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) at both the mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, our analyses revealed that the inhibitory effect of ATO on iNOS expression was ascribed to the prevention of IRF3 phosphorylation, interferon (IFN)-beta expression, and STAT1 phosphorylation, but not the prevention of the MyD88-dependent pathway. Taken together, our results indicate that ATO prevents NO production by inhibiting the TIR-domain-containing adaptor protein inducing IFN-beta (TRIF)-dependent pathway, thus highlighting an anti-inflammatory property of ATO in innate immunity.","['Takahashi, Miyuki', 'Ota, Akinobu', 'Karnan, Sivasundaram', 'Hossain, Ekhtear', 'Konishi, Yuko', 'Damdindorj, Lkhagvasuren', 'Konishi, Hiroyuki', 'Yokochi, Takashi', 'Nitta, Masakazu', 'Hosokawa, Yoshitaka']","['Takahashi M', 'Ota A', 'Karnan S', 'Hossain E', 'Konishi Y', 'Damdindorj L', 'Konishi H', 'Yokochi T', 'Nitta M', 'Hosokawa Y']","['Department of Biochemistry, Department of Internal Medicine, Nagakute, Aichi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121213,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,PMC7657247,2012/10/31 06:00,2013/07/03 06:00,['2012/10/31 06:00'],"['2012/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/18 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cas.12053 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2013 Feb;104(2):165-70. doi: 10.1111/cas.12053.

A botanical mixture of extracts from two natural substances, Panax notoginseng and Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch, was developed as a novel botanical agent synthesized with anti-inflammatory effect. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of the botanical mixture on the release of inflammatory cytokines and its inhibitory effect on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced alveolar bone loss (ABL) in a rat model. METHODS: Cytotoxicity was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-5(3-carboxymethoxyphenol)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetraz olium assay using human gingival fibroblast (hGF) and human periodontal ligament (hPDL) cells. Human acute monocytic leukemia cell line and hGF cells were cultured to assay tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6, respectively. Microcomputed tomography analysis and immunofluoresence analysis were performed to evaluate the efficacy of the botanical mixture to inhibit the destruction of alveolar bone and connective tissue in a rat model. RESULTS: The botanical mixture is cytotoxic at concentrations exceeding 2.5 mg/mL (P <0.05). Based on the results from cytotoxicity assay, it can be determined that the pharmacologic ranges of the botanical mixture to be used in all subsequent in vitro and in vivo experiments. The botanical mixture reduced the release of TNF-alpha and IL-6 from human monocytic cells and hGF cells in a dose-dependent manner (P <0.05). The administration of the botanical mixture significantly reduced the alveolar bone loss in a rat model (P <0.05). In groups treated with the botanical mixture, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 was detected along the alveolar bone crest (ABC), but not around the gingival connective tissue, while in the group with LPS-induced ABL, pronounced expression of MMP-9 around the ABC, periodontal ligament, and gingival connective tissue was found. CONCLUSIONS: The botanical mixture showed a potential adjunctive effect in the treatment of periodontitis. However, the present findings are obtained in vitro and in a rat model, so further clinical study is needed for its clinical application.","['Lee, Bo-Ah', 'Lee, Hwa-Sun', 'Jung, Young-Suk', 'Kim, Se-Won', 'Lee, Yong-Wook', 'Chang, Sun-Hwa', 'Chung, Hyun-Ju', 'Kim, Ok-Su', 'Kim, Young-Joon']","['Lee BA', 'Lee HS', 'Jung YS', 'Kim SW', 'Lee YW', 'Chang SH', 'Chung HJ', 'Kim OS', 'Kim YJ']","['Dental Research Institute, School of Dentistry, 2nd Stage of Brain Korea 21 Project for School of Dentistry, Chonnam National University, Gwangju, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121029,United States,J Periodontol,Journal of periodontology,8000345,,2012/10/31 06:00,2014/03/29 06:00,['2012/10/31 06:00'],"['2012/10/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1902/jop.2012.120460 [doi]'],ppublish,J Periodontol. 2013 Aug;84(8):1221-9. doi: 10.1902/jop.2012.120460.

For those who relapse after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), the prognosis is particularly poor, with limited reported literature on these patients. We reviewed the clinical course of 49 children with AML (28 males, 21 females) who received allo-HSCT between 1993 and 2011, and who had subsequently relapsed. Study endpoints included (i) complete remission (CR) rate after intensive chemotherapy, and prognostic factors for CR, (ii) disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) for patients who achieved CR and (iii) OS for recipients of intensive chemotherapy and prognostic factors for OS. Of the 36 patients who received intensive chemotherapy after post-HSCT relapse, 26 (72%) achieved CR. For patients who achieved CR, 5-year DFS and OS were 32.6 +/- 10.2% and 44.4 +/- 11.1%, respectively. For all recipients of intensive chemotherapy, 5-year OS was 31.6 +/- 8.7%. Cumulative incidence of treatment-related death was 14.4%. All three recipients of second HSCT died. Amongst prognostic factors predicting improved survival, only disease status at HSCT (early first CR vs. others) proved significant in multivariate study (Hazard Ratio 2.42, 95% Confidence Interval 1.02-5.74, P = 0.045).

(18)F-FLT and (18)F-FDG PET imaging were performed both in the same mouse when eight tumor-bearing mice models of human chronic myeloid leukemia were established successfully by injecting K562 cells. Regions of interest were drawn over the tumor, the crossed normal tissue was regarded as background and the ratio of tumor to non-tumor counts (T/NT) in tissues was calculated. A higher uptake of (18)F-FLT (15min, 5.73+/-0.05%; 30min, 5.90+/-0.06%; 60min, 6.16+/-0.19%; 120min, 6.32+/-0.08%) than that of (18)F-FDG (15min, 1.05+/-0.10%; 30min, 1.11+/-0.14%; 60min, 1.14+/-0.37%; 120 min, 1.36+/-0.25%) was observed in K562 cells in the tracer uptake experiment.

In this case - control study we have examined the effect of riboflavin status as measured by erythrocyte glutathione reductase activation coefficient (EGRAC) on homocysteine levels along with vitamin B(12) and folate in pediatric ALL. Folate and B(12) levels were significantly lower among cases as compared to controls while EGRAC and tHcy did not differ significantly among the groups.

Oxidative stress, a pervasive condition of an increased number of reactive oxygen species, is now recognized to be prominent feature of various diseases and their progression. Thus antioxidants, which control the oxidative stress state, represent a major line of defense regulating overall true state of health. The relationship between antioxidants status and levels of well-known markers of oxidative stress that are measured as lipid peroxides and oxidized proteins reflect better health indices and postures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of oxidative stress in pathophysiology of Chronic myeloid leukemia by measuring the circulating plasma lipid peroxide levels in terms of malonyldialdehyde, total lipid hydroperoxide and oxidized proteins as protein carbonyl whereas antioxidant status were estimated in terms of reduced glutathione and total thiol in plasma of Chronic myeloid leukemia patients. The present study included 47 Chronic myeloid leukemia patients and 20 age-and sex-matched healthy subjects. Out of 47 Chronic myeloid leukemia patients, 31 were in chronic phase (CML-CP) and 16 in accelerated phase (CML-AP). The median age of Chronic myeloid leukemia patients was 33 years and that of controls was 32 years. Oxidative stress and antioxidant status in plasma were evaluated by spectrophotometric procedures. There was a significant increase (p<0.05) in plasma malonyldialdehyde, total lipid hydroperoxide and protein carbonyl levels in Chronic myeloid leukemia patients as compared to healthy subjects. Our results also showed that plasma malonyldialdehyde and protein carbonyl levels were markedly elevated (p<0.05) in both chronic phase (CML-CP) and accelerated phase (CML-AP) as compared to healthy volunteers. Antioxidant status was found to be significantly decreased (p<0.05) in Chronic myeloid leukemia patients and its phases as compared to healthy participants. It could be concluded that oxidative stress may be associated with the pathophysiology of Chronic myeloid leukemia.","['Ahmad, Rizwan', 'Tripathi, Anil K', 'Tripathi, Payal', 'Singh, Ranjana', 'Singh, Sushma', 'Singh, Raj K']","['Ahmad R', 'Tripathi AK', 'Tripathi P', 'Singh R', 'Singh S', 'Singh RK']","['Department of Biochemistry, C.S.M.

Hence, the present study was undertaken to examine the lipid profile in children patients with leukemia and Hodgkin's disease in comparison with age matched controls. The study included 52 normal healthy controls and 105 patients with leukemia and Hodgkin's disease. Lipid profile included serum cholesterol, HDL & LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. Serum cholesterol, HDL & LDL cholesterol were found to be inversely associated with incidence of cancer, whereas triglycerides were significantly elevated in cancer patients. The inverse association between cancer and serum cholesterol may reflect a physiological response to early undiagnosed stages of cancer.","['Naik, P P', 'Ghadge, M S', 'Raste, A S']","['Naik PP', 'Ghadge MS', 'Raste AS']","['Department of Biochemistry, Tata Memorial Hospital, 5th Floor, Annexe Building, Dr. E.

This indicates that dysfunction in T-cell apoptosis may influence the natural history of the T-cell neoplasms, such as adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) caused by the retrovirus HTLV-1. Fas is ubiquitous, and down-regulated or mutated Fas has been widely detected in tumor cells that escape from elimination via Fas-mediated apoptosis. De novo fresh ATL cells and cell lines derived from the de novo cells, however, express Fas abundantly on the cell surface and are susceptible to Fas ligand and agonistic agents. On the other hand, there are two types of Fas gene transcripts, full-length and alternatively splicing truncated forms corresponding to membrane and soluble Fas isoforms, respectively. Focusing on membrane and soluble Fas isoforms and ATL pathology mediated by apoptosis, this paper reviews and discusses our ATL cases and ATL cell lines, which provide useful ""experiments of nature"" for understanding the role of Fas-mediated apoptosis in tumor biology.","['Kamihira, S', 'Yamada, Y', 'Maeda, T']","['Kamihira S', 'Yamada Y', 'Maeda T']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, 1-7-1, Sakamoto, 852-8501 Nagasaki City, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Indian J Clin Biochem,Indian journal of clinical biochemistry : IJCB,8708303,PMC3454065,2000/08/01 00:00,2000/08/01 00:01,['2012/10/30 06:00'],"['2012/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2000/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/BF02867549 [doi]', 'BF02867549 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Clin Biochem. 2000 Aug;15(Suppl 1):101-9. doi: 10.1007/BF02867549.,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ATL', 'Fas (APO-1/CD95)', 'HTLV-1', 'apoptosis', 'mutation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) establishes a lifelong infection and is linked to adult T-cell leukemia lymphoma (ATLL). Here, we demonstrate that HTLV-1 p30 recruits the cellular proteasome activator PA28gamma onto the viral tax/rex mRNA to prevent its nuclear export and suppress virus replication. Interaction of p30 with a PA28gamma retaining fully functional proteasome activity is required for p30's ability to repress HTLV-1. Consistently, HTLV-1 molecular clones replicate better and produce more virus particles in PA28gamma-deficient cells. These results define a unique and novel role for the cellular factor PA28gamma in the control of nuclear RNA trafficking and HTLV-1-induced latency. Importantly, knockdown of PA28gamma expression in ATLL cells latently infected with HTLV-1 reactivates expression of viral tax/rex RNA and the Tax protein. Because Tax is the most immunogenic viral antigen and triggers strong CTL responses, our results suggest that PA28gamma-targeted therapy may reactivate virus expression from latently infected cells and allow their eradication from the host. KEY POINTS: PA28gamma acts as a co-repressor of HTLV-1 p30 to suppress virus replication and is required for the maintenance of viral latency.

These observations stimulated in vitro and in vivo animal studies, implicating NRG-1/ErbB signaling in the regulation of cardiac cell biology throughout life. Cardiovascular effects of ErbB2-targeted cancer therapies provide evidence in humans that ErbB signaling plays a role in the maintenance of cardiac function. These and other studies suggest a conceptual model in which a key function of NRG-1/ErbB signaling is to mediate adaptations of the heart to physiological and pathological stimuli through activation of intracellular kinase cascades that regulate tissue plasticity. Recent work implicates NRG-1/ErbB signaling in the regulation of multiple aspects of cardiovascular biology, including angiogenesis, blood pressure, and skeletal muscle responses to exercise. The therapeutic potential of recombinant NRG-1 as a potential treatment for heart failure has been demonstrated in animal models and is now being explored in clinical studies. NRG-1 is found in human serum and plasma, and it correlates with some clinical parameters, suggesting that it may have value as an indicator of prognosis. In this review, we bring together this growing literature on NRG-1 and its significance in cardiovascular development and disease.","['Odiete, Oghenerukevwe', 'Hill, Michael F', 'Sawyer, Douglas B']","['Odiete O', 'Hill MF', 'Sawyer DB']","['Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,United States,Circ Res,Circulation research,0047103,PMC3752394,2012/10/30 06:00,2013/01/08 06:00,['2012/10/30 06:00'],"['2012/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/08 06:00 [medline]']","['111/10/1376 [pii]', '10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.267286 [doi]']",ppublish,Circ Res. 2012 Oct 26;111(10):1376-85. doi: 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.267286.,"['0 (NRG1 protein, human)', '0 (Neuregulin-1)', '0 (Nrg1 protein, mouse)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Heart/*embryology/*physiology', 'Heart Failure/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Neuregulin-1/genetics/*physiology']",,,,,"['R01 HL089385-02/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL068758/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL068144/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL089385/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '3R01HL089385-02S1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 HL101425/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS499083'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These include the microbiota on environmental surfaces, such as the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, and also endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), comprising a substantial fraction of the mammalian genome. The long-term consequences for the host of interactions with these microbial species can range from mutualism to parasitism and are not always completely understood. The potential effect of one microbial symbiont on another is even less clear. Here we study the control of ERVs in the commonly used C57BL/6 (B6) mouse strain, which lacks endogenous murine leukaemia viruses (MLVs) able to replicate in murine cells. We demonstrate the spontaneous emergence of fully infectious ecotropic MLV in B6 mice with a range of distinct immune deficiencies affecting antibody production. These recombinant retroviruses establish infection of immunodeficient mouse colonies, and ultimately result in retrovirus-induced lymphomas. Notably, ERV activation in immunodeficient mice is prevented in husbandry conditions associated with reduced or absent intestinal microbiota. Our results shed light onto a previously unappreciated role for immunity in the control of ERVs and provide a potential mechanistic link between immune activation by microbial triggers and a range of pathologies associated with ERVs, including cancer.","['Young, George R', 'Eksmond, Urszula', 'Salcedo, Rosalba', 'Alexopoulou, Lena', 'Stoye, Jonathan P', 'Kassiotis, George']","['Young GR', 'Eksmond U', 'Salcedo R', 'Alexopoulou L', 'Stoye JP', 'Kassiotis G']","['Division of Immunoregulation, MRC National Institute for Medical Research, The Ridgeway, London NW7 1AA, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121024,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,PMC3511586,2012/10/30 06:00,2013/01/17 06:00,['2012/10/30 06:00'],"['2012/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/17 06:00 [medline]']","['nature11599 [pii]', '10.1038/nature11599 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2012 Nov 29;491(7426):774-8. doi: 10.1038/nature11599.

We hypothesized that increased recruitment of the protein tyrosine phosphatase, Shp2, to FLT3-ITDs contributes to FLT3 ligand (FL)-independent hyperproliferation and STAT5 activation. Co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated constitutive association of Shp2 with the FLT3-ITD, N51-FLT3, as well as with STAT5. Knockdown of Shp2 in Baf3/N51-FLT3 cells significantly reduced proliferation while having little effect on WT-FLT3-expressing cells. Consistently, mutation of N51-FLT3 tyrosine 599 to phenylalanine or genetic disruption of Shp2 in N51-FLT3-expressing bone marrow low-density mononuclear cells reduced proliferation and STAT5 activation. In transplants, genetic disruption of Shp2 in vivo yielded increased latency to and reduced severity of FLT3-ITD-induced malignancy. Mechanistically, Shp2 co-localizes with nuclear phospho-STAT5, is present at functional interferon-gamma activation sites (GAS) within the BCL2L1 promoter, and positively activates the human BCL2L1 promoter, suggesting that Shp2 works with STAT5 to promote pro-leukemogenic gene expression. Further, using a small molecule Shp2 inhibitor, the proliferation of N51-FLT3-expressing bone marrow progenitors and primary AML samples was reduced in a dose-dependent manner. These findings demonstrate that Shp2 positively contributes to FLT3-ITD-induced leukemia and suggest that Shp2 inhibition may provide a novel therapeutic approach to AML.","['Nabinger, S C', 'Li, X J', 'Ramdas, B', 'He, Y', 'Zhang, X', 'Zeng, L', 'Richine, B', 'Bowling, J D', 'Fukuda, S', 'Goenka, S', 'Liu, Z', 'Feng, G-S', 'Yu, M', 'Sandusky, G E', 'Boswell, H S', 'Zhang, Z-Y', 'Kapur, R', 'Chan, R J']","['Nabinger SC', 'Li XJ', 'Ramdas B', 'He Y', 'Zhang X', 'Zeng L', 'Richine B', 'Bowling JD', 'Fukuda S', 'Goenka S', 'Liu Z', 'Feng GS', 'Yu M', 'Sandusky GE', 'Boswell HS', 'Zhang ZY', 'Kapur R', 'Chan RJ']","['Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121022,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC3916934,2012/10/30 06:00,2013/04/05 06:00,['2012/10/30 06:00'],"['2012/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2012308 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2012.308 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2013 Feb;27(2):398-408. doi: 10.1038/leu.2012.308.

It has been demonstrated to be linked to reduced expression of the cytoskeletal protein vimentin and its inverse correlation with the clinical outcome of the disease. AIMS: Investigation of the percentage of smudge cells, CD38-, ZAP-70-positive cells and the time to treatment in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. METHODS: Authors investigated the percentage of smudge cells, CD38- and ZAP-70-positive cells in the peripheral blood of 50 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and their correlation with the time to treatment. RESULTS: 21 patients required treatment in the follow-up period. Their median smudge cell percentage was 9.9%, while it was 26.8% in the non-treated group. The cut-off value of smudge cell positivity was set to 20%. 59.3% of the patients with less than cut-off had to be treated in the follow-up time compared to 21.7% of patients with more smudge cells. These findings were similar to the prognostic value of CD38 and ZAP-70. The necessity of treatment increased to 75-77.8% with the combination of investigated markers. The time to treatment was 19 months when smudge cells were less than 20%, but above 20% it was 36.15 months. In case of low smudge cell percentage and CD38 positivity the time to treatment was 14.14 months and in case of high smudge cell percentage and CD38 negativity it was 32.92 months. In discordant cases the time to treatment was 18.43 months. The authors also present a case report that demonstrates the relationship between the percentage of smudge cells and apoptotic cells with annexin V and 7-AAD staining. CONCLUSIONS: Estimation of smudge cells on a blood smear could be a simple and cheap prognostic test in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia with sensitivity similar to CD38 and ZAP-70 estimation. Combination of these tests raised the sensitivity of their prognostic value.","['Szerafin, Laszlo', 'Jako, Janos', 'Risko, Ferenc', 'Hevessy, Zsuzsanna']","['Szerafin L', 'Jako J', 'Risko F', 'Hevessy Z']",['Josa Andras Oktatokorhaz Egeszsegugyi Szolgaltato Nonprofit Kft.

Here, we retrospectively analyze interphase data of children who underwent HSCT after myeloablative conditioning with BU, CY, and melphalan (BuCyMel) for AML in second remission (CR2) between 1998 and 2009. Out of 152 children, transplant data were available on 109 individuals. Sixty out of 109 children (55%) received BuCyMel. Median age at HSCT was 12.2 years (range 3.0; 18.3). GVHD prophylaxis mostly consisted of CsA and short term MTX with or without antithymocyte globulin. Matched-sibling donors were used for 6/60 analyzed recipients, the remainder either received grafts from matched unrelated (30/60) or mismatched donors. OS after 5 years was 62% (s.e. 6%), relapse incidence 35% (18/60 children) and treatment-related mortality accounted for 12% (7/60) of fatal events.

Multivariate analysis revealed that day +100 AMC (risk ratio (RR) 0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07-0.73, P=0.01) and mild chronic GVHD (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.005-0.43, P=0.008) were independently associated with survival. To explore whether the patterns of lymphocyte and monocyte recovery had a prognostic value, we performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering on the studied hematopoietic parameters and identified three patient clusters, A-C. Patient clusters A and B both had improved OS compared with cluster C (77.8 months vs not reached vs 22.3 months, respectively, P<0.001). No patient in cluster C had a day +100 AMC >300. Both severe acute GVHD and relapse occurred more frequently in cluster C. Our data suggest that patients with low AMC by day +100 post fludarabine/melphalan-conditioned allogeneic hematopoietic SCT may be at risk for poor outcomes.","['DeCook, L J', 'Thoma, M', 'Huneke, T', 'Johnson, N D', 'Wiegand, R A', 'Patnaik, M M', 'Litzow, M R', 'Hogan, W J', 'Porrata, L F', 'Holtan, S G']","['DeCook LJ', 'Thoma M', 'Huneke T', 'Johnson ND', 'Wiegand RA', 'Patnaik MM', 'Litzow MR', 'Hogan WJ', 'Porrata LF', 'Holtan SG']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121029,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,2012/10/30 06:00,2014/05/07 06:00,['2012/10/30 06:00'],"['2012/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/07 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt2012211 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2012.211 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2013 May;48(5):708-14. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2012.211.

METHODS: TLR4 protein and mRNA expression, levels of NF-kappaB protein, and expression of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta in lipopolysaccharide-induced THP-1 cells after incubation with different concentrations of atorvastatin (0.1, 1, 10, 20muM) were quantified via flow-cytometry, quantitative RT-PCR, western blotting, and ELSIA kits. RESULTS: Atorvastatin incubation resulted in significant decreases in the levels of TLR4 protein and mRNA, NF-kappaB expression, and levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta in LPS-induced THP-1 cells (P<0.01). However, compared with the untreated control, the expression of these were significantly increased (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Atorvastatin could inhibit the TLR4 expression and TLR4-dependent downstream signaling in THP-1 cells. These observations imply that the interactions with innate immunity may serve as one of the pleiotropic mechanisms of atorvastatin.","['Yang, Shuan Suo', 'Li, Ruogu', 'Qu, Xinkai', 'Fang, Weiyi', 'Quan, Zhe']","['Yang SS', 'Li R', 'Qu X', 'Fang W', 'Quan Z']","['Department of Cardiology, Central Hospital, Fengxian District, Shanghai 201400, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121001,Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,,2012/10/30 06:00,2013/04/05 06:00,['2012/10/30 06:00'],"['2012/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/11 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0008-8749(12)00172-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellimm.2012.09.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 2012 Sep;279(1):96-102. doi: 10.1016/j.cellimm.2012.09.008.

Dysfunction of the hERG channel can cause Long QT Syndrome (LQTS). A wide variety of structurally diverse therapeutic compounds reduce the hERG current by acute direct inhibition of the hERG current or/and selective disruption of hERG protein expression. Arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)), which is used to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia, can cause LQTS type 2 (LQT2) by reducing the hERG current through the diversion of hERG trafficking to the cytoplasmic membrane. This cardiotoxicity limits its clinical applications. Our aim was to develop cardioprotective agents to decrease As(2)O(3)-induced cardiotoxicity. We reported that superfusion of hERG-expressing HEK293 (hERG-HEK) cells with matrine (1, 10 muM) increased the hERG current by promoting hERG channel activation. Long-term treatment with 1 muM matrine or oxymatrine increased expression of the hERG protein and rescued the hERG surface expression disrupted by As(2)O(3). In addition, Matrine and oxymatrine significantly shortened action potential duration prolonged by As(2)O(3) in guinea pig ventricular myocytes. These results were ascribed to the up-regulation of hERG at both mRNA and protein levels via an increase in the expression of transcription factor Sp1, an established transactivator of the hERG gene. Therefore, matrine and oxymatrine may have the potential to cure LQT2 as a potassium channel activator by promoting hERG channel activation and increasing hERG channel expression.","['Zhang, Ying', 'Dong, Zengxiang', 'Jin, Liyan', 'Zhang, Kaiping', 'Zhao, Xin', 'Fu, Jia', 'Gong, Yan', 'Sun, Mingming', 'Yang, Baofeng', 'Li, Baoxin']","['Zhang Y', 'Dong Z', 'Jin L', 'Zhang K', 'Zhao X', 'Fu J', 'Gong Y', 'Sun M', 'Yang B', 'Li B']","['Department of Pharmacology, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150086, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121024,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,,2012/10/30 06:00,2013/03/01 06:00,['2012/10/30 06:00'],"['2012/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/02 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(12)00611-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2012.09.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2013 Jan 1;85(1):59-68. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2012.09.002.

We used K562/Dox cells overexpressing P-gp and their variants (subclones) with a gradually decreased P-gp expression. These subclones were established by stable transfection of K562/Dox cells with a plasmid vector expressing shRNA targeting the ABCB1 gene. Functional analysis of P-gp using a specific fluorescent probe indicated gradually decreased dye efflux which was proportional to the P-gp expression. We observed that K562/Dox cells overexpressing P-gp contained a significantly reduced intracellular level of nilotinib when compared to their counter partner K562 cells, which do not express P-gp. This effect was accompanied by a decreased sensitivity of the K562/Dox cells to nilotinib. Importantly, cells with downregulated expression of P-gp gradually lost their ability to decrease the intracellular level of nilotinib although they still significantly decreased the intracellular level of daunorubicin (DNR). Accordingly, cells with the reduced expression of P-gp concomitantly failed to provide resistance to nilotinib, however, they exhibited a significant resistance to DNR. Taken together, we demonstrated that the conclusion as to whether P-gp is involved in nilotinib resistance or not strongly depends on its expression at protein level.","['Kosztyu, Petr', 'Dolezel, Petr', 'Mlejnek, Petr']","['Kosztyu P', 'Dolezel P', 'Mlejnek P']","['Department of Biology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc, Hnevotinska 3, Olomouc 77515, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121026,Netherlands,Pharmacol Res,Pharmacological research,8907422,,2012/10/30 06:00,2013/05/25 06:00,['2012/10/30 06:00'],"['2012/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/17 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S1043-6618(12)00199-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.phrs.2012.10.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Pharmacol Res. 2013 Jan;67(1):79-83. doi: 10.1016/j.phrs.2012.10.012.

Unexpectedly, we found that TCF-1-deficient (Tcf7(-/-)) mice developed aggressive T cell malignancy, resembling human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). LEF-1 was aberrantly upregulated in premalignant Tcf7(-/-) early thymocytes and lymphoma cells. We further demonstrated that TCF-1 directly repressed LEF-1 expression in early thymocytes and that conditional inactivation of Lef1 greatly delayed or prevented T cell malignancy in Tcf7(-/-) mice. In human T-ALLs, an early thymic progenitor (ETP) subtype was associated with diminished TCF7 expression, and two of the ETP-ALL cases harbored TCF7 gene deletions. We also showed that TCF-1 and LEF-1 were dispensable for T cell lineage commitment but instead were required for early thymocytes to mature beyond the CD4(-)CD8(-) stage. TCF-1 thus has dual roles, i.e., acting cooperatively with LEF-1 to promote thymocyte maturation while restraining LEF-1 expression to prevent malignant transformation of developing thymocytes.","['Yu, Shuyang', 'Zhou, Xinyuan', 'Steinke, Farrah C', 'Liu, Chengyu', 'Chen, Shann-Ching', 'Zagorodna, Oksana', 'Jing, Xuefang', 'Yokota, Yoshifumi', 'Meyerholz, David K', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'Knudson, C Michael', 'Zhao, Dong-Mei', 'Xue, Hai-Hui']","['Yu S', 'Zhou X', 'Steinke FC', 'Liu C', 'Chen SC', 'Zagorodna O', 'Jing X', 'Yokota Y', 'Meyerholz DK', 'Mullighan CG', 'Knudson CM', 'Zhao DM', 'Xue HH']","['Department of Microbiology, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121025,United States,Immunity,Immunity,9432918,PMC3501598,2012/10/30 06:00,2013/02/05 06:00,['2012/10/30 06:00'],"['2011/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/06 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S1074-7613(12)00372-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.immuni.2012.08.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunity. 2012 Nov 16;37(5):813-26. doi: 10.1016/j.immuni.2012.08.009.

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network and European LeukemiaNet guidelines now include nilotinib and dasatinib in their treatment algorithms for CML. To assess these new guidelines, a cross-sectional survey of US hematologists and/or oncologists was conducted in December 2010 through an online survey. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The survey had 43 questions consisting of items updated from the 2005 survey to reflect changes in clinical practice, tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, and current guidelines. RESULTS: Analysis of the responses from 507 board certified medical oncologists/hematologists suggests that the use of imatinib 400 mg as an initial treatment option had decreased from 62% in 2005 to 52% in the 2010 survey. Currently, nearly 40% of physicians would choose either nilotinib or dasatinib as first-line treatment. From the surveyed physicians, achievement of at least a major molecular response (MMR) is the predominant treatment goal in chronic phase CML. CONCLUSION: This survey emphasizes the need for continued updates and education regarding optimal therapy, monitoring practices, and therapeutic end points in CML.","['Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Deering, Kathleen L', 'Mauro, Michael J']","['Kantarjian HM', 'Larson RA', 'Cortes JE', 'Deering KL', 'Mauro MJ']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. hkantarj@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121025,United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,PMC3645375,2012/10/30 06:00,2013/11/16 06:00,['2012/10/30 06:00'],"['2012/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2012/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(12)00145-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2012.07.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2013 Feb;13(1):48-54. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2012.07.009.

The best raw and postthaw semen quality for cancer patients occurred in those with prostate cancer (TMC of 155.1 and 53.2 x 10(6), respectively) and the worst in those with leukemias. Lymphoid leukemias demonstrated the worst raw TMC (26.8 x 10(6)), but myeloid leukemias displayed the worst postthaw TMC (6.9 x 10(6)). The testicular cancer group was the only group with a statistically significantly lower chance of having TMC >5 x 10(6). CONCLUSION(S): Men with testicular cancer were most commonly referred for sperm cryopreservation and were the only group that was statistically significantly less likely to have TMC >5 x 10(6) on postthaw semen analysis. The most severe reduction in TMC was seen in the myeloid leukemia group, suggesting that these patients along with men with testis cancer and those with lymphoid leukemia should be counseled to provide increased numbers of specimens for fertility preservation.","['Hotaling, James M', 'Lopushnyan, Natalya A', 'Davenport, Michael', 'Christensen, Heather', 'Pagel, Erin R', 'Muller, Charles H', 'Walsh, Thomas J']","['Hotaling JM', 'Lopushnyan NA', 'Davenport M', 'Christensen H', 'Pagel ER', 'Muller CH', 'Walsh TJ']","['Department of Urology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20121025,United States,Fertil Steril,Fertility and sterility,0372772,,2012/10/30 06:00,2013/04/05 06:00,['2012/10/30 06:00'],"['2012/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/17 00:00 [revised]', '2012/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0015-0282(12)02250-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.fertnstert.2012.09.031 [doi]']",ppublish,Fertil Steril. 2013 Feb;99(2):464-9. doi: 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2012.09.031.

We report the case of a 78-year-old man with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), M1 subtype (French-American-British classification), with a t(11;21)(p14;q22). Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed a split signal for RUNX1, which indicated that RUNX1 was involved in this translocation. Using 3'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses, we found that RUNX1 was fused to C11orf41 on 11p14 and detected two in-frame C11orf41-RUNX1 fusion transcripts. One was a fusion between exon 5 of RUNX1 and exon 13 of C11orf41, and the other was between exon 6 of RUNX1 and exon 13 of C11orf41. This suggested that the RUNX1 breakpoint was in intron 6 and had generated alternative fusion splice variants. A reciprocal C11orf41-RUNX1 fusion was not detected. Thus, we identified C11orf41 as a novel fusion partner of RUNX1 in AML.","['Abe, Akihiro', 'Katsumi, Akira', 'Kobayashi, Miki', 'Okamoto, Akinao', 'Tokuda, Masutaka', 'Kanie, Tadaharu', 'Yamamoto, Yukiya', 'Naoe, Tomoki', 'Emi, Nobuhiko']","['Abe A', 'Katsumi A', 'Kobayashi M', 'Okamoto A', 'Tokuda M', 'Kanie T', 'Yamamoto Y', 'Naoe T', 'Emi N']","['Department of Hematology, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Toyoake, Aichi, Japan. aakihiro@fijita-hu.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121024,United States,Cancer Genet,Cancer genetics,101539150,,2012/10/30 06:00,2013/04/05 06:00,['2012/10/30 06:00'],"['2012/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/30 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S2210-7762(12)00250-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergen.2012.10.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet. 2012 Nov;205(11):608-11. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergen.2012.10.001.

We describe 18 patients with t(8;16) AML, including their clinical, cytomorphologic, immunophenotypic and cytogenetic features. Half of the patients had extramedullary disease, most commonly leukemia cutis, which often preceded bone marrow involvement and six had therapy-related AML. Patients with t(8;16) AML commonly present with clinical and pathological features that mimic APL, with promyelocytes and promyeloblast-like cells and coagulopathy in most patients. Several patients also presented with marrow histiocytes with hemophagocytosis and erythrophagocytosis. Comprehensive molecular analysis for co-occurring genetic alterations revealed a somatic mutation in RUNX1 in 1 of 6 t(8;16) patients with no known AML mutation in the remaining five t(8;16) patients. This suggests that the t(8;16) translocation could be sufficient to induce hematopoietic cell transformation to AML without acquiring other genetic alteration. These data further support classifying t(8;16) AML as a clinically and molecularly defined subtype of AML marked by characteristic clinical and cytomorphologic features that mimic APL, and is associated with very poor survival.","['Diab, Adi', 'Zickl, Lynette', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar', 'Jhanwar, Suresh', 'Gulam, Manjit A', 'Panageas, Katherine S', 'Patel, Jay P', 'Jurcic, Joseph', 'Maslak, Peter', 'Paietta, Elisabeth', 'Mangan, James K', 'Carroll, Martin', 'Fernandez, Hugo F', 'Teruya-Feldstein, Julie', 'Luger, Selina M', 'Douer, Dan', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Lazarus, Hillard M', 'Rowe, Jacob M', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Tallman, Martin S']","['Diab A', 'Zickl L', 'Abdel-Wahab O', 'Jhanwar S', 'Gulam MA', 'Panageas KS', 'Patel JP', 'Jurcic J', 'Maslak P', 'Paietta E', 'Mangan JK', 'Carroll M', 'Fernandez HF', 'Teruya-Feldstein J', 'Luger SM', 'Douer D', 'Litzow MR', 'Lazarus HM', 'Rowe JM', 'Levine RL', 'Tallman MS']","['Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA. diaba@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121024,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,PMC5382928,2012/10/30 06:00,2013/03/21 06:00,['2012/10/30 06:00'],"['2012/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/18 00:00 [revised]', '2012/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(12)00358-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2012.08.025 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2013 Jan;37(1):32-6. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2012.08.025.

Forced expression of SGOL1 in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) significantly increased colony numbers for CFU-M and CFU-GM compared with control vector transduced infected HSPCs, suggesting that SGOL1 might act as an oncogene in hematopoietic cells. In addition, we found that repression of SGOL1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) slowed the proliferation of NB4, EOL-1 and U937 cells compared with the control siRNA transfected cells, in parallel with the appearance of precocious dissociation of centromeric cohesion and separation of sister chromatids in these cells. Furthermore, we found that repression of SGOL1 by siRNA accumulated EOL-1 and U937 cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, in conjunction with up-regulation of the spindle checkpoint protein BubR1, followed by apoptosis via caspase pathways. Thus, SGOL1 might be a promising molecular target for treating individuals with AML.","['Yang, Jing', 'Ikezoe, Takayuki', 'Nishioka, Chie', 'Yokoyama, Akihito']","['Yang J', 'Ikezoe T', 'Nishioka C', 'Yokoyama A']","['Department of Hematology and Respiratory Medicine, Kochi Medical School, Kochi University, Nankoku, Kochi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121024,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,2012/10/30 06:00,2013/03/21 06:00,['2012/10/30 06:00'],"['2012/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2012/08/31 00:00 [revised]', '2012/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/03/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(12)00403-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2012.10.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2013 Jan;37(1):76-82. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2012.10.002.

We have recently developed ethyl 2-amino-6-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-(2-ethoxy-2-oxoethyl)-4H-chromene-3-carboxylate (CXL017), derived from a dual inhibitor of Bcl-2 and SERCA proteins, sHA 14-1, with selective cytotoxicity toward MDR cancer cell lines in vitro. In this study, we present new evidence for its therapeutic potential in treatment of MDR cancers and offer mechanistic insights toward its preferential targeting of drug-resistant cancer. CXL017 selectively suppressed the growth of tumors derived from the MDR cancer cell line, HL60/MX2, in vivo. In addition, even after chronic exposure to CXL017, HL60/MX2 failed to develop stable resistance to CXL017, whereas it acquired >2000-fold resistance to cytarabine (Ara-C), the major first-line chemotherapy for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Remarkably, instead of acquiring further cross-resistance, HL60/MX2 cells exposed to CXL017 were resensitized to standard therapies (10- to 100-fold). Western blotting analyses revealed that CXL017 exposure significantly down-regulated Mcl-1 and Bax and up-regulated Noxa, Bim, Bcl-X(L), SERCA2, and SERCA3 proteins, along with a reduction in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium content. Given the well-established functions of Bcl-2 family proteins and ER calcium in drug resistance, our results suggest that the down-regulation of Mcl-1 and the up-regulation of Noxa and Bim along with the decrease in ER calcium content are likely responsible for CXL017-induced resensitization of MDR cancer cells. These data also demonstrate the unique potential of CXL017 to overcome MDR in cancer treatment.","['Das, Sonia G', 'Hermanson, David L', 'Bleeker, Nicholas', 'Lowman, Xazmin', 'Li, Yunfang', 'Kelekar, Ameeta', 'Xing, Chengguo']","['Das SG', 'Hermanson DL', 'Bleeker N', 'Lowman X', 'Li Y', 'Kelekar A', 'Xing C']","['Department of Medicinal Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, University of Minnesota, 308 Harvard Street SE, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121105,United States,ACS Chem Biol,ACS chemical biology,101282906,PMC3574219,2012/10/30 06:00,2014/12/19 06:00,['2012/10/30 06:00'],"['2012/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/cb300460f [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Chem Biol. 2013 Feb 15;8(2):327-35. doi: 10.1021/cb300460f.

Risks of leukemia/lung/breast/colorectal and bladder cancer were higher in NHL compared with the general population. A higher risk of leukemia was restricted to patients given a cumulative dose of cyclophosphamide more than 11 250 mg/m(2). However, no significant association was found between SMN risk with rituximab, fludarabine, anthracyclines, epipodophyllotoxins and platinum, respectively. In combined modality treatment, involved- fi eld radiation therapy (IFRT) had a higher risk for second solid cancers as compared to involved-nodal radiation therapy (INRT). For patients receiving radiation doses exceeding 40 Gy, the risk of lung cancer and breast cancer was increased.

We used methods for apoptosis assessment (cell viability count and flow-cytometric analysis) and cell cycle analysis (DNA content measurement) and we detected expression and post-translational modifications (Western blotting) of proteins involved in DNA repair signalling pathways. Pre-treatment with NU7026 resulted into decreased activation of checkpoint kinase-2 (Thr68), p53 (Ser15 and Ser392), and histone H2A.X (Ser139) 2 hours after irradiation. Subsequently, combination of radiation and inhibitor led to decreased amount of cells in G2-phase arrest and into increased apoptosis after 72 hours. Our results indicate that in leukaemic cells the pre-incubation with inhibitor NU7026 followed by low doses of ionising radiation results in radio-sensitising of MOLT-4 cells via diminished DNA repair and delayed but pronounced apoptosis. This novel approach might offer new strategies in combined treatment of leukaemia diseases.","['Tichy, Ales', 'Novotna, Eva', 'Durisova, Kamila', 'Salovska, Barbora', 'Sedlarikova, Radka', 'Pejchal, Jaroslav', 'Zarybnicka, Lenka', 'Vavrova, Jirina', 'Sinkorova, Zuzana', 'Rezacova, Martina']","['Tichy A', 'Novotna E', 'Durisova K', 'Salovska B', 'Sedlarikova R', 'Pejchal J', 'Zarybnicka L', 'Vavrova J', 'Sinkorova Z', 'Rezacova M']","['Department of Radiobiology, University of Defence in Brno, Faculty of Health Sciences in Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic. tichy@pmfhk.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Czech Republic,Acta Medica (Hradec Kralove),Acta medica (Hradec Kralove),9705947,,2012/10/30 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2012/10/30 06:00'],"['2012/10/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.14712/18059694.2015.57 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Medica (Hradec Kralove). 2012;55(2):66-73. doi: 10.14712/18059694.2015.57.,"['0 (2-(morpholin-4-yl)benzo(h)chromen-4-one)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (DNA-Activated Protein Kinase)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/radiation effects', 'Cell Cycle/radiation effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/radiation effects', 'Cell Proliferation/radiation effects', 'Chromones/*pharmacology', 'DNA Damage/radiation effects', 'DNA Repair/radiation effects', 'DNA-Activated Protein Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Gamma Rays', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*radiotherapy', 'Morpholines/*pharmacology', 'Radiation Tolerance/*drug effects', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/*pharmacology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is possibly because of the considerable clinical, cytological and histological similarities between these two disorders. As prognostic and therapeutic approach to AA and HMDS are different, it is imperative to differentiate them at the time of initial diagnosis. Various attempts have been made in the past to differentiate AA from HMDS. In the present study, we explored the value of certain new parameters i.e. S-phase fraction (SPF) and aneuploidy that could be used for this purpose. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 46 consecutive patients with aplastic anemia, 15 patients with HMDS along with 32 age and sex-matched control subjects. S-phase fraction and aneuploidy analysis was carried out by flow cytometry using Mod Fit-LT V3.0 software. RESULTS: The mean SPF value was significantly lower (p=0.02) in patients with AA and higher (p=0.01) in HMDS as compared to that of the control. Aneuploidy was present in 15.2% patients with AA and in 33.3% HMDS cases. During follow-up, 4 patients with AA developed MDS, out of these, three patients had aneuploidy as well as high SPF value at the time of diagnosis. Two patients with HMDS who had aneuploidy and high SPF, converted into AML. Eleven patients died during the study, in whom 8 had aneuploidy and high SPF value. CONCLUSION: We conclude that high SPF value and presence of aneuploidy favour the diagnosis of HMDS rather than AA. SPF and aneuploidy may be important parameters in patients with AA to predict their propensity to evolve into myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. SPF value may also be useful in the early diagnosis of HMDS before morphologically evidence of dysplasia is apparent.","['Tripathi, Payal', 'Tripathi, Anil Kumar', 'Kumar, Ashutosh', 'Ahmad, Rizwan', 'Balapure, Anil Kumar', 'Vishwakerma, Achchhe Lal']","['Tripathi P', 'Tripathi AK', 'Kumar A', 'Ahmad R', 'Balapure AK', 'Vishwakerma AL']","['Department of Medicine, C.S.M.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: PRP-PC and BC-PC were prepared from whole blood and Apheresis-PC by automated cell separator. The post transfusion efficacy of transfused platelets was assessed at 1 hour and 20 hours by corrected count increment (CCI) and percentage recovery (PR). RESULTS: A total of 60 patients' (20 each for PRP-PC, BC-PC and Apheresis-PC) were enrolled in this study. Forty one patients received therapeutic and nineteen received prophylactic transfusion support. Patients with aplastic anemia 43% (25/60) and acute leukemia 38% (23/60) formed a majority of study population. Platelet dosage of patients' received PRP-PC, BC-PC and apheresis-PC were 2.4+/-0.82 x 1011 (mean+/-SD), 2.2+/-0.83 x 1011 (mean+/-SD) and 4.14+/-1.82 x 1011 (mean+/-SD) and ranged from 1.16-4.11 x 1011, 1.04-4.20 x 1011 and 1.22-8.90 x 1011 respectively.

The diagnosis involves a multiparameter approach. The geographical distribution of various types of hematological malignancies has been provided by various authors but no such data have been published regarding the State of Uttarakhand in India. AIM: To study the hematological malignancies at Uttarakhand in India based on age, sex and the type of malignancy with further sub typing wherever possible. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A total of 220 cases of hematological malignancies were worked up from the Reference Laboratory of Himalayan Institute of Medical Sciences over an eight year period (1998-2005). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diagnosis was mainly based on morphological examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow smears stained by Leishman's stain and MPO, Sudan Black and PAS stain as and where required. Distribution of cases was studied based on age, sex and the type of malignancy with further sub typing wherever possible. RESULTS: The most common hematological malignancy was found to be Leukemia 129/220 (58%) followed b Lymphoma 33/220 (14.8%), Multiple Myeloma 55/220 (24.7%) and Metastatic Lesions 3/220 (1.3%). These malignancies were seen to be distributed throughout all ages with a peak at 11-20 years age group 39/220 (17.5%) and another peak at 51-60 years age group 41/220 (18.4%). We found an overall male preponderance with a M:F ratio of 2.3:1. CONCLUSIONS: The commonest haematological malignancy in our series was Leukemia. Other diagnoses were Multiple Myeloma, Lymphoma and Secondaries. Multiple Myeloma which turned out to be the second most common diagnosis was an unusual finding.","['Kusum, Anuradha', 'Negi, Gita', 'Gaur, Dushyant Singh', 'Kishore, Sanjeev', 'Meena, Harsh', 'Sharma, Anita', 'Verma, S K']","['Kusum A', 'Negi G', 'Gaur DS', 'Kishore S', 'Meena H', 'Sharma A', 'Verma SK']","['Departments of Pathology & Medicine, Himalayan Institute of Medical Sciences, Jolly Grant, Dehradun, 248 140 Uttarakhand India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080501,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,PMC3453163,2008/03/01 00:00,2008/03/01 00:01,['2012/10/27 06:00'],"['2008/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2008/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-008-0016-9 [doi]', '16 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2008 Mar;24(1):7-11. doi: 10.1007/s12288-008-0016-9.

The levels and the prognostic relevance of serum endostatin in AML patient is not fully clear. AIM: To evaluate serum levels of endostatin in acute myeloid leukemia patients before chemotherapy and after achieving complete remission and to correlate endostatin levels with patients outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum samples from 30 adult patients (22 males and 8 females, median age 37, range 19-66 years) with AML had been taken before chemotherapy was administered. In addition 20 out of 30 patients were reinvestigated again at complete remission (CR). Ten samples from healthy normal persons of matched age and sex were evaluated as a reference control group. Serum endostatin levels were determined using enzyme linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Endostatin serum levels were not significantly different in the pretreatment AML patients as compared to that in normal controls (P>0.05). In AML patients the baseline endostatin levels were significantly lower than at CR (P=0.001). No significant correlation were detected between pretreatment serum endostatin levels and age, peripheral blood white cell counts, platelet counts, bone marrow blast cell counts, blast cell distribution ratio. The prognostic value of sE was also evaluated by dividing AML patients into high and low sE groups using the 75 percentile sE levels of the patients group as cutoff. The authors found that patients group in the high sE group survived for significantly longer time than those patients in the low sE group. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated endostatin levels at AML diagnosis is a good prognostic marker for patients' outcome. Wide scale study is recommended in order to establish the clinical value of this study.","['Aref, S', 'El-Sherbiny, M', 'Azmy, E', 'Goda, T', 'Selim, T', 'El-Refaie, M', 'Emaad, T']","['Aref S', 'El-Sherbiny M', 'Azmy E', 'Goda T', 'Selim T', 'El-Refaie M', 'Emaad T']","['Mansoura Cancer Institute, Mansoura Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080501,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,PMC3453162,2008/03/01 00:00,2008/03/01 00:01,['2012/10/27 06:00'],"['2008/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2008/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-008-0015-x [doi]', '15 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2008 Mar;24(1):1-6. doi: 10.1007/s12288-008-0015-x.

Pgp over expression has been demonstrated to be linked with poor treatment outcome and poor prognosis in a number of malignant tumors. AgNORs is a simple, reliable and inexpensive method of evaluating the proliferative activity of a tumor. We have studied MDR1 expression and AgNORS in 41 cases of acute leukemia in children. In this study, AgNOR counts in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) L2 subtype (FAB classification) were significantly higher as compared to the ALL L1 subtype. Similarly, mean AgNOR count in the acute myeloid Leukemia (AML) M2 subtype was significantly higher as compared to the ALL L1 subtype. However, there was no correlation between AgNOR and treatment outcome or between AgNOR counts and MDR1 expression in any of the subtypes of acute leukemia included in this series. In AML, MDR1 gene expression was found to be related to reduced remission induction rates and hence poorer prognosis. In ALL, our study has shown no difference in remission induction between MDR1 positive and MDR1 negative cases. This would suggest that factors other than MDR1 may be of relevance in Pediatric ALL.","['Balamurugan, S', 'Sugapriya, D', 'Shanthi, P', 'Thilaka, V', 'Venkatadesilalu, S', 'Pushpa, V', 'Madhavan, M']","['Balamurugan S', 'Sugapriya D', 'Shanthi P', 'Thilaka V', 'Venkatadesilalu S', 'Pushpa V', 'Madhavan M']","['Dept of pathology, Madras Medical College, Chennai, 600 002 India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080319,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,PMC3453125,2007/12/01 00:00,2007/12/01 00:01,['2012/10/27 06:00'],"['2012/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2007/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-008-0002-2 [doi]', '2 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2007 Dec;23(3-4):73-8. doi: 10.1007/s12288-008-0002-2.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that recently emerged as master regulator of gene expression by targeting protein-coding mRNAs. However, miRNAs involvement in the regulation of the epigenetic machinery and their potential use as therapeutics in MM remain to be investigated. Here, we provide evidence that the expression of de novo DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) is deregulated in MM cells. Moreover, we show that miR-29b targets DNMT3A and DNMT3B mRNAs and reduces global DNA methylation in MM cells. In vitro transfection of MM cells with synthetic miR-29b mimics significantly impairs cell cycle progression and also potentiates the growth-inhibitory effects induced by the demethylating agent 5-azacitidine. Most importantly, in vivo intratumor or systemic delivery of synthetic miR-29b mimics, in two clinically relevant murine models of human MM, including the SCID-synth-hu system, induces significant anti-tumor effects. All together, our findings demonstrate that aberrant DNMTs expression is efficiently modulated by tumor suppressive synthetic miR-29b mimics, indicating that methyloma modulation is a novel matter of investigation in miRNA-based therapy of MM.","['Amodio, Nicola', 'Leotta, Marzia', 'Bellizzi, Dina', 'Di Martino, Maria Teresa', ""D'Aquila, Patrizia"", 'Lionetti, Marta', 'Fabiani, Fernanda', 'Leone, Emanuela', 'Gulla, Anna Maria', 'Passarino, Giuseppe', 'Caraglia, Michele', 'Negrini, Massimo', 'Neri, Antonino', 'Giordano, Antonio', 'Tagliaferri, Pierosandro', 'Tassone, Pierfrancesco']","['Amodio N', 'Leotta M', 'Bellizzi D', 'Di Martino MT', ""D'Aquila P"", 'Lionetti M', 'Fabiani F', 'Leone E', 'Gulla AM', 'Passarino G', 'Caraglia M', 'Negrini M', 'Neri A', 'Giordano A', 'Tagliaferri P', 'Tassone P']","['Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Magna Graecia University and Medical Oncology Unit, T.

Leukemia and lymphoma, along with lung failure, are the main causes of morbidity and mortality in A-T patients. At present, no effective therapy for A-T exists. One promising therapeutic approach is bone marrow transplantation (BMT) that is already used as a curative therapy for other genomic instability syndromes. We used an established clinically relevant non-myeloablative host-conditioning regimen and transplanted green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-competent bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) into Atm-deficient mice. GFP expression allowed tracking of the potential migration of the cells into the tissues of recipient animals. Donor BMDCs migrated into the bone marrow, blood, thymus, spleen and lung tissue of Atm-deficient mice showing an ATM-competent phenotype. BMT inhibited thymic lymphomas, normalized T-lymphocyte populations, improved weight gain and rearing activity of Atm-deficient mice. In contrast, no GFP(+) cells were found in the cerebellum or cerebrum, and we detected decreased size index in MRI imaging of the cerebellum in 8-month-old transplanted Atm-deficient mice in comparison to wild-type mice.

Interestingly, miR-181a expression was increased in CN-AML patients harboring CEBPA mutations, which are usually biallelic and associate with better prognosis. CEBPA encodes the C/EBPalpha transcription factor. We demonstrate here that the presence of N-terminal CEBPA mutations and miR-181a expression are linked. Indeed, the truncated C/EBPalpha-p30 isoform, which is produced from the N-terminal mutant CEBPA gene or from the differential translation of wild-type CEBPA mRNA and is commonly believed to have no transactivation activity, binds to the miR-181a-1 promoter and up-regulates the microRNA expression. Furthermore, we show that lenalidomide, a drug approved for myelodysplastic syndromes and multiple myeloma, enhances translation of the C/EBPalpha-p30 isoform, resulting in higher miR-181a levels. In xenograft mouse models, ectopic miR-181a expression inhibits tumor growth. Similarly, lenalidomide exhibits antitumorigenic activity paralleled by increased miR-181a expression. This regulatory pathway may explain an increased sensitivity to apoptosis-inducing chemotherapy in subsets of AML patients. Altogether, our data provide a potential explanation for the improved clinical outcomes observed in CEBPA-mutated CN-AML patients, and suggest that lenalidomide treatment enhancing the C/EBPalpha-p30 protein levels and in turn miR-181a may sensitize AML blasts to chemotherapy.","['Hickey, Christopher J', 'Schwind, Sebastian', 'Radomska, Hanna S', 'Dorrance, Adrienne M', 'Santhanam, Ramasamy', 'Mishra, Anjali', 'Wu, Yue-Zhong', 'Alachkar, Houda', 'Maharry, Kati', 'Nicolet, Deedra', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Walker, Alison', 'Eiring, Anna M', 'Whitman, Susan P', 'Becker, Heiko', 'Perrotti, Danilo', 'Wu, Lai-Chu', 'Zhao, Xi', 'Fehniger, Todd A', 'Vij, Ravi', 'Byrd, John C', 'Blum, William', 'Lee, L James', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Garzon, Ramiro', 'Marcucci, Guido']","['Hickey CJ', 'Schwind S', 'Radomska HS', 'Dorrance AM', 'Santhanam R', 'Mishra A', 'Wu YZ', 'Alachkar H', 'Maharry K', 'Nicolet D', 'Mrozek K', 'Walker A', 'Eiring AM', 'Whitman SP', 'Becker H', 'Perrotti D', 'Wu LC', 'Zhao X', 'Fehniger TA', 'Vij R', 'Byrd JC', 'Blum W', 'Lee LJ', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Garzon R', 'Marcucci G']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20121025,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC3538328,2012/10/27 06:00,2013/02/26 06:00,['2012/10/27 06:00'],"['2012/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47335-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-05-428573 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Jan 3;121(1):159-69. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-05-428573.

In the present study, we retrospectively analyzed 35 patients who experienced progression of or relapsed persistent ATL after a first allo-SCT at 3 institutions in Nagasaki prefecture (Japan) between 1997 and 2010. Twenty-nine patients were treated by the withdrawal of immune suppressants as the initial intervention, which resulted in complete remission (CR) in 2 patients. As the second intervention, 9 patients went on to receive a combination of donor lymphocyte infusion and cytoreductive therapy and CR was achieved in 4 patients. Of 6 patients who had already had their immune suppressants discontinued before the relapse, 3 patients with local recurrence received local cytoreductive therapy as the initial treatment, which resulted in CR for more than 19 months. Donor lymphocyte infusion-induced remissions of ATL were durable, with 3 cases of long-term remission of more than 3 years and, interestingly, the emergence or progression of chronic GVHD was observed in all of these cases. For all 35 patients, overall survival after relapse was 19.3% at 3 years. The results of the present study suggest that induction of a graft-versus-ATL effect may be crucial to obtaining durable remission for ATL patients with relapse or progression after allo-SCT.","['Itonaga, Hidehiro', 'Tsushima, Hideki', 'Taguchi, Jun', 'Fukushima, Takuya', 'Taniguchi, Hiroaki', 'Sato, Shinya', 'Ando, Koji', 'Sawayama, Yasushi', 'Matsuo, Emi', 'Yamasaki, Reishi', 'Onimaru, Yasuyuki', 'Imanishi, Daisuke', 'Imaizumi, Yoshitaka', 'Yoshida, Shinichiro', 'Hata, Tomoko', 'Moriuchi, Yukiyoshi', 'Uike, Naokuni', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi']","['Itonaga H', 'Tsushima H', 'Taguchi J', 'Fukushima T', 'Taniguchi H', 'Sato S', 'Ando K', 'Sawayama Y', 'Matsuo E', 'Yamasaki R', 'Onimaru Y', 'Imanishi D', 'Imaizumi Y', 'Yoshida S', 'Hata T', 'Moriuchi Y', 'Uike N', 'Miyazaki Y']","['Department of Hematology, Sasebo City General Hospital, Sasebo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121024,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2012/10/27 06:00,2013/02/26 06:00,['2012/10/27 06:00'],"['2012/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)47341-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2012-07-444372 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2013 Jan 3;121(1):219-25. doi: 10.1182/blood-2012-07-444372.

The role of microRNA-34b and CREB in patients with myeloid malignancies has never been evaluated. We examined microRNA-34b expression and the methylation status of its promoter in cells from patients diagnosed with myeloid malignancies. We used gene expression profiling to identify signatures of myeloid transformation. We established that microRNA-34b has suppressor ability and that CREB has oncogenic potential in primary bone marrow cell cultures and in vivo. MicroRNA-34b was found to be up-regulated in pediatric patients with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (n=17) and myelodysplastic syndromes (n=28), but was down-regulated in acute myeloid leukemia patients at diagnosis (n=112). Our results showed that hypermethylation of the microRNA-34b promoter occurred in 66% of cases of acute myeloid leukemia explaining the low microRNA-34b levels and CREB overexpression, whereas preleukemic myelodysplastic syndromes and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia were not associated with hypermethylation or CREB overexpression. In paired samples taken from the same patients when they had myelodysplastic syndrome and again during the subsequent acute myeloid leukemia, we confirmed microRNA-34b promoter hypermethylation at leukemia onset, with 103 CREB target genes differentially expressed between the two disease stages. This subset of CREB targets was confirmed to associate with high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes in a separate cohort of patients (n=20). Seventy-eight of these 103 CREB targets were also differentially expressed between healthy samples (n=11) and de novo acute myeloid leukemia (n=72). Further, low microRNA-34b and high CREB expression levels induced aberrant myelopoiesis through CREB-dependent pathways in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, we suggest that microRNA-34b controls CREB expression and contributes to myeloid transformation from both healthy bone marrow and myelodysplastic syndromes. We identified a subset of CREB target genes that represents a novel transcriptional network that may control myeloid transformation.","['Pigazzi, Martina', 'Manara, Elena', 'Bresolin, Silvia', 'Tregnago, Claudia', 'Beghin, Alessandra', 'Baron, Emma', 'Giarin, Emanuela', 'Cho, Er-Chieh', 'Masetti, Riccardo', 'Rao, Dinesh S', 'Sakamoto, Kathleen M', 'Basso, Giuseppe']","['Pigazzi M', 'Manara E', 'Bresolin S', 'Tregnago C', 'Beghin A', 'Baron E', 'Giarin E', 'Cho EC', 'Masetti R', 'Rao DS', 'Sakamoto KM', 'Basso G']","['Women and Child Health Department, Hematology-Oncology Laboratory, University of Padova, Padova, Italy. martina.pigazzi@unipd.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121025,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,PMC3659992,2012/10/27 06:00,2013/12/16 06:00,['2012/10/27 06:00'],"['2012/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2012.070664 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2012.070664 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2013 Apr;98(4):602-10. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2012.070664.

We have developed a novel protocol to expand GDTc from human blood whereby GDTc were initially expanded in the presence of alpha beta T cells (ABTc) that were then depleted prior to use. We achieved clinically relevant expansions of up to 18,485-fold total GDTc, with 18,849-fold expansion of the Vdelta1 GDTc subset over 21 days. ABTc depletion yielded 88.1 +/- 4.2 % GDTc purity, and GDTc continued to expand after separation. Immunophenotyping revealed that expanded GDTc were mostly CD27-CD45RA- and CD27-CD45RA+ effector memory cells. GDTc cytotoxicity against PC-3M prostate cancer, U87 glioblastoma and EM-2 leukemia cells was confirmed. Both expanded Vdelta1 and Vdelta2 GDTc were cytotoxic to PC-3M in a T cell antigen receptor- and CD18-dependent manner. We are the first to label GDTc with ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) nanoparticles for cellular MRI. Using protamine sulfate and magnetofection, we achieved up to 40 % labeling with clinically approved Feraheme (Ferumoxytol), as determined by enumeration of Perls' Prussian blue-stained cytospins. Electron microscopy at 2,800x magnification verified the presence of internalized clusters of iron oxide; however, high iron uptake correlated negatively with cell viability. We found improved USPIO uptake later in culture. MRI of GDTc in agarose phantoms was performed at 3 Tesla. The signal-to-noise ratios for unlabeled and labeled cells were 56 and 21, respectively. Thus, Feraheme-labeled GDTc could be readily detected in vitro via MRI.","['Siegers, Gabrielle M', 'Ribot, Emeline J', 'Keating, Armand', 'Foster, Paula J']","['Siegers GM', 'Ribot EJ', 'Keating A', 'Foster PJ']","['Imaging Research Laboratories, Robarts Research Institute, Western University, London, ON, Canada. gsiegers@uwo.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121026,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,,2012/10/27 06:00,2013/05/03 06:00,['2012/10/27 06:00'],"['2012/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2012/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-012-1353-y [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2013 Mar;62(3):571-83. doi: 10.1007/s00262-012-1353-y.

Voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.3 has increasingly been demonstrated to play an important role in the modulation of macrophage function. Here, we investigate the role of Kv1.3 in modulating cholesterol-metabolism-associated molecules in human acute monocytic leukemia cell-derived macrophages (THP-1 macrophages) and human monocyte-derived macrophages exposed to oxidized LDL (ox-LDL). Human Kv1.3 and Kv1.5 channels (hKv1.3 and hKv1.5) are expressed in macrophages and form a heteromultimeric channel. The hKv1.3-E314 antibody that we had generated as a specific hKv1.3 blocker inhibited outward delayed rectifier potassium currents, whereas the hKv1.5-E313 antibody that we had generated as a specific hKv1.5 blocker failed. Accordingly, the hKv1.3-E314 antibody reduced percentage of cholesterol ester and enhanced apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux in THP-1 macrophages and human monocyte-derived macrophages exposed to ox-LDL. The hKv1.3-E314 antibody downregulated SR-A, LOX-1, and ACAT1 expression and upregulated ABCA1 expression in THP-1 macrophages and human monocyte-derived macrophages. Our results reveal that specific Kv1.3 blockade represents a novel strategy modulating cholesterol metabolism in macrophages, which benefits the treatment of atherosclerotic lesions.","['Yang, Yong', 'Wang, Yan-Fu', 'Yang, Xiao-Fang', 'Wang, Zhao-Hui', 'Lian, Yi-Tian', 'Yang, Ying', 'Li, Xiao-Wei', 'Gao, Xiang', 'Chen, Jian', 'Shu, Yan-Wen', 'Cheng, Long-Xian', 'Liao, Yu-Hua', 'Liu, Kun']","['Yang Y', 'Wang YF', 'Yang XF', 'Wang ZH', 'Lian YT', 'Yang Y', 'Li XW', 'Gao X', 'Chen J', 'Shu YW', 'Cheng LX', 'Liao YH', 'Liu K']","['Department of Cardiology, Union Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20121024,United States,J Lipid Res,Journal of lipid research,0376606,PMC3520537,2012/10/27 06:00,2013/05/29 06:00,['2012/10/27 06:00'],"['2012/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/05/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-2275(20)41759-6 [pii]', '10.1194/jlr.M023846 [doi]']",ppublish,J Lipid Res. 2013 Jan;54(1):34-43. doi: 10.1194/jlr.M023846.

However, its use is associated with a disruption in the physiological balance between haemostatic and anticoagulant pathways, with the predominant clinical manifestation being thrombosis. Although L-Asp therapy is known to be associated with an acquired deficiency of antithrombin (AT), the concurrent depletion of fibrinogen and other haemostatic proteins means that the precise mechanism of thrombosis remains to be defined. In vitro coagulation assays are often prolonged but thrombosis rather than haemorrhage is the primary concern. Management of thrombotic events in these patients is based around agents that rely on AT for their anticoagulant effect, even though it is usually depleted. There is currently only limited evidence supporting the use of AT concentrates in either primary prevention or management following an established event. Evidence-based guidelines for prevention and management strategies are lacking.","['Truelove, E', 'Fielding, A K', 'Hunt, B J']","['Truelove E', 'Fielding AK', 'Hunt BJ']","['Department of Haematology, Nottingham University Hospitals, Nottingham, UK.

METHOD: This qualitative research used semi-structured interviews with seven nurse practitioners (NPs) practicing in the rural southeastern part of North Carolina. Flanagan's critical incident technique was used to describe the experiences of NPs providing health care for Latino children and parents. RESULTS: Data analysis indicates that the most commonly reported illnesses by Latino children are upper respiratory infections and asthma, followed by otitis media, obesity, anemia, pneumonia, leukemia, and tumors. Barriers to health care for children included language and cultural differences, lack of access to care (e.g., lack of insurance, cost, and transportation), and health illiteracy/low education level of parents. The findings also suggest that Latinos are preserving their traditional health practices when treating their children's illnesses, such as through use of foods, hot/cold items, herbs, coin on ""belly button,"" traditional juices, healing bracelets, and evil eye. DISCUSSION: The findings of the study imply the need to incorporate culturally sensitive care when providing care for Latino children and parents.","['Kim-Godwin, YeounSoo', 'McMurry, Megan J']","['Kim-Godwin Y', 'McMurry MJ']","['School of Nursing, University of North Carolina, Wilmington, NC 28403, USA. kimy@uncw.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20110507,United States,J Pediatr Health Care,Journal of pediatric health care : official publication of National Association of Pediatric Nurse Associates & Practitioners,8709735,,2012/10/27 06:00,2014/01/01 06:00,['2012/10/27 06:00'],"['2010/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/16 00:00 [revised]', '2011/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2012/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0891-5245(11)00082-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.pedhc.2011.02.013 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Health Care. 2012 Nov-Dec;26(6):409-17. doi: 10.1016/j.pedhc.2011.02.013.

STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-eight infertile women with ultrasonographically homogeneous (group 1) or trilaminar (group 2) endometria in the late follicular phase underwent endometrial biopsies. Some molecular markers and development of pinopodes were evaluated. RESULTS: In the late follicular phase, the mean level of vascular endothelial growth factor was significantly lower in group 1 than in group 2 (0.96 +/- 0.37 marks vs 1.39 +/- 0.46 marks; P = .010). In the mid luteal phase, a decreased leukemia inhibitory factor and integrin alpha v beta 3 levels were found in group 1 (1.58 +/- 0.99 marks vs 2.59 +/- 0.61 marks; 1.85 +/- 0.72 marks vs 2.60 +/- 0.73 marks; 1.92 +/- 0.91 marks vs 2.83 +/- 0.57 marks; P = .003; P = .011; P = .004).

Risk stratification in ALL has also a vital role in predicting outcome and identifying patients at higher risk of relapse with multiagent chemotherapy, but the role of diagnostic karyotype and molecular markers in adult ALL is limited to few well recognized cytogenetic abnormalities. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report a case series of 6 adult ALL patients with a characteristic molecular abnormality that have done poorly with chemotherapy. Between April 2004 and November 2009, 72 adult ALL patients (Pre-B-cell 61; T-cell 11) were referred to and treated at the Leukemia/BMT Program of BC in Vancouver, Canada. FISH for BCR-ABL fusion was positive in 12 of 61 Pre-B cell ALL patients. An additional 6 patients were negative for this typical fusion but had FISH abnormalities related to BCR and/or ABL1. RESULTS: In this report, we describe the clinical and hematopathologic characteristics of these 6 patients and their poor outcome. We review the literature where only 2 similar cases with normal karyotype Pre-B ALL and associated FISH BCR/ABL1 numerical abnormalities were found. CONCLUSION: We recommend screening all adult pre-B ALL patients with normal karyotype for this clonal abnormality and suggest classifying these ALL patients into the high-risk category.","['Abou Mourad, Yasser R', 'Bhargava, Rahul', 'Bruyere, Helene', 'Gillian, Tanya', 'Barnett, Michael J', 'Forrest, Donna L', 'Nevill, Thomas J', 'Toze, Cynthia L', 'Nantel, Stephen H', 'Shepherd, John D']","['Abou Mourad YR', 'Bhargava R', 'Bruyere H', 'Gillian T', 'Barnett MJ', 'Forrest DL', 'Nevill TJ', 'Toze CL', 'Nantel SH', 'Shepherd JD']","['Leukemia/BMT Program of BC, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver General Hospital and University of British Columbia, British Columbia, Canada.

METHODS: Incident cases and population data from 1983 to 2008 were obtained from the Hong Kong Cancer Registry and the Census and Statistics Department, respectively. Age- standardized incidence rates (ASIR) were estimated and joinpoint regression was applied to detect significant changes in cancer morbidity. RESULTS: For all cancers combined, the ASIR showed declining trends (1.37% in men, 0.94% in women), this also being the case for cancers of lung, liver, nasopharynx, stomach, bladder, oesophagus for both genders and cervix cancer for women. With cancer of thyroid, prostate, male colorectal, corpus uteri, ovary and female breast cancer an increase was evident throughout the period. The incidence for leukemia showed a stable trend since early 1990 s, following an earlier decrease. CONCLUSIONS: Although overall cancer incidence rates and certain cancers showed declining trends, incidence trends for colorectal, thyroid and sex-related cancers continue to rise. These trends in cancer morbidity can be used as an important resource to plan and develop effective programs aimed at the control and prevention of the spread of cancer amongst the Hong Kong population. It is particularly useful in allowing projection of future burdens on the society with the increase in certain cancer incidences.","['Xie, Wen-Chuan', 'Chan, Man-Him', 'Mak, Kei-Choi', 'Chan, Wai-Tin', 'He, Miao']","['Xie WC', 'Chan MH', 'Mak KC', 'Chan WT', 'He M']","['Bioinformatics, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,,2012/10/27 06:00,2013/04/20 06:00,['2012/10/27 06:00'],"['2012/10/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/04/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2012.13.8.3911 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2012;13(8):3911-6. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2012.13.8.3911.,,IM,,"['Age Factors', 'Female', 'Hong Kong/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Mortality/*trends', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Registries', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
